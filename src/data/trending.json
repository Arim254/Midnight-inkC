    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England head coach Thomas Tuchel caused a stir by leaving Jude Bellingham out of his last squadByChief football writer in RigaEngland confirmed qualification for next summer's World Cup with victory over Latvia, enabling head coach Thomas Tuchel to start finalising his plans as the countdown to the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico continues.Competition for places will be intense, with disappointment inevitable for some of those who have played a part in England's smooth qualifying campaign.The jockeying for positions will continue over the next months - so who are those players with something to prove to Tuchel as he considers England's squad to take to the World Cup?Jude BellinghamIt is inconceivable that Jude Bellingham will not be part of England's squad at the World Cup but does the Real Madrid star, who is arguably the biggest global name available to Tuchel, still have something to prove to the head coach?The recent evidence on and off the pitch suggests he does.It all stems from Bellingham being left out of England's latest squad despite telling Tuchel he wanted to be included, to the constant narrative of team spirit and the excellence of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers in the number 10 role.England's next squad for what are effectively dead rubbers against Serbia and Albania will now have one main point of interest, namely whether Bellingham is included.If he is, Bellingham will return to duty having been made acutely aware by Tuchel that there is no star system, no special cases, no automatic route back into England's team.And it will also come after it has been made crystal clear that Tuchel's England world does not revolved around Bellingham and how best to utilise his undoubted talent.Bellingham is not exactly starting again with England - the odds will still be on him being in the line-up their first game in next summer's World Cup - but he has to prove to Tuchel that he can be part of the team spirit the German cherishes, and that he deserves his place back in the side.The England star famously mouthed \"who else?\" when scoring a spectacular stoppage-time overhead kick when England beat Slovakia in the last 16 at Euro 2024, but he now knows there are others Tuchel is willing to consider.Cole PalmerCole Palmer's England career has, so far, been a mixed bag ranging from the moment of brilliance that gave England hope with the equaliser against Spain in what was eventually a losing cause in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin, to other occasions when he has left even supporters of his superb talent wanting more.Palmer's current problem is a lingering groin injury. Further down the line it will be the Chelsea star performing in consistently eye-catching fashion that might persuade Tuchel to find a place for the 23-year-old in what is already a crowded area.Tuchel is unlikely to start fitting square pegs in round holes so close to a major tournament - therefore Palmer, who has only played 64 minutes under the German, has work to do.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cole Palmer celebrates scoring for England in the Euro 2024 final against Spain in BerlinHe is unlikely to get in as the 10, with Rogers currently in possession and Bellingham waiting in the wings.It is hard to see a place on the flanks, where he is less effective, with Anthony Gordon and Marcus Rashford contenders on the left and Arsenal pair Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke fighting for a place on the right.This effectively means Palmer will have to produce a spectacular run of form to force his way back into Tuchel's thinking.Phil FodenManchester City's brilliant 25-year-old was, along with Bellingham, a stand-out exclusion from Tuchel's squad for the friendly against Wales and the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga.Foden, who has won two caps under Tuchel, has been rebuilding form and confidence with an excellent start to the season after a poor campaign last term.And he will do all this with his sights set on the World Cup.He was a permanent fixture in Sir Gareth Southgate's plans up to Euro 2024, but getting Foden and Bellingham in the same team was often a struggle and never felt like a neat fit at the time, with the former often out on the left rather than his preferred central role.No-one, least of all Tuchel, can ignore Foden's talent but he must continue to impress to reclaim what was once an automatic place in England's squad.Like Palmer, Foden operates in what is now a congested place under Tuchel, whether it is in the centre or pushed out wide.Never rule a player of Foden's quality out, but he has a fight on his hands to make England's World Cup squad.Trent Alexander-ArnoldThis ship may have already sailed.Trent Alexander-Arnold's World Cup hopes were already in deep trouble even before he sustained the hamstring injury that has interrupted the start to his Real Madrid career.If Alexander-Arnold has been looking for signs of a bright England future under Tuchel, then not many of them are promising.He played former Liverpool team-mate Curtis Jones, a midfield player, ahead of him at right-back in the 1-0 win away to Andorra then dropped Alexander-Arnold completely for the return World Cup qualifiers with Andorra and visit to Serbia.This came after Tuchel appeared to publicly cast doubt on Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities when he spoke about his influence at Liverpool, saying: \"If he wants to have this impact in the English national team, then he has to take the defensive part very, very seriously.\"Tuchel is also a big admirer of another right-back, Reece James, who played under him at Chelsea, although he has had injury problems of his own.Alexander-Arnold may have to make other plans for the summer unless his form for Real can force a change of heart from Tuchel.Jack GrealishJack Grealish has been a player and personality reborn since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City, but Tuchel saw fit to ignore the clamour for an England recall when he selected his latest squad.Tuchel is a confirmed Grealish fan but, at present, it is hard to see where the midfielder would fit into England's plans, and who would make way to accommodate him.Grealish can join names like Palmer and Foden, who both face a fight to win places either as the 10 or on the flank.This is not to denigrate Grealish's form, which has already made him a hero with Everton's fans, but a brutal reality.Tuchel may also want to see Grealish produce consistently over 20 Premier League games rather than the seven so far. This is the task facing the popular 30-year-old if he is to put himself back in World Cup contention.Adam WhartonAdam Wharton has been outstanding for Crystal Palace for a long time now, running games against elite opponents, especially Manchester City when the Eagles won the FA Cup at Wembley last season, and in the win against Premier League champions Liverpool recently.Wharton's loping, languid style may sometimes disguise a classy, fiercely competitive midfielder, but his England breakthrough has not arrived, despite going to Germany as part of Southgate's Euro 2024 squad.He is yet to get his first minutes under Tuchel and was another surprise omission.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Adam Wharton during his only England appearance - 28 minutes as a substitute against Bosnia & Herzegovina in June 2024 under Sir Gareth SouthgateWharton's only England cap came under Southgate against Bosnia & Herzegovina in June 2024, when he made a 28-minute appearance as a substitute.Like others, he is still waiting for his chance to make his mark as Nottingham Forest's Elliott Anderson has taken the opportunity handed to him by Tuchel with excellent performances, looking right at home on the international stage.Tuchel has made all the right noises, even down to contacting Wharton to re-assure him he is in his thoughts.Wharton, however, has still not made Tuchel's squad so he is another who must continue to press his case to finally get some action under England's head coach.Marcus RashfordBarcelona is the latest stop on Marcus Rashford's road to redemption after being exiled by Manchester United - but he still has a way to travel to re-establish himself as a permanent fixture in England's squad.If the 27-year-old needed any reminding that he still has to prove himself to be fixed firmly in Tuchel's World Cup plans, he only needed to listen to the head coach's words before the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga.Tuchel said: \"It's not a question of talent. It's a question of whether he can prove the point at club and international level.\"It never has been a question of Rashford's talent, it is the times when he has lost his way after producing stunning performances in spells that raise doubts.He has to produce consistency at Barcelona then, as Tuchel suggests, \"prove the point\" with England as well.Rashford knows Tuchel has faith in his ability - he is selecting him for starters - but the warning is clear. He cannot afford to slip, or fail to prove his point, otherwise others are ready and waiting to take his place.Myles Lewis-SkellyWhen Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly scored the first goal of the Tuchel era against Albania in March, becoming the youngest player to score on his senior England debut, aged 18 years and 176 days, he not only looked like a superstar in the making but the answer to the problem left-back position.He may well still be, starting England's victory in Latvia, but has a potentially major problem ahead that Tuchel has already made reference to.And it is a problem that comes in the imposing shape of Riccardo Calafiori.England apart, Lewis-Skelly has been ousted from Arsenal's left-back slot by the Italian this season, starting only two games for the Gunners and playing only 263 minutes.This is not a question of Lewis-Skelly's quality - that is there for all to see. This is a question of how much football he will play.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly scored the first goal of the Thomas Tuchel era when he made his debut against Albania in March.It is a subject that has already been exercising Tuchel's mind, even though he played Lewis-Skelly in Riga.It is clear that unless he can find his way back into Arsenal's starting line-up, Tuchel may face a difficult choice with the gifted youngster, saying: \"Maybe it becomes a problem for him, yeah.\"Being a good team-mate in camp may not be good enough to stay the whole year with us. You have to perform at club level on a regular basis.\"Lewis-Skelly's task is clear. He may yet claim the left-back berth if Tuchel is unable to find a better alternative but he cannot rely on past credit. He has to find a way into Arsenal's starting line-up.Jordan HendersonJordan Henderson has a huge admirer in Tuchel. He was an instant inclusion for his first squad in March, winning a recall after being absent from England duty since November 2023.It was a pick that raised eyebrows but Tuchel was unmoved, continuing to keep faith with Brentford's veteran midfielder, even to the exclusion of Palace's Wharton, saying: \"He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"No-one could ever question the desire and attitude of one of the game's most consummate professionals, but Henderson will be 36 during next summer's World Cup, which will be played in gruelling conditions in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Tuchel has praised Henderson's influence around camp, and his impact can already be seen at Brentford, but he will need to be seen as someone who will figure on the pitch as well. There is no room for non-playing figureheads at a major tournament.Plenty question Tuchel's wisdom on this decision. It remains to be seen how much longer he will include Henderson, so the former Liverpool captain must produce high-class performances with Brentford consistently to stop eyebrows being raised further.Morgan Gibbs-WhiteMorgan Gibbs-White is a real talent and the Nottingham Forest player has won four caps under Tuchel, who is clearly an admirer of his quality.The problem for Gibbs-White may come with competition for places in the areas he likes, especially with Bellingham, Palmer and Foden not currently in England's squad and Aston Villa's Rogers producing excellence.This is no slight on Gibbs-White, who has been outstanding at Forest. Tottenham Hotspur thought they had signed him in a £60m deal during the transfer window but were left desperately disappointed when Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis persuaded him to stay by offering an improved contract.It is simply that, when the final numbers take shape, Gibbs-White could be in an area where there are just too many names to fit into a limited pot.Gibbs-White has the ability to be in that shake-up, although he may hope for some stability at the City Ground, where new manager Ange Postecoglou is already under pressure after the sacking of Nuno Espirito Santo, who got Forest into Europe and also got the best out of the 25-year-old.Who else must make a good impression?The understudy to England captain Harry Kane is always a thorny issue with options seemingly limited beyond Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.Spurs striker Dominic Solanke and Chelsea's Liam Delap will want to be in Thomas Tuchel's thoughts but both are currently troubled by injuries.Arsenal's Eberechi Eze operates in an area of the pitch where England competition is red-hot, but he offers variety and versatility, so that may well bolster his claims when the time comes for Tuchel to name his squad.The same may just apply to Newcastle United's Dan Burn with limited choices in central defence and left-back, but he will need to maintain good form and there are still questions about his quality at international level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, James Trafford hoped to be Manchester City's first choice keeper when he moved from Burnley - but was then replaced by Gianluigi DonnarummaEverton's Jordan Pickford is unchallenged as goalkeeper with Crystal Palace's Dean Henderson as his understudy - but what does the future hold for James Trafford?He is currently third choice but had hoped to challenge Pickford for top spot after he moved from Burnley to Manchester City.This plan unravelled somewhat when City bought world-class Italian Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris St-Germain, Trafford losing his place immediately.City manager Pep Guardiola has insisted Trafford will get game time - but will it be enough to make Tuchel feel comfortable about his match sharpness?Arsenal's Declan Rice believes England have the all-round quality to cope with any squad issues, saying: \"I think every time you play for England you want to grab the shirt, you want to grab your chance. \"We do miss Jude for sure, we miss Phil, we miss Cole, we miss loads of players that have not been turning up for reasons the manager has said. \"We are an unreal team when they are in the team as well. What they have done for England in an England shirt is nothing short of incredible. \"We are looking forward to having them next camp hopefully, as a team we want to keep integrating as many people as possible before the World Cup.\"",

    "body": "\"Big John\" Fisher, a British social media star known for his viral fast food reviews, has been detained in Australia over a visa issue.Famous for his love of Chinese takeaway and signature catchphrase \"bosh\", Fisher arrived in Western Australia on Tuesday ahead of a tour of the country.However, in social media posts, he said he would have to cancel his scheduled appearances in Perth and Sydney as he would be deported to London.Fisher said he was questioned by border officials for four hours, and though his visa was \"legit\", Australian authorities \"weren't happy\" that he was going to be working during his visit. It is understood that Fisher entered Australia on an incorrect visa.A spokesperson for the Australian Border Force said it could not comment on individual cases, due to privacy issues.\"Will explain more when I get home but absolutely gutted,\" he said. \"Sorry, Perth, sorry, Sydney.\"In a post on Wednesday morning local time, Fisher complained about his treatment by authorities and said he was spending his 52nd birthday in a detention hotel waiting to be deported.\"I'm still smiling and I still love Australia,\" he wrote before signing off with his famed slogan \"bosh\" - a British slang word often used as an enthusiastic exclamation.In another Instagram story, Fisher wrote that many people had offered to drop food off for him at the hotel, but he was not allowed to receive it.\"Thank you for the gesture but if you have got me food please take to a food bank -Bosh,\" he wrote.Fisher's son - British heavyweight boxer Johnny Fisher - confirmed on Instagram that his father would be flown home.\"Rumour has it they are frightened of his express pace bowling ahead of the Ashes,\" he said.Fisher, who has previously visited Australia to meet fans, was due to appear at four events in the country this week. His schedule included hosting a \"Bucking Bull\" challenge at a greyhound race in Sydney and doing a DJ set at a horse racing meet in Perth.With almost 700,000 followers on Instagram and another half a million on TikTok, Fisher often films himself eating meals and gives a short review that almost always finish with him saying \"bosh\".He was recently interviewed on BBC's Newsnight programme about a Chinese takeaway in York which was vandalised. He later visited the takeaway to show his support and posted a review of its food. ",

And that means making actual significant improvements, not more empty promises.\"Ofcom's investigation found the company \"breached its obligations by failing to provide an acceptable level of service without justification\".It said the actions taken by Royal Mail to try and reach its targets were \"insufficient and ineffective\".The fine, Ofcom said, reflected the \"harm suffered by customers\" as a result of Royal Mail's poor service.Second-class scrapped on SaturdaysUnder the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK.Since July, some areas only receive second-class letters every other weekday and not on Saturday, a change proposed by Ofcom earlier this year.Responding to Ofcom, a Royal Mail spokesperson said: \"We acknowledge the decision made by Ofcom today and we will continue to work hard to deliver further sustained improvements to our quality of service.\"The spokesperson said that the reduction of second-class deliveries in some areas enabled the company to \"drive a step change in quality of service\".Royal Mail has also made changes in recruitment and training and has provided more support in delivery offices, the spokesperson added.The fine will be paid to the Treasury.More on this story",

    "body": "Former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga has died at the age of 80, family sources have told the BBC.Odinga died on Wednesday while receiving medical treatment at a hospital in India. In recent weeks, there has been speculation about his health, although family members and political allies had dismissed reports suggesting he was critically ill. Politicians and other leaders, including Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, have been sending their condolences.A political mobiliser and towering figure in Kenyan politics, Odinga ran unsuccessfully for the presidency five times. He rejected the results on each occasion, often saying that victory had been stolen from him.He was vindicated by Kenya's highest court after the 2017 elections, when it annulled Uhuru Kenyatta's victory and ordered fresh polls. However, he boycotted the rerun, demanding electoral reforms.The disputed election of 2007, in which Odinga claimed he was cheated of victory by Mwai Kibaki, led to the biggest crisis in Kenya's history.Violence erupted around the country, resulting in 1,200 deaths and about 600,000  people were forced to flee their homes.To resolve the crisis, a power-sharing agreement was brokered by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, leading to the formation of a unity government in which Odinga became prime minister.He has often reconciled with the incumbent president after contentious elections.After his most recent defeat in 2022, he later joined President William Ruto in a so-called broad-based government, which brought several of his allies into key positions.He defended the move as necessary for national unity, coming in the aftermath of watershed nationwide protests last year that culminated in the storming of parliament. Dozens of protesters were killed in confrontations with security officers.The Ruto administration backed Odinga's bid to become chairperson of the African Union Commission, in elections held earlier this year. Despite strong regional support, he lost to Djibouti's Mahmoud Ali Youssouf.Odinga inspired a passionate and loyal following throughout his political career, especially in western Kenya, where he was from.His supporters called him \"Baba\" (Father), \"Agwambo\" (Act of God), and \"Tinga\" (Tractor) - drawn from his party's symbol during the 1997 elections.He was widely regarded as a master strategist and mass mobiliser, often drawing huge crowds to his political rallies, and he had a deep ability to connect with ordinary people.He will be remembered for his unwavering fight for democratic freedoms and human rights.He was a former political prisoner, and holds the record for being Kenya's longest-serving detainee. His struggle against one-party dictatorship saw him detained twice (from 1982 to 1988 and 1989 to 1991) during the rule of Daniel arap Moi.He was initially imprisoned for trying to stage a coup in 1982, which propelled him on to the national stage.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSayeda AkterBBC Bangla, Dhaka andKelly NgSingaporeAt least 16 people have died after a huge fire broke out at a garment factory in Bangladesh, with officials warning that the toll could rise.Sixteen bodies have been recovered and would be handed to families after DNA testing, as they have been burnt beyond recognition, the fire service said.Distraught relatives gathered outside the four-storey factory in Dhaka's Mirpur area on Tuesday in search of their loved ones still missing.The blaze, which broke out at the factory around midday, was extinguished after three hours. But an adjacent chemical warehouse continued to burn, authorities said.Large fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, often due to lax safety standards and poor infrastructure. Hundreds of people have been killed in fires in recent years.Up until 21:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the fire at the chemical warehouse in Mirpur had not been completely doused, media reports said.Fire service officials have not ascertained which of the two buildings caught fire first. According to eyewitnesses, the chemical warehouse stored bleaching powder, plastic and hydrogen peroxide, all of which can intensify fires. Plastic also releases toxic fumes when burned.Most of the deaths were caused by toxic gas and the building's roof door being locked, the fire service said.Fire service director Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury told local media the victims probably died \"instantly\" after inhaling \"highly toxic gas\". Police and military officers are still trying to locate the owners of the factory and the warehouse, Mr Chowdhury told reporters.An investigation into whether the warehouse was operating legally was also ongoing, he added.The fire service said that the chemical warehouse had no fire safety clearance or licence from their department. Meanwhile, officials in northern Dhaka had confirmed that the warehouse had no occupancy certificate or licence to operate, local media reported.Tearful family members stood outside the charred buildings, many of them clutching photographs of their missing relatives. Among them is a man searching desperately for his daughter, Farzana Akhter. \"When I heard about the fire, I came running. But I still haven't found her... I just want my daughter back,\" he told Reuters news agency.Bangladesh has a long history of deadly industrial disasters. In 2021, a fire at a food and drink factory left at least 52 people dead and another 20 injured. The factory was built illegally and had no emergency exit, an investigation later found.In 2019, a fast-moving fire swept through a historic district in Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, including members of a bridal party.The country's deadliest industrial accident to date took place in 2013, when the eight-storey Rana Plaza building housing garment factories near Dhaka collapsed owing to a structural failure, killing more than 1,100 people.",

    "body": "Stars pay tribute to D’Angelo, after his death at 5114 hours agoAna Faguy andMark SavageMusic correspondentFrans Schellekens/RedfernsAward-winning R&B and soul singer D’Angelo has died aged 51 after a cancer diagnosis, his family has announced. In a statement, they wrote that the star, whose real name was Michael Eugene Archer, left behind a \"legacy of extraordinarily moving music\" and asked fans to celebrate “the gift of song that he has left for the world”.The influential singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz. His three albums won D'Angelo four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D'Angelo appeared to be performing naked.\"The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,\" his family said in a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC’s US media partner.Tributes have flooded in, with fellow musicians Beyoncé, Nile Rogers and Lauryn Hill among those paying their respects.'Transformed R&B forever'Singer Beyoncé thanked D’Angelo for his music on her website. \"You were the pioneer of neo-soul, and that changed and transformed rhythm and blues forever,\" she wrote. \"We will never forget you.\"Writing about his first meeting with D'Angelo, guitarist and producer Rogers recalled having encouraged the late star - who was then on the way up - to put out his material as it was \"perfect\".\"About a year later I heard one of those songs on the radio. It was genius and it was exactly what he had played for me,\" wrote Rogers. \"I know... I still have the original cassette.\"Singer and rapper Hill shared a similarly lengthy and personal reflection on the life and work of D'Angelo, saying his \"beauty and talent were not of this world\".\"You imaged a unity of strength and sensitivity in Black manhood to a generation that only saw itself as having to be one or the other,\" she wrote.Fellow rappers Doja Cat and Missy Elliot also paid their respects, as well as singers Jill Scott and Jennifer Hudson.\"A true voice of soul and inspiration to many brilliant artists of our generation and generations to come,\" Doja Cat wrote on X. \"Rest Peacefully D'Angelo,\" posted Elliot, who was becoming one of hip-hop's biggest around the same time as the soul singer's rise int he late 1990s.Scott posted: \"I never met D'Angelo but I love him, respect him, admire his gift.\"Hudson noted how \"we lost a true original today\". \"D'Angelo, your voice will live on forever. Rest well, King!!!\"Tyler the Creator said his \"musical DNA\" was shaped by D'Angelo - \"We are so lucky to have been alive to enjoy his art,\" he wrote.ReutersThe award-winning singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazzD’Angelo began his career as a songwriter, and worked alongside big names in music like Lauryn Hill and The Roots. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar. His song, Lady, from that album reached the number 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 1996. That song earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot on the music scene.The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano when he was just three years old.Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.).When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI.He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo.However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died in a car crash in 2005. He returned to music in 2014 with Black Messiah - an album in the works for years - which he finished after watching the national unrest prompted by protests over the failure to convict police officers in the deaths of the unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner.Getty ImagesD'Angelo's song Lady earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot in the music sceneIt went on to win the Grammy for best R&B album in February 2016.Among those paying tribute was hip-hop legend DJ Premier, who produced D'Angelo's song Devil's Pie.\"Such a sad loss,\" he wrote on social media. \"We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING.\"The Voodoo album which was released in 2000 topped the US charts and in its most recent list of the greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at 28 – one place above The Beatles' White Album.D'Angelo had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq.",

    "body": "Some migrants coming to the UK will need to speak English to an A-level standard under tougher new rules set to be introduced by the government.The changes, which will come into force from 8 January 2026, will affect some graduates and those applying for skilled worker or scale-up visas, which are for people employed by fast-growing businesses.The new rules  form part of wider plans to cut levels of immigration to the UK outlined in a white paper in May.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"If you come to this country, you must learn our language and play your part.\"\"This country has always welcomed those who come to this country and contribute,\" Mahmood said. \"But it is unacceptable for migrants to come here without learning our language, unable to contribute to our national life.\"Applicants will be tested in person on their speaking, listening, reading and writing at Home Office-approved providers, with their results checked as part of the visa process.Those applying for skilled worker, scale-up and high potential individual (HPI) visas will be required to reach B2 level - a step up from the current B1 standard which is equivalent to GCSE.To come to the UK on the skilled worker visa, migrants have to work for a government-approved employer and earn at least £41,700 a year, or the \"going rate\" for their type of work, whichever is highest.The scale-up visa is open to migrants coming to work for a fast-growing UK business. Migrants can apply for a high potential individual visa if they have been awarded a qualification from a top global university within the last five years.According to the British Council, which offers English language courses, learners who achieve B2 level can \"understand the main ideas of complex texts on concrete or abstract topics.\"They can express themselves \"fluently and spontaneously\" and communicate comfortably with other English speakers. They can also produce \"clear, detailed text on many subjects and explain a complex viewpoint\".Further English language requirements for other visa routes and family dependants are expected to be introduced in due course, Home Office Minister Mike Tapp told Parliament on Tuesday.The prime minister previously said the changes outlined in the white paper would make the UK's immigration system \"controlled, selective and fair\".Home Office estimates suggest the measures could reduce the number of people coming to the UK by up to 100,000 per year.Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - fell to 431,000 in 2024, down almost 50% on the total in 2023, when it reached a record high of 906,000. Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the government faced a \"trade-off\" between \"ensuring migrants speak good English and enabling employers to recruit workers who are expected to bring economic benefits.\"Many graduate jobs already require language skills above A-level standard, she said.The new language requirements will have \"more impact in middle-skilled jobs involving technical and manual skills, where employers sometimes do not require high language proficiency\".Immigration lawyer Afsana Akhtar told BBC News she thought it was \"unfair\" that migrants had to reach such a high standard of English \"because even many people in the UK probably wouldn't be able to pass English A-level\". \"This would rule out even skilled workers who want to come and contribute to our British economy,\" she said. \"The GCSE standard is sufficient - and then when they come live here, [and] integrate into England and the English way of life, their English will improve inevitably.\"Other measures in the white paper include cutting the time period international students can stay in the UK to find a graduate job after their course ends from two years to 18 months, which will take effect from January 2027.Students will also have to meet higher financial requirements, raised to £1,171 per month outside London (from £1,136) for up to nine months.The Global Talent visa, for high achievers in technology, arts and academia fields has also been expanded to include winners of more prestigious prizes. Further plans in the White Paper include, the immigration skills charge for UK employers to pay when sponsoring foreign workers on specific visas has also been  increased to £480 per person per year for small organisations or charities, and to £1,320 for medium and large organisations.This is raised from £364 and £1,000 respectively.As part of the government's efforts to attract highly skilled people to the country, the HPI route will be expanded. The number of migrants on the visa is expected to double from 2,000 to 4,000, but there will be a cap of 8,000 applications each year.",

    "body": "5 hours agoThe \"shattered remains\" of Khan Younis have been pictured on the front page of the Guardian, which writes that the \"fragile ceasefire\" in Gaza has already been tested. The paper reports four dead hostages have been returned to Israel, but says Hamas has previously claimed it may take longer to return the rest of the bodies as \"not all burial sites have been identified\". Israel has said aid into Gaza will be cut by half and a key border crossing will remain closed, the paper adds.The UK state pension is set to climb 4.8%, the i Paper reports, with pensioners now set to receive £12,547.60 annually. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that UK inflation will remain \"higher than any other large rich country\", the paper notes. But it adds the IMF's \"modest\" growth rate forecast will offer a \"slight boost\" to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her Budget next month.The Express offers a different interpretation on the IMF's forecasting, declaring it a \"bleak verdict\" on the UK economy and \"fresh humiliation\" for the chancellor.The Daily Mail zeros in on official figures which it says show unemployment in the UK is at a four-year high, and wage growth has slowed.  It also refers to the IMF predictions, and says the \"darkening outlook\" has prompted a Bank of England official to warn of a \"growing risk of recession\".The Telegraph leads with the Home Secretary's upcoming speech at a summit with Balkan interior ministers, where she is expected to warn that a failure to control UK migration is \"eroding trust\" in politicians. According to the paper, Shabana Mahmood will tell leaders that \"international co-operation\" is the only way to secure borders. \"Hamas kills its enemies on ceasefire Gaza streets\" reads the headline of the Times, detailing the alleged executions in Gaza of \"suspected collaborators\" following the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The front page also features a photograph of the Princess of Wales beaming as she bakes at Long Meadow Farm, captioned \"On a roll\".The Financial Times leads with comments from US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, after he told the paper that China is \"trying to hurt the world's economy\" following the introduction of export controls on rare earths and critical minerals. A member of Madagascar's military is also pictured, amid reports that the army has seized power in the African nation and President Andry Rajoelina has fled.\"Illegal migrant madness\" says the Sun, alleging that art classes and puzzle rooms in immigrant removal centres are funded by the taxpayer. The Home Office has said they are reviewing the provision of activities in immigration centres to \"ensure they deliver value for taxpayers\".The Mirror leads with comments from former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who told the Covid inquiry that the 2021 phased return to school was \"destined to fail\" and \"damaging for children and parents\".\"Gavin and numpty\" reads the headline of the Star, reporting that Williamson also told the inquiry that the decision to shut schools during the pandemic was made in just 24 hours.Daily Mail's assessment of the latest figures on the economy, which showed the number of jobless hitting a four-year high, as the International Monetary Fund predicted the UK would have the highest inflation in the G7. The Daily Express says the figures are fresh humiliation for the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The i Paper says the triple lock will help to buffer older people from inflation, with the state pension set to climb by 4.8%.The Daily Telegraph says Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will tell a summit of Balkan interior ministers in London that the UK has lost control of its borders - and that this failure is eroding trust in political leaders and the credibility of the state. The Times reports on a different concern of the Home Secretary. It says she took a \"dim view\" of a warning from the Council of Europe that the government's policies on trans rights and banning Palestine Action could breach the European Convention on Human Rights. A source tells the paper that the intervention plays into the hands of Reform UK and the Conservatives, which both want to leave the Convention.The Guardian says the fragile ceasefire in Gaza has faced its first test - with Israel halving the aid allowed into the territory, accusing Hamas of withholding the bodies of its hostages. The Times says Hamas has been killing its enemies on the streets of Gaza, as it attempts to regain control. The Telegraph says for Hamas, \"peace\" has started with mass executions.The Daily Mirror considers evidence from the former Education Secretary Sir Gavin Williamson to the Covid Inquiry. \"At last they admit it,\" it says - \"Boris DID harm our kids.\" The Daily Star says Sir Gavin admitted that the plan to shut schools was decided in just 24 hours.The Times says a new book claims that Lady Margaret Thatcher had two extramarital affairs. It says the book - The Incidental Feminist - says the former prime minister had a relationship with the PR executive Tim Bell - and the Conservative MP Sir Humphrey Atkins. The Express quotes an unnamed politician as saying: \"The joke about Atkins was that for someone who was not very good, he kept getting promoted. Now why was that?\"Related Internet Links",

She and her partner ended up taking out a loan to pay for the procedure, and used money they had been saving for their wedding.\"We didn't have the money. But it took us five minutes to decide that we would find it from somewhere,\" Ms Hawley said.Hundreds of pet owners contacted Your Voice, Your BBC News, with concerns over vet bills.Vets and animal charities told the BBC in June pet owners are increasingly having their sick animals put down or they are delaying taking them for treatment to avoid spiralling vet bills.Many veterinary surgeons and nurses said treatment prices have been pushed up after big corporations have bought up practices.Kept in the darkSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the CMA's Martin Coleman said veterinary prices had increased by 63% over a seven year period, which was nearly twice the rate of inflation.\"Many people were paying twice what they needed to for vet medicines,\" Mr Coleman said. \"It's not right to keep pet owners in the dark about key matters that affect them and their pets and their pockets.\"We're often not being told up-front basic information such as who owns the practice, the price of commonly used services, and we're not often given estimates of the likely price of treatment costing hundreds, even thousands of pounds.\"The CMA also found practices owned by large vet groups charge 16.6% more on average than independent vets.Mr Coleman said the regulatory system was set up in 1966, \"when the world of veterinary services was very different to the world that we have today.\"\"There is regulation of individual vets, but there is no regulation of the businesses that own the majority of the practices in the country,\" Mr Coleman said.Wednesday's findings into the £6.3bn sector are provisional, with interested parties now having until next month to make submissions before a final decision is published next year. After the decision, changes will be implemented through a legally binding CMA order, which is expected to come before the end of 2026. Smaller vet businesses given additional time to implement it.The CMA's recommendations include:Making it easier for pet owners to access cheaper medicines online, including by requiring vets to tell pet owners about savings they make by buying medicines onlineWhere a medicine is likely to be needed frequently, automatically providing a written prescription to enable the pet owner to purchase the medicine elsewhereCapping the price of providing prescriptions at £16Requiring vets to give pet owners clear price information when they are choosing a treatment, with prices in writing for treatments over £500 and itemised billsMaking the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to improve its 'Find a Vet' website to include pricing dataMaking vets give clear price information to pet owners arranging a cremation and pet care plans",

    "body": "9 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent andLiv McMahonBBC Technology JournalistOpenAI plans to allow a wider range of content, including erotica, on its popular chatbot ChatGPT as part of its push to \"treat adult users like adults\",  says its boss Sam Altman.In a post on X on Tuesday, Mr Altman said upcoming versions of the popular chatbot would enable it to behave in a more human-like way  - \"but only if you want it, not because we are usage maxxing\".The move, reminiscent of Elon Musk's xAI recent introduction of two sexually explicit chatbots to Grok, could help OpenAI attract more paying subscribers.It is also likely to intensify pressure on lawmakers to introduce tighter restrictions on chatbot companions.OpenAI did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment following Mr Altman's post.Changes announced by the company come after it was sued earlier this year by parents of a US teen who took his own life.The lawsuit filed by Matt and Maria Raine, who are the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.The Californian couple criticised the company's parental controls - which it said were designed to promote healthier use of its chatbot - saying they did not go far enough.The family included chat logs between Adam, who died in April, and ChatGPT that show him explaining he has suicidal thoughts.Altman said that OpenAI previously made ChatGPT \"pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues\".\"We realise this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,\" Mr Altman said.He said the company has now been able to mitigate the serious mental health risks and have new tools allowing it to \"safely relax the restrictions in most cases\".\"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,\" he said.Critics say OpenAI's decision to allow erotica on the platform shows the need for more regulation at the federal and state levels.\"How are they going to make sure that children are not able to access the portions of ChatGPT that are adult-only and provide erotica?\" said Jenny Kim, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. \"Open AI, like most of big tech in this space, is just using people like guinea pigs.\"Ms Kim is involved in a lawsuit against Meta that claims the company's Instagram's algorithm harms the mental health of teen users.\"We don't even know if their age gating is going to work,\"  she said. In April, TechCrunch reported that OpenAI was allowing accounts in which a user had registered as a minor to generate graphic erotica.OpenAI said at the time that the company was rolling out a fix to limit such content.A survey published this month by the nonprofit Centre for Democracy and Technology (CDT) found that one in five students report that they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with AI.On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill passed by the state legislature that would have blocked developers from offering AI chatbots companions to children unless the companies could guarantee the software wouldn't breed harmful behaviour.Newsom said it was \"imperative that adolescents learn how to safely interact with AI systems\" in a message that accompanied his veto.At the nationwide level, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an inquiry into how AI chatbots interact with children.In the US Senate last month, bipartisan legislation was introduced that would classify AI chatbots as products. The law would allow users to file liability claims against chatbot developers.Mr Altman's announcement on Tuesday comes as sceptics have been questioning the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies.OpenAI's revenue is growing, but it has never been profitable.Tulane University business professor Rob Lalka, who authored the recent book The Venture Alchemists, said the major AI companies find themselves in a battle for market share.\"No company has ever had the kind of adoption that OpenAI saw with ChatGPT,\" Lalka told the BBC. \"They needed to continue to push along that exponential growth curve, achieving market domination as much as they can.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoPhanindra DahalBBC Nepali in KathmanduDhan Bahadur ChaudharyDhan Bahadur (left) and Bipin, seen here in their bachelor level college year at Far Western University in NepalBipin Joshi threw back a grenade from Hamas attackers before being taken hostage in the assault on Israel two years ago, says the fellow Nepalese student he saved.\"I may not have survived if both grenades had exploded. Bipin showed courage and threw the grenade out,\" Dhan Bahadur Chaudhary told BBC Nepali.He was speaking after the Israeli military identified his friend's body as being among  the first four dead hostages returned by Hamas under the Gaza ceasefire accord.Bipin was 23 and working on a kibbutz when he was taken by Hamas into captivity along with 250 others on 7 October 2023. It's unclear how or when he died.His family and friends hoped right up to the release deadline that he might be among living hostages returned on 13 October, but he wasn't, and a day later their worst fears were confirmed.Bipin, Dhan Bahadur and 15 other Nepalese agriculture students had been in Israel for just over three weeks when Kibbutz Alumim was attacked.\"We knew that there may be a war in Israel. But we had no idea that there may be any ground attack of that magnitude,\" Dhan Bahadur said. \"We thought that there could be missile attacks and we would be safe if we stay underground, in the bunkers.\"For the students who'd been invited under the Israeli government's \"Earn and Learn Programme\" it was a great opportunity to make better lives for themselves and their families in Nepal.Dhan Bahadur credits his survival to Bipin's courage.\"At the time of attack, two grenades were thrown near the bunkers. He [Bipin] picked up one and threw it outside; one exploded inside. Due to that explosion, I and four others were injured,\" he says.\"He was unharmed at that point. If both grenades had exploded, I would not have been speaking with you like this.\"Ten of the Nepalese students were killed in the attack. Bipin was the only one captured.\"We met for the last time when he and others were being shifted to another bunker,\" Dhan Bahadur says. \"Because, after the injury, I could not move and I stayed in the first bunker. I later came to know that there were two attacks in the bunker where he took shelter and he was held captive from there.\"Courtesy Dhan Bahadur ChaudharyMany of the students can be seen in this selfie inside the bunker 30 minutes before the attack, taken by one of those killedHamas returns four more bodies of hostages, Israeli military saysIsraeli hostages and Palestinian detainees freed as Trump hails 'historic dawn' in Middle East'You're my life, my hero': Hostages reunite with families after two yearsPalestinians celebrate return of detainees freed by IsraelThe 27-year-old says he feels deeply saddened after hearing about his colleague's death. He and Bipin studied together in Far Western University School of Agriculture in Tikapur, Nepal.\"We made all possible efforts from our sides to secure his release. We did everything. But yesterday, we had to face such shocking news. All of Nepal is in grief. I do not know what to say. I have no words to explain my sorrow.\"Dhan Bahadur says Bipin and other colleagues had the same goal of making little savings and starting their own enterprise after returning from the exchange programme in Israel.\"He loved playing football and basketball. We would chat for hours about our goals and dreams. He wanted to get his body in good shape and to buy a new mobile phone. We even recorded a song about friendship with my phone. He also talked about showcasing himself in a music video.\"Dhan Bahadur ChaudharyBipin and Dhan Bahadur with Israeli friends, in a final selfie at the Kibbutz Alumim basketball court On 14 October, the Israeli military said it believed Bipin Joshi was \"murdered in captivity during the first months of the war\". There's no way of independently confirming that.But if it's the case, Dhan Bahadur said, the international community should ask Hamas about why it happened.He said he had not received any support from Nepal's government following his injury but hoped the Israeli government would help Bipin's family.Bipin's immediate family members have not released any statement so far.Footage from 7 October showed him walking inside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. His family received no signs of life for a year, until the Israeli military shared a video of him in captivity around November 2023.Relatives described the footage as \"proof of life\" just hours before the ceasefire deal was agreed, and were hoping for a miracle.Now in his hometown of Bhimdutta municipality Bipin's family are grieving after hearing news of his death.Hostages and Missing Families ForumThe bodies of Bipin Joshi and fellow hostage Guy Illouz were handed over by Hamas in Gaza on MondayHis mother and sister had gone to the United States to lobby for the release of hostages, Bipin's cousin Kishore Joshi told BBC Nepali.He says the family has no words to describe the grief. \"His mother and sister are returning from US on Thursday. The father is not in the condition to express the pain in words.\"Meanwhile it's unclear when Bipin's body will be returned to his family.Israel is making all necessary arrangements to repatriate his remains to Nepal, as it did for the other students who died, Nepal's ministry of foreign affairs said.\"We are all shocked by the news of Bipin Joshi's death. In this time of sorrow [we] extend our deep sympathy to the grieving family,\" it said in a statement of condolence. \"Even after Bipin Joshi's body is brought back to Nepal, we will continue appropriate efforts in co-ordination and co-operation with the concerned government authorities and stakeholders - to uncover the truth about the actual cause and circumstances of his death.\"Dhan Bahadur says he and other colleagues who returned safely from Israel plan to visit Bipin's family in Kanchanpur district.\"We will keep his memories alive. We will provide our care, support and consolation to his family.\"He still feels numb.\"I returned to Nepal and I am studying at the moment. But Bipin's dreams remained unfulfilled.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC News, DelhiMuskan SharmaMuskan Sharma has dedicated her crown to her motherMuskan Sharma stood up to men who tried to bully her over her clothes - and went on to win hearts and a beauty pageant.The 23-year-old, who was crowned Miss Rishikesh 2025 last week in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, told the BBC that even though it was a small local pageant, \"it made me feel like Miss Universe\".Sharma's win has made headlines in India as it came after a viral video that showed her spiritedly arguing with a man who barged into their rehearsals just a day before the 4 October contest.Sharma, who \"wanted to be a model and participate in a pageant since I was in school\", said the intruders came in just as they broke for lunch. \"We were sitting around, chilling, having a laugh when they walked in,\" she said.The footage showed Raghavendra Bhatnagar, district head of a Hindu group called Rashtriya Hindu Shakti Sangathan, objecting to skirts and western dresses Sharma and other contestants were wearing.\"Modelling is over, go back home,\" Bhatnagar is heard telling them. \"This is against Uttarakhand's culture.\" Sharma refuses to back down. \"Why don't you shut the shops which sell them [Western clothes]?\"She then tells him that he should expend his energies on things that are worse than women's clothing - social evils such as drinking and smoking.\"There's a shop right outside that sells cigarettes and alcohol. Why don't you shut that down? First stop those things and I will stop wearing these clothes,\" she says.The man snaps at her saying \"don't tell me what to do\". Likewise, she retorts. \"If you have the right to choose, then so do we. Our opinion matters as much as yours,\" she says.As the argument continues, Sharma is joined by some of the other contestants and organisers and Bhatnagar and his group, who threatened to stop the show, are finally escorted out by the hotel manager.Muskan SharmaThe Miss Rishikesh contestants were heckled by men for their clothes during rehearsalsSharma says her reaction to Bhatnagar was \"spontaneous\". \"I could see my dreams shattering in front of me. The only question in my mind at the time was will the pageant go on? Will I be able to walk the ramp? Or will all my hard work go waste?\" she says. The next day, the event went on as planned and Sharma won the crown.\"For three seconds after I heard my name announced, I was shocked,\" she said.\"But then I was happy that I stood up for myself and that I won. It felt like a double victory. It was a small pageant in a small place but it made me feel like Miss Universe,\" she said.Sharma says heckling of women for their clothing is unheard of in Rishikesh, a city in the Himalayan foothills on the banks of Ganges river. It's known for its ashrams and meditation and yoga retreats and is considered a holy Hindu site that draws in large numbers of tourists and pilgrims.The city is also sought out by fans of Beatles because the Fab Four had spent weeks at an ashram there in 1968.\"You see tourists dressed in western clothing here all the time and no-one bats an eyelid,\" she adds.Globally, beauty pageants have been criticised for objectifying women and reinforcing gender stereotypes. But these contests have been hugely popular in India since 1994 - the year when Sushmita Sen won the Miss Universe crown and Aishwarya Rai brought home the Miss World trophy. Both went on to become top Bollywood actresses and have inspired generations of young women since then to follow in their path. Similar successes in later years of Priyanka Chopra, Diana Hayden and Lara Dutta have only reinforced the belief that beauty pageants can be a ticket to success, especially for young women in small-town India.Sharma says her parents have always been very supportive of her decision to participate in the pageant. In the viral video, she's even heard asking Bhatnagar: \"Who are you to comment on my clothing if my parents allow me to to wear them?\"Muskan SharmaThe pageant took place as plannedBut the backlash to Western clothing in India is not new where what women wear routinely becomes a subject of debates. In a deeply patriarchal society, many link western clothing, especially jeans, to the \"moral degradation\" of young people. Schools and colleges set dress codes for female students and sometimes village elders bar an entire community of girls from wearing jeans.The BBC has reported a number of cases where girls and women have been singled out and humiliated for their clothes.A few years ago, we wrote about a 19-year-old student in Assam who turned up in shorts to take an exam and was forced to wrap a curtain around her legs after the teacher objected. In one extreme case, a teenager was allegedly murdered by her relatives for wearing jeans. Namita Bhandare in her column in The Hindustan Times newspaper points out that there is no objection to the Mr Rishikesh contest where participants are barely dressed.The objection to Sharma and other contestants' clothing, she writes, is \"barely a fig-leaf\". \"The issue is not clothes. The issue is freedom and aspiration. How dare these young women be on a stage that could springboard them to a larger global platform? How dare they cross lines of honour and shame that a patriarchal society has imposed on them?\"Bhandare writes that in India where there are not enough women MPs or judges, the pushback by young women from a small town is remarkable.Sharma says it's her mother who taught her to stand up for what's right. \"The crown is as much my mother's as it's mine. Without her I wouldn't be the person I am today.\"Her story, she believes, will now encourage other women to stand up for themselves, for what is right. \"I'm saying that in the moment, I was scared and nervous too. But I also want to say that if you believe that you're right, then you can also fight.\"\"For me,\" she says, \"the crown was always secondary. The more important thing was to encourage women to stand up against injustice, to speak up for what's right,\"I ask her what's the next step for her.\"I will go for Miss Uttarakhand next year and then Miss India. After that, I'll see where life takes me.\"",

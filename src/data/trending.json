On Tuesday Democratic Rep Ihan Omar was attacked at a local event in the city and protests are continuing following Saturday’s shooting of US citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents. Video evidence contradicts claims by Trump administration officials immediately after Pretti’s killing that he was a “domestic terrorist”, planning a “massacre” and “brandishing” a weapon. \nIn this episode, Sarah, Anthony and Marianna discuss the president’s controversial response to the attack on Democrat Ihan Omar, and whether Trump can actually de-escalate tensions when thousands of ICE agents remain in Minnesota.\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Kris Jalowiecki and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Image source, EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockByShireen JordanBBC WeatherUpdated 30 January 2026Stargazers may be able to catch the last full Moon of meteorological winter on Sunday. If you're tempted to pop outside to catch a glimpse, it will rise at 16:13 GMT in London and should be visible - clouds permitting - until it sets at 08:06 GMT on 2 February. These timings vary slightly depending on where in the UK you are.A full Moon happens when the Sun and Moon are on opposite sides of Earth - in alignment, known as 'syzygy' - so the whole side that is facing us is illuminated. It also appears to look full in the days before and after the peak, so there will be other opportunities to see it, if you don't catch it on Sunday. Image source, BBC Weather Watcher/ Dave's PatchImage caption, Last year the Snow Moon was visible in the night sky on Valentine's DayWhy is it called a Snow Moon?Full Moons were historically named as a way of keeping track of the change of seasons and often influenced the timing of activities like hunting, harvesting and planting, where the bright moonlight could come in handy. Each full Moon in a year has a name - a practice that dates back to ancient traditions centuries before the Gregorian calendar existed.February's full Moon is known as the Snow Moon, after the heavy snowfall often associated with this time of year in the northern hemisphere, but is also sometimes called the Storm Moon or Hungry Moon.Image source, BBC Weather Watcher/ AstroMalImage caption, January's Wolf Moon captured by BBC Weather Watcher 'AstroMal' over Crystal Palace, London Will I be able to see the full Moon?Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / YorkshireTedImage caption, A bright orange supermoon shines over Yorkshire There is quite a lot of cloud in the forecast for Saturday and Sunday night, with the best of any clear spells likely to be across Northern Ireland.The Moon will be at its peak illumination at 10:09 GMT in the UK when it is below the horizon, however it will still appear 'full' when it rises at night and for the following few days. Sunday will see a largely cloudy day with patchy rain in places, mainly the north and east and just a few brighter breaks between these.If you manage to spot the Moon and want to take a picture make sure you turn off the flash on your phone, activate night mode and use ambient light. Oh, and check the BBC Weather forecast.The lunar monthImage source, Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesImage caption, The Snow Moon in February 2023 was the smallest one of the year making it a Micromoon - the opposite of a supermoon This year there will be an extra full Moon on 31 May, known as a Blue Moon. This is the name given to the second full Moon in a calendar month. May's Blue Moon will also be one of three Micromoons this year. Micromoons appear to look smaller in the sky and are the opposite of a supermoon.We usually get 12 full Moons a year, but as this doesn't quite match up with the lunar cycle we get an additional one roughly every two and half years. As it only happens every few years it is where the expression 'once in a blue moon' comes from.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRevelations from more than three million newly released documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein dominate the front pages of Saturday's papers. The Times reports that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to visit Buckingham Palace two months after the financier was released from house arrest, according to an email from 2010. The email was sent from an account attributed to \"The Duke\" which appears to be linked to the former prince. The BBC has not been able to independently verify their authorship. Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all allegations of wrongdoing connected to Epstein, and the BBC has contacted him for a response. The exchange is among the latest batch of more than three million pages released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday. \"Andrew invited paedophile to Palace a month after his release\" is the Daily Mail's headline. The paper reports that the email suggests the former prince promised Epstein \"lots of privacy\". The email is dated from September 2010. Epstein was released from house arrest in July of that year. The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing and the BBC has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor for a response.The Daily Telegraph follows with details from an email in 2010 between Epstein and an account named \"The Duke\", which appears to be linked to Mountbatten-Windsor. The message suggested Epstein wanted to introduce \"A\" to a \"beautiful\" 26-year-old Russian woman. The paper reports that the email was signed \"A\", with what appears to be an email signature that reads \"HRH Duke of York KG\". The BBC has not been able to independently verify their authorship. The BBC has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor, who previously denied all wrongdoing related to Epstein.The Sun leads on the same story, with the headline \"Epstein fixed Russian girl for Andrew\".The Guardian focuses on documents that suggest Epstein sent thousands of pounds in bank transfers to Peter Mandelson's partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva in 2009. In an email to Epstein, da Silva sets out the costs of an osteopathy course, provides his bank details and thanks the financier for \"anything you can help me with\". Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his past friendship with the late sex offender. When asked for a response to the newly released emails, he said he had been \"very clear\" about his relationship with Epstein and has \"nothing more to add\".The Daily Star shifts its attention to Microsoft boss Bill Gates whose name also appears in the newly released documents. The paper says the new files reveal the billionaire reportedly caught a sexually transmitted disease 'from Epstein sex girls'. A spokesperson for Gates called the claims \"absolutely absurd and completely false\".The Daily Mirror's front page says Donald Trump's name also appears again in the new documents. Many of the allegations about the US president appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency, and were made without supporting evidence. When asked about the claims, the White House directed reporters to the part of the DOJ announcement which described some documents as containing \"untrue and sensationalist\" allegations against the president. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.In other Trump news, the Financial Times reports that the US president has named Kevin Warsh as the Federal Reserve chair to succeed Jerome Powell when his term ends in May. Warsh has been an outspoken critic of the central bank and served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011.In news closer to home, the i Paper's latest polling shows \"half of UK voters\" want Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to be replaced. It adds that the figures show \"for the first time, the PM has lost the support of voters who backed him and Labour in the 2024 election\".The Daily Express shouts out its campaign for \"a proper Brexit\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "5 hours agoBrandon DrenonReutersLuigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, will not face the death penalty if convicted, a court has ruled.US District Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed the federal firearms charges against the 27-year-old that carried the possibility of the death penalty.He will still face stalking charges, which can bring a maximum punishment of life in prison.Mangione was arrested days after he allegedly shot Thompson as he walked into a New York City hotel on 4 December 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to all federal and state charges.After the ruling, Mangione's attorney Karen Agnifilo thanked the court for \"this incredible decision\", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. \"We're all very relieved,\" Agnifilo said. \"We're prepared, and have been prepared, to fight this case, and we look forward to fighting this case.\"In her ruling, Judge Garnett, a Biden appointee, said two of the four federal charges did not \"meet the federal statutory definition of a 'crime of violence' as matter of law\". She noted that her decision was \"solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury\".Garnett's ruling was a setback for the justice department, which had called Thompson's murder a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination\".The judge has given the government 30 days to challenge her decision to rule out the death penalty in the Mangione case.In a win for prosecutors, Garnett said they could present evidence to the jury from Mangione's backpack that he had at the time of his arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.Among the items in the bag were a gun, fake IDs and a notebook with writings that allegedly detailed Mangione's grievances against the US healthcare system. Defence attorneys had sought to dismiss that evidence from trial, arguing that authorities obtained it illegally without a warrant. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a wealthy Maryland family, is also facing nine charges in a separate case brought by New York state prosecutors, including second-degree murder.Father-of-two Thompson, 50, was shot from behind by a masked gunman as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for an annual investor conference. Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Thompson's murder.Law enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.Jury selection in the federal trial is due to begin on 8 September with opening statements due to start on 13 October. But state prosecutors are seeking to try Mangione as soon as July.In a separate incident, a Minnesota man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly impersonating an FBI agent in an attempt to free Mangione from the Brooklyn jail where he is being held. The suspect - Mark Anderson - was carrying a barbecue fork and pizza cutter, prosecutors say. He is now being held at the same facility as Mangione.",

    "body": "6 hours agoIsabella Allen,Politics producer in ShanghaiandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterReutersSeven new shops for Labubu dolls are to open in the UK this year, following the prime minister's trip to China.Chinese toy maker Pop Mart has confirmed it will open a flagship shop on Oxford Street in London's West End, as well as shops in Cardiff and Birmingham, before opening 20 more shops in Europe in 2026.The announcement is part of a package of deals announced by the UK government, including on whisky and cars, which officials claim is worth £2.2bn in export deals.Some have expressed concerns about Sir Keir's visit to China, arguing the country has a poor record on human rights and poses a threat to the UK's national security.Labubus are furry dolls wearing a signature spiky-toothed grin and became a viral purchase last summer, with celebrity fans including Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Kim Kardashian.The legions of fans are happy to queue to snap up the dolls, although to many their appeal is hard to explain. But their popularity has been a boon to Chinese soft power, with state news agency Xinhua saying Labubu \"shows the appeal of Chinese creativity, quality and culture in a language the world can understand\".Pop Mart founder Grant Wang, who expects to bring 150 new jobs to the UK, said: \"London stands at the heart of the global creative ecosystem, and we are thrilled to plant our European roots here.\"Sir Keir has made the first trip to China by a UK prime minister for eight years in an effort to thaw relations and cement trade deals with the second-biggest economy in the world behind the US.On the final day of his three-day visit to Beijing, he announced an estimated  £2.2bn in export deals, as well as new investment.This includes a cut in tariffs on Scottish whisky exports to China, estimated to be worth £250m to the UK economy over the next five years, which will come into force on Monday.The prime minister also met the chairman of car manufacturer Chery, who confirmed the company will open a European headquarters in Liverpool.However, the Conservatives have argued Sir Keir's trip was not in the national interest and Reform UK has called on him to reject trade deals with China until British citizen Jimmy Lai is released from prison.Responding to critics, Sir Keir said: \"Engaging with China, is how we secure growth for British businesses, support good jobs at home, and protect our national security.\"",

The Belgian then took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five set contest and he had a match dart after hitting two treble 20s when attempting a 142 check-out but he missed double 11 with his third arrow.World number one Littler hit double 16 with his next dart to level the match and then opened with 180 on his way to taking the deciding set.Littler called it a \"tough\" night, adding on ITV: \"I didn't get going. \"In the second and third set, Mike deserved to win them.\"I had to fight back and that's what I did. I got over the line, found a bit of form and got the win.\"The tournament favourite's win sets up a last-16 showdown with Ross Smith.Littler was followed on to the stage by defending champion Luke Humphries, who averaged 104 as he defeated Dave Chisnall 3-1.Humphries, the 2024 world champion, lost the first set but went on to hit seven 180s.The night's final match saw Stephen Bunting beat Jeffrey de Graaf 3-1.Day two of the competition also saw wins for Josh Rock, Luke Woodhouse, Danny Noppert and Rob Cross.Friday's resultsStephen Bunting 3-1 Jeffrey de GraafLuke Humphries 3-1 Dave ChisnallLuke Littler 3-2 Mike de DeckerJosh Rock 3-1 Connor ScuttLuke Woodhouse 3-0 Martin SchindlerRoss Smith 3-1 Jimmy van SchieDanny Noppert 3-1 Daryl GurneyRob Cross 3-1 Ryan Searle",

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel Muller HeyndykandChi Chi Izundu,Investigations correspondentNews SyndicationThe former prince, Andrew, left, has been criticised for his association with Jeffrey EpsteinEmails suggest that the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein invited a man believed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a 26-year-old Russian woman.The latest batch of documents released by the US Department of Justice relating to Epstein shows emails signed \"A\", with a signature that appears to read \"HRH Duke of York KG\".The emails were exchanged in August 2010, two years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor. The messages are likely to put further pressure on Mountbatten-Windsor, who has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein.BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.The emails between Epstein and an account named \"The Duke\" on 11 and 12 August 2010 suggest that the American wanted to introduce \"A\" to a 26-year-old Russian woman, whom Epstein suggests he \"might enjoy having dinner with\".He says that the woman would be in London in August 2010. \"The Duke\" replies that he would be in Geneva \"until the morning of the 22nd but would be delighted to see her\" before asking: \"Will she be bringing a message from you? Please give her my contact details to get in touch.\"He asks Epstein whether there is \"any other information you might know about her that might be useful to know?\"Epstein replies that \"she [is] 26, russian, clevere [sic] beautiful, trustworthy and yes she has your email\".Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl in Florida and completed his sentence in July 2010, a month before the email exchange. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the emails.Also among the latest tranche of documents is an email exchange dated 27 September 2010 between Epstein and the account titled \"The Duke\".Epstein writes that he is in London, adding: \"What time woudl [sic] you like me and [redacted], we will also need/ have private time\".\"The Duke\" replies: \"I am just departing Scotland should be down by 1800. I'll ring you when I get down if you can give me a number to ring. Alternatively we could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy. A\".Epstein replies: \"bp pleease [sic].\"The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor for a response.Another document, from 2020, is a formal request for assistance from US authorities asking to interview the former prince as they believed that \"Prince Andrew may have been a witness to and/or participant in certain events of relevance to the ongoing investigation\".They said documentary evidence \"has revealed information suggesting that Prince Andrew had knowledge that Maxwell recruited females to engage in sex acts with Epstein and other men\" and \"there is evidence that Prince Andrew engaged in sexual conduct involving one of Epstein's victims\".The letter also said: \"Prince Andrew is not presently a target of the investigation, and US authorities have not, to date, gathered evidence that he has committed any crime under US law.\"Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction\".He has faced allegations, which he repeatedly denied, that he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre as a teenager after she said she was trafficked by Epstein.He paid a financial settlement to Giuffre, who he claims to have never met, to settle a civil sexual assault claim in 2022.EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockSarah Ferguson, Mountbatten-Windsor's former wife, has not publicly commented on the latest release of emailsSome emails which appear to have been between Sarah Ferguson and Epstein have also been found in the latest release.One email dated 4 April 2009 - signed \"Love, Sarah, The red Head.!!\" - read: \"Hello Jeffrey. I am landing in Palm Beach in a couple of hours. Is there any chance on my quick layover, that I can get to have a quick cup of tea...\" The email goes on to discuss ideas for Ferguson's company, Mother's Army. The former Duchess of York refers to Epstein as \"My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you.\"The financier was still under house arrest when the email exchange was sent.In another exchange in August 2009, Ferguson emails Epstein again to discuss \"my Sarah Ferguson Brand\" and thanks the billionaire \"for being the brother I have always wished for\".The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response.The newly released email exchanges form part of more than three million pages of documents made public on Friday by the US justice department. More than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images are included in the latest batch. Their release comes six weeks after a deadline mandated in a law signed by President Donald Trump.Many of the documents are heavily redacted, with some files showing pages which are entirely blacked-out.",

    "body": "13 hours agoMaia DaviesandImogen Foulkes,Geneva correspondentGetty ImagesAntónio Guterres said the organisation's money could run out by JulyThe United Nations is at risk of \"imminent financial collapse\" due to member states not paying their fees, the body's head has warned.António Guterres said the UN faced a financial crisis which was \"deepening, threatening programme delivery\", and that money could run out by July.He wrote in a letter to all 193 member states that they had to honour their mandatory payments or overhaul the organisation's financial rules to avoid collapse.It comes after the UN's largest contributor, the US, refused to contribute to its regular and peacekeeping budgets, and withdrew from several agencies it called a \"waste of taxpayer dollars\". Several other members are in arrears or are simply refusing to pay.Though the UN General Assembly did approve a partial change to its financial system in late 2025, the organisation still faces a massive cash crisis compounded by a rule that means it is refunding money it never received.At its headquarters in Geneva, signs warning of the situation have been put up everywhere. In an almost desperate attempt to save cash, the escalators are regularly turned off and the heating turned down.Guterres wrote in his letter that the UN had faced financial crises in the past but that the current situation was \"categorically different\".\"Decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced,\" the secretary general said, without naming specific members.He said the \"integrity of the entire system\" depended on states adhering to their obligation under the UN charter to pay their \"assessed contributions\" - adding that 77% of the total owed had been paid in 2025, leaving a record amount unpaid.Guterres said a rule that the UN must return unspent money on particular programmes to members if it could not implement a budget created a \"double blow\" in which it was \"expected to give back cash that does not exist\".\"I cannot overstate the urgency of the situation we now face. We cannot execute budgets with uncollected funds, nor return funds we never received.\"As a result, the UN is now returning millions of dollars it never actually had. The letter reads: \"Just this month, as part of the 2026 assessment, we were compelled to return $227m [£165m]  – funds we have not collected.\"\"The bottom line is clear,\" Guterres wrote. \"Either all member states honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or member states must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse.\"UN agencies rarely get all the money they ask for to tackle humanitarian crises, but the past 12 months have been particularly difficult. The US is the UN's largest contributor, but President Donald Trump has said it was not fulfilling its \"great potential\" and has criticised it for failing to support US-led peace efforts.The US did not pay its contribution to the UN's regular budget in 2025 and offered only 30% of its expected funding to UN peacekeeping operations.Other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have also announced significant reductions in foreign aid, which will inevitably impact the UN's work.Guterres had warned earlier that same month that the UN faced its most fragile financial position in years - again citing unpaid fees - having said in October that it faced a \"race to bankruptcy\".Trump has separately been accused by critics of seeking to replace some functions of the UN with his Board of Peace to oversee regeneration efforts in Gaza.The US president has said its work would happen \"in conjunction with the United Nations\" - but when previously asked by a Fox TV journalist whether the board would take the UN's place, he replied: \"Well, it might.\"The US officially left the UN's World Health Organization last week. It had refused to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues despite, WHO lawyers say, being legally obliged to do so.Other agencies are also making huge cuts. The UN's human rights office has warned that serious violations will now go undocumented because it lacks the funds to deploy investigators. In the past, their evidence has led to prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity.In Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, UN Women has had to close mother and baby clinics. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme has had to cut rations to refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNardine SaadReutersCatherine O'Hara, the comedic actress best known for her starring roles in the Home Alone and Beetlejuice films, as well as her Emmy-winning turn in Schitt's Creek, has died aged 71. The Canadian star rose to fame through Toronto's Second City improvisation troupe and on SCTV, before making a name for herself in the US in 1988's Beetlejuice and as the matriarch in the holiday classic Home Alone.O'Hara, whose colleagues remembered her as a \"wonderful person, artist and collaborator\", who most recently appeared in the Emmy-winning comedy The Studio and HBO's The Last of Us.In a statement to the BBC, O'Hara's agent said she died  on Friday at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness.O'Hara made lightning strike twice in her career with indelible cinematic turns.In 1988's spooky satire Beetlejuice, she played Delia Deetz who led her possessed dinner guests in an enthralling song and dance performance of Day-O (the Banana Boat song).Two years later, in Home Alone, her panicked scream of \"Kevin!\" as she realises her mischievous eight-year-old son had been left behind during their Christmas holiday became is among the most memorable moments from one of the most successful film comedies ever. Her young co-star Macaulay Culkin, now 45, paid tribute to his on-screen mother on Friday, sharing images of the two of them from the film and in later years: \"Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later.\"'I'm so proud of you' - O'Hara speaks at Macaulay Culkin Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremonyThe Toronto-born actress got her foot in the door as a waitress at the Toronto Second City theatre franchise in the 1970s, before auditioning for a role with the famed acting troupe.She further developed her comedic chops after joining the cast of sketch comedy show Second City Television (SCTV) -  one of the most successful Canadian TV programmes ever - alongside the likes of Eugene Levy and the late John Candy.She has credited her Canadian roots with helping develop her sense of humour.In 2020, she told Rolling Stone that growing up Canadian didn't have the same sense of nationalism or patriotism that she saw in the US.\"And that's a good thing because it does make you look outside of yourself and be aware of the world and not take yourself seriously,\" she said.\"And I think Canadians have not only a sense of humour about others but also about themselves.\"Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney joined Canadians and fans across the world in mourning O'Hara.\"Over 5 decades of work, Catherine earned her place in the canon of Canadian comedy — from the iconic Toronto production of Godspell to SCTV to Schitt's Creek,\" he said. \"Canada has lost a legend.\"O'Hara also collaborated with Christopher Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy four times, including on the critically acclaimed mockumentary films Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration. Her role as character actress Marilyn Hack in For Your Consideration earned her the 2006 National Board of Review Award for supporting actress.In a statement to Variety, Guest said he was devastated and that \"we have lost one of the comic giants of our age\".O'Hara had a late career surge thanks to the Canadian comedy series Schitt's Creek that became one of the biggest hits of the Covid lockdown.The fish-out-of-water comedy show followed the wealthy Rose family as they abruptly lose their money and mansion, and are forced to move into a shabby motel in a deadbeat town they bought as a joke.Getty ImagesSeth Rogen and Catherine O'Hara presented an award together at the 2026 Golden GlobesO'Hara's character Moira was a particular delight, with her wildly fluctuating accent, outlandish fashion sense, and brilliant one-liners, like \"Never assume, Twyla, because when you assume, it makes an ass out of... both of us.\"Upon winning the Emmy Award for actress in a comedy, O'Hara thanked her co-stars Eugene and Dan Levy for giving her the opportunity to play \"a woman of a certain age - my age - who gets to fully be her ridiculous self\".Dan Levy who played her son David in the series, which he also co-wrote and produced, said it was a gift \"to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O'Hara's brilliance\".\"Having spent over fifty years collaborating with my Dad, Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family,\" he wrote. \"It's hard to imagine a world without her in it. I will cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her.\"O'Hara had continued working until very close to her death, playing a therapist in HBO's sci-fi drama The Last of Us and an ousted movie executive in Seth Rogen's The Studio just last year.In The Studio she played Patty Leigh, a studio boss replaced by Rogen's character, who pursues more creative roles as a film producer and makes her way to the Golden Globes - a stage that O'Hara was no stranger to. She won a Golden Globe award for best actress in 2021 for her role in Schitt's Creek and was nominated for her role in The Studio at this year's awards.She is also nominated at the Actor Awards (formerly the Screen Actors Guild Awards), which take place in March, for her role as Patty.Rogen on Friday said that when he first met O'Hara, he told her she \"was the funniest person I'd ever had the pleasure of watching on screen\" and that Home Alone was the film that made him want to make movies.\"Getting to work with her was a true honour,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"She was hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous… she made me want to make our show good enough to be worthy of her presence in it. This is just devastating. We're all lucky we got to live in a world with her in it.\"Film director Judd Apatow, replying to Rogen's post, added: \"Brilliant and kind. Riotously funny for fifty years. A really special person.\"O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch and sons Matthew and Luke, as well as her siblings Michael O'Hara, Mary Margaret O'Hara, Maureen Jolley, Marcus O'Hara, Tom O'Hara, and Patricia Wallice.With additional reporting by Jessica Murphy in Toronto and entertainment reporter Steven McIntosh.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesKevin Warsh has previously worked at the Federal Reserve and on Wall StreetDonald Trump has been calling for change at the US central bank. Now, with Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve chairman poised to end in May, he could be about to get his wish.On Friday, the US president announced Kevin Warsh - a conservative whom he had passed over for the post, to his regret, during his first term - as his choice to replace Powell. \"Warsh \"is 'central casting' and he will never let you down,\" Trump declared on social media as he announced the decision. The irony of the choice was lost on no one. Warsh has made his name as a supporter of higher interest rates - a reputation he has tried to shed in recent opinion articles and media appearances. It's a position that would seem to put him at odds with Trump, a self-described \"low interest rate guy\", who has criticised Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough and who has made no secret that his choice to lead the Fed should be on board with his views.It remains to be seen whether Warsh's selection will lead to the bank Trump wants.Warsh brings a traditional background to the job: an Ivy League education, a prior stint at the Fed, as well as time on Wall Street and at the Hoover Institution - a conservative economic think tank.Supporters say he is sensitive to concerns about the bank's independence and alert to the risks if its policies serve short-term political aims rather than the wider economy.Lee Ohanian, an economics professor at UCLA and senior fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution, who has known Warsh for years, said taking directions from Trump \"would diminish the Fed. It would diminish the office of the chairman, and it would create tremendous turmoil in the financial markets. Kevin knows that\". His nomination has drawn praise from establishment figures including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Mohamed el-Erian, a high-profile economist with a long career on Wall Street.Critics have questioned whether it is the fact that Warsh's father-in-law, Ronald Lauder, is a Trump donor and friend that got him the job. Others say his record as a policymaker is poor, noting that Warsh opposed economic stimulus during the 2008 financial crisis as he fretted the policies would lead to inflation – a minority view then and now.  Congressman Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, accused Warsh of showing \"willingness to wildly alter his views...based on who is in the White House\".But on balance, many in financial circles see him as a responsible pick. \"There appears to be at least some degree of comfort with a Warsh-led Fed vs. the other choices,\" Wells Fargo analysts said on Friday - noting that his relatively sparse public profile in recent years implies a degree of uncertainty. \"Investors should be thankful,\" Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, told the BBC.What Warsh could mean for interest rates?The acceptance of Warsh is partially a gamble that a Fed with him in charge might not change much. After all, despite Trump's complaints, the Fed cut interest rates three times last year and most analysts expect additional cuts this year – regardless of what Trump thinks.That's good news for borrowers in the US, who may see lower rates on mortgages, car loans and other kinds of debt - and maybe for the president too, if this makes people feel better about the economy. It also means Warsh does not necessarily have to surrender his credibility as an independent economist to deliver lower interest rates for Trump. 'Mission creep' at the FedWhere differences might be felt more is in other parts of the Fed, which Warsh has accused of \"mission creep\" and taking on too big a role in the economy. He wants to reduce its role in bank regulation and cut back study of issues like climate change - putting him in alignment with the White House. He, like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is a fierce critic of the interventions the Fed made in markets after the 2008 financial crisis and again during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has left the bank with huge holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Warsh maintains these policies prop up the stock market and other assets - benefiting the wealthy and big financial interests rather than the mainstream economy - and has called for reducing those holdings and coordinating their management more closely with the Treasury Department.Whether he would actually lead the Fed to shrink its balance sheet more quickly than the bank has been doing is unclear. One effect of doing so could be higher borrowing costs - exactly the opposite of what Trump wants to see. On Friday, gold prices dropped and the dollar gained, suggesting traders see Warsh as likely to stick to his initial instincts as a \"hawk\" who favours higher interest rates. Narayana Kocherlakota, a finance professor at the University of Rochester, who served on the Fed with Warsh, said he thinks he would go against the president if conditions called for it. \"He's very smart and he's very independent. And I think that's the kind of person that Americans should want at the head of their central bank,\" Kocherlakota said. Others argue Warsh's thinking on the economy has evolved to be closely aligned with Trump, including downplaying concerns that rapid growth and rising wages could fuel inflation. \"Warsh is not the Fed's guy, he is Trump's guy, and has shadowed Trump on monetary policy almost every step of the way since 2009,\" wrote Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Group. For now, Warsh may look like the candidate most likely to satisfy all parties. But Trump's swift turn on Powell - his last pick for Fed chair - should serve as a cautionary reminder.

    "body": "3 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: \"I will not be silenced\", says Don Lemon after arrestFormer CNN host Don Lemon has appeared before a judge after being arrested for entering a Minnesota church and filming anti-immigration enforcement protesters as they disrupted a service.After appearing in court, Lemon was released from custody. He told media outside that he was arrested for covering the news, adding: \"I will not be silenced.\"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said he was charged with \"conspiracy to deprive rights\" and \"violation of the FACE Act\", by allegedly interfering in someone's First Amendment rights by force. Lemon went into the Cities Church in St Paul on 18 January with protesters who said one of the pastors was an immigration enforcement official.Getty ImagesLemon, an independent journalist, said he was taken into custody by federal agents on Thursday. He did not enter a plea in court. \"Last night the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night for something that I have been doing for the last 30 years and that is covering the news,\" Lemon said. \"I have spent my entire covering the news. I will not stop now,\" Lemon added. \"In fact, there is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.\"Lemon has been charged with violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances and Places of Religious Worship (FACE) act, which is a law that typically has been used to crack down on demonstrations at abortion clinics but also prohibits obstructing access to houses of worship.US Department of Justice questioned over arrest of Don Lemon\"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell said earlier on Friday in a statement posted on Lemon's Instagram account. The lawyer added: \"This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand.\"Lowell said Lemon had been arrested while he was in Los Angeles covering the Grammy Awards.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said three others had been arrested: local independent journalist Georgia Fort, along with activists Trahem Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy.Fort was also released earlier on Friday after her court appearance in Minnesota. America's top law enforcement official accused them of participating in a \"coordinated attack\" on the church. FBI Director Kash Patel said investigators from his agency and the DHS had arrested Lemon and the other three.Fort posted a livestream of federal agents arriving at her home to arrest her. \"Agents are at my door right now,\" she said in the clip. \"My children are here, they're impacted by this.\" President Donald Trump's administration initially sought to charge eight people involved in the Minnesota church protest with conspiring to deprive rights and interfering with someone's religious freedom in a house of worship.But a magistrate judge who reviewed the evidence approved charges for only three of those involved, excluding Lemon.The government challenged that decision, but an appeals court suggested prosecutors take the case to a federal grand jury - a panel of citizens that evaluates if there is enough evidence to charge someone in a case.A longstanding Trump critic, Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 after 17 years with the company. The morning show host had apologised for on-air comments that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, then 51, was past her prime. In the Minnesota church protest, he live-streamed with protesters on YouTube. The broadcast began with Lemon standing with the group in a car park where he says: \"This is an operation that is secret.\"I can't tell you what is going to happen, but you're going to watch it live unfold here on 'The Don Lemon Show.'\"He followed the group - whom he called \"resistance protesters\" - into the church, initially without his camera operator. His microphone picked up audio of a woman shouting \"excuse me pastor\". Protesters chant \"Justice for Renee Good\", referring to the US citizen who was fatally shot in her vehicle on 7 January during a confrontation with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis.Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other. Lemon repeatedly says he is there as a journalist and is unaffiliated with demonstrators.\"We're not part of the activists, but we're here just reporting on them,\" he says.The pastor says: \"This is unacceptable, it's shameful. It's shameful to interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship.\" Harmeet Dhillon, of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, said during an interview with podcaster Megyn Kelly on Friday: \"We're going to pursue this to the ends of the Earth.\"The White House appeared to celebrate the arrest, posting a photo of Lemon on its official X account with the caption \"when life gives you lemons\", next to an emoji of chain links.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the detention of Lemon \"shocking\" and \"alarming.\"CNN said it raised \"profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment\". The network said it would follow Lemon's case closely.This is the second high-profile incident this month of the Trump administration investigating a journalist, raising the alarm of free speech advocates. On 14 January, the FBI showed up unannounced to the home of a Washington Post reporter with a search warrant and seized her devices over the alleged leak of classified information, although she herself was not charged with any crime.Protests are continuing in Minnesota, where an operation by federal immigration agents has sparked confrontations that have left two US citizens dead: Renee Good, a mother-of-three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse.",

    "body": "2 hours agoEmer MoreauandJosh MartinGetty ImagesThe price of a flight on your phone is sometimes different to booking on a computerThe business model for many airlines involves charging attractively low prices for the actual ticket, but making customers pay separately for luggage, seat selection and priority boarding.And it is lucrative: add-on fees, or \"ancillary revenue\", brings in billions for these airlines every year.In some cases, passengers find paying the fees is unavoidable, especially if you're flying with children. But here's how to beat some of them.1. Be ruthless when it comes to packingThere are sometimes bargains to be had when it comes to carry-on bag charges, says Laura Anne Sargeant, who documents her holidays online under the name Travelling Page Turner. But in her experience never anything as low as the £5.99 suggested by easyJet.\"It's usually closer to £20,\" she says. easyJet has now been told by the UK's advertising watchdog to stop claiming this price is available, after it failed to provide evidence customers could bring a bag on for that cost.While budget airlines say they offer low carry-on prices, Which? found in the vast majority of cases they weren't available. The consumer rights organisation only found Ryanair's lowest advertised price (£12) accessible twice out of 634 flights it checked, and found Wizz Air's lowest price of €10 was available twice in 338 flights. To avoid a bill for carry-on luggage, Laura Anne is \"really ruthless\" with her packing.\"I'll use the hotel body wash,\" she says, \"I never take a hairdryer.\" Then if she is travelling with someone else they can share a case and split the cost between them.Laura Anne SargeantLaura Anne says you should think about whether you really need priority boardingWendie Smith from Bristol is more of a solo traveller. She is off to south-east Asia for two weeks soon but is only taking a backpack to avoid the charge for putting a bag in the hold.\"It's a soft backpack so it squeezes into their little cages a bit better than a solid one,\" Wendie said. \"And it unzips like a suitcase.\"Wendie SmithWendie is going to Asia for two weeks and is only taking a backpackBut her best-kept secret? \"Dry robes have massive pockets,\" she says.Designed for outdoor swimming fans, these large overcoats can hold a lot of extras and fit over a couple of jumpers. \"They can't tell you what to wear on a plane,\" Wendie says.Travel influencer Chelsea Dickenson also loads her pockets with heavier items rather than putting them in a suitcase for the hold. \"Airlines may weigh your bag, they don't weigh you!\"You can even buy vests with many pockets, marketed as a hack that \"airlines hate\".If you are taking a bag, the advice is to pay for it as early as possible.\"Prices can increase closer to departure,\" Chelsea says, \"and adding luggage at the airport or gate is almost always the most expensive option.\" 2. Double check the airline's cabin bag rulesChelsea warns holidaymakers to watch out for different rules at different airlines, particularly for luggage.Measure your bag and check the airline's website for precise limits. Don't just go with what your bag claims to be.\"A bag labelled 'cabin size' does not guarantee it meets the airline's rules. Wheels, handles and rigid shells can push bags over the limit.\"Helpfully, luggage firms have your back there. \"Companies have got savvy to this and created a whole range of bags where the wheels come off,\" Chelsea said.\"Wheel your case through the airport but when it comes to boarding, simply take the wheels off, pop them in your pocket and know that you're sorted.\"Chelsea DickensonChelsea Dickenson has been writing about travel since 2017. She recommends using pockets to their maximum capacity, like with this fishing vest3. Don't fall for sneaky sales tacticsClicking through the booking process can sometimes make it look as though you have to pay extra to reserve a seat.But if you do not need a particular seat and you are not bothered about sitting with your travel companions, you can just let the airline allocate you a place.Laura Anne also thinks paying for priority boarding is \"a bit of a con\".Many passengers worry that if they don't pay to board ahead of other people, and then there is no room in the overhead bins for their luggage, they will end up having to pay to put it in the hold. But Laura Anne says if that happens you will not be charged. You will have to wait longer for your luggage when you land, though.The booking process is also littered with offers of extra services.Laura Anne says that while there is sometimes value to be found in booking accommodation or transfers offered through the airline, this is rarely the case with insurance.\"Occasionally you'll find a [cheap] hotel or car hire ... but definitely no to insurance.\"More weekend picks",

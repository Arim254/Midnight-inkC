    "body": "3 hours agoAn attack targeting a Jewish community event at Australia's Bondi Beach dominates the front pages of Monday's papers. The Daily Mail centres its coverage on the \"incredible courage\" of a 43-year-old shopkeeper who wrestled a gun off one the attackers in an effort to save lives. The paper says Ahmed al Ahmed was shot after he tackled one of the gunmen from behind and is still in hospital.The Metro fills their front page with photos from a widely-circulated video of Mr Ahmed disarming one of the gunmen. The paper quotes New South Wales premier Chris Minns, who praised the father of two as \"a genuine hero\", saying he has \"no doubt many, many people are alive... as a result of his bravery\".\"Hero of Bondi\" echoes the Daily Star, as it reports the death toll from the tragedy has risen to 15 people, including a child, and 42 people remain in hospital. It says a father and son were responsible for the attack.The Daily Express describes Mr Ahmed's actions as \"fearless\".The i reports the Jewish community in Sydney is in mourning while Hanukkah celebrations begin around the world.\"Hate and heroism on Bondi\" is the Daily Telegraph's headline. The paper picks up on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comments, saying Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's decision to recognise a Palestinian state was pouring \"fuel on the anti-Semitic fire\". The Guardian leads with the Australian PM's condemnation of the attack as \"an act of evil antisemitism\". The incident is the deadliest terror attack in Australia for nearly three decades, according to the paper.\"Bloodbath at Bondi beach\" reports the Times. Police say one of the gunmen was known to security services, but authorities had no indication of a planned attack, the paper says. The front page also features another headline from MI6's chief, Blaise Metrewelli, who will warn on Monday that the rules of war are being \"rewritten by Russia\".The Independent spotlights a photo of a British-born rabbi who was among those killed in the massacre.The Sun calls the gunmen \"Bondi fiends\" as it says both men were shot by police, killing the father while the son remains in hospital in critical condition.The Mirror follows with photos of people fleeing Bondi Beach as the attack unfolded. \"Horror and heroism at Bondi\" is the headline.Finally, the Financial Times features an image of a police officer standing guard at Bondi Beach as authorities continue to investigate the crime scene. It also reports on investors seeking protection as \"fears of AI meltdown test Wall Street's nerves\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "4 hours agoEmily AtkinsonWatch: Eyewitness captures moment man tackles and disarms Bondi shooterA \"hero\" bystander who was filmed wrestling a gun from one of the Bondi Beach attackers has been named as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed.Video verified by the BBC showed Mr Ahmed run at the gunman and seize his weapon, before turning the gun round on him, forcing his retreat. Mr Ahmed, a fruit shop owner and father of two, remains in hospital, where he has undergone surgery for bullet wounds to his arm and hand, his family told 7News Australia.Fifteen people died and dozens were injured in the shooting on Sunday night, which took place as more than 1,000 people attended an event to celebrate Hanukkah. Police have declared it a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.Mr Ahmed's cousin, Mustafa, told 7News Australia late on Sunday:  \"He is a hero, 100% he is a hero. He has two shots, one in his arm and one in his hand.\"In an update early on Monday, Mustafa said: \"I hope he will be fine. I saw him last night. He was alright but we're waiting to see what the doctor (says).\"Police say that the two shooters involved were a father and son aged 50 and 24. They confirmed that the 50-year-old man died at the scene while the 24-year-old remains in hospital in critical condition.The footage of Mr Ahmed's intervention has been shared widely online.It shows one of the gunmen standing behind a palm tree near a small pedestrian bridge, aiming and shooting his gun towards a target out of shot.Mr Ahmed, who was hiding behind a parked car, is seen leaping out at the attacker, whom he tackles.He manages to wrestle the gun from the attacker, pushes him to the ground and points the gun towards him. The attacker begins to retreat back to the bridge.Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the shooters.The same attacker is later seen on the bridge picking up another weapon and firing again.Another gunman also continues firing from the bridge. It's unclear who or what they are aiming at.Mr Ahmed managed to wrestle the gun from the attacker in the struggle At a news conference late on Sunday, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns paid tribute to the bravery of Mr Ahmed, who was unnamed at the time.\"That man is a genuine hero, and I've got no doubt there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery.\"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said: \"We have seen Australians today run towards danger in order to help others.\"These Australians are heroes, and their bravery has saved lives.\"Speaking at a White House Christmas reception, US President Donald Trump also praised Mr Ahmed, saying he had \"great respect\" for him. \"It's been a very, very brave person, actually, who went and attacked frontally one of the shooters, and saved a lot of lives,\" he said.

My family, we've had some hard times, but they've been here.\"She also paid tribute to her dance partner Caillon, saying: \"You've been brilliant in every sense of the word.\"When I wobbled, and when I felt really brilliant about the dance and got the steps right, you've just held me in your hands and you've gone, 'Bal, we've got this.'\"I've never felt alone on this floor, and I just want you to remember me. Don't replace me too soon!\"Caillon said Sopal \"embodies\" what Strictly Come Dancing is about. \"Her spirit is unbreakable, and you have shown me that I'm actually dreaming too small, and Bal can inspire us that whatever any of us want in life, all you have to have is the desire to go after it.\"The celebrities performed two dances each on Saturday.Carney and her partner Carlos Gu topped the leader board for their performance, after receiving a near perfect score of 78 out of a possible 80.The results show also featured a surprise for departing presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman.Following a highlights package of their best moments working on the show, the pair were each awarded their own unique golden Glitterball Trophy.There was also a festive performance from Kylie Minogue of her new single XMAS accompanied by 16 Strictly professional dancers, plus a special performance of the 90s classic Sit Down from the band James.The remaining three couples will perform during next weekend's final.It will air on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 19:00 GMT on Saturday 20 December, with the winner crowned that evening.",

    "body": "Image source, GettyBySimon King Lead Weather Presenter and Ema SabljakBBC England Data UnitWe've had songs written about it, it features on Christmas cards and films - with almost every advert throughout December showing it.Most of us will dream or romanticise about a white Christmas, but how common or not is it to have one in the United Kingdom?According to the Met Office, an \"official white Christmas\" has happened more often than not since 1960, but new analysis of its data by the BBC shows that locally, snow falling on Christmas Day is rare for most of us.And there have been fewer stations reporting a white Christmas in the past two decades across the UK, according to the data.The Met Office officially defines a white Christmas as one where snow is reported to fall at any of its weather stations in the 24 hours of Christmas Day.If there was no snow falling but snow already on the ground, this is not defined as a white Christmas.On this definition, three out of four Christmases since 1960 have seen at least a flake of snow fall somewhere in the UK.Analysis of Met Office data by the BBC shows at a very local level it's unlikely you will have experienced many white Christmases where you live.For example, during the most recent white Christmas in 2023, snowfall was only seen at three stations in the Highlands and one in Aberdeenshire.Use the tool below to see how many white Christmases have been reported at weather stations near you.While the official definition of a white Christmas has changed in the past, along with the number of stations and how it is observed, the data will still include all recorded instances of snow falling on Christmas Day.'It probably frightened Father Christmas'Ian Currie from London was 12 years old when he was given a weather station for Christmas in 1962. It included a rain gauge, a funnel and a brass container. On Boxing Day, he said it snowed so much, his instruments were buried.\"I remember the milk bottles freezing with a column of ice,\" said Mr Currie, who went on to become a weather forecaster, author and editor of Weather Eye magazine.\"Couldn't be better timed to encourage a young weatherman in the making.\" \"The classic white Christmas that I remember was 1970,\" he added.\"It snowed heavily the day before and over Christmas Day and Boxing Day - metres of snow fell.\"He recalled \"a terrific flash of lightning and almost instantaneous crash of thunder, which woke quite a few people up - and probably frightened Father Christmas\".Image source, GettyImage caption, There is lots of nostalgia about waking up on Christmas Day with a blanket of snow with more fallingDreaming of a white Christmas?The classic \"white Christmas\" idea is thought to originally come from the Victorian era when snowy winter days were much more frequent than today.Coincidentally this is a period when sending Christmas cards first became widespread, depicting the snow scenes of the time, a tradition that continues to the day.Christmas movies originating from the United States also show snowfall on Christmas Day, something more common in parts of North America.While it is likely somewhere in the UK will see snow falling at Christmas, for the majority, this will not be the case.Most white Christmases are found, perhaps unsurprisingly, in Scotland where over the past 65 years, 43 were \"white\". Northern Ireland had the least with less than a third of those years recording a white Christmas.In fact, Northern Ireland has not recorded a white Christmas for 14 years.Across England you will have most likely experienced a white Christmas in the North West where nearly 40% of years recorded snow on Christmas Day since 1960.Quite a contrast to the South East where since 1960, London has only seen five Christmas Days where snow fell, the last one more than two decades ago in 2001.Image source, NASA WorldviewImage caption, On Christmas Day in 2010 there was widespread lying snow across the UKYou might remember Christmas of 2010 when most of us would have opened the curtains on Christmas Day to a Christmas card scene with snow on the ground.About 80% of weather stations recorded lying snow that year but only 30 stations had snowfall meeting the definition of a white Christmas. Compare this to 2004 when snow was observed at 146 weather stations.Francesca Di Giuseppi, principal scientist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, was in Reading over the Christmas period in 2010 and remembers having snowball fights with the friends she lived with.Image source, Francesca Di GiuseppiImage caption, Scientist Francesca Di Giuseppi said she had found the snow \"actually quite magical\"\"We made a snowman - I remember not having a carrot to put on the nose, so we ended up with an apple,\" she said.\"We were a household of southern Europeans, not very used to snow in our home countries. It was actually quite magical.\"She said she believed the excitement over white Christmases stemmed from snow slowing things down, meaning it is an excuse be at home with family and \"see the beauty of nature\".White Christmas and climate changeThe Met Office data analysed by the BBC suggests there have been fewer widespread white Christmases in past two decades.While we cannot use what happens on one day of the year to assess whether the decline is due explicitly to climate change, scientists suggest a white Christmas will become less likely in the future.According to the Met Office, the UK has already warmed by 1C since about the 1950s and we have seen less frost and snow as a result.In the 1990s and early-2000s there were five years with a widespread white Christmas where more than 100 weather stations reporting falling snow.But in the past 20 years the most stations reporting a white Christmas was 30 in 2010.So far in the 2020s there have already been four white Christmases declared with snowfall reported somewhere in the UK but falling snow was only confirmed by at most six stations in a year.While better technology means recording snowfall at just one location in the UK has increased the likelihood of having a confirmed white Christmas, the number of stations actually seeing snow on Christmas Day appears to have declined.Our winters are expected to get warmer and wetter and a Met Office spokesperson confirmed snowy spells were \"becoming less frequent as our climate warms\".They added \"natural variability means cold, snowy periods will still happen\", but we can expect \"fewer frost and snow days\".Additional reporting by Alix Hattenstone.",

    "body": "4 hours agoYasmin RufoGetty ImagesAt first glance, my emails are polite and warm, after all \"I'm just checking\" in on a deadline but \"no worries either way\". However, a closer look reveals my messages are punctuated by unnecessary apologies, smiley faces, exclamation marks and even kisses.I like to think I'm being friendly and approachable, but according to experts, these linguistic habits may be quietly undermining how seriously I'm taken at work.Careers coach Hannah Salton and etiquette coach William Hanson explain why so many of us write like this and the impact it could be having on how we're perceived, and even promoted at work. Is your punctuation extra?\"Thanks very much!\" I've replied to many an email - my punctuation may be extra but a full stop feels blunt.People use exclamation marks to show \"positivity and enthusiasm,\" says Hannah.Women use them three times more often than men, a recent study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found.She thinks that’s likely down to the idea that \"women are often judged more harshly than men when they are direct and are called bossy and other gendered negative words\". And while a single exclamation mark isn't the problem the cumulative effect can be, warns Hannah. “If it looks fake or like it's covering up insecurity it could impact credibility,” she explains.Would you kiss them in real life?Written communication is notoriously easy to misread, which is why many of us insert an emoji as a picture of our warmth or humour.But etiquette coach William Hanson warns this can backfire. \"One emoji can mean different things to different people or something entirely unintended,\" he says.\"It would be better if people used words and a good command of English,\" he advises.Emojis can have an \"infantile connotation\" which could lead to people perceiving you as younger, less senior, capable or responsible, he says.\"I would not put an emoji in an email,\" he says. \"You can be friendly in your writing and remain professional at the same time.\" And when it comes to signing off with a kiss, he says: \"I would never put a kiss on the end of an email unless I would kiss them on the cheek in real life.\" Softening language can dilute authority\"Just checking that you're following me and this all makes sense?\"Emails containing reassurance checkers can be self-depreciating,\" Hannah says, adding that over time, that tone can subtly shape how someone is perceived.\"As a manager, it's a difficult balance of being liked and respected and if you're not direct, there's a risk of creating an impression of being less capable,\" she says.\"There are definitely times where communicating in an overly apologetic or overly measured way can make you come across as less impactful.\" \"A lot of it is unconscious,\" Hannah says. \"No one reads an email and thinks 'oh, they don't back themselves', it's more subtle than that.\"But if you're consistently communicating in a people-pleasing way, that can build up an impression of someone who doesn't back themselves, or who is potentially less competent.\"What to cut out of your emailsHere are some of the things you might want to consider losing to appear more professional, our experts suggest:Qualifying words such as \"just\" (\"just checking\", \"just wondering\")Pre-emptive apologies like \"sorry to bother you\" or \"I'm sure you're really busy but…\"Reassurance checkers such as \"does that make sense?\", \"hope that's ok\" or \"no worries either way\"Exclamation marksEmojisKisses or overly warm sign-offsHannah and William stress it's not about stripping all warmth or personality from professional communication. \"Personal style is important,\" Hannah says. \"Showcasing personality at work is not a bad thing. You don't want to feel like you have to filter everything you write and remove any personality from it.\"But at the same time you shouldn't use certain words and symbols \"as a tool to be liked\". A practical way to spot and reduce these habits without losing personality is to pay attention to the emails you receive and notice how different styles make you feel - what sounds clear, confident or reassuring, and what feels excessive, she says.Salton says AI tools can also be useful for reviewing drafts and removing excess filler or qualifier words.",

    "body": "3 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinandLeyla KhodabakhshiAFP via Getty ImagesSanam, an Iranian immigrant who came to the US over a decade ago, was finally about to become a US citizen. Years of navigating paperwork, approvals, tests, and security vetting, had brought her to the last step: a naturalization ceremony.But then, just two days before she was to take her oath on 3 December, the US government abruptly cancelled it.Sanam was shocked and confused at first – there was no explanation. She didn't understand why the ceremony was cancelled when she hadn't done anything wrong, she told the BBC.Later, she found out it was because of where she was born, and sadness and frustration crept in.\"It's been just years and just feeling drained and feeling like, can I even keep going with this process? Because it's been so hard,\" Sanam said. \"It's just very heartbreaking.\"Getty ImagesSanam - who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation but who chose to share her nickname - lives in Oregon with her husband, a US citizen from Kansas. Her identity has been verified by the BBC.Her case is one of many – earlier this month the Trump administration began cancelling the citizenship ceremonies of immigrants from 19 countries already subject to a travel ban, including Iran.That controversial decision left some legal permanent residents like Sanam – people who already had passed through every step of the process to become US citizens and were only awaiting the final formality – in an indefinite state of uncertainty.\"It just feels like our life is kind of in this limbo state, unstable,\" Sanam said, adding that she and her husband feel like they are \"at the mercy of what the government decides\".This experience has led Sanam to start reconsidering whether it's worth it to stay in the US. She still has family in Iran, including her aging parents, and she doesn't know when she'll be able to see them again.\"It's hard to think about hope at this point,\" she said. \"It's a really scary time and unfortunately as we approach the holidays, it's just really sad that people are going through this, and it's supposed to be a season of joy and getting together with your family.\"19 countries affected by travel banThe cancelling of oath ceremonies is just one part of the Trump administration's latest efforts to tighten immigration rules. Migrants from the 19 countries already subject to a travel ban have had their immigration processing halted no matter where they are in the process, not just those at the final step.The move, and others like it, came in the days after an Afghan national opened fire on National Guard members in Washington DC on 26 November, killing one and critically injuring another. The Trump administration has used the shooting as justification for a number of new efforts to tamp down immigration, including sending an additional 500 National Guard troops to DC, reducing the work visa validity period from five years to 18 months, and pausing all asylum claim decisions.US Citizenship and Immigration Services has said the restrictions are necessary to safeguard national security, protect American lives, and ensure public safety.But Mario Bruzzone, vice president of policy at the New York Immigration Coalition, a nonprofit that represents hundreds of immigrant rights groups, said the restrictions put immigrants who are in need of protection in dangerous situations.\"An indefinite pause is a ban, plain and simple, and they're using the recent shooting in DC as a pretext for an escalation in attacks on immigrants and refugees,\" Mr Bruzzone told the BBC.One Venezuelan immigrant, Jorge, was also on the cusp of becoming a US citizen when suddenly, less than 24 hours before his ceremony on 2 December, he was told it had been cancelled without explanation.\"I had everything prepared, including attending the ceremony with my son. To have it cancelled the day before, without any clear reason, left us with no clarity about the next steps,\" Jorge said.Jorge, which is not his real name, has asked to remain anonymous, but his identity and experience have been verified by the BBC. He said he obtained permanent residency in 2017 through the \"extraordinary ability\" category, which is reserved for professionals at the top of their field.Jorge agrees with the Trump administration that there should be \"stricter reviews\" of immigrants, he told the BBC. He blames the Biden administration for allowing too many immigrants into the country, and added that if he had been able to vote, he would have supported President Donald Trump.What concerns him, he said, is that long-term residents with no criminal history are now being \"generalised\" alongside people who he believes do require deeper scrutiny.\"I just want those of us who have followed every rule to be able to move forward with our cases — and for those who have committed fraud or crimes to face the appropriate legal consequences,\" Jorge said.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Trump has expanded his previous travel ban to include 19 countries, mostly from Muslim-majority or African countriesMr Bruzzone of the NYIC said many immigrants from the 19 countries - including refugees, asylum seekers, and legal permanent residents like Sanam and Jorge - have already gone through extensive vetting that takes years and has multiple layers of security checks and health checks.Living in New York state alone, there were an estimated 132,000 Venezuelan-born people in 2023, according to data gathered by the New York Immigration Coalition.The halt has disrupted the lives of people at every stage of the immigration process, leaving them to wait it out in a \"huge amount of uncertainty\", Mr Bruzzone said.Sanam's husband, who chose not to share his name for fear of retaliation, told the BBC that the timeline of events feels astounding.\"If those National Guard members weren't attacked last week, but this week, [my wife] would be a citizen right now,\" he told the BBC the day after Sanam's oath ceremony was supposed to happen.\"Your mind goes a little bit wild about how quick the mechanism for changing all of these policies came on,\" he said. \"It just feels like the administration clearly didn't let a good crisis go to waste in this case. And it's pretty tough to be underneath that.\"",

It's a moment of your life that you put down on paper and give to someone else,\" she said.King shares personal message on cancer in TV broadcastThe Rothera research station, which opened in 1975, is the largest British Antarctic Survey (BAS) facility, and a renowned global hub for climatic research.It is situated 1,860km (1,155 miles) south of the Falkland Islands.Staff work and live at the station for months at a time. Ms Shaw said: \"Getting post is really special for the team at Rothera. \"If you're doing fieldwork for many months, the feeling of receiving a letter — an actual tangible, piece of paper with handwriting from friends and family — is such a lift. \"It's a wonderful way to connect people that goes beyond what an email or text message can do.\"BAS/Jake MartinKirsten Shaw and Aurelia Reichardt, station leader at Rothera, are pictured with the new post boxThe box will replace the handmade and painted one currently used at the station.The BAS said \"the Royal Household worked with Royal Mail to arrange this particularly special delivery\".It was delivered to Rothera by the UK's polar research vessel RRS Sir David Attenborough, along with the first major drop of supplies to the station following the long Antarctic winter. The post box will be installed in the Discovery Building, a new scientific support and operations hub.BAS/Aurelia ReichardtThe handmade box will now be replaced by the official one from the Royal MailPostal logistics in such a remote area are understandably not straightforward.Ms Shaw's job is to oversee the formal Post Office logistics of getting mail in and out of Antarctica from Rothera, as well as getting post out to staff to other BAS stations and science field camps.Post has to be gathered and put on board the RRS Sir David Attenborough or on BAS aircraft to the Falkland Islands, where BAS maintains an office in Stanley.The final leg involves transport to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where letters enter the Royal Mail postal network for onward delivery.BAS/Jake MartinThe box will be placed in a new building at the stationJane Rumble, HM Commissioner for the British Antarctic Territory said: \"Maintaining a postal service in the British Antarctic Territory is far more than a symbolic gesture. \"It reinforces Britain's presence and heritage in Antarctica and provides a vital link to the wider world.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "8 hours agoJessica Rawnsley,Alex SmithandLucy Manning,Special correspondentJames Manning/PA WireThe victims of a mass shooting during an event marking Hanukkah at Australia's Bondi Beach have been remembered at events around the UK.Police forces in England and Scotland have said they are increasing their visibility among Jewish communities, as events celebrating the religious holiday get under way.Fifteen people, including a child, were killed during the Bondi shooting, officials have said, in an attack targeting members of the Jewish community.A crowd of around 100 people gathered outside the Australian High Commission in central London for a vigil on Sunday evening. People could be seen waving British and Israeli flags, while some held signs reading: \"Stop the Hate\".Speaking at the vigil, the rabbi for Marleybone, Yisroel Lew, lit a menorah and said: \"After hearing what happened this morning, the first thought was - how can we bring more light?\"Don't be afraid and celebrate Hanukkah.\"Just down the road in Trafalgar Square, a large menorah was lit up to mark the first day of the festival.Hundreds of people also attended Hanukkah events in north-west London on Sunday with music and dancing - and an increased police presence.Present at one of them was Chanie Simon, who went to school with Rabbi Eli Schlanger, among those killed in the Sydney shooting. She described the 41-year-old victim as a \"father in the prime of his life\".\"We are reeling in pain,\" she told the BBC. \"But we are going around and carrying on to make the world a bigger and better place, bringing acts of goodness, acts of light, because that's what the world needs.\"It's awful but we aren't going to let terror stop us.\"Social mediaThe BBC also spoke to Joseph Sassoon who said: \"I'm saddened that Jewish people have to be afraid in this day and age\". He added: \"Years after the Holocaust and Jews are still being murdered.\"London-born Rabbi Eli, a father of five, was described as a \"caring, vivacious, energetic, outgoing guy who loved people\" by his cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis.Speaking to the BBC earlier in the day, he said people should \"spread light\" by doing charitable acts in Rabbi Schlanger's name: \"I know how he would have been reacting and it was something he said recently.\"Every human being on earth has a positive way to contribute to making the world a better place, and we just have to keep spreading light.\"The world is a positive place and we need to show that and I know Eli would be saying that.\"Getty ImagesMusicians played during a Hanukkah event held in Islington, London, on Sunday eveningGetty ImagesEvents across the UK had an increased police presence in the wake of the attackJames Manning/PA WireA large menorah lit-up in neon light was placed in Trafalgar Square on SundaySir Keir Starmer and his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, have lit a menorah in the window of Number 10.Lady Starmer is Jewish, and Sir Keir has previously said they often mark the beginning of Shabbat on Friday nights.In a post on social media, the prime minister said: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with those murdered in the terrorist attack on Bondi Beach today, their loved ones and the whole Jewish community.\"Light will always win over darkness.\"@keir_starmerEarlier, the UK's Jewish Leadership Council (JLC) called on the police and government to protect events celebrating Hanukkah - which began on Sunday evening and lasts for eight days - saying: \"We must not let hatred extinguish the festival of light.\"In a statement, the JLC said it is \"devastated and angered that in Sydney, Jews appear to have been targeted once again for being Jewish\".\"We know that such hatred also exists in this country, as we are still reeling from the attack on a synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur.\"Two people were killed in that attack at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar.Starmer described the Bondi attack as \"sickening\" and said the government was working with Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish security organisation, on the policing of Hanukkah events in the UK.Police Scotland said it was carrying out additional patrols around synagogues and other Jewish venues and was \"actively communicating with faith leaders\".Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the Metropolitan Police would increase its visibility in Jewish communities ahead of Hanukkah events.The police force said: \"At a time when London's Jewish communities are coming together to begin the celebration of Hanukkah, we know this attack will be the cause of not just terrible upset but also significant heightened concern about safety.\"It added that \"there is no information to suggest any link between the attack in Sydney and the threat level in London\".King Charles said he was \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack\" at the Bondi Hanukah celebrations, and that his and Queen Camilla's \"hearts go out to everyone who has been affected so dreadfully\".He added that the light of the Jewish festival \"will always triumph over the darkness of such evil\".The Prince and Princess of Wales also issued a statement, saying their \"thoughts are with every Australian today\", and they \"stand with the Jewish community in grief\".Meanwhile, the UK's chief rabbi said the Jewish community will \"rebuild with tenacity\".\"As we kindle our first Chanukah lights this evening, we hold the victims of the unspeakable atrocity in Sydney in our hearts and in our prayers,\" Sir Ephraim Mirvis  said in a statement on X.Green Party leader Zack Polanski said he would be attending a Hanukkah event which \"should be a celebration but instead our community is once again mourning\".\"I will be thinking of everyone in Australia and those around the world in the Jewish community who know this fear and loss. We stand with you.\"The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had offered its support to its Australian partners and was in touch with the government to discuss the UK response.\"The scourges of terrorism and antisemitism are shared, international challenges and need concerted and determined action to defeat them,\" it added.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has advised any British people caught up in the shooting to contact the Sydney consulate for support.",

    "body": "7 hours agoTessa Wong,Bondi beachandTiffanie Turnbull,SydneyGettyThe shooting at Bondi beach targeted a Jewish Hanukkah event where many families were presentThe first day of Hanukkah was a sweltering one in Sydney - a perfect afternoon to spend at Australia's most iconic beach.More than 1,000 people were enjoying a festival marking the occasion at a grassy stretch in Bondi: kids careened around in facepaint, crowds snaked between food trucks, and many enjoyed live entertainment as they soaked up the last rays of sunshine.Then, just before 7pm local time, shots rang out.From a small footbridge - just metres from a children's playground - gunmen fired upon the fenced-in crowds. A car full of improvised bombs was parked nearby, though they never went off.One attendee, who identified himself only as Barry, described watching people around him get shot as hundreds of beach-goers began screaming and running through the park to get away from the attack.\"It was pandemonium and chaos,\" he told the BBC.One video showed a man - dubbed a \"genuine hero\" by state officials - leaping out from behind a parked car to wrestle a gun from one of the attackers and push him away.\"It was simply an unbelievable scene… in today's day and age, that families and kids on Bondi could be completely mowed down for being Jewish,\" Barry said.Bondi shooting was 'act of pure evil', Australian PM saysFifteen people were killed, including a child, according to Australian authorities. Police say the two gunmen were a father and son: a 50-year-old who has died, and a 24-year-old who is in critical condition. Police are investigating whether a third person helped stage the attack.This is an unfamiliar, and devastating, shock for Australia - the deadliest shooting in this country since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996.That attack, which killed 35 people, was a turning point, famously prompting the government to introduce some of the world's strictest gun control measures.We've only had a handful of mass shootings since then, most of them horrific acts of domestic violence - not public attacks like today.Swiftly declared a terrorist attack by police, it comes amid a rise in antisemitic attacks in Australia since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's subsequent offensive on Gaza.GettyMore than 1,000 people had gathered at the Hanukkah event.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called it an \"act of evil antisemitism\" and a \"vile act of violence and hate\".But he's been accused by some - including Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - of failing to address the upward trend of antisemitism here.\"The Australian government, which received countless warning signs, must come to its senses!\" Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar wrote on X.Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News Sunday night that the \"worst fears\" of the Jewish community had been realised.\"It's been bubbling under the surface for a long time, and now it's actually happened.\"In a statement, the Australia Jewish Association's Robert Gregory said many Jews would tonight be pondering whether they have a future in Australia.\"To be confronted with this horrific act of antisemitic violence during the Jewish festival of light and hope is shattering. In moments like this, we hold each other close,\" the Jewish Council of Australia said in a statement.GettyAn injured woman is treated by emergency workers at Bondi beachThere's a lot police can't - or won't - say yet. But they have declared this was a terrorist attack. Who the gunmen are - how many of them even - and their motive is still unclear. They said one of the attackers was known to police, but wasn't on their radar for anything like this.Officials wouldn't answer any questions about those who died either, out of respect for families who are still being notified.\"It's too early to give that information,\" was the most frequent refrain uttered at a press conference late on Sunday night.But where NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon couldn't offer answers, he tried instead to offer reassurance. Police are throwing everything at this investigation, he said.He urged the community to remain calm, and avoid spreading misinformation online - including speculating on the victims and perpetrators of the attack.\"I want to make sure that there is no retribution,\" Commissioner Lanyon said.Local politicians have also asked people not to share graphic footage from the attack on social media.Getty ImagesIn the aftermath of the shooting, sirens were ringing through the city and the area surrounding Bondi swarmed with police cars, helicopters circling above.There we found Fin Green, who was on FaceTime with his family in the UK when he saw the shooting unfolding outside his window. Unsure what was happening, he hid in his wardrobe for an hour and a half, until he felt it was safe to go out.Danny Clayton, a broadcast journalist who was at the beach and witnessed the events from the Bondi Pavilion, said some people crashed their cars as they attempted to flee.Many others in the area had similar stories. Restaurant worker William Doliente Petty said he was serving someone when he heard the gunshots. \"The whole shop just stood up and we ran into the back exit.\"Australia prides itself on being a merry, safe country and Bondi Beach has long been a symbol of that. But that image has been shattered and residents are in disbelief.Sunday's attack also came less than two years after another nearby tragedy. In April last year, a deadly mass stabbing attack took place at nearby Bondi Junction. Shocked, many then uttered the same words we've heard over and over today too: \"This sort of thing just doesn't happen here\".Additional reporting by Katy Watson and Tabby Wilson.More on this story",

    "body": "7 hours agoTom McArthur and Emily AtkinsonWatch: Eyewitness captures moment man tackles and disarms Bondi shooterThe gunmen behind a shooting targeting the Jewish community at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach were father and son, Australian officials say.Fifteen people - including a 10-year-old girl - were killed in the attack, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called \"an act of antisemitism... [and] terrorism on our shores\".The older gunman, 50, died after being shot dead by police. The 24-year-old is in a critical condition.Mass shootings in Australia are very rare, and the attack at Bondi is the deadliest incident in the country since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 when 35 people were killed by a lone gunman.Police have declared the incident a terrorist attack. Here's what we know so far. How the attack unfoldedAt around 18:47 local time (07:47 GMT), New South Wales Police received reports that a number of shots had been fired at Archer Park, Bondi Beach.A short while later, police shared their first public statement, urging anyone at the scene to take shelter and others to avoid the area.Verified videos captured hundreds of people fleeing the beach, screaming and running as a volley of gunshots rang out. Footage verified by the BBC appears to show two gunmen firing from a small bridge which crosses from the car park on Campbell Parade towards Bondi Beach.Separate video verified by the BBC shows a bystander tackling one of the gunmen, before taking his gun and turning it back on him. The gunman then retreats towards the bridge, from where another attacker is firing.The bystander has since been identified as Ahmed al Ahmed, a fruit shop owner and father of two. His family told 7News Australia he remains in hospital where he has undergone surgery for bullet wounds to his arm and hand.He was described by New South Wales Premier Chris Minns as a \"genuine hero\". \"I've got no doubt there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery,\" Minns told a news conference.In the same footage, another man - who appears to be injured -  is seen fleeing the scene, as police arrive and begin to fire in the direction of the gunmen. A further verified video shows several police officers on the same bridge. One appears to be administering CPR to a motionless man as someone shouts \"he's dead, he's dead\".How many people were killed and injured?A 10-year-old girl was among the fifteen people killed in the shooting, according to New South Wales Police. The ages of the victims ranges from 10 to 87 years old. No further details have been provided.The family of British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, has told the BBC that he is among the dead.Schlanger's cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis, said he was \"vivacious, energetic, full of life and a very warm outgoing person who loved to help people\".Israeli media - citing Israel's foreign ministry - reported that an Israeli citizen was also killed. French citizen Dan Elkayam has also been identified as a victim of the attack. In a tribute shared to X, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said he mourned with Mr Elkayam's family and loved ones, the Jewish community and bereaved Australians.The 50-year-old gunman was shot dead by police, while the younger gunman remains in hospital in a critical condition.A further 42 people are in hospital, police say. New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park told ABC News on Monday that some are \"critically injured, some seriously injured\".Park also said four children were transferred to Sydney Children's Hospital. It is not clear if the child who died is included in this number.Two police officers were shot and injured during the incident, according to police. They were reported on Sunday to be in a \"serious, verging on critical\" condition.What do we know about the gunmen?Police say the gunmen were father and son aged 50 and 24, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a news conference on Monday morning. The 50-year-old male was a licenced firearms holder. He was linked to six firearms, all of which were believed to have been used in the Bondi Beach attack, Lanyon said.Getty ImagesThe attack targeted a Hanukkah celebration on the beach, police sayWhat is the latest?Police have declared Sunday's shooting a terror attack.Overnight on Sunday into Monday, an exclusion zone was set up around the scene as police use specialist equipment to check improvised explosive devices (IEDs) found in a car linked to one of the gunmen, and police are still urging the public to avoid the area.During a televised address, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the shooting \"an act of evil antisemitism\". \"We have seen Australians today run towards dangers in order to help others. These Australians are heroes and their bravery has saved lives,\" he added.Israeli President Isaac Herzog has called the shooting a \"very cruel attack on Jews\", while King Charles - who is head of state in the Commonwealth nation - said he was \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack\".Getty ImagesPolice have urged for calm as they carry out their investigationWhat is Hanukkah?Hanukkah, or Chanukah in Hebrew, is often referred to as the Jewish festival of lights.The dates of Hanukkah change every year, but it will always fall in November or December and lasts for eight days.An event to mark the first day of the celebration was taking place on Bondi Beach at the time of the shooting.A digital flyer for the event, named Chanuka by the Sea 2025, shows it was scheduled to take place near the beach's children's playground from 17:00 local time (06:00 GMT) on Sunday.Organised by Jewish centre Chabad of Bondi, the event was set to feature live entertainment and activities \"for all ages\". Around 1,000 people were said to be in attendance.",

    "body": "Their diamond-rich land in South Africa was taken. Now they want it back4 hours agoKarnie SharpBBC Focus on Africa, South Africa's west coastBBCMartinus Fredericks is fighting to get the land back for his Nama peopleThere is a disturbing contrast along South Africa's remote west coast.The 800km (500 mile)-journey north from Cape Town starts with views of outstanding natural beauty which as the long road rolls on, and the northern border approaches, dissolve into a pockmarked lunar-like landscape.And the scars left by a lucrative diamond-mining industry are not just physical.The impoverished local Nama community living amid the environmental degradation in the far north-west of South Africa – also known as Namaqualand - wonder what has happened to the riches their land has yielded.Some of the hundreds of millions earned went on to build the country, but not much, it seems, stayed within the area.The Nama, who straddle South Africa and Namibia, are descended from the indigenous nomadic peoples – the Khoi and the San – seen as the original human inhabitants of this part of the world.Despite winning a legal battle over land and mining rights more than two decades ago in Richtersveld, which is part of Namaqualand, many in the community argue that they are yet to see any benefit.Andries Joseph once worked in the diamond industry in Richtersveld, which is now in declineStanding amid the wrecked empty shell of a former mineworks in the coastal border town of Alexander Bay, Andries Josephs, who worked here two decades ago before he was laid off, shakes his head.\"There's no work, that's the problem. The people have stagnated and everything has gone backwards. The buildings have collapsed. Unemployment is sky-high,\" he says.The diamond industry in this part of the region has declined in recent years, as most of the gems on the land are thought to have been found, leaving a trail of economic and social problems.About a kilometre from this derelict mine is a residential area of a few houses, a broken-down church building and a hospital with some damaged windows, offering basic services.The local authority's development plan describes \"dilapidated\" water and electricity infrastructure as well as poor roads which affect access to things such as healthcare.A century ago, the discovery by prospectors of precious stones south of the Orange River, which now forms part of South Africa's border with Namibia, led to a diamond rush that changed the land forever.But the Nama already knew of the gems.\"In our family, they used to teach the children to count with diamonds,\" says Martinus Fredericks.In 2012, Nama elders appointed him as their leader in South Africa. The 60-year-old says they urged him to fight for the return of their ancestral lands.Many of the abandoned mine buildings on the coast in Richetersveld are still standing  The Nama were once herders and traders until the European \"settlers came and interrupted their way of life\", according to Mr Fredericks.The area where they lived was annexed in the mid-19th Century by the Cape Colony – part of what is now South Africa - and then, after diamonds were found in the 1920s, the Nama were cleared from land around the Orange River.Nothing changed throughout the years of the racist apartheid system, or after the first democratic elections and the end of white-minority rule in 1994.The new African National Congress-led government maintained the earlier position that the greater good was served by sharing the diamond wealth generated in these parts with the rest of the country.The Nama were not happy and that disquiet continues to this day.\"You go to an area like the Richtersveld… you see how destitute the people are,\" Mr Fredericks says.\"They are unemployed. They live from hand to mouth, and then there's no real prospects.\"I'm not against development, but it must be to the extent where the community benefits as a partner.\"Things should be different.After a five-year legal battle with the state and the state-owned mining company, Alexkor, that ended up in the country's highest court, judges ruled in the Nama community's favour in 2003.The Constitutional Court said the Nama had an inalienable right to their ancestral land and the rights to the minerals there.However, four years later, Alexkor secured a deal with the Richtersveld Communal Property Association (CPA), which purportedly represented the Nama, that gave the company 51% of the mineral rights while 49% went to the community and an entity called the Richtersveld Mining Company.But Mr Fredericks argues that the CPA did not represent the Nama and the agreement was made without the consent of the wider community. He alleges that 20 years on they are yet to profit from the deal, or from any wealth generated over the decades despite the Constitutional Court ruling.Alexkor disputes this, saying in a statement to the BBC that it was \"incorrect to state that the community has not benefited from the land claim\".It said Alexkor had paid 190m rand ($11m; £8.4m) \"as reparation\" to the Richtersveld Investment Holding Company (RIHC) over a period of three years, as well as 50m rand ($2.9m) as a development grant.But the chairperson of Alexkor's board of directors, Dineo Peta, who took over earlier this year, acknowledged that the company was \"not oblivious to the fact that the community has not received the full economic benefit of the operations\". In an interview with the BBC she blamed that on \"maladministration and malfeasance within Alexkor\".The previous management was subject to an investigation by a special commission into what was known as \"state capture\". The commission's 2022 report found that there had been corruption – those findings are currently under investigation but have not resulted in any convictions.The issue of what has happened to the money handed over to the CPA was raised at a recent parliamentary hearing.One lawmaker, Bino Farmer, said that during a briefing, the Select Committee on Agriculture, Land Reform and Mineral Resources heard from the department of rural development that the CPA was \"dysfunctional\".He added that \"it also came to light that over 300m rand ($17.6m) rand has been paid over by the department and yet the people of the community did not receive anything\".The CPA was not present at the hearing but the select committee's chairperson said that it had \"expressed dissatisfaction, stating that relevant national departments had not adequately supported the implementation of the [Constitutional] Court order\".The BBC contacted the CPA on several occasions in an effort to understand what had happened to the money but has not received a response.\"[We] should have been in a much better position because we are the original custodians of the land,\" Mr Fredericks says.The diamond mining industry has left its mark on South Africa's north-western coastlineApart from the money, the community leader has another concern: the environment.\"Big companies come in, they rip up the land, they take whatever they can, and they just move off without doing the rehabilitation, leaving the receiving community to deal with the after-effects of their mining,\" he alleges.\"The Nama people used to mine themselves, but they've done it sustainably, they knew how to use resources from the land but also how to fix the land after using it.\"The damage left behind by commercial mining is hard to miss.Some mines remain abandoned, and there is little sign of rehabilitation.Instead, there was clear evidence of extraction, where the earth had been dug up, leaving behind an unsightly landscape.A mine in Hondeklipbaai, once owned by the mining giant, Trans Hex, looked abandoned.This is not part of the Richtersveld area but is still considered to be Nama land.In a letter to the BBC, Trans Hex said it had sold the site five years ago, but while it \"was the holder of the mining right it complied with its legal obligations including to make full financial provision for the rehabilitation of the mining areas\".But now that it has sold the site on, Trans Hex is no longer responsible for the rehabilitation, it added.Another mining giant, De Beers, has sold its interests in the mines on the west coast and says that it passed on responsibility for repairing the environment.But in an email to the BBC it did say that \"as part of the sale agreement in 2023 with Kleinzee Holdings, De Beers Consolidated Mines committed 50m rand ($3m) to support rehabilitation work in the area\".There are now concerns that the environmental damage could go further south as mining companies slowly edge their way down the coast.The BBC asked the department of forestry, fisheries and the environment for a response to the claims that many mining companies were not sufficiently rehabilitating land they mined on.Dion George, who was the minister until last month, said he was unavailable for comment adding that communicating via the media was \"not helpful and does not lead to progress\".The new minister, Willie Aucamp, in place for just under a month, was not in a position to comment yet.But Mr Fredericks is clear what should happen next.\"The government should return what is ours,\" he says.To change things he has begun legal action against the CPA, the group that was supposed to run things on behalf of his community, saying that it was not properly constituted.\"A Nama people cannot be a Nama people without control of Nama land. A Nama person cannot be separated from Nama land because of the intrinsic link between the person and the land.\"More from South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

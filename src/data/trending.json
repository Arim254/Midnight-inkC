    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

They are: Jake Reeves, 23, who pleaded guilty to a National Security Act offenceNii Mensah, 23, Jakeem Rose, 23, and Agnius Usmena, 20, who were found guilty of burning down the warehouseAshton Evans, 20, from South Wales who was found guilty of failing to disclose information about terrorist actsOn Thursday, prosecutor Duncan Penny KC, said: \"Earl's actions constitute a sustained campaign of terrorism and sabotage on UK soil, carried out in support of a foreign power, the Russian Federation, and its war of aggression against Ukraine.\" He said Earl had \"demonstrated a willingness to go to extreme lengths, including endangering lives\".Mr Penny also told the court that Earl discussed burning down a warehouse in the Czech Republic for £35,000.The focus of the trial was the burning down of a Ukrainian-owned warehouse in Leyton, East London, on 20 March 2024 that was used to send goods to Ukraine, including Starlink satellite terminals. Earl was supposed to receive £9,000 for his role but was paid less because he carried out the plan early without his handler's sign-off.The jury were shown messages between him and Wagner Group-linked accounts in which he discussed planning the attack and told his handler: \"I know I can be the best spy you have ever seen.\"Mr Penny said \"additional messages show that Earl sought to pay a person identifying as a serving British soldier for 'intelligence' for\" the Wagner Group.The sentencing judge, Mrs Justice Cheema Grubb, was shown a Telegram exchange between Earl and a man claiming to be a soldier in the British Army who used the name Huncho 0tf.Huncho 0tf told Earl he had been in the army for six years, to which Earl replied \"I work for a PMC [private military company]\" and \"we pay well for intelligence\".Huncho 0tf replied: \"Tell your superiors I can get any type of information not only in my squadron but I have mates in the SAS.\"PA MediaThe Ukrainian-owned warehouse in Leyton, East London was torched in March 2024In another exchange, Earl communicated with with a man in Slovakia about a plot to carry out an arson attack on a warehouse in the Czech Republic, writing: \"A warehouse needs to be [fire emoji].\"Asked \"when do you need it done\", Earl replied: \"The sooner the better. Asap really.\"The court was told other messages showed he sought \"banking information of European residents\" and discussed kidnapping a billionaire for the purposes of extortion.Earl's barrister Paul Hynes KC described his client as \"a sad individual\" and compared him to the deluded fictional character Walter Mitty.He said Earl \"led a rather nihilistic existence which involved taking drugs\" and \"saw the world through the desperate, pathetic and delusional prism of online gaming\".The prosecution's case that Earl had waged a \"sustained campaign of terrorism and sabotage\" was described by Mr Hynes as hyperbole. Mr Hynes said his client was \"vulnerable\" and \"easy meat for the fairly sophisticated operative of the Wagner Group... acting as proxies for the Russian Federation\".He continued: \"He never left his bedroom. He never met the people he recruited... These are not sophisticated agents of espionage.\"The judge said that was \"rather an old-fashioned view\", adding: \"It is not a question of dropping people behind enemy lines.\"She is expected to pass sentence at the Old Bailey on Friday.",

    "body": "7 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentPeter AshworthDave Ball formed Soft Cell with singer Marc Almond in Leeds in 1977In 1981, an unlikely group from Leeds scored a number one hit with their icy cover version of an obscure 60s soul hit.With Tainted Love, Soft Cell set a template for 80s synth-pop duos: The flamboyant frontman paired with an unassuming keyboard technician.Dave Ball, who has died at the age of 66, was that musical force, creating ominous, polyphonic soundscapes to match Marc Almond's lyrics about X-rated movies and sado-masochism.Tainted Love sold more than 21 million copies across the world and was followed by hits such as Say Hello, Wave Goodbye and Torch, before the band split in 1984. Reunited in the 2000s, they had completed a new album in the days before Ball's death.In a statement, the musician's family said he had died peacefully in his sleep at his home in London on Wednesday 22 October. It comes less than two months after Soft Cell played a headline show to 20,000 fans at the Rewind Festival in Henley-on-Thames.During that concert, Ball performed in a wheelchair, as he had for the last two years, following a spate of ill-health.\"I managed to damage myself quite a bit,\" he told the Yorkshire Post in 2023. \"I fractured lower vertebrae in my spine and cracked about five ribs and broke my wrist\". After catching pneumonia and developing sepsis, he was placed in an induced coma and remained in hospital for seven months.  However, he had been in \"a great place emotionally\" over the summer, as he worked on Soft Cell's new album, Danceteria, which is scheduled for release next year.The band were at the forefront of the synth-pop movement in the early 1980s\"He was focused and so happy with the new album that we literally completed only a few days ago,\" said Almond in a tribute. \"It's so sad as 2026 was all set to be such an uplifting year for him, and I take some solace from the fact that he heard the finished record and felt that it was a great piece of work.\"Almond has thanked his bandmate for \"being an immense part of my life and for the music you gave me\", adding: \"I wouldn't be where I am without you.\"Ball had also been part of the pioneering techno duo The Grid, who scored a UK top 10 hit in 1994 with the banjo-powered Swamp Thing.His bandmate from that era, Richard Norris, also paid tribute, remembering Ball's \"endless laughter\" and \"unwavering friendship\".\"Being in a duo with someone is different from being in a band, the bond is very tight,\" he added. \"That's how it was with us. We went through so many remarkable, extraordinary, life-affirming experiences together. Thank you, Dave.\"Mike OwenThe musician's death was announced shortly after Soft Cell completed a new albumBorn into a single-parent household in Chester in 1959, Ball was given up for adoption when he was 18 months old. He grew up in Blackpool with adoptive parents Donald and Brenda Ball, who changed his first name from Paul to David, alongside his younger sister Susan, who was also adopted.He met Almond at Leeds Polytechnic in 1977, where they were both studying art. Fuelled by a shared love of Northern Soul, they formed Soft Cell the same year, and quickly recorded an EP, which was given early airtime by Radio 1's John Peel.They were an unusual pairing: Ball was quietly hunched over his keyboard, while Almond was a flamboyant showman, all glitter and eye-liner; but they achieved a rare musical alchemy.Ball had developed a fascination with synthesizers after watching Kraftwerk appear on BBC science show Tomorrow's World, and began to marry dark electronica to the soaring melodies Almond was writing.Tainted Love became the UK's second biggest-selling single of 1981, shifting 21 million copies worldwide. Alongside hits by Gary Numan, Human League and Ultravox, it helped paved the way for the synth-pop sound of the 80s.The song was also included on their full-length debut, Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, which spawned two further top five singles: Bedsitter and Say Hello, Wave Goodbye. They followed the album with the stand-alone single, Torch, which peaked at number two in 1982.Getty ImagesThe duo were working on new material right up until Ball's deathFame had its upsides. \"I loved being able to afford my first home, having money and travelling, which makes me sound like a Miss World,\" Ball recently told Classic Pop Magazine.But it also presented problems. \"Newfound wealth meant we could afford newfound drugs to relieve the boredom\" of media interviews and TV performances, Ball said.\"I know that's a cliché, but it's a cliché for a good reason, because it works for so many bands.\"Amidst the hedonistic lifestyle, the duo were also drifting apart, but they managed to create a second classic album - the wayward, tense and aptly-titled The Art Of Falling Apart.They released one more album, 1984's This Last Night In Sodom, before dissolving the band to concentrate on other projects.Almond went on to have a successful solo career, including the top 10 hit Something's Got A Hold Of My Heart; while Ball created The Grid, who mixed acid house with ambient pop over a long-lasting collaboration.Peter AshworthDave Ball was a pioneer of the 80s British synth-pop movementSoft Cell reunited in 2001, producing the Top 40 album Cruelty Without Beauty. After another hiatus, they reappeared in 2018, releasing the original singles Northern Lights and Guilty (Cos I Say You Are) before performing what was supposed to be a farewell show at the O2 Arena on 30 September, 2018.However, they remained together, recording their fifth album, Happiness Not Included, during the 2020 Covid lockdown.Ball recently described the band's new music as a tribute to the New York club scene they frequented while recording their first two albums.He added that his time in hospital had influenced the band's sound.\"I had strange recollections when I was in and out of hospital because I was on morphine,\" he told Classic Pop.\"The new songs are a digital reflection of the sounds in my head from that time.\"In parallel, it's about the times me and Marc got up to in the 80s.\"The final mixes were completed only days before Ball died. It is due for release in Spring 2026.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterChangpeng Zhao, founder of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has been pardoned by US President Donald Trump.Zhao, also known as \"CZ\", was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 after pleading guilty to violating US money laundering laws.Binance was ordered to pay $4.3bn (£3.4bn) after a US investigation found it helped users bypass sanctions.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Zhao's prosecution under the Biden administration part of a \"war on cryptocurrency\".She claimed Zhao had been targeted \"despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victim\" and said prosecutors' efforts to seek a three-year prison sentence had \"severely damaged the United States' reputation\".\"The Biden Administration's war on crypto is over,\" she said.The move to pardon Zhao comes amid the Trump administration's adoption of a more friendly stance towards cryptocurrency than his predecessors.The President has vowed to make the US the \"crypto capital\" of the world and made his own mark in the digital currency landscape by releasing his own coin shortly ahead of his inauguration in January.Since then, he has sought to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve and pushed for making it easier for Americans to use retirement savings to invest in them.The Wall Street Journal previously reported representatives of the Trump family - which has its own crypto firm World Liberty Financial - had recently held talks with Binance.The company has spent nearly a year pursuing a pardon for its former boss, who completed his four month prison sentence in September 2024, the WSJ reported on Thursday.Binance has been approached for comment.The exchange, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, remains the world's most popular platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.Zhao stepped down from the company in November 2023. He wrote in a post on X it was \"not easy to let go emotionally\" but \"the right thing to do\". \"I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility,\" he said.US officials at the time accused Binance and Zhao of \"wilful violations\" of its laws - saying they had threatened the US financial system and national security.\"Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,\" said then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\"Its wilful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterThe number of reported passenger assaults on the rail network has more than tripled in the past 10 years, according to official figures. Between April 2024 and March 2025 found there were 10,231 reported assaults, up 7% on the year before, the Office of Rail and Road's annual report into health and safety found.  Ten years ago, there were 3,211 reported assaults, including harassment and common assaults. \"The safety of passengers and colleagues is our top priority,\" said Network Rail,  Rail Delivery Group, and British Transport Police in a joint statement. The increase coincides with a drive by British Transport Police to encourage the public to report a wide range of potential concerns on the rail network. In 2022, it launched its 'Speak Up, Interrupt' campaign to encourage anyone who witnesses inappropriate sexual behaviour \"to report incidents or safely intervene where they can\". Across the mainline rail network, harassment and common assault made up more than three quarters of the total assaults, and both of these categories saw an increase. This trend was mirrored on the London Underground, where reported assaults reached their highest level since the data series began in 2004, up to just over 4,600.Of those reported incidents, harassment and common assault counted for more than 80% of the total. Reports dipped in 2019/20 because of the pandemic.In the financial year from April 2024 in the report to March 2025, passengers took 1.7 billion journeys on the mainline railway. In that period, 14 members of the public died on the mainline network and the London Underground (not counting suicides and trespass-related incidents). There were also two deaths of workers on the rail network - one after being assaulted at a station, and the other resulting from a fall. The number of suicides across the rail network were also at their highest level since 2002. Across the mainline network, there were 368 suicides or suspected suicide attempts, resulting in 293 fatalities. In its joint statement, Network Rail, the Rail Delivery Group and British Transport Police said they are \"committed to reducing suicide risk through staff training programmes that have already enabled thousands of life-saving interventions\". They added they were also investing in technology like drones and remote monitoring tools.Thursday's report found injuries to members of the public and workers have also been creeping back towards pre-pandemic highs.  Recording just over 11,472 injuries, this marked the fourth yearly increase in a row, but was still below level reported in 2019-20. Of these injuries, the vast majority - almost 80% - were non-severe. The ORR divides up the information it reports between the mainline rail network, non-mainline (which includes services through the Channel Tunnel, as well as trams and light rail), and the London Underground.

    "body": "1 hour agoChris Mason,Political editor, Jennifer McKiernan,Political reporter and Sam Francis,Political reporter Getty ImagesThe search for a new chair of the grooming gang inquiry is expected to take months after the process was thrown into chaos when two leading candidates pulled out, the BBC understands.Sources told the BBC the government would move \"as fast as possible\" but were looking to \"re-engage with the victims and survivors\" to get their views on who should lead the inquiry.It comes after four members quit the inquiry's survivors panel and called for Safeguarding Minister Jess Philips to resign, accusing her of \"betrayal\" for denying claims the investigation might be broadened.Multiple sources have told the BBC the government are determined to keep Phillips in post. Another five abuse survivors have written to the prime minister to say they will only continue to work with the inquiry if Phillips keeps her job.There were, originally, 30 people on the panel the BBC understands - more than has been previously reported.On Wednesday, former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command (CEOP) Centre Jim Gamble ruled himself out of leading the grooming gang inquiry.The ex-police officer said political \"point-scoring\" had created a \"highly charged and toxic environment\".Mr Gambles withdrawal came only a day after ex-Lambeth children's services director Annie Hudson pulled out following intense media coverageA government source told the BBC \"urgent steps\" were being take \"to ensure a new candidate is found\".\"The government will now re-engage with the victims and survivors - to listen to their concerns and take their opinions on the type of person they want to lead the inquiry,\" the BBC was told.We \"will move as fast as possible, but must also take the time, likely months, to appoint the right chair,\" a source added.Sir Keir announced a national inquiry into the sexual exploitation of children by grooming gangs in England and Wales in June.The PM said the inquiry would have the power to compel witnesses to be questioned and would be guided by a panel of survivors, which the BBC understands had at least 20 members at the start.But there has been turmoil over the past week, with Fiona Goddard and Ellie Reynolds quitting the survivors panel in the inquiry on Monday, and two more known as \"Elizabeth\" and \"Jess\" following them on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.Senior figures in government are acutely aware that the victims of sexual abuse have been repeatedly and profoundly let down by multiple agencies of the state – and so establishing trust is incredibly difficult.\"Upset and vulnerable people hit out when they are in pain, and that is entirely understandable,\" one figure told the BBC.The panel members, we are told, are of a range of views and instincts – on their willingness or not to speak out, on their views on those who chose to do so or not, and on who should chair the inquiry and how it should be run.Multiple sources in government are making it clear there is a widespread determination – from Downing Street and the Home Office - to keep Phillips in her post.The issue was raised at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, when Sir Keir invited the four who had quit to re-join and sought to reassure them that \"I want to get this right\", despite the difficulties when \"every survivor does bring their own painful experience to this\".\"The inquiry is not and will never be watered down. Its scope will not change. It will examine the ethnicity and religion of the offenders and we will find the right person to chair the inquiry,\" he told MPs.However, there was still palpable fury from the group, who penned a group letter calling for Phillips to resign because she had broken a fragile trust. Now, a second group of survivors, headed by Samantha Walker-Roberts, has written to Sir Keir and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood with a list of seven conditions for their continued support, including Phillips continuing in her role.\"Jess Phillips has remained impartial to the process, only listening to feedback [and] we want her to remain in position for the duration of the process for consistency,\" they wrote. \"Her previous experience and drive to reduce VAWG [violence against women and girls] and her clear passion and commitment is important to us.\"They praised Phillips, who they said had \"devoted her life to hearing and amplifying the voices of women and girls who would otherwise have been unheard\" and had helped some of them access support. Earlier today, the first group called on Phillips to quit in order to restore trust in the inquiry, accusing her of \"betrayal\" for describing reports the scope of the inquiry could be widened as \"untrue\".Headed up by Fiona Goddard, the group of four said they would only re-join it if the minister went, because they had \"raised legitimate concerns around the inquiry's direction\" but \"in response, your safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips called our accounts untrue\".Another survivor, known as Carly, from Huddersfield, told the BBC she wanted to remain part of the inquiry, but she also believes Phillips should go, because \"she can't lie about what we all know\" around the question of whether to widen the inquiry's scope.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "2 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia EditorSputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via Reuters and ReutersOne week ago I had the distinct feeling it was Groundhog Day, or as the Russians call it, Dyen Surka.Amid US threats to pressure Moscow - by supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine - Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump held a telephone call. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Budapest.Last August, amid threats of additional US sanctions against Russia, Putin met Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. The result: the announcement of a US-Russia summit in Alaska.Déjà vu.But Groundhog Day seems to be over.The Alaska meeting went ahead, with minimal preparation and little result.But the Budapest summit is off. It barely had time to be \"on\", to be fair. Now President Trump has cancelled it.\"It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get,\" the US president told reporters.And that's not all.Previously, Trump had not followed through on threats of more pressure on Russia, preferring carrots to sticks in his dealings with the Kremlin.For the moment he has put his carrots away. Instead he's imposed sanctions on two major Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. That's unlikely to force a U-turn on the war from President Putin. But it's a sign of Trump's frustration with the Kremlin's unwillingness to make any compromise or concessions to end the fighting in Ukraine.Trump says Putin talks 'don't go anywhere' as he imposes new sanctionsWhat's the significance of US sanctions on Russian oil?The Russians don't take kindly to sticks.On Thursday, President Putin told reporters that the new US sanctions were an \"unfriendly act\" and an attempt to put pressure on Russia.\"But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decide anything under pressure.\"Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was less diplomatic.\"The USA is our enemy and their talkative 'peacemaker' has now fully set on the path to war with Russia,\" he wrote on social media. \"The decisions that have been taken are an act of war against Russia.\"Thursday morning's edition of the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets was slightly less dramatic, but obviously unflattering. The paper criticised \"the capriciousness and fickleness of [Russia's] main negotiating partner.\"So what's changed?Instead of rushing off to summit no. 2, as he had done for summit no.1, this time around President Trump was slightly more cautious. He had asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to lay the groundwork for the summit with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to make sure there was a point in decamping to Budapest.It soon became clear that there wasn't, and that a new summit now was unlikely to produce a breakthrough. Russia is fiercely opposed to Donald Trump's idea of freezing the current battle lines in Ukraine. The Kremlin is determined to take control, at the very least, of the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. It has seized and occupied much of it. But President Volodymyr Zelensky is refusing to cede to Russia those parts of the Donbas that Ukraine still controls.ReutersMembers of Russia's National Guard patrol Red Square near St. Basil's Cathedral in central Moscow on 23 OctoberMoscow would have welcomed a second US-Russia summit. The first, in Alaska, was a diplomatic and political coup for the Kremlin. The red-carpet welcome in Anchorage for President Putin symbolised Russia's return to the international stage and the West's failure to isolate Moscow. Over the last week Russian state media have been savouring the idea of a summit with President Trump in Europe, but without the European Union at the table. Russian commentators portrayed the proposed meeting in Budapest as a slap in the face for Brussels.At the same time, few here seemed to believe that, even if it went ahead, the Budapest summit would produce the kind of result Moscow wanted. Some Russian newspapers have been calling for the Russian army to continue fighting.\"There isn't a single reason Moscow should agree to a ceasefire,\" declared Moskovsky Komsomolets yesterday.That doesn't mean the Kremlin doesn't want peace.It does. But only on its terms. And right now those are unacceptable to Kyiv and, it would appear, to Washington. Those terms involve more than just territory. Moscow is demanding that what it calls the \"root causes\" of the Ukraine war be addressed: an all-encompassing phrase with which Russia broaden its demands to include a halt to Nato enlargement eastwards. Moscow is also widely believed to retain the goal of forcing Ukraine back into Russia's orbit.Is Donald Trump ready to increase the pressure on Russia even more?Possibly.But it's also possible we may wake up one morning and find ourselves back in Groundhog Day.\"In the game of Trump tug-of-war, Russia is leading again,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets after the Budapest summit had been announced. \"In the couple of weeks before the meeting in Budapest, Trump will be pulled in the opposite direction by telephone calls and visits from Europe. Then Putin will pull him back to our side again.\"",

    "body": "The decades-old exemption that lets Trump fast-track White House rebuild5 hours agoMadeline Halpert and Bernd Debusmann JrGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump plans to knock down the entire \"existing structure\" of the White House East Wing to construct a new ballroom - despite previous assurances that the addition would \"not interfere with the current building\". The sight of demolitions has sparked an uproar from Democrats as well as conservation groups, including the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which wrote a letter calling on Trump to hold a public review process. As a former property developer, Trump has extensive experience of navigating planning restrictions, and has occasionally found himself on a collision course with campaigners objecting to his plans.Under a nearly-60-year-old law, the White House and several other notable buildings are exempt from a key historic preservation rule - though one expert told the BBC that presidents typically follow it anyway. Full story: Trump says 'existing structure' to be torn downWho is paying for Trump's new ballroom?Is Trump allowed to demolish part of the White House to build a ballroom?What does the law say?Trump's renovation appears to be the biggest in decades, but the president of the US does have the power to make those changes. And he is not the first to reconstruct the White House. Over the years, a host of presidents have made renovations, from a bowling alley to an indoor swimming pool. Under a law known as National Historic Preservation Act, federal agencies are required to examine the impact of any construction projects on historic properties. Specifically, Section 106 requires the agencies to undergo a review process, including getting input from the public. Then-President Lyndon B Johnson signed the law in 1966, after a period of rapid development in the US - including through federally-funded infrastructure projects - as concerns grew that cultural and historical landmarks were being destroyed. Why is the White House exempt? According to Section 107 of the act, three buildings and their grounds are exempt from the Section 106 review process: the White House, the US Capitol and the US Supreme Court building. In the past, however, typically presidents have voluntarily submitted their plans to the National Capital Planning Commission - which oversees federal building construction - before the construction project begins. Trump officials have not yet done so, but say they plan to, though the renovation has already begun. What's the precedent?Priya Jain, the chair of a heritage preservation committee at the Society of Architectural Historians, told the BBC that the process laid out by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was well established and would have been the \"best practice\" for Trump's East Wing renovation. These reviews - which can take years - involves discussions about programmatic requirements and potential alternatives.\"In this case, it would have been: do we need such a big ballroom? Should it be smaller?\" said Jain, a professor of architecture at Texas A&M University. \"Could it be an extension of the East Wing? Could it have been submerged?\"At stake, she said, is the \"history\" that the building contains. All the additions to the White House over time have added to how the public understands the building and the country at that point in time, she said. \"It's the memory,\" she said. \"The East Wing is 83 years old. It has assumed a historical importance of its own. I haven't seen much out there about how that was assessed.\"",

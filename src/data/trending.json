    "body": "Image source, SNSImage caption, Rangers' new ownership has suffered a chaotic start to its reign  ByBBC Scotland's chief sports writerMaybe the time has now come for Rangers to accept that when Steven Gerrard says 'it's not you, it's me' what he actually means is the complete opposite.Gerrard didn't want to be considered when the Rangers job was vacant after the sacking of Philippe Clement - family reasons. And late on Saturday it emerged that he doesn't want to be considered now either - the timing isn't it right.He supposedly realised that after flying from the Middle East to London for a day - or days - of talks with the Rangers hierarchy. How long does it take to say, 'I'm out'? The 'timing' reason, it would appear, is strictly for those who came down in the last shower. It's understood that a reluctance to work under a sporting director (Kevin Thelwell) was one of Gerrard's main issues.Twice jilted, Rangers are putting out the notion that they might still get back together sometime in the future. The unrequited love routine is a bit embarrassing and, for whoever they eventually manage to get in the head coach's chair, possibly a touch unsettling.Rangers had gone all-in on Gerrard. He was the populist choice, the one character they could think of who would be given time and understanding by the fans.In the wake of the horror show that was Russell Martin's time in the job, they needed someone the fans wanted to get behind, a guy with presence and who they could believe in. The new owners didn't need a data company for that. All roads led to Gerrard, but that's over now.'This is now horror show for Rangers'This is now something of a horror show for the Rangers board. Their known first choice has ditched them. They're now on to the supporting cast. Danny Rohl is supposedly the front-runner. Rohl, 36, was an assistant manager at RB Leipzig, Bayern Munich and with the German national team. His management career exists of 89 games with Sheffield Wednesday, finishing 20th in his first season - he guided them to safety when the drop looked distinctly possible - and then 12th in the season after that.At a club mired in ownership and financial troubles, 12th was an admirable performance. He left by mutual consent in July this year. To Rangers, the brevity of Rohl's managerial career would represent a monumental gamble - and after Martin, the new Ibrox board probably thought they were done with monumental gambles.This is a huge club, but the list of potential managers is tiny. Already, Sean Dyche has said he's not interested. Kevin Muscat - who works in China with champions Shanghai Port - has also been mentioned and would have support. Another former player, Derek McInnes, has turned them down before and it's highly probable the Hearts head coach he would do so again, if the offer came, which it almost certainly won't.The job is a huge opportunity but also a poisoned chalice. The abuse Martin endured will not be lost on any potential target, the instant judgement and the necessity to win from the get-go will not be for everybody.Media caption, Take a look back at Gerrard's first spell at RangersThat's why the club, now under the control of the American consortium who took charge in May, went straight to Gerrard. He ticked a lot of boxes. Even though everyone assumed his return was a fait accompli, there were a few red flags around.The club he left in 2021 no longer operates in the same way. Gerrard had the run of Ibrox when he was there before. Everybody bowed to him. He had a managing director and a board, yes, but he was the man, he was Stevie G, the boss.What he asked for, within reason, he got. But now there is no Dave King as chairman and no Stewart Robertson as managing director, there is no Michael Beale helping on the coaching side and no Ross Wilson on player recruitment. All four were huge Gerrard men. They were his colleagues but also his champions.There's now a new chairman, a new vice-chairman, a new sporting director, a new technical director, a new head of recruitment, a new head scout - and Gerrard doesn't know them.If, and when, he asked about budget the chances are that he won't have liked what he heard. Rangers have already said that they had a net spend on players of £20m in the summer, which puts their gross spend close to £40m, if the fees for outgoing players are to be believed.Last time around, when Gerrard took over from the hapless Pedro Caixinha, he could throw out the dross and start again, but it cost a lot of cash and it plunged Rangers into financial challenges.To fuel his regime, Rangers' spent big on transfer fees, in part, but mostly on enormous wages. Immediately, or over time, Allan McGregor replaced Wes Foderingham; Connor Goldson, Nikola Katic, Filip Helander and Leon Balogun were brought in to replace the aforementioned Martin, Bruno Alves and David Bates.Get in touchSend us your views on RangersUnder Caixinha, Rangers had Declan John and Gerrard had Ryan Kent. Steven Davis, Borna Barisic, Jermaine Defoe, Ianis Hagi, Calvin Bassey, Joe Aribo and Kemar Roofe improved things. There were also duds - far too many - but Gerrard was bullet proof.The wage bill kept on rocketing throughout his time. The operating losses soared to fund the vision - in his three full seasons, including the financially wounding Covid era, Rangers recorded operating losses of more than £50m. Celtic's losses across the span covering the pandemic were about £100,000.That latitude does not exist anymore. There are more lines of command at the club. There is a squad that maybe Gerrard didn't fancy and would have wanted to change, but that freedom he had before would not be there now. Thelwell, the sporting director appointed by the owners, signed all of these guys.You could say that Saturday and last summer were the two times Gerrard custard-pied Rangers, but of course there was a third. On a Thursday in October 2021, Gerrard was interviewed after his Rangers team - reigning champions of Scotland - had beaten Brondby 2-0 in the Europe League.That week there'd been speculation linking him with Newcastle, so the rumours were put to him. \"Do I look happy?\" he asked, in a rhetorical sense. \"Do I look settled? Don't ask me silly questions then.\"Five games later he was no longer Rangers manager. He went to Aston Villa and won eight games out of 31 and was sacked with Villa 17th in the Premier League.Later, he went to Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia, got them to sixth in his first season and left by mutual consent after 18 months when his team fell to 12th, just five points above the relegation zone.Gerrard was the manager Rangers wanted, but he's been beaten up since he left Ibrox. There was no guarantee that they'd have been getting the hot property of 2021, the great redeemer who, eventually, stopped Celtic in their tracks.Who they will get is now anybody's guess. The Rangers board will be reeling. Chaos reigns and nobody rules.",

    "body": "7 hours agoHolly HarrisonBBC WalesSouth Wales PoliceThe disgraced rock star from Pontypridd was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for child sex offencesLostprophets singer Ian Watkins has died after being attacked in jail, prison sources have confirmed.West Yorkshire Police said two men aged 25 and 43 had been arrested on suspicion of murder.The disgraced rock star from Pontypridd was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for child sex offences.Watkins, 48, was jailed in December 2013 for a string of child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby.Police said they were called to the prison on Saturday morning to reports of a serious assault on a prisoner, who was pronounced dead at the scene.A Prison Service spokesperson said it was aware of an incident at the prison but was \"unable to comment further while the police investigate\".Watkins was sentenced to 29 years in prison with a further six years on licence, and his two co-defendants, the mothers of children he abused, were jailed for 14 and 17 years.He was previously attacked in prison in August 2023, but his injuries were not life threatening.The attack at Wakefield Prison comes less than two weeks after a report into the facility was published that found violence there had \"increased markedly\".The report from the chief inspector of prisons said: \"Many prisoners told us they felt unsafe, particularly older men convicted of sexual offences who increasingly shared the prison with a growing cohort of younger prisoners.\"Police were called to Wakefield Prison on Saturday morningWatkins admitted the attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13 but pleaded not guilty to rape.He also admitted conspiring to rape a child, three counts of sexual assault involving children, seven involving taking, making or possessing indecent images of children and one of possessing an extreme pornographic image involving a sex act on an animal.Judges rejected an appeal by Watkins in 2014 to reduce the length of his jail term.During sentencing, Mr Justice Royce said the case broke \"new ground\" and \"plunged into new depths of depravity\".\"Any decent person... will experience shock, revulsion and incredulity.\"The judge said Watkins had a \"corrupting influence\", and had shown a \"complete lack of remorse\".Who was Ian Watkins? Getty ImagesWatkins performing in London a few months before his arrest in 2012His trial heard Watkins had used his fame to manipulate and control others, often under the influence of hard drugs, including crystal meth.After Watkins was sentenced, Des Mannion, NSPCC national head of service for Wales, said: \"Watkins used his status and global fame as a means to manipulate people and sexually abuse children.\"But we must nevertheless remember that this case isn't about celebrity, it's about victims. And those victims are children.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondent andNick Edserbusiness reporterDonald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods is \"a typical example of US double standards\", China's government has said.A Commerce Ministry spokesperson also said China could introduce its own unspecified \"countermeasures\" if the US President carries out his threat, adding it was \"not afraid\" of a possible trade war.On Friday, Trump hit back at Beijing's move to tighten its rules for exports of rare earths, accusing China of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\".He also threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping scheduled for later this month.Trump's comments on Friday rattled financial markets, with the S&P 500 share index closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April.The president's words renewed fears of a trade war between the US and China.In May, the two sides had agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods. which had raised the prospect of trade halting between the two countries.This left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a 10% tariff.China's latest remarks – released by the Commerce Ministry in the form of written responses to journalist's questions – echoed language from the height of the recent trade conflict.They criticised US export restrictions on chips and semi-conductors as well as defending China's own export controls on rare earths as \"normal actions\" to safeguard national security and that of all nations.The spokesperson said that for \"a long time\", the US had \"overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures\" and \"adopted discriminatory practices against China\".\"Resorting to tariff threats is not the right way to engage with China,\" the spokesperson said.\"China's position on a tariff war has always been consistent: we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.\"Last week, China announced it was tightening export controls on rare earths and other materials critical for advanced tech manufacturing.This was seen as key move, as the country processes about 90% of the world's rare earths, which are used in goods such as solar panels and smartphones.The recent comments from Washington and Beijing are being seen by some as a means of strengthening positions ahead of future trade talks.It is unclear whether a meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, expected at a summit in South Korea later this month, will still proceed.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporter andHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentA key security adviser had no role in the \"substance or the evidence\" of the collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China, the education secretary has said.The Conservatives have suggested Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's national security adviser, had a role in not giving prosecutors evidence they said they needed to secure convictions.Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry – who both deny the allegations – were dropped last month, prompting criticism from ministers and MPs.Asked about Mr Powell's involvement, Bridget Phillipson told the BBC: \"I can give you that reassurance, he did not have those conversations around the substance or the evidence of the case.\"Phillipson said ministers were \"deeply disappointed that the case hasn't proceeded\" and insisted the Crown Prosecution Service was \"best placed to explain why it was not able to bring forward a prosecution\".Downing Street had previously denied that ministers were involved in the collapse of the case.But in a rare intervention this week, the director of public prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, the head of the CPS, said the trial collapsed because the government did not provide evidence referring to China as a national security threat.The Conservatives have submitted an urgent question in Parliament, asking ministers to address MPs on Monday to explain why the trial collapsed.They have suggested Mr Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence required.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp told the BBC ministers \"must urgently explain why it chose not to disclose the reams of information it has demonstrating China was a threat to national security in the 2021-2023 period\".He said: \"It looks as if Jonathan Powell was behind this decision – and he should resign if he is.\"The prime minister has said the government could only draw on the previous Conservative's position, which designated China an \"epoch-defining challenge\".\"You have to prosecute people on the basis of the circumstances at the time of the alleged offence,\" the prime minister told reporters in India this week.\"So all the focus needs to be on the policy of the Tory government in place then.\"Several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat.They claim there is a document with \"hundreds\" of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence.Sources cited the hack on the Ministry of Defence, which ministers suspected China was behind, as one of many incidents.\"I don't think there is a sane jury in the world that would look at that evidence and conclude China was not a threat,\" a source in the last government said.Former Conservative ministers also point to public statements, including from the former head of MI5 Ken McCallum, who in 2023 said there had been a \"sustained campaign\" of Chinese espionage on a \"pretty epic scale\".The Liberal Democrats said the government's approach to China was \"putting our national security at risk\".The party urged the government to block the planning application for a new Chinese embassy in London.\"Giving the green light to the super embassy being built in the heart of the City of London and above critical data connections would enable Chinese espionage on an industrial scale,\" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Calum Miller said.Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry, were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.Under the Official Secrets Act, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy.However, last month the director of public prosecutions said \"the case could no longer proceed to trial since the evidence no longer met the evidential test\".",

    "body": "The prime minister will attend an international peace summit in Egypt on Monday where the peace plan for Gaza will be signed, Downing Street has said.Sir Keir Starmer will pay \"particular tribute\" in Sharm El-Sheikh to US President Donald Trump, No 10 added.A ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire agreement and hostage return deal brokered by Trump, with the next phases still to be negotiated.  The US president will lead the summit alongside Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi with leaders from more than 20 countries in attendance, a spokesman for al-Sisi said.Under the deal, Hamas has until 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday to release all Israeli hostages - including 20 who are believed to be alive, and the remains of up to 28 deceased hostages.Israel should also release around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while increased amounts of aid should enter the Strip.Many details for the later phases, which would be negotiated after the successful completion of phase one, could be hard to reach agreement on - such as the governance of Gaza, the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal, and the disarming of Hamas.Downing Street said Monday's summit would involve a \"signing ceremony\" for the peace plan, \"marking a historic turning point for the region after two years of conflict and bloodshed\".Sir Keir will thank Egypt, Qatar and Turkey for \"bringing us to this point\" as well as Trump, before calling for continued coordination to secure \"swift progress towards phase two\" of the truce.No 10 added in its statement: \"He will offer the UK's steadfast support and engagement with international partners as we look to secure the ceasefire, get urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza and secure a basis for a lasting peace and security.\"French President Emmanuel Macron will also attend, the Elysee Palace confirmed on Saturday, where he will \"express his full support for the implementation of the agreement\". Confirming the summit late on Saturday, a spokesperson for Egypt's presidency said it was intended to \"end the war in the Gaza Strip, strengthen peace and stability efforts in the Middle East, and open a new page in regional security and stability\".Trump had told reporters at the White House on Friday that he would be travelling to the region on Monday, addressing Israel's parliament the Knesset, before heading to Egypt.He said: \"We have a lot of leaders from all over the world coming too, they've been invited.\"Egypt's foreign ministry had also said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed arrangements for the summit with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty.The ceasefire came into effect after the Israeli government approved the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal on Thursday, following three days of indirect talks in Egypt.The Israeli military said it had partially withdrawn troops from parts of Gaza and pulled back to an agreed position within the territory - though troops still occupy half of the Strip. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the ceasefire marked \" a massive step forward\". When asked whether the UK had a role in the peace plan, she added: \"We do have a role, but of course the role of the US has been critical in this - we can all recognise that.\" Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said the prime minister's visit to Egypt for the Sharm El-Sheikh summit would be a \"photo opportunity\" and the government has \"had no role whatsoever\" in the Gaza ceasefire.\"I think it's extraordinary that Keir Starmer is apparently going to Egypt tomorrow when we've got plenty of domestic issues that he should be resolving,\" she told Kuenssberg. The UK has already said it has \"no plans\" to send British troops to be part of a multinational force that will monitor the latest ceasefire from Israel.The US is moving up to 200 troops already based in the region to what it is calling a civil-military coordination centre in Israel, officials have said, alongside forces from Arab and Muslim countries including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said on Friday the UK would continue to support the peace process in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza.Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 18,000 children, the Hamas-run health ministry says.A previous ceasefire agreement that began in January collapsed after two months when Israel resumed its military offensive, having never got past the first stage of a three-stage plan.",

We cannot accept that. There can be no place for it.\"The education secretary said she had written to university vice-chancellors urging them to take steps to protect Jewish students from harassment.The government said the Union of Jewish Students will deliver 600 training sessions to help university staff support students, identify harassment and hate.A £4m fund will support projects that teach pupils and students how to identify misinformation online and promote interfaith understanding.Separately, £2m is being put towards a scheme to teach secondary school pupils in England about the Holocaust - the genocide of Jews during World War Two.Patel said the Conservatives stood by the right to protest and freedom of expression.But Patel told Laura Kuenssberg that pro-Palestinian marches taking place in London were \"ugly protests\" which demonstrated \"division and hatred\" in our society.\"Look at what happened on the streets of London yesterday. Look at the level of hatred that was demonstrated on the streets of London to Britain's Jewish community,\" she said.Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in central London on Saturday, as well as a small group of pro-Israeli counter-protesters.During the march, which came a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect in Gaza, slogans such as \"stop arming Israel\" and \"free Palestine\" could be seen.The Metropolitan Police said it had made 14 arrests for offences including breaching Public Order Act conditions, affray and supporting a proscribed group.",

Is there more illness than normal?Data collection from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows Rhinovirus – what many of us would call the common cold – has been on the increase in recent weeks and seems to be the most common cause of illness at the moment.Covid is also doing the rounds, driven by two new variants – XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. But there is already a high degree of immunity built up in the population meaning, for most, it's a fairly mild infection.There are signs flu may be on the rise too – there has been an increase in the 15-25 age group over the past week - while RSV, which can cause serious illness in young children, also tends to take off in the autumn.\"There is often, although not always, a pattern,\" says Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA. \"You tend to see Rhinovirus take off first and then RSV,\" he explains. \"Flu tends to come later in December and January. But that's not always the case – and certainly the pandemic disrupted the traditional seasonal trends. What we've seen in the last year or so is those trends return to something like normal.\"He says the levels of illnesses at the moment are not particularly high.\"Covid is above baseline and there's a lot of Rhinovirus around. The uptick in flu in that younger age group has perhaps come a little bit earlier than we would expect, but it is still at a low level.\"Is it a cold, flu or Covid?The most common symptoms, according to the NHS, are:ColdsSymptoms appear graduallyMostly affect nose and throatEarly sign - pressure in your earsChestier, mucus coughFluComes on suddenlyFeel wiped outFever, muscle aches, exhaustionNeed bed restDry coughCovidTypical flu symptomsLoss of taste of smellDiarrhoea or tummy upsetMany of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid overlap.How can you protect yourself?Respiratory infections can, of course, be really dangerous for vulnerable people - in a bad winter tens of thousands of people can die of flu.But there is nothing to suggest the respiratory viruses circulating now are causing more serious illness this year in otherwise healthy people. \"We all react in different ways – and we don't really understand why,\" admits Prof Ball. \"Of course, age and fitness have a lot to do with it, but sometimes it is just your individual genetics or how tired and rundown you may be, or when you were last exposed to that particular virus.\"In terms of protecting yourself, the most important step to take, if you are eligible, is to get vaccinatinated. Shots are being offered for flu, Covid and RSV to protect those who are most at-risk of serious illness, which includes older people and those with certain health conditions.If you are ill, UKHSA says you can help protect others by washing your hands regularly, especially after coughing or sneezing, staying at home if you can and consider wearing a mask if you do have to go into public places.Prof Ball says it is right to take precautions to try to protect vulnerable people, but adds if you are healthy and young or of working age, getting the odd respiratory illness is pretty inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing.\"Most people will get one or two respiratory infections every year. In some ways, it's a good thing when you are a child or healthy adult.\"By getting exposed you are building up your immunity through natural infection - so when you are older you hopefully have enough immunity to not get severely ill.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "4 days agoJacob PanonsSouth EastUniversity of KentBel'kovich A Pit is close to the Moon's north pole and therefore more likely to be a source of waterArtificial intelligence (AI) has been used to find two previously undiscovered possible cave entrances on the Moon, which could support human survival on future space missions.Daniel Le Corre, a PhD researcher at the University of Kent, surveyed less than 0.3% of the lunar surface before finding the two pits.The South Marius Hills Pit, which the university said was previously overlooked by researchers, is in an area thought to be rich in lava tubes, while the Bel'kovich A Pit is close to the Moon's north pole and more likely to be a source of water.The pits were detected using an AI model that was trained to scan publicly available Nasa images and identify pits based on their distinctive shape.The AI model is named Essa, which is short for entrances to sub-surface areas and a nod to the Cornish name of Mr Le Corre's hometown, Saltash.Mr Le Corre said: \"Thanks to Essa, we can now analyse volumes of space data at speeds that would have been unachievable manually, thus accelerating the search for the pits that will be the most favourable for future exploration or habitation.\"The university said the pits may be connected to underground cave networks that could provide natural shelter from harmful radiation and micrometeorite impacts, as well as harbour water ice.\"It's this which makes them of interest to scientists as good bases for humans exploring or living on the Moon, and hopefully one day even Mars,\" a university spokesperson said.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "10 hours agoAlice CuddyTel Aviv andJaroslav LukivTel Aviv crowd boos as Witkoff thanks NetanyahuHundreds of thousands of people have held a rally in Tel Aviv, ahead of the expected release of Israeli hostages by Hamas.Addressing the crowds, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said the hostages \"are coming home\" and praised Donald Trump for making a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal possible.In Gaza, Palestinian officials said about 500,000 people had returned to northern Gaza - which lies in ruins - in the past two days, following the withdrawal of Israeli troops.Meanwhile Egypt confirmed it would host a summit on Monday to finalise an agreement aimed at ending the war.More than 20 leaders including Trump would attend the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, an Egyptian presidential spokesperson said. French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are confirmed to be travelling to Egypt on Monday.Trump is expected to visit Israel on Monday before heading to Egypt. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner also addressed the Tel Aviv rally on Saturday.Three members of Qatar's top administrative body - the Amiri Diwan - died in a car crash near Sharm El-Sheikh, the Qatari embassy in Egypt said on Sunday. Qatar has been mediating in the Gaza crisis.Under the ceasefire and hostage release deal announced on Thursday, Hamas was given 72 hours - until 12:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday - to release all the 48 hostages it is still holding after two years of war, 20 of whom are assumed to be alive.A top Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told AFP news agency that \"according to the signed agreement, the prisoner exchange is set to begin on Monday morning as agreed, and there are no new developments on this matter\".He said Hamas militants on the ground had not yet notified the movement's leadership about the logistics of the handover.Aviv Havron, whose family members were murdered and others kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas, told the BBC in Tel Aviv: \"It's so important for the community... that they come back. Without this, we can't restart our lives.\"My sisters and two brothers in law were murdered. Seven of my family members were kidnapped - my older sister was kidnapped, her daughter, her grandchildren. Four bodies of Be'eri [community] members are still in Gaza,.\"ReutersCrowds at the Tel Aviv rally unfurled a banner praising TrumpShulamit and David Ginat, who also attended the Tel Aviv rally, told the BBC all the hostages must be saved. \"They're our brothers and sisters. We want to heal again. We want to stop the war, stop the pain and heal again,\" Shulamit said.Many in the crowd yelled \"Thank you, Trump!\" - but also booed when Witkoff mentioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Speaking just afterward, the couple said they were angry at him over the failure to prevent the 7 October attack, the war and the failure to bring the hostages home sooner.\"He wants to continue the war only because he wants to stay prime minister,\" David said.Hamas mobilises fighters in Gaza as fears of internal violence mountHospital prepares for freed Israeli hostagesWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?What we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementIn Gaza, Hamas has called up thousands of fighters to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends and fears of internal violence. There have also been reports of armed clashes between Hamas and Gaza clans.Displaced Palestinians have continued to move north in Gaza in large numbers, in many cases arriving to find their homes destroyed.\"There is no house anymore. Everything is gone,\" lawyer Mosa Aldous said over the phone from Gaza City.Watch: Palestinians crowd around trucks to grab aid in Khan YounisRaja Salmi, 52, told AFP she reached Gaza City's Rimal neighbourhood to find her home also gone.\"I stood before it and cried. All those memories are now just dust,\" she said.Under the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, the amount of aid entering Gaza is due to be scaled up but the World Food Programme (WFP) told the BBC that a surge of aid lorries had \"not yet\" entered Gaza, reporting only two to three lorries entering the territory daily.With full access, WFP, a UN agency, said it intended to restore its regular food distribution system, boosting aid through 145 distribution points across Gaza.Cogat, the Israeli military body overseeing the entry of aid into Gaza, said 500 trucks had entered on Thursday of which around 300 were distributed inside Gaza by the UN and other organisations.A recent report by the world's leading hunger monitor Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), backed by the UN, estimated that 500,000 people in Gaza - a quarter of the territory's population - were suffering from famine.Israel has repeatedly denied that starvation is taking place in Gaza, and Netanyahu has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas.About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 on southern Israel.Israel responded by launching a military offensive that has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

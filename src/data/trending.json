    "body": "The Kenyan government has confirmed that 21 people have died following a landslide in the western part of the country after heavy rainfall. Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said the bodies had been transferred to a nearby airstrip after the landslide in Marakwet East late on Friday night.He said on X that more than 30 people were still unaccounted for after being reported missing by their families while 25 people with serious injuries had been airlifted to receive further medical attention.The Kenyan Red Cross, which is helping to coordinate rescue efforts, said that the most affected areas are still not accessible by road due to mudslides and flash flooding. The Kenyan government paused the search and rescue operation on Saturday evening but said it would resume on Sunday.\"Preparation to supply more food and non-food relief items to the victims is underway,\" said Murkomen, adding: \"Military and police choppers are on standby to transport the items.\"Kenya is in its second rainy season when it usually experiences a few weeks of wet weather compared to a heavier, more prolonged period earlier in the year. The government has urged people living near seasonal rivers as well as areas that experienced landslides on Friday to move to safer ground.Meanwhile, flash flooding and landslides in Uganda, near the border with Kenya, have killed a number of people since last Wednesday.On Saturday, the Uganda Red Cross said another mudslide had occurred in Kapsomo village in the east of the country, destroying a house and killing four people inside. The Red Cross said floods had severely affected most villages near riverbanks in the Bulambuli District. It said continuous heavy rainfall had caused the River Astiri and the River Sipi \"to overflow, resulting in widespread destruction of homes, crop fields, and community infrastructure\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoMultiple papers lead with the ongoing fallout from King Charles III's decision to strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles and evict him from the Royal Lodge. The Sunday Mirror leads with calls from some US congressmen for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to face a US committee investigating the Jeffrey Epstein case. The former prince has consistently denied wrongdoing. The Duke of Sussex has backed the King's move, the Sun reports. The newspaper says it understands that California-based Prince Harry \"supports Charles ending Andrew's allowance\". The train stabbing in Cambridgeshire leads the Sunday Times, with two people arrested. \"Multiple passengers are rushed to hospital after terrifying ordeal\", the paper reports, adding \"armed police were deployed\" to Huntingdon train station. \"Hundreds of foreign killers slip into UK,\" reads the headline on the Sunday Express.  The paper writes its analysis showed hundreds of \"murderers and rapists\" were identified after a police check on foreign nationals carried out by the Criminal Records Office between 2022 and 2024.Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph reports Chancellor Rachel Reeves is considering doubling council tax rates on the highest tax bands, set to impact \"more than a million homes\", in the November Budget. The paper says it is part of Reeves's efforts to \"find £30bn to fill a black hole in the public finances\". Leader of the Opposition Kemi Badenoch \"warned the proposal would 'hamper' pensioners in more valuable properties who live on fixed incomes,\" according to the paper.\"Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves will face an angry revolt if the chancellor breaks Labour's manifesto pledge and raises income tax at the Budget,\" the Independent writes, citing unnamed senior ministers who have spoken to the paper. It follows reports the Treasury is considering raising income tax by 2p, the paper says.Two estate agents reportedly told the chancellor she would need a licence to rent out her home, the Mail on Sunday reports. Reeves told prime minister Sir Keir Starmer \"she didn't know she needed permit to let house\", the paper says. It quotes a source who says Reeves and her husband allegedly \"approached a blue-chip estate agency Knight Frank about managing the property – and were warned about the need for the licence\". The Observer's front page is dominated by climate features and analysis, making references to the Conference of the Parties (COP) climate summit that's due to take place in Brazil in November. The lead stories are \"why climate action is the real growth story\" and \"the failure of the UN talking shop\". \"Kids in Yorkshire have the worst teeth in the country\", writes the Daily Star. Its headline piece focuses on a national study showing six out of the top 10 towns and cities for most teeth extractions involving children aged five to nine are based in Yorkshire.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Thousands of military homes across the UK will be modernised, refurbished or rebuilt over the next decade under a £9bn government plan to improve defence housing.The Ministry of Defence's new housing strategy will see improvements made to almost all of its 47,700 homes for military families in what Defence Secretary John Healey said will be the \"biggest renewal of Armed Forces housing in more than 50 years\".The plan is in response to consistent complaints from serving personnel about the state of their accommodation. In 2022, dozens of members and their families told the BBC they were having to live in damp, mould-infested housing without heating.A Commons defence committee last year found two-thirds of homes for service families needed \"extensive refurbishment or rebuilding\" to meet modern standards.Under the new strategy, service family accommodation (SFA) will be refurbished with new kitchens, bathrooms and heating systems.About 14,000 will receive either \"substantial refurbishment\" or be completely replaced.The plans are part of the government's wider defence housing strategy, to be published on Monday. A total of £4bn in funding to tackle the housing problem had already been announced. The government says it has also identified surplus MoD land which could be used to build 100,000 new homes for civilian and military families.Healey said: \"This is a new chapter - a decisive break from decades of underinvestment, with a building programme to back Britain's military families and drive economic growth across the country.\"Almost three years ago, the BBC was contacted by families in military accommodation in Sandhurst who had been living without heating for days.\"We're at breaking point and something has to change. The system is broken,\" they said at the time.In response to the story, the MoD said it was working with its contractors to improve the service. But a report released in December last year found those problems \"still exist\". \"It is shocking that until a policy change in 2022, it was considered acceptable to house families in properties known to have damp and mould,\" the report said.The MoD last year announced it would acquire 36,347 military houses from property company Annington Homes for nearly £6bn, reversing a privatisation deal struck in 1996 under the Conservative government.The deal would save millions in rent and maintenance costs, the MoD said, money that would be put towards fixing military accommodation.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent, in KyivUkraine's top military commander has admitted his soldiers are facing \"difficult conditions\" defending Pokrovsk - a key eastern front-line town - against massed Russian forces.Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops were facing a \"multi-thousand enemy\" force - but denied Russian claims that they were surrounded or blocked.He confirmed that elite special forces had been deployed to protect key supply lines which, army sources said, were all under Russian fire.The defence ministry in Moscow reported that Ukrainian troops were surrendering and 11 of their special forces had been killed after landing by helicopter, something denied by Kyiv.In Saturday's posts on Telegram, Gen Syrskyi said he was \"back on the front\" to personally hear the latest reports from military commanders on the ground in the eastern Donetsk region.In a short video, Syrskyi is seen studying battlefield maps with other commanders, including the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov.It is unclear when and where the footage was recorded.Ukrainian media earlier reported that Budanov was in the region to personally oversee the operation by the special forces.The deployment of special forces suggests officials in Kyiv are determined to try to hold on to the town, which Russia has been trying to seize for more than a year.Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Saturday Ukrainian troops \"have improved [their] tactical position\" in Pokrovsk - but the situation remained \"difficult and dynamic\".Late on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that the defence of Pokrovsk was a \"priority\".There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town to the west of the Russian-seized regional capital of Donetsk. Images shared with news agencies late on Friday appear to show a Ukrainian Black Hawk helicopter deploying about 10 troops near Pokrovsk, although the location and date could not be verified.Russia's defence ministry said it had thwarted the deployment of Ukrainian military intelligence special forces north-west of the town, killing all 11 troops who landed by helicopter.DeepState, a Ukrainian open-source monitoring group, estimates about half of Pokrovsk is a so-called \"grey zone\" where neither side is in full control.A military source in Donetsk told the BBC that Ukrainian forces were not surrounded but their supply lines were under fire from Russian troops.The US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had \"marginally advanced\" during recent counter-attacks north of Pokrovsk, but said the town was \"mainly a contested 'grey zone'\".Moscow wants Kyiv to cede the Donetsk and the neighbouring Luhansk regions (collectively known as Donbas) as part of a peace deal, including the parts it currently does not control.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014.Pokrovsk is a key transport and supply hub whose capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.But Kyiv also believes its capture would help Russia in its efforts to persuade the US that its military campaign is succeeding - and, therefore, that the West should acquiesce to its demands.Washington has grown increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin's failure to move forward with peace negotiations - culminating in US President Donald Trump placing sanctions on two largest Russian oil producers and axing plans for a summit with President Vladimir Putin.Zelensky has publicly agreed with Trump's proposal for a ceasefire that would freeze the war along the current front lines. Putin is refusing to do so, insisting on his maximalist pre-invasion demands that Kyiv and its Western allies see as a de facto capitulation of Ukraine.Additional reporting by Jaroslav Lukiv",

    "body": "8 days agoAndrew RogersBBC NewsbeatMicrosoftThe Halo series has gone to new worlds, and now it's going to new consoles tooMicrosoft is taking one of its most popular and recognisable game series to a rival console for the first time.Halo, a sci-fi shooter fronted by the armour-clad Master Chief, is heading to PlayStation 5 next year, something that would have been unthinkable for gaming fans when the title first launched in 2001.A remake of the first game Halo: Combat Evolved has been announced for Microsoft's own Xbox hardware, as well as for Sony's PS5, under the name Halo: Campaign Evolved.It will also launch on PC, and will be playable on mobile phones and tablets through Microsoft's cloud streaming technology.It's the latest sign Microsoft is moving away from the traditional approach of console makers keeping their own franchises and characters as exclusives.The end of console wars?Halo is often credited with helping Microsoft first break into the gaming market with its original Xbox, despite arriving after consoles from Nintendo and Sony were already popular.But while Microsoft has rapidly expanded its presence in the industry, buying up several rival studios - including Call of Duty maker Activision for $69bn (£56bn) - it's struggled to convince gamers to buy its latest consoles.Globally, the PlayStation 5 has reportedly outsold Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X consoles by more than two to one. Nintendo's hybrid Switch console has been even more successful.Microsoft has instead been pushing a strategy of being able to play its games in more places, including on PCs, tablets, phones, and its new handheld console, the ROG Xbox Ally.This has included promoting its subscription service Game Pass, where a monthly charge gets players access to a library of games, similar in style to services like Netflix and Disney+.Increasing the Halo: ReachWhile there's long been rivalry between PlayStation and Xbox players, some fans of the Halo series are happy to see it reach more people. YouTuber Kara, who streams under the name @Eldeeable, tells BBC Newsbeat that Halo's been a big part of her life. \"Combat Evolved was one of the first games I ever played on Xbox,\" she says. \"I played it with my little brother split-screen and I loved it.\" She says the announcement is \"massive\" and \"broke the internet a little bit\". @EldeeableKara, 29, says Halo has been a big part of her life, growing up as an \"Xbox girly\"Some Xbox owners have criticised Microsoft for not keeping Halo as an exclusive game, but it reflects a broader move away from exclusivity - with PlayStation releasing games from its The Last Of Us and Horizon series on PC, and even Nintendo making some games with its characters available on mobile phones.For Kara, this shouldn't be seen as a bad thing.\"I know there's a bit of controversy about it coming to PlayStation, but I don't see any reason why it should be like that at all\", she says. \"I just think it's a win for all gamers.\" The game's executive producer Damon Conn agrees, promising that the remake will appeal to old and new fans.\"At its heart, Halo is about connection, we're thrilled to meet a new generation of players on their platforms of choice to fall in love with Halo the same way we did,\" he says.\"We're not trying to rewrite Halo's legacy - we're trying to immerse you in it like never before.\"Additional reporting by Georgia Levy-Collins and Peter Gillibrand.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.Related topics ",

Andrew has always denied wrongdoing.At least four Democrat members of the House Oversight Committee have since renewed their calls for Andrew to testify - although the panel is controlled by Republicans, who have not indicated they would support the move.Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC: \"If he wants to clear his name, if he wants to do right by the victims, he will come forward\".Andrew could appear remotely, have a lawyer present and could speak to the panel privately, Subramanyam said.\"Frankly, Andrew's name has come up many times from the victims,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday. \"So he clearly has knowledge of what happened and we just want him to come forward and tell us what he knows.\"He added: \"No matter who it is - American or not - everyone should be looked at.\"Fellow committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi told BBC Newsnight he would be willing to formally summon Andrew with a subpoena - although he conceded this would be difficult to enforce while he was outside of the US. Everything we know about Andrew losing titles and Windsor mansionVirginia Giuffre's family speak to BBC: \"She'd be so proud\"Read the King's statement in fullWatch: Question Time audience reacts to newsIs this finally rock bottom for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?Why Sarah Ferguson, Beatrice and Eugenie can't escape the taint of family scandalWhere does the King get his money?He said on Friday: \"However, if Andrew wishes to come to the United States or he's here, then he's subject to the jurisdiction of the US Congress, and I would expect him to testify.\"He added: \"At the end of the day, we want to know exactly what happened, not just to give justice to the survivors, but to prevent this from ever happening again.\"\"Come clean. Come before the US Congress, voluntarily testify. Don't wait for a subpoena. Come and testify and tell us what you know.\"Congressman Stephen Lynch also told the BBC hearing from Andrew \"might be helpful in getting justice for these survivors\" but said the committee would be unable to subpoena him \"as the situation stands\".Meanwhile, Liz Stein - one of Epstein's accusers - said Andrew should \"take some initiative\" and help US investigators.She told BBC Breakfast on Saturday: \"A lot of us are curious as to why he's unwilling to cooperate and be questioned about his involvement with Epstein.\"\"If he has nothing to hide, then why is he hiding?\"\"We know he had a longstanding friendship with Epstein and that he was in his social circle - so he may have seen things during his involvement with Epstein that he could speak to.\"Another of Epstein's accusers, Anouska De Georgiou, likewise told Newsnight Andrew should appear before Congress, saying \"it would be appropriate for him to be treated the same as anybody else would be treated\".Getty ImagesLiz Stein said Andrew should step in and help investigators It comes after UK trade minister Chris Bryant told the BBC Andrew should go to the US to answer questions about Epstein's crimes if invited, \"just as with any ordinary member of the public\".Meanwhile, the police watchdog said it had approached the Metropolitan Police to ask whether there are matters it should be looking into, in light of media reports about Andrew.The Independent Office for Police Conduct said it had contacted Scotland Yard's Directorate of Professional Standards last week - which oversees internal investigations into misconduct - and had not yet received any referrals.Reports emerged in mid-October that Andrew sought to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection in 2011. He has not commented on the reports, while the Metropolitan Police previously said it was \"actively\" looking into them.Separately, new court documents published in the US on Friday showed that Andrew wrote in an email in 2010 that it would be \"good to catch up in person\" with Epstein, after he was released from prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor.The pair were then pictured together in Central Park in New York in December 2010, in a meeting that Andrew later told the BBC was to break off their friendship.Andrew's ties to Epstein were at the centre of Thursday's decision, with the Palace announcement stating: \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\"\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"In recent weeks, pressure had increased on the monarchy to resolve the issue of Charles's brother.In early October, emails which re-emerged from 2011 showed Andrew in contact with Epstein months after he claimed their friendship had ended.A posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre was also released - repeating allegations that, as a teenager, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three separate occasions, claims he has always denied.And earlier this week, the King was heckled about the matter.Although Andrew denies the accusations, the Royal Family considers there have been \"serious lapses of judgement\" in his behaviour.As well as losing his titles and honours, he was ordered to move out of his Windsor mansion - Royal Lodge - and into a property on the King's Norfolk estate, paid for by the monarch.The BBC understands that he will not have to move out immediately, and could move to Sandringham as late as the new year.On Saturday, a black Land Rover with a number plate ending DOY was seen leaving Bishops Gate near Royal Lodge just before 08:00 GMT.Only a driver was in the vehicle as it left the grounds of Windsor Great Park. Andrew has previously been pictured driving a vehicle with the same private number plate.",

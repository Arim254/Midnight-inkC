    "body": "'I felt really lonely': Joe Swash on being a young dad1 hour agoShola LeeBBC NewsBBC Studios/Eddie Hutton-MillsIn his new documentary, Joe Swash meets young fathers like Wyatt, who is 18\"I remember just feeling so scared and vulnerable,\" says actor and TV presenter Joe Swash of becoming a father in his twenties.Swash found out he was going to be a dad at the age of 24. He says it was a life-changing experience he felt \"grossly underprepared\" for, adding that \"there was no one really for me to talk to\".The presenter says his and his former partner's conversations with midwives were \"rightly\" centred on the mum-to-be, but he felt lonely and no one had asked him how he was doing. There were no father-and-child support groups and having lost his own father aged 11, Swash felt he had no positive male role models to turn to.He worried about small things like how to change a nappy or how hot his baby's bottle had to be, and felt everyone was \"looking down\" at him for being a young dad.It was this feeling of being \"completely unsupported\" as a young father that he explores in the BBC documentary Joe Swash: Forgotten Young Dads.In the film, the former EastEnders star meets four young fathers and explores some of the problems they face, from social stereotypes to a lack of parental support services.Last year, dads were an average of 34 years old when their child was born, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. The fathers in the BBC documentary, meanwhile, are all 18 to 22.Kevin Stoodley is founder of North East Young Dads and Lads (NEYDL), a charity that provides parenting and community support for young fathers.Stoodley says that in his 27 years as a community youth worker, he has \"never encountered a community as stigmatised\" as young dads.'Absent dads'Swash says that as a young dad, he \"really struggled\" with judgement from others and felt that people viewed him as \"irresponsible\".He adds that young dads often get a \"bad reputation\" and are characterised as \"absent\".\"I'd love to find out how many of them 'absent dads' are absent because they wanted to be, or because they were so vulnerable, scared and frightened that they had nowhere to go and had no support,\" he explains.Swash says society needs to \"readjust\" how it sees young dads. Stoodley agrees, saying that young fathers have historically been wrongfully \"perceived as being feckless, disinterested and in some cases, a risk to their children\".He adds that some of the young dads he's met face judgement from their own communities and are \"told that they've ruined their life\".'Alpha male'BBC Studios/Eddie Hutton-MillsSwash urges young dads to speak to each other and met four young  men navigating parenthood during his documentaryFor Swash, having positive male role models is key in supporting young dads.After his father died, Swash says he was \"craving, as a young man, just to have a male role model put their arm around me and look after me - whether that was a negative role model or a positive role model, I was just desperate to have some role model\".\"If all we're seeing is negative role models being put on social media and on TV, you can be mistaken in thinking that's the sort of man you want to be\", he adds.Swash explains: \"We can all get in fights down the streets and go on boys' holidays, but not everyone can change a nappy and love and nurture and cherish a child and for me, that's an alpha male\".Stoodley says having positive male role models is \"super important\" in helping young fathers navigate their new roles.The founder says NEYDL also looks to address toxic masculinity and steer young men on the path of being a good role model.Recently, Stephen Graham, who starred in Adolescence, which explored toxic masculinity, announced a new book calling for fathers to have more open conversations with their sons.'Fall through the net'Swash says the lack of support available for young dads is \"pretty unbelievable\".In the course of making the documentary, Swash notes that he and the team struggled to find support services for young men and he says there should be a service available to all young fathers.Services that do exist, like NEYDL, provide parenting and community support to young dads. However, Stoodley says there needs to be more national investment.Swash adds that support can mean simple things like having more nappy-changing stations in men's toilets, or bigger shifts: \"Fundamentally, I think society has got to change the way they look at young dads and young families.\"\"I felt really lonely,\" Swash adds of his own experiences as a young dad.Swash, a parent to six children, says he's \"proud\" to have been a young dad and loves his kids \"with a passion\". However, he acknowledges a lot of young men are \"not as lucky\" as him and encourages young dads to have conversations with each other and to \"not suffer in silence\".You can watch Joe Swash: Forgotten Young Dads on Monday 20 October at 20:00 BST on BBC Three, and on BBC iPlayer.More weekend picks",

    "body": "The Spanish town of Terrassa in north-eastern Catalonia has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters to prevent potentially sinister \"rituals\" during Halloween.All requests for the fostering or adoption of the felines will be denied from 6 October to 10 November to protect them from being hurt or used as props, said the local animal welfare service. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque told broadcaster RTVE that adoption requests for black cats usually increase around Halloween.While black cats are often associated with witchcraft and seen as bad luck in Western culture, many other cultures, including Japan and Egypt, see them as symbols of prosperity and fortune.Terassa's city council said there had been no record of cruelty towards black cats in the town, however there have been incidents in other areas and the decision was taken after warnings from animal welfare groups.\"We try to prevent people from adopting because it's trendy or impulsively. And in cases like these, which we know exist, to prevent any macabre practices,\" Duque said.Terrassa is home to more than 9,800 cats, according to local authorities, and the town's adoption centre houses around 100 felines, 12 of which are black, the Catalan News Agency reported.The city council emphasised that the measure is \"temporary and exceptional\" and represents an extra precaution for animal welfare, but did not rule out repeating the ban in the future.Exceptions during the ban period will be assessed individually by the adoption centre and normal fostering requests will resume after Halloween.",

    "body": "4 hours agoIan AikmanReutersHamas says it has been working to recover the remains of dead hostages beneath the rubble left by Israeli attacks on the Gaza StripIsrael has received two bodies from Gaza that Hamas says are hostages, the Israeli prime minister's office has said.The remains, which were transferred via the Red Cross to Israeli forces, were transported to Israel and will be formally identified. Hamas earlier said the bodies had been recovered in the Palestinian territory on Saturday.Prior to Saturday, the remains of 10 of 28 deceased hostages had been returned to Israel.The delay has caused outrage in Israel, as the terms of last week's ceasefire deal stipulated the release from Gaza of all hostages, living and dead. Hamas says it has struggled to find the remaining bodies under rubble.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has ordered the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to remain closed until further notice, and said its reopening would be considered based on the return of the final hostage remains and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.The Rafah crossing is vital for Palestinians who need medical assistance to leave, and for thousands of others to return.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".But the US has downplayed suggestions that the delay amounts to a breach of the ceasefire deal, which President Donald Trump claimed as a major victory on a visit to Israel and Egypt last week.The text of the deal has not been published, but a leaked version that was seen in Israeli media appeared to account for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult, as air strikes on Gaza have reduced many buildings to rubble, and Israel does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into the territory.UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. Israel's military confirmed the identity of the tenth deceased hostage returned by Hamas on Friday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) named him as Eliyahu Margalit, whose body was taken from Nir Oz kibbutz after he was killed on 7 October 2023.Hostages and Missing Families ForumIsrael's Hostages and Missing Families Forum described Mr Margalit as \"a cowboy at heart\" who managed a horse stables for many yearsAlso as part of the deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. The bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.Separately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire. The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza. There are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report as \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editor andJosh MartinBusiness reporterAll 1,287 Betfred shops could disappear from the UK High Street if Chancellor Rachel Reeves hikes taxes on gambling firms, the company's co-founder and chairman has told the BBC.Fred Done, who set up Betfred in 1967 with his brother, said a closure of that size would put 7,500 jobs at risk.The billionaire businessman said tax rises were the \"biggest threat\" to the industry in his 57 years. It echoes similar warnings from other gambling brands.Increasing taxes on betting firms in the Budget has been suggested to the chancellor. She recently told ITV: \"I do think there is a case for gambling firms paying more… they should pay their fair share of taxes and we will make sure that happens.\"Reeves has been encouraged by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to increase taxes on the gambling sector and use the revenue from that to reduce child poverty.The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank estimated over the summer that additional taxes on the industry, as high as 50%, could raise £3.2bn.At the time the Betting and Gaming Council, which represents gambling companies, called Brown's plan \"economically reckless\", saying it would push gamblers into the black market.Betting companies have resisted calls for taxes to rise. Up to 200 William Hill retail outlets could close if the industry faces higher taxes, its owner Evoke said earlier this month.Betfred's Mr Done said that if taxes on UK gambling companies increased he would also feel compelled to close his High Street shops. \"It [tax] doesn't even need to go up to 50%. If it went up to anywhere like 40% or even 35% there is no profit in the business. We would have to close it down. I'm talking job losses. We're talking probably 7,500,\" he said.He said 300 of his shops were \"currently losing money\" and claimed a 5% increase on gambling taxes would raise that number to 430.\"Once the [UK] industry is closed down, it's gone. People will still bet, but they'll bet offshore with it. There's plenty of bookmakers offshore who happen to take the bets, who don't pay anything to this country,\" he said.Punters' winnings from gambling are not taxed in the UK, nor is VAT charged on bets. However, the gambling industry pays extra taxes, including:a tax of 21% on online casino gaming stakesduty of 20% on slots and gaming machinesgeneral betting duty on sports fixtures of 15% general betting duty on horseracing of 25%Mr Done said recent increases in employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and the minimum wage had already added £20m to his company's costs.He agreed that, like with banking or buying clothes, customers are increasingly going online, making it inevitable to close betting shops.Rival firm Paddy Power on Thursday said it would close 57 shops across the UK and Republic of Ireland, citing increasing cost pressures and challenging market conditions.\"Slowly it will go online, but we're talking, without tax increases, we've still got probably 20 years of life on the High Street,\" said Mr Done. \"And you know, the UK High Street is being decimated with closures.\"In its most recent annual results, Betfred took in nearly £1bn of revenue, but made an operating profit of just £500,000 after a series of writedowns on its assets.The family-owned company has bases in the UK, Gibraltar, the US and South Africa, with investment in both online gambling and High Street sports betting.Critics point to the social and financial harm caused by gambling. Office for Health Improvement and Disparities research from 2023 estimated the excess costs of harmful gambling to be between £1bn and £1.77bn.Prof Ashwin Kumar, director of research and policy at the IPPR, said higher taxes were needed on the industry, particularly for online betting, to reflect the negative consequences gambling has on some people.\"We know that most of the profits made by gambling companies come from a very small number of gamblers, many of whom are at risk of serious harm. And so we think that the duties should be higher, just like tobacco and alcohol.\"But Mr Done argues that UK-based, High Street betting shops provide better safeguards for people with gambling problems, as well as tax revenues, than online and offshore rivals.As to whether he thinks his appeal to keep taxes as they are will win over the chancellor, Mr Done said \"we're 10 to one against\", which suggests it's odds on that many betting shops will close.An HMT spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on speculation around future changes to tax policy.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterPrince Andrew's removal from the last vestiges of royal life has not only reshaped his future - it's sending ripples through his family too.His ex-wife has now lost her duchess title and will simply be known as Sarah Ferguson.Their daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, will continue to have the title of princess as scandal surrounds their parents.Prince Andrew lost use of his Duke of York title over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.So, what does life after the royal shake up look like for the women of the York Family?For Ferguson, 66, the change will be the most visible.For all these years, she has kept the courtesy royal divorcee title Sarah, Duchess of York. Now, she reverts to her maiden name of Ferguson.And while arguably we've always referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer said that will \"no doubt\" have an impact.\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title – even her Twitter bio is @SarahTheDuchess.\"But the loss of her title may impact her much less than the scandal she's facing separately about her own links with Epstein.Accuser's brother urges King to strip Andrew of prince titleSarah Ferguson dropped from multiple charities over Epstein emailAfter all those scandals, why did Andrew quit his titles now?Last month, several charities dropped her as patron or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\"I think as far as Sarah is concerned, her own recent controversy involving the email she is said to have sent Epstein is what has had the biggest impact for her of late,\" said royal commentator Victoria Murphy.\"Prior to that, she had sidestepped the firing line of the controversy around Epstein and I think may have continued to do so, albeit without calling herself Duchess of York, had that not happened.\"Away from her philanthropy, Ferguson also has various business ventures.And these, too, are more likely to be affected by the Epstein controversy than any change in title, says Murphy.\"I would say it's likely they will be impacted by the revaluations of her own contact with Epstein, in the same way her charity work was and the fact that charities didn't want to be associated with her.\"But Ferguson has been a great survivor in royal circles. She's kept bouncing back.Even though she split from Prince Andrew more than three decades ago, she has remained his strong supporter and still lives in his Windsor estate.The Christmas before last, she was back in the royal fold, joining a royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham for the first time in decades, despite the fact that she and her ex-husband were not working royals or allowed to be part of official royal events.That ability to bounce back may help her this time too.\"She's the ultimate survivor and master of reinvention,\" said royal author Katie Nicholls.\"Not only has she been reaccepted by the public, but the late Queen Elizabeth II brought her back into the fold, and Charles is also very fond of her.\"Nicholls argues that over the years Ferguson has been through \"much worse\" and won't be too impacted by the loss of her title.\"Having been a royal outcast for all these decades, she's learnt not to attach too much weight to things like that.\"For the couple's two daughters, Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, there's no formal change.They will still be known as princesses, which they have been entitled to since birth.There is also no change to the line of succession.Andrew remains eighth in line to the crown, followed by his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, in ninth and twelfth place respectively.But in reality their positions are \"low down\" and will likely become much further down as time goes on, says Murphy.\"So practically, their positions have little meaning for the future,\" she says.King Charles III's closest family and line of successionBeatrice and Eugenie are also currently non-working royals, and while they do sometimes take on roles – Princess Eugenie was recently announced as a mentor for the King's Foundation's 35 under 35 network, for example - Murphy also says she \"can't see a world\" in which they would step up into royal duties in any official way.\"I don't think that was ever really on the cards, and I certainly don't see it as an option,\" she said.They have also benefited from all of the contacts their parents have made over the years, says Palmer. And while Andrew still remains a prince, losing the dukedom could have a knock-on impact there.Prince Andrew will also no longer join the King and the rest of the royal family at Christmas at Sandringham, but it's possible his daughters will still attend, says Palmer.\"As far as Beatrice and Eugenie go, I think there's an appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them, and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves,\" says Murphy.\"Their daughters are most unfortunate victims, they've had to suffer in silence and have been dignified in their silence,\" adds Nicholls.\"It can't be easy to see their parents dragged through something like this, and they remain very much loved nieces of the King. It wouldn't surprise me at all to see them at Christmas occasions in the future. They're largely untarnished.\"Ultimately, there seems to be little doubt that the person who will be most affected by all of this will be Prince Andrew himself.For a man who always liked the trappings of royalty, the pomp and the ceremony, the loss of his titles is deeply humiliating.So to not have those, on a personal level, will really matter.",

    "body": "18 hours agoFergus WalshMedical editorA blood test for more than 50 types of cancer could help speed up diagnosis, according to a new study.Results of a trial in North America show that the test was able to identify a wide range of cancers, of which three-quarters don't have any form of screening programme.More than half the cancers were detected at an early stage, where they are easier to treat and potentially curable.The Galleri test, made by American pharmaceutical firm Grail, can detect fragments of cancerous DNA that have broken off a tumour and are circulating in the blood. It is currently being trialled by the NHS.The trial followed 25,000 adults from the US and Canada over a year, with nearly one in 100 getting a positive result. For 62% of these cases, cancer was later confirmed.  Lead researcher Dr Nima Nabavizadeh, associate professor of radiation medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, said the data showed that the test could \"fundamentally change\" their approach to cancer screening. He explained that it could help detect many types of cancer \"earlier, when the chance of successful treatment or even cure are the greatest\".The test correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative.  When combined with breast, bowel, lung and cervical screening it increased the number of cancers detected overall seven-fold.  Crucially, three-quarters of cancers detected were those which have no screening programme such as ovarian, liver, stomach, bladder and pancreatic cancer.The blood test correctly identified the origin of the cancer in nine out of 10 cases.These impressive results suggest the blood test could eventually have a major role to play in diagnosing cancer earlier.But scientists not involved in the research say more evidence is needed to show whether the blood test reduces deaths from cancer.Clare Turnbull, professor of translational cancer genetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"Data from randomised studies, with mortality as an endpoint, will be absolutely essential to establish whether seemingly earlier-stage detection by Galleri translates into benefits in mortality.\"The topline results are to be released at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Berlin on Saturday, but the full details have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Much will depend on the results of a three-year trial involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, which will be published next year.The NHS has previously said that if the results are successful, it would extend the tests to a further one million people.Sir Harpal Kumar, president of biopharma at Grail called the results \"very compelling\".  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"The vast majority of people who die from cancer do so because we find their cancers too late.\"Many cancers are found when they are \"already very advanced\" he added, explaining that the aim is to \"shift to earlier detection, when we have the chance to use treatments that are much more effective and potentially curative\".But Naser Turabi of Cancer Research UK cautioned that further research is needed to \"avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm\". \"The UK National Screening Committee will \"play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS,\" he added.",

Her son admitted he \"knew quite early on I was beaten\". His pumpkin weighed a measly 2.9 stone (19kg).Ms Crickmore called her winning vegetable Sirius, \"because that's the brightest star in the sky\". Shaun Whitmore/BBCMs Crickmore warned her son \"you know I'll win this competition\"Mr Crickmore said he had always been fascinated by pumpkins, but it had been years since he had grown any. So this year, having decided \"there's nothing worse than seeing pathetic little pumpkins\", the farmer bought three seeds from a professional grower specialising in giant plants based in the United States.They were initially raised as seedlings in his mother's greenhouse, before he \"chose the two better looking specimens\", offering her the third one, he said. Shaun Whitmore/BBCMr Crickmore with the pumpkin he managed to produceMs Crickmore told him: \"You know I'll win this competition.\"Her competitive streak comes from her own mother and she has passed it on to her sons, she said.Her tactics included covering the plant up if the growing conditions were too hot, cold or wet.She also sneaked into Mr Crickmore's pumpkin patch at 06:00 one morning to steal pollen, admitting: \"They caught me doing it.\" \"It's because I had the female pumpkin, but I didn't have any male flower and I thought, 'ahh I know where there is a male flower' - I ripped the petals off and it worked.\"Pumpkins need to be pollinated to produce fruit. Mr Crickmore said they planned to re-run the competition next year. \"I know what mother's tactics are now - or maybe I'll give her one of the not-so-good seeds,\" he said.More on this storyRelated internet links",

Elkann's comments came after Ferrari issued guidance implying there was no truth to the Horner claims.In Saturday's sprint race in Austin, Hamilton finished fourth with team-mate Charles Leclerc fifth.",

    "body": "Will giving up his titles really make much difference for Andrew?2 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentReutersThere has been a loss of pride, but will much of Andrew's life stay the same?We're unlikely to see Prince Andrew at a royal public event now for at least six months. And then maybe only once or twice a year.Banned from royal Christmas celebrations at Sandringham he won't be on the annual church walk. It could be April 2026, at the Easter church service, before he reappears on such a family occasion, maybe longer.But when he resurfaces, how much will his life have really changed, despite the drama of the loss of his titles and honours?The move against Andrew followed a public outcry for some kind of sanction and there's certainly been a powerful symbolic message of displeasure - but will it really end the accusing headlines and will his daily life be much affected?PA MediaPrince William has not shown any enthusiasm for being seen with AndrewBuckingham Palace will hope that this will be seen as a decisive intervention, ending the drip-drip of scandal.The King was in Scotland when Andrew made his decision on giving up his titles and reportedly spoke to his brother on the phone.He had consulted Prince William, who has all the warmth of an ice age for his uncle Andrew. When William is eventually on the throne, Andrew's royal appearances might be reduced from rare to never.It had been William who had already intervened to stop Andrew from walking in the Order of the Garter procession.There has been a colossal loss of reputation for Prince Andrew and he'll keenly feel no longer being able to use the Duke of York title and to take part in the Order of the Garter. He's become a persona non-garter.It's a deep blow to his pride. But on a day-to-day basis, he's still a prince and he's still living in a mansion in Windsor. Royal Lodge has got a lease until 2078, so if he leaves it will be his own choice.Living with him still will be his ex-wife, who is now also an ex-duchess. They've gone back to the position when they first met, Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew.His downfall has been driven by his links with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But while Andrew has lost his status, if he ever looks at the infamous photo of him and Virginia Giuffre, everyone else in the picture - Ms Giuffre, Ghislaine Maxwell - and the person who was claimed to have taken it - Epstein - are either dead or in prison. The prince is the only one who has walked away.He can still spend his days watching aviation videos or TV shows. His family life with his daughters, who are still princesses, can continue unchanged.His statement about not using his titles, more or less a resignation letter, didn't have any flicker of remorse, continuing to assert his sense of duty and honour. So no change there.PA MediaSarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew will still be together at Royal LodgeWhen Andrew had to stop being a working royal, in the wake of his Newsnight interview, there was an expectation that he might take the time-worn approach of quiet contrition and some charity work, to gradually regain public respect.Instead he showed no sense of regret. A royal insider, asked about Andrew's chances of a dignified return to public life, simply said to me: \"The grand old Duke of York, he gave 12 million quid, to someone he never met, for something he never did.\"It meant he had never really accepted responsibility for what had happened. Several years later, the only thing that's changed is that he's no longer the Duke of York.The intense pressure applied this week by the Palace to Prince Andrew to accept the loss of titles was driven by two key factors, according to royal sources.First, the Palace wanted to stop the cacophony of terrible headlines about Andrew that kept drowning out the rest of the Royal Family's work. They wanted a line drawn under the scandals.And second, there was genuine disquiet at the discovery that Prince Andrew had stayed in touch longer with Epstein than he had previously admitted. If that part of his account was unreliable, what else might emerge?Getting Prince Andrew to renounce the use of his titles, under the threat of forcibly taking them away, was an attempt to publicly show that the Palace was taking this seriously. They would put an end to his remaining links with royal life.Although this made headlines around the world, it won't stop the underlying questions about Prince Andrew and Epstein and the accompanying headlines.This week will see the publication of the posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein victim who claimed to have been forced to have sex with Andrew.The prince has emphatically denied any wrongdoing, but the questions for Andrew about Ms Giuffre and Epstein seem to be getting louder than fading away. There could also be questions about what the Palace did or didn't know about Andrew and Epstein's circle.Whether he's called a prince or an ex-duke, he could still be caught up in the public and political pressure to reveal more documents about Epstein, particularly in the United States.PA MediaKing Charles had been in Scotland when Andrew had agreed to lose his titlesThe press will keep pulling on other threads, like Andrew's business dealings with China. Whatever the Palace hopes, the headlines are unlikely to stop.At the centre of it all is Prince Andrew, saying nothing now apart from his terse statement, written through gritted teeth, about his titles.Before his Newsnight interview in 2019 he had been much more open to talking to the media. I remember speaking to him at an event in 2017 encouraging entrepreneurs.Looking back it seems unintentionally prophetic.\"One of the things that I was taught at school was that the best way of being successful is to fail,\" he'd said.\"If you can learn about failure, and do it in such a way that it's a safe environment… then you will have learnt something, you will have experienced something.\"How many times did you put your finger in the plug socket as a small child and say 'ow' - and you never did it again.\"If you did it a second time, you'd think that was really stupid. They've failed and then they've learned what not to do next time,\" said Prince Andrew.\"You're always stronger from failure.\" Is that a lesson he was ever good at learning?",

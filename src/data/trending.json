    "body": "7 hours agoCachella SmithReutersRussell Brand has been charged with two further offences including one count of rape, the Metropolitan Police has said.In a new statement, the police force said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has authorised an additional charge of rape and a charge of sexual assault relating to two further women. The broadcaster, comedian and actor previously pleaded not guilty to five charges including two counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault in relation to four women.Mr Brand, 50, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 20 January 2026 in relation to the two new charges.Detectives began investigating allegations into Mr Brand which came to light following reporting from the Sunday Times, the Times and Channel 4's Dispatches in September 2023.The two new charges allegedly took place in 2009 and relate to separate women, the CPS said.A trial is set to start at Southwark Crown Court on 16 June 2026 for the five original charges which allegedly took place on dates spanning between 1999 and 2005 in central London and Bournemouth.Mr Brand, of Oxfordshire, is accused of raping one woman in Bournemouth in 1999, and indecently assaulting another in the Westminster area by grabbing her arm and dragging her towards a male toilet in 2001.A third charge alleges he sexually assaulted a woman by kissing and groping her in Westminster between 2004 and 2005, while the remaining counts relate to the alleged oral rape and sexual assault of an additional woman in 2004 in the Westminster area. Det Ch Insp Tariq Farooqi from the Metropolitan Police has said the women who have made reports are receiving support from specially trained officers.Mr Brand, who was born in Essex, rose to fame as a stand-up comedian and became a household name as host of TV shows like Big Brother's Big Mouth, and with his own radio programmes on stations including BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music.He went on to establish a Hollywood career, starring in films like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him To The Greek.",

    "body": "12 hours agoIan AikmanPA MediaAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is understood to have voluntarily surrendered his gun licence after a visit from the Metropolitan Police.Officers attended the former prince's Royal Lodge residence in Windsor last month, ahead of his expected house move in the new year.A Met Police spokesperson said: \"On Wednesday, 19 November, Metropolitan Police firearms licensing officers attended an address in Windsor to request that a man in his 60s voluntarily surrender his firearms and shotgun certificate.\" The force said the certificate was surrendered but did not comment further.It is not clear why the former prince - a known hunting enthusiast - gave up his licence, but the decision means he can only use or transport his guns if supervised.Surrendering a certificate does not mean the individual will not have access to their firearms.Andrew is expected to move to Norfolk in the new year, after he was stripped of his titles over his links to the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The former prince will move to an undisclosed property on the Sandringham estate, which is privately owned by his brother, King Charles III.In October, Buckingham Palace said the move would take place \"as soon as possible and practicable\".Andrew's connection to Epstein came under scrutiny again last week after a photo of him lying on the laps of women was released by the US government as part of the Epstein files.The King's brother was one of many well-known figures to be pictured in the files, and appearing in them is not evidence of a crime. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.",

    "body": "8 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterA judge has quashed a private prosecution brought by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) against comedian Reginald D Hunter, saying it was intended to get him \"cancelled\".The CAA's prosecution accused the US stand-up comic, 56, of sending offensive messages on three occasions in August and September 2024.On Tuesday, District Judge Michael Snow quashed a summons for Hunter, ruling that the CAA was seeking to use the criminal justice system for \"improper reasons\".\"The CAA have demonstrated by the misleading and partial way in which it summarised its application and its wilful, repeated, failure to meet its disclosure obligations, that its true and sole motive in seeking to prosecute Reginald Hunter is to have him cancelled,\" he wrote.\"I have no doubt that the prosecution is abusive,\" Judge Snow added at the hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.\"My view of the conduct of the CAA is consistent with them as an organisation which is not 'playing it straight' but is seeking to use the criminal justice system, in this case for improper reasons.\"Hunter, who is known for his appearances on TV shows like Have I Got News For You and 8 Out of 10 Cats, wrote on Instagram \"I sure hope I'm employable again!\" and thanked his legal team.He was accused of sending an offensive communication on three occasions to Heidi Bachram on X on 24 August and 10 and 11 September last year.However, the judge said the CAA's application for a private prosecution had been \"wholly inadequate\" when it came to disclosing her social media activity towards him.\"It did not reveal the extent of her tweets directed against Reginald Hunter in the period immediately preceding the complaints (her tweets were sent between 15 August and 11 September 2024),\" he said.\"The summary misled me into believing that his comments were addressed to her involvement with the Jewish faith as opposed to his response to attempts that were being made to have him 'cancelled'.\"The judge added that the CAA had failed to inform him of a compliance investigation by the Charity Commission into the organisation in November 2024.Hunter's lawyer, Rebecca Chalkley KC, told a hearing on Tuesday: \"The CAA are weaponising and using the courts for their own political agenda and not just in this case.\"The CAA's prosecutor Donal Lawler told the hearing that the charity had complied with its duty of candour.In a statement, a CAA spokesperson said: \"We are of course deeply disappointed by the District Judge's decision.\"Our mission is, and always has been, to stand up for British Jews and their allies, particularly at a time when levels of antisemitism and antisemitic violence are rising at an alarming rate.\"Our lawyers are examining the ruling and considering our next steps.\"Private prosecutions are cases brought to criminal courts without the involvement of the police or CPS.",

The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain's former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein's abuse.\nAlso: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria. Anti-government youth protesters in South Korea are taking cues from the American right's MAGA movement. Italy announces a fee for tourists to visit the Trevi Fountain in Rome. Putin vows revenge on Ukraine after an oil tanker was blown up in the Mediterranean Sea. Palestinians tell the BBC they were sexually abused in Israeli prisons. And how a lost radio play by Tennessee Williams was found more than four decades after his death, and has now been heard for the first time.\nThe Global News Podcast brings you the breaking news you need to hear, as it happens.

    "body": "28 minutes agoMany of the papers lead with the latest tranche of the Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice, which includes an email exchange between Ghislaine Maxwell and a person signing off as 'A' writing from the \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\". The Daily Mirror says the author of the email asked Maxwell to \"find me some 'friends'\" who are described as \"inappropriate\", according to the paper. The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's team for a response. The former prince has previously denied all wrongdoing.Under the headline \"Ghislaine Maxwell emails revealed\", the Sun says she allegedly sought to \"find fun girls for Andrew\".\"Andrew, 'fun girls' and 'inappropriate friends'\" is the i Paper's summary of the latest round of the Epstein files. The Guardian also leads with the \"girls\" email from the Epstein files, saying \"Andrew faces new pressure\". A photo shows climate activist Greta Thunberg being questioned by a police officer in London. The paper writes she was arrested \"after protesting in support of the Prisoners for Palestine hunger strike\".The government will \"scrap farm raid\" plans, the Daily Express writes. Labour will raise the \"tax threshold on inherited farmland\" from £1m to £2.5m, the paper says. It quotes farmer Jonathan Charlesworth – whose dad took his own life \"amid fears\" of the tax – saying the change was \"the best Christmas present for a lot of farmers\". A preview of King Charles III's Christmas message, which will be delivered from Westminster Abbey, also features on the front page.Labour's \"quiet Christmas U-turn\" on its inheritance tax plans is the Financial Times's take. \"Treasury to forgo £130mn\" in tax revenue as a consequence, the paper writes, as it \"shrinks [the] share of farmers facing inheritance tax to 15%\". The Times says Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faced a \"revolt by Labour MPs\" over the initial £1m inheritance tax threshold proposal, writing \"Downing Street was warned that over 40 MPs were prepared to defy Starmer.\"The prime minister's \"U-turn on farm tax\" is described by the Daily Mail as a \"humiliating capitulation to his backbenchers\".\"Farmers cheer as Starmer U-turns on tractor tax raid\" reads the Independent's headline, which the paper says follows \"months of fierce protests – and financial anguish for many families\". \"Loathe actually\" is the Daily Star's headline spin on the popular Christmas film Love Actually, whose director Richard Curtis and his wife Emma Freud oppose \"the idea of a 30-pitch campsite in their swanky village\". Plans for the campsite were approved by East Sussex Council, which Mr Curtis \"objects to\", the paper says.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "The Libyan army chief has been killed in an air crash in Turkey, Libya's prime minister has said.Gen Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad and four others were on board a Falcon 50 aircraft flying out of the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Tuesday evening.  In a post on X, Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said signal with the business jet was lost at 20:52 local time (17:52 GMT) - about 42 minutes after it took off from Ankara's airport. The Tripoli-bound jet had issued an emergency landing request before contact was lost. The aircraft's wreckage was later found south-west of Ankara, and an investigation is now under way into what caused the crash.In a later post on X, Yerlikaya wrote that police had spotted the debris near the village of Kesikkavak, in the Haymana district.He said the \"public will be informed of further developments\".In Libya, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, the prime minister of the country's internationally-recognised Government of National Unity (GNU), said he had received news of the deaths of Gen Haddad and other senior Libyan military officials on board the jet.The prime minister called it a \"great loss\" for the nation, saying Libya had \"lost men who served their country with sincerity and dedication\".Gen Haddad and his team had been in Turkey for talks aimed at further strengthening military and security co-operation between the two countries.Turkey has played an increasingly dominant role in Libya after intervening in 2019 to prevent an army from the east of the country driving out the internationally-recognised government in Tripoli, and has built close political, military and economic ties.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJames W KellyLondonPA MediaThe protest was in support of Palestine Action prisoners on hunger strikeGreta Thunberg has been arrested at a demonstration in support of the Palestine Action protesters who are on hunger strike in prison, according to the Prisoners for Palestine protest group.The 22-year-old activist was detained in the City of London after attending the scene of the early-morning demonstration on Fenchurch Street.In a video shared by the group, she could be seen holding a sign reading \"I support the Palestine Action prisoners\" and \"I oppose genocide\".City of London Police said a 22-year-old woman was arrested, and later bailed, for displaying a placard in support of a proscribed organisation, in this case Palestine Action, contrary to Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.The force said officers were called to the area at about 07:00 GMT after hammers and red paint were used to damage a building.A man and a woman were also arrested on suspicion of criminal damage after they \"glued themselves nearby\", police said. Specialist officers worked to release them before taking them into custody.PA MediaMs Thunberg has been a prominent voice in Europe's pro-Palestinian movementThe Prisoners for Palestine protest group said it staged the demonstration outside the offices of Aspen Insurance, which it claimed provides services to Israeli-linked defence firm Elbit Systems.Palestine Action was proscribed under UK terrorism legislation earlier this year, making it a criminal offence to support or express support for the group.Police said inquiries were continuing.Ms Thunberg, who first came to prominence as a child climate activist, has been involved in several demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause.She described the activists on hunger strike as \"political prisoners\" in a video posted on her Instagram on Monday, adding the UK government should meet their demands to be released from custody and for charges to be dropped.PA MediaProtesters targeted an office in the City with red paintThe protest comes after several imprisoned Palestine Action activists, including one who has refused to eat for 52 days, have been taken to hospital in recent days.Since the hunger strike began on 2 November, a total of seven prisoners have been taken to hospital.Kamran Ahmed, 28, who was being held at Pentonville Prison in north London, was admitted to hospital in the past week, as was Amu Gib, 30, who was being held at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey.The latter's health had \"deteriorated rapidly\" since joining the hunger strike on 2 November, and the activist now needed to use a wheelchair, Prisoners for Palestine previously said.A legal firm representing the hunger strikers has said it submitted a pre-action letter on Monday against the Justice Secretary David Lammy.The letter outlines the group's intention to initiate legal action.

    "body": "3 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentPA MediaThe King will give the traditional message from the Abbey's Lady ChapelThis year's Christmas message from King Charles III will be delivered from Westminster Abbey.This traditional speech, filmed in the Lady Chapel of the medieval church in central London, follows his \"good news\" earlier this month about responding well to cancer treatment.The King is expected to talk about the \"pilgrimage\" of life, and the lessons it can teach about the issues of the day, in a message broadcast at 15.00 on Christmas Day.Last year the speech was given in the Fitzrovia Chapel, which once served hospital staff, and was a symbolic location for a message focusing on the King's thanks for health workers.PA MediaThe King was able to re-use the Christmas trees from Catherine's carol concertThis year's setting is below the Lady Chapel's famous medieval vaulted ceiling, in a chapel where 15 previous kings and queens are buried, including Elizabeth I, Mary I and Charles II.It also means that for a second year the Christmas message won't be delivered from behind a desk inside a palace.The King will be seen standing in front of Christmas trees which were brought to decorate the Abbey for the Princess of Wales's carol concert held earlier this month.Westminster Abbey was also the venue for the King's recent Advent service, where there were prayers and music from different Christian traditions, including Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox.There was a display of icons in the Abbey for that service - and when the King visited Pope Leo earlier this year he gave him an icon of St Edward the Confessor, a saint with strong connections to Westminster Abbey.The Advent service and the trip to the Vatican had reflected one of the King's longstanding causes - his efforts to build bridges between people of different faiths and backgrounds.The tradition of an annual Christmas broadcast from the monarch, looking back on the year and addressing current events, dates back to 1932, when George V delivered a speech on the radio.The first televised Christmas speech was delivered by Elizabeth II in 1957. It's usually among the most-watched programmes on Christmas Day.",

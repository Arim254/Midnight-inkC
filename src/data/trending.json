    "body": "8 minutes agoMark SavageMusic correspondentJimmy Cliff, one of the most prominent and beloved proponents of reggae music, has died at the age of 81.A star since the 1960s, he helped to bring the sound of Jamaica to a global audience through hits such as Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want.His lead role as a gun-toting rebel in the 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come is a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema, and was attributed as the movie that brought reggae to America.Cliff's wife, Latifa Chambers, announced his death via a statement on Instagram.\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" she wrote.\"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. \"To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career.\"Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\" Her message was also signed by their children, Lilty and Aken.Born James Chambers in 1948, Cliff grew up as the eighth of nine children in abject poverty in the parish of St. James, Jamaica.Blessed with a sweet, mellifluous voice, he began singing at his local church at the age of six.By the time he was 14, he'd moved to Kingston and adopted the surname Cliff to express the heights he intended on reaching.He recorded several singles before topping the Jamaican charts with his own composition, Hurricane Hattie. In 1965, he relocated to London to work with Island Records - later the home of Bob Marley - but the label's attempts to make his sound palatable to rock audiences weren't entirely successful at first.He struck gold with the 1969 single Wonderful World, Beautiful People - an upbeat, feelgood anthem; and the more politically-charged Vietnam, which Bob Dylan called \"the best protest song ever written\".But Cliff became an international star with The Harder They Come, expressly written for the movie of the same name, in which he played Ivan Martin, a young man trying to break into Jamaica's corrupt music industry.\"The film opened the door for Jamaica,\" Cliff recalled. \"It said, 'This is where this music comes from.'\"His other recordings included the Grammy Award-winning albums Cliff Hanger (1985) and Rebirth (2012); and Cliff was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.",

    "body": "Pioneering Australian chef Skye Gyngell has died aged 62.Gyngell rose to fame in the UK after her cafe at Petersham Nurseries in south-west London was awarded a coveted Michelin star, one of the highest culinary honours. She went on to helm Spring restaurant at Somerset House and Marle and Hearth at Heckfield Place in Hampshire.Gyngell's family said she died on Saturday in London, describing her as a \"culinary visionary who influenced generations of chefs and growers globally to think about food and its connection to the land\". Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver paid tribute to Gyngell - who was diagnosed with skin cancer last year - and thanked her for \"all you did to inspire young cooks\".During the 1980s, Gyngell pioneered the \"slow food movement\" before becoming a private chef for clients including Nigella Lawson, Madonna and Guy Ritchie.Lawson mourned her death, writing on Instagram, \"However ill you know someone to be, their death is always a shock. It's just awful that Skye is no longer in the world.\"Gyngell died just days after her mother, Ann Barr, who was a well-known interior designer.Her father, Bruce Gyngell, was the first person to appear on Australian television in 1956 with the line: \"Good evening, and welcome to television\". He died in 2000.Born in Sydney, Skye Gyngell was studying at Sydney University when she realised the culinary world was where she wanted to be. She moved to Paris at 19, where she trained and worked under acclaimed chefs including at the two Michelin-starred restaurant Dodin-Bouffant.Gyngell later moved to London and worked at the French House in Soho with Fergus and Margot Henderson.In 2004, Gyngell became head chef at Petersham Nurseries cafe in Richmond, where she  turned the dilapidated site into a thriving cafe, and in 2011, it was awarded a Michelin star.But the kudos was a double-edged sword for Gyngell, who left the cafe a year after the award, saying she was frustrated by customers who expected a traditional Michelin experience at her rustic cafe.Her later ventures included Spring at Somerset House, which was the first single-use plastic-free restaurant in London. Gyngell, who overcame drug and alcohol addiction in her younger years, was also known for her award-winning cookbooks and wrote columns for Vogue as its food editor.Last year, she found a lump in her neck and was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer.She underwent an operation which included the removal of her salivary glands, causing her to temporarily lose her sense of smell and taste.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "17 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, BeirutIsrael's military has killed a senior member of the militant group Hezbollah in an air strike on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, despite a ceasefire.It described Haitham Ali al-Tabtabai, Hezbollah's chief of staff, as a veteran of the group who had held a series of senior positions.Lebanon's health ministry said at least five people were killed and 28 others wounded in the strike, which hit an apartment building in the densely populated Dahieh district.Hezbollah confirmed Tabtabai's death, adding Israel had crossed a \"red line\" in carrying out the strike.The strike is Israel's first on southern Beirut for months.It comes as Israel has escalated its campaign on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group supported by Iran - despite a ceasefire brokered by the US and France that came into effect last November.Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been trying to rebuild its military capabilities, is smuggling weapons into Lebanon and stepping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles, and there are growing fears of an escalation of hostilities.In a statement after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Under my leadership, the State of Israel will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild its power, and we will not allow it to once again pose a threat to the State of Israel.\"He said he expected the Lebanese government \"to fulfill its commitment to disarm Hezbollah\".Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel - which continues to occupy at least five locations in southern Lebanon - to stop the attacks and withdraw from the country, saying the Israeli actions are a violation of the agreement that put an end to 13 months of conflict.The Lebanese government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but the group has rejected calls to discuss the future of its weapons before Israel stops its attacks, fully withdraws from Lebanon, and releases Lebanese prisoners. A Western diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the authorities are under pressure from the Trump administration, which is growing impatient with what they see as the slow progress against the group, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and UK.The latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted after the Lebanese group started firing rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.The US government imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016 and designated him a terrorist. It has a $5m (£3.8m) award on offer for information about him.The US described him as a key Hezbollah military leader who once commanded the group's special forces in Syria and Yemen, adding his actions in these countries were part of a larger Hezbollah effort to provide training, material, and personnel \"in support of its destabilising regional activities\".",

    "body": "20 hours agoDearbail JordanUK Ministry of DefenceA view from HMS Severn as it tracks Russia's RFN Stoikiy in the English ChannelTwo Russian warships were intercepted in the English Channel by the Royal Navy, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.In the latest incident involving Russia's ships entering waters around the UK, HMS Severn headed off the RFN Stoikiy, a corvette and Yelnya, a tanker, as they sailed west through the Dover Strait into the English Channel in the past fortnight.Last week, it emerged that the Russian spy ship Yantar was spotted off the coast of Scotland and it used lasers to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its movements.Defence Secretary John Healey branded the Yantar's move \"deeply dangerous\" and warned Russia and its president Vladimir Putin: \"We see you. We know what you're doing. We are ready.\"Healey said last week that there had been a 30% increase in Russian vessels threatening UK waters in the past two years.The MoD said after intercepting the Stoikiy and the Yelnya, the HMS Severn later handed over monitoring duties to a Nato ally off the coast of Brittany, north west France.It said the UK ship \"continued to observe from a distance and remained ready to respond to any unexpected activity\".It is not the first time the Stoikiy has been in British territory.In May, the Royal Navy dispatched two vessels and the 814 Naval Air Squadron - also known as the \"flying tigers\" - to shadow the Russian warship as it sailed west through the English Channel to meet the Sparta IV and General Skobelev.The two merchant vessels were returning from the Mediterranean and the group headed back to the Baltic Sea, watched by HMS Hurworth.Healey has said that the rise in Russian activity in UK waters was evidence of increased \"Russian aggression right across the board\" which he says is impacting Europe, not just Ukraine.At a news conference in Downing Street last week, the defence secretary said he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely \"when it is in our wider waters\".Built in 2002, HMS Severn is a River-class offshore patrol vessel. Together with her sister ships, HMS Tyne and HMS Mersey, the Royal Navy says the ships are able to \"escort passing foreign warships, mount fishing vessel inspections and defend the UK border\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesHinkley Point C in Somerset is under constructionThe UK has become the \"most expensive place in the world\" to build nuclear power plants, according to a government review which criticises \"overly complex\" bureaucracy around the sector.The report, which was commissioned by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calls for a  \"one-stop shop\" for nuclear decisions. A \"radical reset\" of the rules around nuclear power could save Britain \"tens of billions\" in costs and reverse the industry's \"decline\" in recent years, the Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce said.It comes as the UK government looks to build a new generation of nuclear plants to meet the country's future energy needs and net zero targets.Hinkley Point C in Somerset is expected to start operating in the early 2030s, while Sizewell C - which the government says will be capable of powering six million homes - will follow later that decade. The UK is also setting up small nuclear power stations, which are faster to build than full-size reactors.The taskforce's report said the planning system needed to be streamlined and the risks associated with nuclear energy should be brought in line with the rest of the worldIt said the UK had excessively risk-averse policies in place, including \"overly conservative\" rules on radiation exposure levels for workers.A \"fragmented\" regulatory system has led to \"conservative and costly decisions not proportionate to the actual risk being managed\", it said.The report said nuclear plants - which generate electricity by using atomic reactions to produce heat - were \"essential to the UK's future\", with the country at risk of missing out on a \"worldwide nuclear renaissance\".Taskforce chair John Fingleton said: \"Our solutions are radical, but necessary. By simplifying regulation, we can maintain or enhance safety standards while finally delivering nuclear capacity safely, quickly, and affordably.\"Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fingleton said the UK's regulations  have \"made us the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear\".Limitations on exposure to radiation are stricter in an energy setting than in a dentists or doctors, he said.\"Motorways wouldn't be very useful if we all drove at five miles an hour but that's sort of what we're doing in nuclear safety.\"The government is expected to address the report's findings later this month in the Budget.Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"This government is delivering a golden age of new nuclear as we drive for energy sovereignty and abundance.\"A crucial part of that is delivering the reforms we need to drive forward new nuclear in a safe, affordable way.\"Several major economies are reassessing their nuclear strategies and expanding capacity. The number of planned and proposed nuclear plants currently in the works is roughly equivalent to the number already in operation around the world.The UK is among 30 other countries that have signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050 in a bid to cut carbon emissions.Britain's existing nuclear power stations account for about 15% of the electricity generated in 2024.The UK runs nine nuclear reactors but they are ageing, with eight set to shut by 2030, and the new plants will take several years to come online.Beyond the UK, France plans to build at least six new reactors, while China has nearly 30 under construction.The US completed its first new reactor in over three decades last year, and Japan - which temporarily shuttered its nuclear programme after the 2011 meltdown at Fukushima - now plans for it to supply a fifth of its electricity by 2040.In contrast, Germany has phased out its use of nuclear power, prioritising alternative renewables like hydrogen.The development of nuclear energy remains divisive, with public opinion shaded by high-profile safety incidents, including Fukushima and the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl. Mike Childs, head of policy for environmental campaigning group Friends of the Earth, said: \"Nuclear power has always been and will always be extraordinarily expensive, not because of regulation but because of the nature of the technology. \"Investing in energy efficiency, renewable power and energy storage is the economically sensible route to keep energy bills affordable.\"",

    "body": "21 minutes agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterPA MediaThe Princess of Wales has called for an end to the \"stigma\" surrounding addiction, and urged people to offer \"empathy and support\" to those dependent on alcohol, drugs or gambling.Catherine, who sent the message to mark Addiction Awareness Week, said \"significant progress\" has been made to better understand addiction, but warned more needs to be done.The princess is the patron of The Forward Trust, a charity that tries to break the cycle of addiction and is behind the campaign running from 23-30 November.Catherine, who has also campaigned on mental health issues, draws parallels between the two conditions in her message.She said addiction was \"not a choice or a personal failing, but a complex mental health condition that should be met with empathy and support\".She added: \"But still, even now in 2025, people's experience of addiction is shaped by fear, shame and judgement. This needs to change.\"The stigma surrounding those who face addiction allows it to thrive behind closed doors, impacting families and communities, and ultimately ruining lives.\"The princess said that many people will know someone who is struggling with addiction.\"Now is the moment to show our compassion and love to help them, or their friends and family, to reach out to organisations like The Forward Trust for support,\" she said.\"Recovery is hard, but with the right treatment it is possible. And this begins with a conversation, a listening ear and showing we care.\"Catherine launched the first Addiction Awareness Week in 2021 on behalf of the trust and its Taking Action on Addiction campaign.She concluded her message by urging people to have open conversations to bring addiction and the harm it causes \"out of the shadows\".PA MediaCatherine launched the charity's campaign in 2021It is not the first time Catherine has spoken out on the issue of addiction.In 2022, she gave her personal support to people struggling with addictions, telling them shame should not stop them getting help and urging a more compassionate public attitude towards the condition.Former England and Arsenal captain Tony Adams, who spent 11 years in addiction, has also recorded a video to launch a series of films demonstrating the power of open conversations in the journey to recovery.In the film, he reveals that a conversation with his mother-in-law Barbara was the catalyst to getting help.Adams, who is now chairman of trustees at the Forward Trust, said: \"If you are struggling with an addiction or a mental health issue, then please reach out and get the appropriate help. The greatest thing I ever did was to say, 'I can't do this'.\"The charity provides services including helping with employment and addressing the problems of addicts and addictions in prison.Before the Princess of Wales became the Forward Trust's patron, she had twice visited the charity's substance misuse services at HMP Send, a women's prison in Surrey.The trust has also called for greater recognition of the scale of gambling inside prisons.Steve JonesSteve Jones: \"The Princess of Wales discussing these issues will help remove stigma - anything to help people understand and have empathy when they see or hear about addicts is a good thing\"Several people who have struggled with addiction contacted the BBC after reading Catherine's message.Steve Jones said he \"turned to drink and drugs\" to \"help blank it all out\" after spending 40 years in the military. After losing friends in a helicopter crash and witnessing a man die in a car accident, Mr Jones said he \"had bottled up all these emotions which all came out five years ago\".He believes the Princess of Wales' open discussion of addiction and mental health will help to remove the stigma and encourage understanding. Another reader, who only wanted to be named as MD, said they had been struggling with gambling for about 20 years, calling it \"an addiction that you can only hide by lying and deceiving people\".MD feels that Addiction Awareness Week and Catherine's message has \"amazing intent\", but \"the stigma and shame on something like this literally drives people to suicide.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGeeta PandeyDelhiDinodiaDharmendra often said he was 'embarrassed' by talk about his looksBollywood star Dharmendra has died in the Indian city of Mumbai at the age of 89.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the actor, saying his passing \"marks the end of an era in Indian cinema\".Dharmendra, who often described himself as \"a simple man\", commanded extraordinary affection and loyalty from his tens of millions of fans.Best known as Veeru, the lovable petty criminal in the 1975 blockbuster Sholay, he appeared in over 300 films, many hits, captivating audiences for decades.Songs featuring him topped the charts, and his romance and marriage with Hema Malini made headlines.Dubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\" and \"Garam (hot) Dharam\", the actor often made it to global lists of \"most handsome men\" in his heyday and female fans were known to sleep with his photographs under their pillows.Bollywood stars weren't immune to his charms either - over the years actress Madhuri Dixit described him as \"one of the most handsome people I have seen on screen\", superstar Salman Khan said Dharmendra was the \"most beautiful looking man\" and actress Jaya Bachchan called him \"a Greek God\".Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".Born on 8 December 1935 in Nasrali village in Punjab's Ludhiana district in a middle-class Jatt-Sikh family, he was named Dharam Singh Deol by his schoolteacher father.In a 2018 interview with BBC Hindi, he said his father wanted him to study, but he fell in love with films early on and wanted to be a hero.\"I watched my first film when I was in the ninth standard and I was hooked. I was wondering, where is this heaven where all these beautiful people live? I thought I must find my way there. I felt like they were mine and I belonged to them.\"But when he told his family, they were appalled.DinodiaDharmendra (right) with Amjad Khan in Sholay\"My mother said, 'you are our eldest child, you have family responsibilities'. I was very sad. So when we heard about the All India Talent Contest by Filmfare magazine, to humour me, she said, 'ok, send in your application'. We didn't think I would be selected.\"But then he won the contest and moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) and the rest, as they say, is history.For three decades - after debuting with Dil Bhi Tera, Hum Bhi Tere (The heart is yours and so am I) in 1960 - he ruled Bollywood, delivering several hits a year.Dharmendra first rose to fame with Bimal Roy's 1963 film Bandini, earning praise for his elegant portrayal of a prison doctor who falls for a convict.He soon became a romantic hero, pairing successfully with top actresses like Nutan, Meena Kumari, Mala Sinha, and Saira Banu.In 1966, he did his first action role in Phool Aur Patthar (Flower and rock), but it was the 1971 hit Mera Gaon Mera Desh (My village, my country) which cemented his reputation as an action hero.Tall and well-built, Dharmendra often did his own action scenes, involving daring stunts, even taking risks.Besides romance and action, the actor also delivered thrillers and comedies that were hits. Critics praised him \"for his impeccable comic timing\" in the hilarious 1975 film Chupke Chupke.DinodiaDharmendra with wife Bollywood actor Hema MaliniOver the years, Dharmendra said he was cast against 70 heroines, but his most successful screen pairing was with Hema Malini, who later became his second wife.The couple first met at a film premiere in 1965 and Hema Malini made an immediate impression on Dharmendra. In her 2017 biography, she wrote that she heard Dharmendra telling fellow actor Shashi Kapoor in Punjabi, \"Kudi badi changi hai (The girl is quite pretty)\".Their romance bloomed in the 1970s through superhit films like Seeta Aur Geeta, Raja Jani, and Sholay, making headlines as Dharmendra was already married with grown-up children with his first wife, Prakash Kaur.The media wrote about the resistance from Hema Malini's family to their wedding, but the couple finally tied the knot in 1980. Some reports said they had converted to Islam, which allows polygamy, to marry - a claim Dharmendra later denied.The actor-producer also dabbled in politics. He was the BJP MP from Bikaner in Rajasthan for one term from 2005 to 2009. But he was criticised for not taking politics seriously as he rarely attended parliament, preferring to spend time shooting for films or working on his farm.Speaking to a television programme, Aap Ki Adalat, years later, he agreed that he was a misfit in politics. \"Politics is not for emotional people, it's for the thick-skinned,\" he said. \"These five years were very tough for me, they were difficult.\"He worked almost to the end of his life, acting alongside his sons Sunny and Bobby Deol, judging reality shows, and connecting with fans via social media.AFP via Getty ImagesDharmendra with sons Sunny (right) and Bobby Deol (left) at his Mumbai residenceIn his lifetime, the actor gave many fine performances, but if there's one role that he'll always be remembered for, it'll be that of Veeru in Sholay - the 1975 blockbuster that has become a cultural phenomenon.The multi-starrer that also had Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini and Jaya Bachchan in the lead roles saw Dharmendra and Bachchan play loveable rogues-turned-saviours who are recruited to fight a dreaded bandit.The film became a cult classic and many fans credited Dharmendra for its success, describing him as the \"soul of Sholay\". The actor also described it as his finest role. \"I don't think I have ever done a better role than Veeru's,\" he said.The young girl who became Bollywood's pen-palBut despite delivering dozens of hits, Dharmendra never made it to the \"number one\" slot in Bollywood - losing to contemporaries such as Dilip Kumar, Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan - and was passed for the prestigious Filmfare awards several times.It was finally in 1997 that Filmfare honoured him with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to Hindi cinema and in 2012, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan - an Indian government honour given to civilians for distinguished service.But Dharmendra wore his stardom lightly, staying away from the rat race and said he never wanted to be number one in the industry.\"I never asked for too much money, and fame is transient. All I ever wanted was people's love,\" he told an interviewer.\"I came here just for this love. Everyone loves Dharmendra and I am grateful for that,\" he added.On Wednesday, news of his death prompted tributes from the film fraternity on social media.\"Growing up, Dharmendra was the hero every boy wanted to be,\" said actor Akshay Kumar. \"Thank you for inspiring generations. You'll live on through your films and the love you spread.\"Describing his passing as the \"end of an era\", director Karan Johar said it had left \"a gaping hole in the industry... a space that can never be filled by anyone... there will always be one and only Dharmendra\".",

    "body": "14 minutes agoBen KingBusiness reporterGetty ImagesWorkers and business leaders have told the Covid-19 inquiry about the devastation they faced during the pandemic and the difficulties they faced accessing support.Business owners described breaking into tears as they were forced either to lay off staff or shut up shop entirely, while employees told how they feared for their jobs.The comments were included in 8,000 submissions from the public, and come as the third stage of the inquiry focuses on the measures taken to support workers' incomes and keep businesses afloat when the pandemic struck.According to the Treasury, £140bn was spent on support for businesses, much of it going to pay people's wages when they were forced to stay at home.Last week the report on the second phase of the inquiry, into political decision-making, found the government had done \"too little, too late\".The current module, expected to last until just before Christmas, will examine the unprecedented economic intervention rolled out when the first lockdown was announced in March 2020.The largest scheme, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, known as furlough, covered 11.7 million jobs between March 2020 and September 2021, at a cost of £70bn, paying a portion of employees' wages to ensure they still had an income even if they could not go to work, and to keep businesses going so that they could reopen later.There was also a support scheme for self-employed people, loan schemes for businesses and business rates relief.Questions were raised over the scale of the financial support, the strength of safeguards against fraud and error, and whether it delayed people taking up new work roles.In submissions to the inquiry, employees told the inquiry how they were worried of losing their jobs and faced a scramble to pay bills through the pandemic, with some missing out on furlough payments after being made redundant by their companies.Others said their careers were rescued by the furlough programme.Some business owners said they were saved by government support schemes and spared having to make redundancies.As part of the submissions, the owner of a small retailer told the inquiry: \"One awful day, I had to call 80% of my staff and tell them that we had to make them redundant because there was no job for them anymore.\"And I cried, I didn't sleep all night, I was so, so, upset. I had people that had worked for me for seven, eight years, that I had to say, 'I'm so sorry, I literally can't afford to pay you anymore because we've got no business'.''Describing flaws in the furlough system, one Northern Irish contributor said her husband lost his job in the run-up to the scheme coming to an end. \"It then got extended, but he'd already been let go,\" she said.Then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Eat Out to Help Out scheme split opinion among bosses.\"When we reopened, it helped to get people back into the pub and it helped us increase our profits,\" the finance director of a large English food and drinks firm said.But an operations manager at a travel and hospitality firm in Wales said: \"When we look back, it probably wasn't the right thing to do, given where we were with the pandemic.\"What is the UK Covid inquiry and how does it work?The Covid Inquiry, chaired by Baroness Hallett, is expected to look at 10 areas in total, and provide lessons for managing future pandemics.This phase of the inquiry will also look at the additional funding provided for public services such as the railways to keep them running during lockdowns, and support for the voluntary and community sector.It will examine decisions on benefits, sick pay and support for vulnerable people.However, this part of the inquiry will not look at how the pandemic affected the economy as a whole.Baroness Coffey, the former work and pensions secretary, is due to appear on Wednesday, as well as Will Quince, the former welfare delivery minister.Labour market expert Mike Brewer, one of five experts commissioned to write reports on different aspects of the governments' economic policy response, will be the first witness to give evidence on Tuesday morning. Also appearing are: Former Treasury officials James Benford and Dan York-SmithRepresentatives of the charities Child Poverty Action Group, Long Covid Support and Disability UKFormer Downing Street special adviser Ben WarnerFormer director general for analysis of the Covid-19 Taskforce, Robert Harrison.Rishi Sunak has confirmed that he will appear in a couple of weeks' time.On Friday, he told the BBC the government and scientific community were \"operating in a highly uncertain environment\". \"I think we do need to view the decisions taken through that lens. \"But it's important that lessons [are] learned so that we can be better prepared if there's ever another pandemic.\"Last week, the inquiry published a highly critical report on core decision-making during the pandemic, which described a \"toxic and chaotic\" culture at the centre of the UK government.The public hearings for this section of the inquiry – known as Module 9 – are scheduled to run for four weeks, ending on 18 December.",

    "body": "5 hours agoAnnabel Rackham and Ian Youngs,Culture reportersSenior figures involved in the BBC's recent troubles will be questioned by MPs on Monday.Michael Prescott - a former editorial adviser who raised concerns about BBC reporting, including Panorama's edit of a Donald Trump speech - will speak on the matter in public for the first time when he appears in front of a House of Commons committee.An internal memo written by Prescott was leaked to the press, leading to the resignations of the BBC's director general and head of news earlier this month.Also giving evidence will be BBC chairman Samir Shah, who is under pressure for his handling of the affair, and fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson.Caroline Daniel, another former editorial adviser, will also speak to parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee from 15:30 GMT.They are expected to face tough questions from MPs, and to give their views on the state of the BBC and its journalism, and give their accounts of events behind the scenes. On Friday, one board member, Shumeet Banerji, resigned over what he called \"governance issues\" at the top of the corporation, which BBC media editor Katie Razzall said \"looks like a direct critique of\" Shah.Banerji's departure makes Monday's committee hearing \"even more critical\" for Shah, Razzall added.The role of Sir Robbie, a former BBC senior editor and director of communications for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, is also expected to come under  scrutiny.BBC director general Tim Davie and CEO of News Deborah Turness resigned following criticism after Prescott's memo was reported by the Telegraph.In a subsequent letter to the parliamentary committee, Shah apologised for the \"error of judgement\" when two sections of Trump's speech on 6 January 2021 were edited together in an episode of Panorama.Prescott's memo also raised concerns about other \"troubling matters\" including \"systemic problems\" of bias in BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, and one-sided coverage of trans issues.The committee's chairwoman, Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage, has said Davie's departure was \"regrettable\" but that \"restoring trust in the corporation must come first\".She said: \"The BBC Board must now begin the long process of rebuilding the corporation's reputation both at home and abroad, after the damage caused by what has become a seemingly constant stream of crises and missteps.\"The latest crisis has sparked a wider debate about the future of the BBC and the state of its news output, including claims of institutional bias and political interference.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has said the perception of political influence is \"a problem\", and that there is \"a real concern, which I share, that political appointments to the board of the BBC damaged confidence and trust in the BBC's impartiality\".She pledged to examine the issue as part of the corporation's next charter review.Sir Robbie was appointed to the BBC board by the Conservative government in 2021, and has been accused of interfering in editorial decisions.He sits on the BBC board's editorial guidelines and standards committee (EGSC) alongside Shah, Davie and Thomson, who is the BBC's former chief operating officer.The parliamentary committee said Monday's session would focus on the EGSC's \"processes and how it ensures output complies with the BBC's editorial guidelines\".Prescott, a former Sunday Times political editor, and Daniel, a former FT assistant editor, advised the EGSC about \"editorial risks and issues\" after being appointed as the BBC's first \"external editorial experts\" in 2022.On Sunday, the Guardian reported the BBC was looking to expand the EGSC as part of reforms, which is understood to be accurate.It is possible that having a bigger cast could help it to scrutinise issues better, and ensure no one individual can dominate proceedings.The Guardian also reported the BBC will look to add a new deputy director general role, after concerns that the job is too much for one person. There have been deputy director generals in the corporation previously.The BBC has not commented on the Guardian reports.The session comes as the BBC waits to discover whether Trump will file legal action after threatening to sue the corporation for between $1bn (£759.8m) and $5bn (£3.8bn) over the Panorama edit.",

    "body": "51 minutes agoShari Vahl,BBC Rip Off Britain and Jenny Coleman,North WestBBCPaul Harrison said the letters began to arrive at his house in JanuaryWhen letters and bank cards mysteriously started popping through his letter box, Paul Harrison grew increasingly worried somebody was trying to steal his identity.And when he discovered neighbours on his Cheshire street had also been receiving suspicious mail they soon found out they were likely being targeted as part of a wider, sophisticated money laundering scam.Mr Harrison, who has lived at his home in Warrington for 22 years, said strange items of post began to arrive in January, addressed to somebody completely unknown to either him or his wife.\"When the first letter arrived from HSBC [it] clearly had a bank card in it,\" he told BBC One's Rip Off Britain programme.Tracy Heaton received letters addressed to two different people, both unknown to herAfter taking the letter to his nearest HSBC branch, Mr Harrison said he was told to return it to the sender, which he did.A few days later, though, a similar letter arrived.After speaking to HSBC's fraud department he believed the issue had been resolved - until the letters kept coming.The mysterious addressee was then sent seven letters, a bank card, a PIN, overdraft limit warnings and a warning that an outstanding debt could be referred to a credit reference agency.Mr Harrison became increasingly worried.And when he spoke with neighbour Tracy Heaton he found out he was not alone.Ms Heaton, who had received similar letters for a person unknown to her, feared her address was being used by a fraudster.\"I was very concerned about the implications on myself and credit rating,\" she said.Ms Heaton received eight letters addressed to two different men who had never lived at her property.Despite contacting HSBC repeatedly, she said she had felt \"fobbed off\" by the bank, claiming it was \"not taking the appropriate action to stop it\".At least 12 homes in the  street received mysterious lettersMr Harrison then contacted the Rip Off Britain team.The BBC discovered that at least 12 homes on Mr Harrison and Ms Heaton's street had been targeted with bogus accounts, set up on the same day in common Hungarian names.It is possible that these names belong to people who have had their identities stolen, or they have been \"bought\" by money laundering criminals, allowing their identities to be used to open bank accounts for them.Seeking to avoid detection, money launderers often split large sums of cash and quickly transfer it into several newly created bank accounts.It is not known how much money was involved in the Warrington operation.There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Mr Harrison, Ms Heaton or anybody living in their street.The letters first started arriving at properties in the same Warrington street 10 months agoHSBC said it carries out \"physical and digital checks when an account application is received\" and when fraudulent activity is reported or suspected it always aims to investigate and take appropriate action in a timely manner.The bank apologised to Mr Harrison and Ms Heaton and said its response was not up to the standard \"customers should expect\".It said it had reviewed what happened and taken action to ensure it does not happen again.The bank also confirmed the fraudulent accounts on the Warrington street had all now been closed.Finally, it urged anyone who receives a letter addressed to someone who does not live at that property to return it by post or take it to a local branch or banking hub.Related internet linksRelated internet links",

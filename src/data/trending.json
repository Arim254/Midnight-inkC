    "body": "Media caption, How Maresca's tenure at Chelsea turned sourByFootball reporterUpdated 6 hours agoLess than six months after guiding Chelsea to Club World Cup success, Enzo Maresca has left his post as head coach.The Blues won just one of their final seven Premier League matches under Maresca and sit fifth in the table - 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal.After their most recent game - a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth on 30 December - assistant manager Willy Caballero said Maresca felt too unwell to speak to the media, but it is understood his absence was more due to him considering his next steps.Two days on, Maresca has gone. But how did things unravel?From stability to troubleMedia caption, From Match of the Day on 13 December: What did Maresca mean?At the end of November, Chelsea appeared in a harmonious place, with the team third in the Premier League and having recently dismantled Barcelona in the Champions League.On 12 December, Maresca was named Premier League manager of the month for November.Just one league win followed in December but it was not only results that added to the focus on Maresca, with fissures emerging between the Italian and the club's hierarchy.Maresca stunned key figures at Stamford Bridge - and even his own staff - when, after beating Everton 2-0 for Chelsea's solitary Premier League win in December, he said \"many people\" had made it his \"worst 48 hours\" since joining the club.Those comments came from a position of strength after a good performance but were viewed dimly by the club hierarchy, at whom they appeared to be aimed.They have since been explained as being linked to medical recommendations. Senior figures inside Chelsea said instructions were ignored and decisions either risked players getting injured again - or prevented them from training because of overload. Maresca felt the club were telling him who to pick, based on a player's value.Even after that, the plan remained to conduct an end-of-season review to decide whether to move forward with Maresca or part company.Those with knowledge of Maresca's views, though, said he was capable of walking away having grown unhappy at a multitude of factors, including encouragement over which players should start and which substitutions should be made during matches.He also felt a lack of protection from the club over the quality of his work. And on Thursday came news that was not unexpected, with Chelsea confirming the two parties had gone their separate ways. The Blues' players will return to work on Friday closer in points to 15th place than third in the Premier League as they prepare for a defining period.They face Manchester City on Sunday to start a difficult month that also includes games against Arsenal and Napoli.Chelsea's primary goal this season is to qualify for the Champions League, which remains realistic, while also aiming for domestic cup runs.What happened to Maresca behind the scenes?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Enzo Maresca's Chelsea won only once in the Premier League in DecemberChelsea were satisfied with Maresca at the end of last season when he delivered Champions League qualification - regarded internally as his most important achievement - plus success in the Conference League and Club World Cup.While victory in Europe's third-tier competition was broadly expected, beating Paris St-Germain to be crowned 'world champions' was a welcome surprise.Maresca had delighted key figures at Stamford Bridge - including sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Lawrence Stewart, and influential co-owner Behdad Eghbali.In line with the agreed strategy when the Italian moved from Leicester City in 2024 - for which the club paid £10m - he focused on coaching while those above him oversaw much of the backroom staff, medical department and transfers.Maresca knew what he was signing up for in terms of the transfer policy - signing the world's best young players from 'lesser' leagues to create the youngest team in the Premier League - and his issues were not with the quality of players or the strategy, but about the perception of his work with a young group. Maresca also did not expect decisions on team selection to be influenced.This season, he and his agent had informed the club on two occasions of interest from Manchester City. Chelsea noted it came at a time when City boss Pep Guardiola had said Maresca was the best manager in the league. Maresca had also notified the club of interest from Juventus, as well as his willingness to stay despite interest from two of Europe's biggest clubs.He indicated speculation would end if he was handed a new contract. He was only 18 months into his initial deal and contracted until 2029.Difficulties remained in his working relationship with the Chelsea ownership.The Italian was encouraged to rotate his squad, but often felt that when he did so in the Premier League, they dropped points. He openly urged reporters to question the club's hierarchy but there was frustration each time Maresca sought to make his complaints public rather than discussing internally first.He later admitted his comments after the Everton match were premeditated - rejecting the club's claim they were an emotional outburst after a tense match. After winning two trophies in his first two seasons, Maresca wanted to be seen as more than a project-focused manager, and believes the club stopped him raising his profile.The Italian wanted to take on some external engagements and had floated the idea of publishing a book but was blocked by the club - though this is a claim a source close to Maresca denies. He also spoke at Il Festival dello Sport - an event in Italy organised by La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper - without their permission.He also made public that he disagreed with the club not signing a central defender after Levi Colwill injured his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season. The club's hierarchy explained that doing so could prompt academy prospect Josh Acheampong to request a transfer, which ultimately led Maresca to back down.Those close to Maresca, who has switched agents from the Wasserman agency to Jorge Mendes, made it known he was weighing up his future.The last week seemed to be the turning point in Maresca's mind, with Chelsea more keen to make any change of manager in the summer. The home supporters, who Maresca holds in high regard, booed his decisions to take off Cole Palmer in a defeat by Aston Villa and the draw with Bournemouth. Maresca was reportedly told by the medical department he needed to make that change, despite insisting in his news conference his star attacker could complete 90 minutes if he wanted to.All of this after a positive start...After Maresca's side beat Cardiff City in the Carabao Cup in December, supporters chanted his name.They hadn't done so as openly since appearing to be mounting an unlikely title challenge last season, when fans also sang 'We've got our Chelsea back'.But a disappointing run followed, and supporters turned on Maresca both inside the stadium and on social media.Part of the criticism was Maresca seemed a distant, project-focused manager, as fans struggled to move on from the very different and successful era under Roman Abramovich's stewardship.Though he won the Club World Cup, many supporters disliked his communication style and slow, patient football - and influential fans said chants in support of Maresca were largely a protest against the club's BlueCo ownership.That is why Chelsea continued efforts to convince supporters Maresca was the right manager and that the ownership's ultra long-term approach would eventually bring sustained success.Key figures at the club admired Maresca's style of play, insisting it improved players, and that any successor would adopt a similar approach. Further progress was made with team spirit after Mauricio Pochettino had laid the foundations.Regular starters broadly liked Maresca, but - perhaps inevitably - he was less popular on the fringes of the squad. There were complaints after one-off tactical missteps. One player questioned their man-to-man marking approach in a heavy defeat at Manchester City in January 2025, and Maresca said he needed to coach better after a home loss to Brighton, when Chelsea had a player sent off.The club's only real concern in his first season was that he had played down Chelsea's chances of Champions League qualification too much - alienating ambitious fans. There was also a curious moment at the Club World Cup when he awkwardly refused to praise Mexican set-piece coach Bernardo Cueva to a compatriot in the media, despite previously praising coaches closer to him.Maresca also adopted a cold, aggressive tone towards Chelsea's so-called 'bomb squad'. Initially, it proved useful - leaving unwanted players in no doubt they had to leave. But when players such as Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi failed to secure transfers, the approach became counterproductive, as the Blues have a legal obligation to look after the interests of all players on their books.Sources close to Maresca say he felt he deserved backing similar to that enjoyed by Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool and even Ruben Amorim during his struggles at Manchester United - including a say in shaping the project. Arteta, for example, has significant influence over Arsenal's transfer policy.But at Chelsea, the project is king - and the club are more comfortable seeing another manager slot in, rather than ceding any control.Can Chelsea move forward?Chelsea face a packed January schedule across four competitions.They begin with Sunday's Premier League trip to the Etihad, with a series of London derbies - home and away - against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Brentford and West Ham before the end of the month.In addition, they have an FA Cup third-round tie away to Charlton, a Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal, and two Champions League fixtures - at home to Pafos and away to Napoli.Chelsea realistically need to win both European games to avoid the play-off round and secure a top-eight finish in the league phase.The fifth place they occupy in the Premier League may be enough to secure a return to the Champions League for the 2026-27 season.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMost of Friday's papers lead with the fire at a Swiss ski resort bar which has killed dozens of people. \"Horror on the dancefloor\" is the headline for the Daily Star, which reports that British people are \"feared to be among the dead\" following the incident in Crans-Montana in south-west Switzerland.  More than 100 other people are injured, many of them critically, following the \"horror movie\" inferno at the New Year's Eve party in Le Constellation bar, the Daily Express reports. Witnesses tell the paper that the fire could have been started by candles or sparklers.The sparklers that caused the fire were attached to champagne bottles, according to the Sun's lead. Families face an \"unbearable wait\" of days for the bodies of victims to be identified. The fire is \"one of the worst tragedies\" that Switzerland has ever faced, according to the country's president. The i Paper reports that neighbouring countries are offering to \"lend support\" in treating patients, after local hospitals were overwhelmed with victims.The Daily Mail reports that the Foreign Office is on standby to assist any British nationals caught up in the tragedy, after Swiss officials confirmed international citizens were among the dead. Separately, the paper is one of several to feature a photo of the host of The Traitors, Claudia Winkelman, which returned to screens last night with a shake-up of the usual format.Switzerland will hold five days of mourning following the inferno, the Guardian reports, after the country's president vowed to ensure an incident of this kind never happens again. The King and Queen have offered their condolences to the victims of the fire, according to the Times, with the King also praising \"heroic first responders and selfless emergency services\". The paper notes that eight French nationals and sixteen Italian nationals are missing. \"New Year horror inferno\" is the headline for the Daily Mirror, which also features a photo of waitresses carrying champagne bottles with sparklers through Le Constellation bar. The Daily Telegraph front page features a photo of the moment the blaze began spreading across the ceiling of the bar's basement. It adds that the fire likely \"triggered the release of combustible gases that ignited violently\".Finally, the fire in Switzerland features on the front page of the Financial Times, but the paper leads on plans by three US tech giants to launch initial public offerings (IPOs) \"as early as this year\". IPO preparations for SpaceX, OpenAI and Anthropic are \"raising hopes of record returns for their investors and advisers\", the paper writes. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianandAlys DaviesTwo people are reported to have been killed during growing unrest in Iran on the fifth day of protests over the soaring cost of living.Both the semi-official Fars news agency and human rights group, Hengaw, said people had died during clashes between protesters and security forces in the city of Lordegan, in south-western Iran.On Thursday videos posted on social media showed cars set on fire during running battles between protesters and security forces. Many protesters have called for ending the rule of the country's supreme leader. Some have also called for a return to the monarchy.Thursday marks the fifth day of protests in cities across the country, sparked by a currency collapse.Videos verified by BBC Persian show protests in the central city of Lordegan, the capital Tehran and Marvdasht in the southern Fars province taking place on Thursday.Fars reported that in Lordegan two people were killed, citing an informed official. The report did not specify whether those killed were protesters or members of the security forces.Rights group Hengaw said the two killed were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.BBC Persian has not been able to independently verify the deaths.Separately state media said a member of the security forces linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) was killed in clashes with protesters on Wednesday night in the city of Kudasht, in the western Lorestan province. The BBC has not been able to verify this and protesters say the man was one of their number and was shot dead by the security forces. A further 13 police officers and Basij members were injured by stone throwing in the area, the state media report said.Schools, universities and public institutions were closed across the country on Wednesday after a bank holiday was declared by authorities in an apparent effort to quell the unrest. It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "Amber severe weather warnings for snow and ice have been issued by the Met Office with numerous other yellow warnings across the United Kingdom as we start the new year.Arctic air is spreading across the UK with the beginning of a lengthy period of colder weather.With lower temperatures, amber cold health alerts from the UK's Health Security Agency (UKHSA) cover the whole of England.There could be some disruption to travel plans as the wintry weather and warnings continue into the weekend.New year revellers in southern England saw temperatures below freezing around midnight and there was a widespread frost on the first morning of 2026.Overnight lows fell to -6.2C in Bournemouth and -2.5C in Cardiff, with temperatures widely below zero elsewhere across southern England and South Wales.Further north, cloud and patchy rain prevented most areas from falling below freezing but with colder Arctic air moving in, heavy snow has begun to fall in Northern Scotland.With snow showers expected in Northern Scotland, a Met Office yellow warning is in force until 23:59 on Friday where there'll widely be around 2-5cm, locally up to 15cm of snow.But with heavier and more frequent snow in Angus, Perth and Kinross, Grampian, Aberdeenshire, Moray and parts of the Highlands, a more severe amber warning will come into effect at 12:00 GMT Friday until 12:00 Saturday.Accumulations of 10-20cm are likely at low levels with 30-40cm possible on high ground with some drifting and blizzards.Delays on the roads with the risk of vehicles becoming stranded are possible.Some rural communities could also be cut off, according to the Met Office.Elsewhere on New Year's Day cloud and rain will clear southward leaving a lot of dry and sunny weather.But, with a strong northerly wind it will feel cold despite temperatures of 1 to 7C.Amber cold health alerts from the UKHSA for the whole of England will be in place until 12:00 on 6 January.The alerts warn of a rise in deaths particularly among elderly and vulnerable people.Other consequences of cold weather include temperatures inside hospitals and care homes dropping below the levels recommended for assessing health risks, and challenges for people keeping indoor temperatures at the recommended 18C, according to the UKHSA.Overnight into Friday an area of rain, sleet and snow will spread through Northern Ireland, Wales, parts of north-west England, the Midlands and southern England.A Met Office yellow warning has been issued for large parts of England and Wales from midnight on Friday until 12:00 GMT on 2 January.A separate yellow warning is in place for Northern Ireland between midnight and 10am on Friday,Snowfall may last a couple of hours, with 1-2cm possible at low levels and up to 5cm of snow over the higher ground of Wales and the southern Pennines so new year travel disruption is possible.Another area of snow showers will feed in across eastern coastal areas England during Saturday.Here, another Met Office yellow warning has been issued for all of Saturday where around 1-3 cm of snow is likely to accumulate quite widely, with 5-8 cm possible in places such as the North York Moors.Meanwhile the frequent snow showers will continue in northern Scotland right through until the weekend.Strong winds on Saturday will bring blizzards and drifts of snow with the north-west Highlands and Grampians perhaps seeing as much as 60cm of snow by the end of the weekend.An additional Met Office yellow warning is in force for northern and western Scotland covering the whole weekend.Temperatures will be around 3-5C at best with some parts of Scotland and northern England experiencing 'ice-days' where temperatures won't rise above freezing.These low temperatures with widespread overnight frosts are expected to continue well into next week.Stay up to date with the latest forecast on the BBC Weather website or app as details are likely to change.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSilvia CosteloeCrans-MontanaWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireThere is sheer disbelief on people's faces here, confronted by this tragedy - they just can't believe it.I've been coming to Crans-Montana all my life, and this is a wonderful ski resort that just keeps getting bigger and bigger.There's a lot of building going on all the time. It's a place where there's a lot of money and a lot of great skiing. It's very family friendly and there are lots of children.In the summer they've got golf, in the winter they've got skiing, there are mountain bike trails. It's a really popular destination year round, quite a high-end market, and not the kind of place where you would expect a fire to engulf a bar.Le Constellation is somewhere I used to go to when I was much younger. It's a really classic bar.It's very big and right smack in the centre of Crans just by the cinema, and somewhere a lot of locals as well as tourists would be hanging out.This is a bar where lots of young people went. There will be people who are unsure if those they knew were out there, who are trying to trace them.Earlier today, I was speaking to a woman who asked: \"What is happening in the world if you can't go to a bar now in Crans-Montana?\" A British tourist told me he'd heard all these ambulances and just thought people had taken the drinking too far.LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fire'I hid from a wall of heat': Eyewitnesses describe escapeWhat we know so far about how the fire broke outBut, of course, what it actually involved is this horrible tragedy.It's hard to imagine that something like that would happen here, in a place where there's money, very good levels of health and safety, great infrastructure and where police arrived at the scene pretty much immediately.ReutersPeople leave flowers outside Le ConstellationThis morning I woke up to go skiing, but when I saw what had happened I came to the scene instead.The cordoned off area is usually the beating heart of Crans. Initially it was incredibly quiet. I got there before they had erected this huge wall outside the bar. In the early hours of New Year's Day, people were sleeping off their hangovers and their partying, so the police presence gave the scene an almost eerie quality.Now more and more media tripods are going up. People started waking up - some had their skis on - and they all just came up against the cordon and asked what was going on. Some people had not heard yet.Increasingly however small huddles of people are talking about it. Some people have been sharing their stories of a really tragic and horrific night - how they saw people with severe burns, and how they escaped the burning bar by smashing a window.Others are looking in total disbelief at the police cordon in this very well-to-do Swiss Alpine resort. The size of the cordon, the amount of disruption and the number of closed roads all indicate a major disaster.It's just completely shocking.",

    "body": "1 day agoPhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterYoung children from struggling families in some parts of England will be offered vaccinations at home to protect them from preventable diseases, the health secretary has said.The pilot scheme, announced on Thursday as part of a drive to increase vaccine uptake, will see health visitors trained to spend more time with small numbers of families who could fall through the cracks of the NHS.Wes Streeting told the BBC that children's healthcare had not been given the priority it deserved.The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said it was \"a national scandal\" that more than half a million children faced long waits to access health services in England.In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Streeting said he was \"shocked\" by what he described as a lack of focus on children's health when he was in opposition.\"As human beings, it is in our nature to prioritise children. You talk to the overwhelming majority of parents, good parents, they will take bullets for their children,\" the health secretary said.\"There is that kind of innate sense of 'I will do everything I can to protect my child'. I don't think that's reflected sufficiently in the state,\" he added.The pilot scheme was part of that aim, he said, targeting families who are not signed up to a GP surgery or face language barriers, travel costs or childcare issues which stop them getting to a doctor.Uptake of childhood vaccines has declined over the past 10 years - no jabs met the 95% coverage target for children aged five and below, according to the latest data.Twelve areas in London, the Midlands, the North East and Yorkshire, the North West, and South West will test the approach over the next year.The government said all other families should continue to have children vaccinated at their local surgery.Streeting said there had been a decline in the number of health visitors and community nursing over a number of years, and that government was developing a workforce plan to address recruitment.Health visitors are registered nurses or midwives who have additional training in community public health nursing. They work with families with a child aged five and under to identify health needs.In response to Streeting's comments, the Conservatives accused Labour of having \"no plan for children's health or the health service as a whole\". \"Labour are trying to distract from their dismal failures by pointing the finger at the last government,\" shadow health secretary Stuart Andrew said.Professor Steve Turner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, welcomed the plan and called on the health secretary to \"right the wrongs of the past\".Addressing NHS waiting times, he said it was now a \"matter of routine\" that children were not being seen by health professionals within the NHS's 18-week target, adding that he was \"particularly astounded\" that a quarter of children wait more than a year for community treatment, compared with just 1% of adults.\"Long waits for community and elective care are unacceptable at any age, but this is especially true for children where delays can cause irreversible and lifelong harm if care isn't provided during critical developmental windows,\" Prof Turner said.He added that the unequal treatment of adults and children \"must end\" by tackling obesity, protecting mental health, reducing exposure to nicotine and boosting vaccinations in children.Children up to the age of six across the UK are to be offered vaccine protection against chickenpox free on the NHS from January 2026.",

    "body": "'I hid from a wall of heat': Eyewitnesses describe escape from Swiss bar inferno20 minutes agoSilvia Costeloe and Ben TobiasCrans-Montana and LondonEPA/ShutterstockThis story contains details some readers may find upsetting. \"I thought my little brother was inside so I came and tried to break the window to help people to exit, and after that I went in.\"The 18-year-old man, who did not want to give his name, was speaking to the BBC after a huge fire at a New Year's Eve party in the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana rapidly turned what was an evening of celebration into a nightmare.Police say around 40 people died when the blaze broke out in a bar called Le Constellation at around 01:30 local time (00:30 GMT) on Thursday. A further 115 more were injured, mainly with severe burns.LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fireDisbelief as tragedy hits Swiss ski resort on New Year's DayWhat we know so far about how the fire broke outThe eyewitness told the BBC he was close to the bar when he heard a big explosion, followed by a lot of smoke.As others tried to escape, he went in, looking for his brother. Once inside, he described a scene of horror.\"I saw people burning... I found people burning from head to foot, no clothes anymore,\" he said, adding: \"It was very shocking.\" His brother was unharmed.\"I went in this bar every day this week - the day I didn't go, it burned,\" he said.Video shows moment Swiss bar fire appears to startFirefighters and medics quickly took over, he said, but he tried to help where he could, offering water and clothes to the injured.Just minutes earlier, locals and tourists were celebrating the arrival of 2026 during one of the busiest holiday periods of the year for Alpine ski resorts.Le Constellation is a large bar with space for around 300 people spread over two floors and a terrace, although it is not known how many people were in the bar at the time.Two French women, Emma and Albane, told French media outlet BFMTV that they were inside when the fire started.They said they believed it began when a waitress put \"birthday candles\" on top of some champagne bottles.\"In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood,\" they said, adding that the flames \"started to rise very quickly\".Evacuation was \"very difficult\", Emma and Albane said, because the escape route out of the room they were in was \"narrow\" and the stairs leading outside were \"even narrower\".\"We were very lucky,\" they added, claiming there were \"about 200 people trying to get out within 30 seconds through some very narrow steps\".Another teenager who was inside the bar told the BBC how he was forced to hide from a \"wall of heat\" before managing to escape up the stairs.Still, he could not get out so tried to break a window with a table. But it was only when he used his foot to smash through the glass that he was able to make it out alive.Valais Cantonal PoliceInside the bar after the fireThe intensive care unit at the nearest hospital quickly filled up and some patients have been sent elsewhere for treatment, including to Milan in neighbouring Italy. Among those who heard the tragedy unfold was Oleh Paska, who was visiting Crans-Montana with his wife and child.He told the BBC they had just celebrated the New Year in their hotel room around 50m (160ft) from the bar when they heard a series of explosions, which they initially thought were firecrackers. They heard someone crying outside but thought at first that a fight had broken out. It was only when emergency services began to arrive, with the \"different types of sirens\" signalling the arrival of ambulances, police and firefighters, that they realised something was wrong. Daniella, from Milan, who has a holiday home on the street parallel to bar, also watched the horror unfold.Walking home with her husband from a dinner, she started smelling smoke near the bar and saw a jacket completely burnt on the floor. \"People were running in all directions, screaming and crying. I saw several people being carried out on stretchers,\" she told the BBC. \"A young man came up to me and said he'd seen hell - things he would never forget. And then I just froze.\"After returning to her apartment, she said they could \"hear the screams all night – it was terrible\".One student, who did not want to be identified, arrived at the bar with his friend as \"people started running outside, smoking and burned\".Wanting to help, the student told the BBC he rushed to a nearby restaurant, where the manager had ushered in some of the injured to offer them water until ambulances arrived.\"Everywhere hurts\", one of them told the student, he recalled.\"Some of them were just shouting. Just shouting. Nothing else. Some of them didn't say anything, they were just lying on the floor.\"ReutersAn atmosphere of shock hung over the town on Thursday, after the scenes of chaos and tragedy overnight. Italy's ambassador to Switzerland has said it could take weeks for all of the victims to be identified, with the country's foreign minister saying identification would be difficult due to the severe burns.For now, friends and relatives nervously wait for news of loved ones. An Italian man said one of his friends who was in the bar at the time was \"burned all over\", while another was taken to Zurich by helicopter. \"Another friend of ours... last night we had no news, he couldn't be found,\" he told Italian public broadcaster Rai News. \"My friends and I, we haven't slept last night, we've barely eaten,\" he added.

    "body": "15 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterUS Southern CommandA screengrab from a video posted by US Southern Command shows a small vessel in the sea with what appears to be debris floating nearby.The US military says it struck two boats it alleges were carrying drugs on Wednesday, killing five people on board.US Southern Command did not say where it had carried out the latest strikes but US forces have been targeting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific for the past three months. Wednesday's strike came a day after the US targeted what it said were \"three narco-trafficking vessels travelling as a convoy\", killing at least three people.The Trump administration has cast its operations as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September. That first attack has come under particular scrutiny from lawmakers in Washington since it emerged that US forces struck the targeted boat twice.Two people who had survived the first strike and were clinging to the hull of their boat were killed in the second. Some lawmakers expressed concern that the \"double-tap\" strike breached the rules of engagement. In its post announcing the strike on a convoy of three boats carried out on 30 December, US Southern Command said that there had been a number of survivors, without specifying how many.It said that \"the remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels\". It added that the US Coast Guard had been \"immediately notified\" to search for the survivors.Reuters news agency reports that it was told by a US official who asked to remain anonymous that eight survivors were being searched for.It is not yet clear if any of them have been found. The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs but in its most recent post, Southern Command again insisted that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".",

    "body": "Government to defend decision to strip Begum's UK citizenship16 hours agoSuzanne LeighSam Tarling/Getty ImagesThe home secretary will \"robustly defend\" the decision to strip Shamima Begum of her British citizenship, as European judges scrutinise the move, according to a government source.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called for an investigation, but a government source said the decision had already been upheld by UK courts.Ms Begum was 15 when she travelled from east London to the Middle East, to a territory held by the Islamic State group, where she married a fighter.Now 26, she was subsequently stripped of her British citizenship on the grounds that she posed a threat to national security but her lawyers say this failed to consider whether she was a victim of grooming and trafficking.The ECHR has asked the Home Office whether ministers at the time considered whether Ms Begum had been a victim, and whether the UK had obligations to her.But a government source said: \"The home secretary will robustly defend the decision to revoke Shamima Begum's citizenship, which has been tested and upheld time and again in our domestic courts.\"The home secretary will always put this country's national security first.\"In a document published by the ECHR earlier this month, it states that Ms Begum is challenging the decision to revoke her British citizenship under Article 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights - prohibition of slavery and forced labour.The case was lodged in December 2024 after the UK's Supreme Court denied her the chance to challenge the decision.The four questions posed by judges in Strasbourg to the Home Office, include: \"Did the Secretary of State  have a positive obligation, by virtue of Article 4 of the Convention, to consider whether the applicant had been a victim of trafficking, and whether any duties or obligations to her flowed from that fact, before deciding to deprive her of her citizenship?\"Ms Begum was born in the UK to parents of Bangladeshi heritage and was 15 when she left Bethnal Green, east London, with two schoolfriends in 2015 to support the Islamic State group.She had married an Islamic State fighter soon after arriving and went on to have three children, none of whom survived.She was later found in a refugee camp in Syria and a tribunal ruled in February 2020 that because she was \"a citizen of Bangladesh by descent\" removing her British nationality would not make her stateless.A series of appeals were made, ending in the decision that she would not be allowed to challenge it at the Supreme Court.Lawyer Gareth Pierce, who is representing Ms Begum, said it was \"impossible to dispute\" that a 15-year-old was \"lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to Isil-controlled territory\".She added: \"It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.\"It has already been long conceded that the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, who took the precipitous decision in 2019 very publicly to deprive Ms Begum of citizenship, had failed entirely to consider the issues of grooming and trafficking of a school child in London and of the state's consequent duties.\"The Conservatives said Ms Begum should not be allowed to return to the UK \"under any circumstances\".Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Ms Begum \"chose to go and support the violent Islamist extremists\".He added: \"She has no place in the UK and our own Supreme Court found that depriving her of citizenship was lawful.\"It is deeply concerning the European Court of Human Rights is now looking at using the ECHR to make the UK take her back.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoJaroslav LukivNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThorbjørn Jagland's lawyer promised his client's full co-operation with the investigationPolice in Norway have opened a corruption investigation into the country's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland over his alleged links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A special Norwegian police unit which is analysing newly released Epstein files in the US said the 75-year-old was suspected of \"aggravated corruption\". Police said they had already asked the country's foreign ministry to lift his immunity, which he enjoys because of his past role as a senior foreign diplomat. Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent 10 years as secretary general of the Council of Europe. His lawyer said they would fully co-operate with the investigation.Pål K. Lønseth, head of Økokrim - the economic crime unit investigating Jagland - said: \"We consider there are reasonable grounds for investigation, given that he held the positions of chair of the Nobel Committee and Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the period covered by the released documents.\"Among other things, Økokrim will investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position.\"The police added that further details would be given \"at a later stage\".Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said it was \"important that the facts of this case are brought to light\".He added that Oslo would ask the Council of Europe for Jagland's immunity to be revoked.Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet welcomed the opening of the investigation.\"Based on what we have found so far, we are confident of the outcome,\" he told Reuters news agency. Separately, Brosveet told Norway's VG news site that he and his client would submit \"the key findings and documentation we have to Økokrim as soon as practically possible\".Jagland was Norway's prime minister in 1996-97, and the secretary general of the Council of Europe in 2009-19.He also chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2009-15.",

    "body": "14 hours agoBecky Morton,political reporterandPaul Seddon,political reporterReutersLord Mandelson was appointed as the UK's ambassador in Washington in December 2024Documents relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US are due to be released, following pressure from MPs.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has acknowledged the vetting process included discussion of Lord Mandelson's continued relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after he was convicted.However, he has accused Lord Mandelson of lying throughout the process and misrepresenting the extent of their relationship.The BBC understands Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.It was essentially a two-stage process: an initial due diligence check prior to his appointment, followed by security vetting. So how did it work? Due diligenceThe due diligence check was carried out by a team at the Cabinet Office on behalf of Downing Street, as the prime minister was responsible for the appointment.The point of this check is to identify reputational risks or potential conflicts of interests that may need to be considered during the hiring process. Sir Chris Wormald, the UK's top civil servant, has previously confirmed to MPs that this was largely based on public information, such as media reports.At the time, it was public knowledge that the peer had maintained his relationship with Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor in 2008.In 2023, the Financial Times reported emails suggesting he stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2009, while the financier was in jail.The only non-public information that featured, Sir Chris added, were records of a meeting Lord Mandelson facilitated between Epstein and Sir Tony Blair that have since been disclosed by the National Archives.Lord Mandelson's file included information about his previous roles inside and outside government, and his \"professional and financial relationships\".His prior relationship with Epstein was listed as a reputational risk, Sir Chris added, alongside his previous two resignations as a minister during the last Labour government. Follow-up questionsAfter reviewing the file, No 10 sources said Sir Keir asked Lord Mandelson to address three specific questions, which were sent to him via email by the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.These questions were: why has he continued contact with Epstein after he was convicted? Why was he reported to have stayed in one of Epstein's homes while the financier was in prison? And was he associated with a charity founded by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell that the financier had backed?At the time, his answers were considered sufficient for him to be appointed to the role, meaning he then underwent security vetting. No 10 will no doubt face pressure to release them as part of the disclosure process approved by MPs.Security vettingIn addition to providing information about his private interests, Lord Mandelson would have undergone security vetting before taking up the role.The Foreign Office, which is responsible for Britain's overseas embassies, says all ambassadors are required to go through developed vetting (DV), the most intrusive process required to access the most secret government information.Security vetting is carried out by United Kingdom Security Vetting (UKSV), a specialist agency within the Cabinet Office.The process is designed to make sure those being vetted are unlikely to abuse their access to secret material, or be subject to blackmail or bribery.According to government guidance, those undergoing DV are required to fill out various questionnaires including information about their personal finances, internet use, medical conditions, and email addresses they hold.Several checks are carried out, including on candidates' credit history and to check if they have any criminal records. Those being vetted also have to undertake an interview with a specially trained vetting officer, which can cover areas including candidates' health, friendships, family and sexual history. The UKSV decides whether or not to award security clearance, and can attach mitigations, such as being prevented from seeing certain information.The results of this vetting are kept within a tight circle and only the vetting agency and the security team can see the contents. Ministers, including the prime minister, never see the details.Ultimately, Lord Mandelson was announced as the UK's ambassador to the US in December 2024.However, after less than a year in the role, he was sacked last September following the emergence of new emails revealing supportive messages he sent to Epstein after he pleaded guilty to sex offences.The government said the depth of their relationship was not known when he was appointed.However, the PM is now facing questions over whether the information in the public domain was enough to raise alarm bells.

    "body": "2 hours agoScott DuffieldEPA/ShutterstockThree African countries have agreed to take back foreign offenders and illegal migrants after the UK Home Secretary threatened them with visa penalties.A month after the threat from Shabana Mahmood, Namibia and Angola agreed to cooperate on returns. The Home Secretary has now also secured cooperation from the DRC.\"My message is clear, if foreign governments refuse to accept the return of their citizens, then they will face consequences,\" she said following the agreement.The UK government had previously warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) if their governments did not improve co-operation on removals.The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto. It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their \"unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes\".While setting out changes to the UK's asylum system in November, Mahmood warned visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with returns policies. Penalties included an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.Following the agreement with the three countries, Mahmood said: \"Illegal migrants and dangerous criminals will now be removed and deported back to Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\"\"I will do what it takes to secure our order and control to our borders,\" she added.The government says over 3,000 people from these three countries could be eligible to be removed or deported due to the cooperation.The Home Secretary has indicated that ​countries which refuse to work with the UK on returns cannot expect a normal visa relationship, with further threats expected for lack of cooperation.It is understood that India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Somalia and Gabon are all resistant to returns deals and it is possible that the government could look at sanctions for those countries.",

    "body": "Increase school funding to meet need for special education, MPs urge4 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterPA MediaEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson is trying to build a consensus around the SEND reformsSchool funding for special educational needs (SEND) should be increased and protected to meet the rise in demand for support, a group of MPs has said, as ministers consider major reforms.The cross-party group of mostly Labour MPs called on the government to \"align funding to need\" and give schools \"inflation-proofed\" budgets in its plan to overhaul SEND provision in England.The proposals are challenging for the government, which faces significant pressures from the rising costs of a SEND system, widely considered to be in crisis.The Department for Education (DfE) said it was investing more in schools as it seeks to improve outcomes for children with special educational needs.While the department said school funding is increasing by £1.7bn in 2026-27, budgets appear to be tight once rising SEND costs are taken into account.The government has decided to pay SEND costs currently covered by councils from 2028, a move that is forecast to create a £6bn pressure.In recent analysis, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the government had three options for addressing this pressure: increase education funding, reforms to slow the growth of SEND spending, or cuts.There is a risk of a backlash against reforms among parents and Labour MPs who are worried SEND support could be limited in some way.Labour MP Neil Duncan-Jordan, who rebelled against the government's welfare reforms last year, said any changes to SEND provision had to be \"driven by making the system better, not by saving money\".\"We need buy-in from parents for this to work,\" the MP for Poole said.\"The last thing any government needs is an army of parents who are against them because they think they're making their lives worse.\"Local authorities have a legal duty to meet the needs of eligible pupils but are struggling to afford the mounting costs of this as demand grows. More than 1.7 million children in England have special educational needs and the number has risen considerably in recent years.Public spending on children with high needs has increased from £7.5bn in 2016 to £12bn in 2025, a real-terms rise of 66%.A government policy paper that is expected to propose changes to SEND provision is due to be published in February, after being delayed.The Department for Education launched a survey last year and the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on SEND submitted proposals, which have been seen by the BBC.Ministers 'in listening mode'In the submission, the group said: \"Inflation has eroded the real value of core funding in schools and special places; restoring it and protecting early help budgets will underpin timely support.\"The MPs also said national SEND policy \"should align expectations and funding with the level of need settings are now asked to meet\".The APPG also called for more investment in early years and a national SEND workforce plan.Anything perceived as cuts would alarm many involved in the APPG, a group that is keen to influence Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson as her department prepares the reforms.In recent months, ministers have been meeting Labour MPs from the group to get their input and build support for the reforms, should they be voted on in Parliament.Ministers have faced calls not to scrap education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which are legal documents guaranteeing bespoke support for pupils assessed as having high needs.One MP said ministers are \"in listening mode\".Labour MP Jen Craft said money is not being spent well in the SEND systemLabour MP Jen Craft, a vice-chair of the APPG who is the mother of a disabled daughter with an EHCP, recently met Phillipson to discuss SEND issues.The MP for Thurrock said improving early intervention and making mainstream schools more inclusive could lead to a reduction in high-needs support and save money.\"The system is not necessarily focused on the needs of the children it is supposed to be there to help,\" Craft said. \"There's an enormous amount of money in the system but it's not being spent well.\"She has organised events to gather the views of pupils, parents and teachers on SEND provision in her Thurrock constituency.In a report, she wrote: \"The government should look closely at its plans for SEND funding, particularly the discrepancies between local authorities, the potential to ringfence budgets, and investment in early years to prevent children's needs escalating.\"All parties in Westminster agree the SEND system in England needs reforming.The Conservatives and the Green Party have not set out clear policies.The Liberal Democrats have outlined five fundamental principles that should underpin the coming reform, including a \"fair funding system\" that incentivises schools to accept SEND pupils.Reform UK is developing its own SEND policy and is expected to set out some of its ideas early this year.\"SEND needs reform not more money,\" Reform MP Richard Tice said. \"It has had billions more in recent years and outcomes have not improved at all.\"A DfE spokesperson said the government was spending £200m on giving all teachers SEND training and at least £3bn on creating 50,000 new specialist places.The spokesperson said the SEND reforms \"will be driven by our mission to improve outcomes for all children\".The department, the spokesperson added, was \"laying the groundwork for an inclusive education system where children are supported at the earliest stage and can thrive in a school that meets their needs, close to home\".",

    "body": "15 hours agoErica WitheringtonDisability affairs reporterBBCAlton Towers will not allow some people with conditions like autism, ADHD and anxiety to use their disability queuing system this February half-term.Merlin Entertainments provides a ride access pass to help visitors to its theme parks who have a difficulty queuing because of their disability or medical needs.They say the number of people requesting the pass has been increasing, adding that disabled visitors have said the system \"simply isn't working for them\" and that \"queue times for these guests have increased\".A new restriction will also apply at Chessington World of Adventures and Windsor Legoland, as part of a trial to reduce the number of people who get access to the pass.Neurodiverse people can become overwhelmed or distressed when surrounded by large numbers of people, which can bring on sensory overload or panic attacks.Up until now, people who have a \"difficulty with crowds\" have qualified for the ride access pass, but only those with \"difficulty standing,\" \"level access\" or \"urgent toilet needs\" will do so during the half-term trial. Others will have to queue as normal.Merlin says it offers support to people with difficulty with crowds through \"a range of reasonable adjustments\".'No one likes queuing'Henry Shelford, chief executive of the ADHD UK charity, said \"a group of people will be excluded because of this lack of accommodation\".\"It's different from a child just not being happy about it, because no one likes queuing,\" he said.\"When a kid has ADHD, their energy and their focus makes [queuing] just impossible.\"As an adult with ADHD, I can tell you there's a whole lot of stuff I haven't done because I can't face the queuing.\"I have a need to move all the time, and being penned in in that way is very difficult for me as an adult. And it's near impossible for children and others.\"All visitors to Alton Towers can opt to purchase a \"Fastrack\" pass to skip the queues, but these start at an extra £35 on top of the ticket price. The change follows an update by the disability access card provider Nimbus, which is recognised by many attractions and events.Nimbus has split its former \"standing and queuing\" card section into two separate symbols: \"difficulty standing\" (a physical need) and \"difficulty with crowds\" (often linked to neurodivergence or anxiety).During half‑term, Merlin says new eligibility for the ride access pass is being trialled. Those whose Nimbus card shows only the \"difficulty with crowds\" icon will be asked to visit guest services for personalised support instead. The approach will be reviewed after February before the theme park opens fully in March.Jonathan and Cheryl Willis contacted BBC Your Voice when they heard about the changes to the ride access pass for half-term.They had tickets to go with their son Joshua, who has autism, but say there is no way he will be able to join the main queues.\"It's his special place,\" Cheryl said. \"He has a special interest in rollercoasters - he's going to be absolutely devastated if he can't go.\"Jonathan WillisJonathan and Cheryl Willis say Alton Towers is their son Joshua's \"special place\"Five-year-old Joshua also has mobility issues, but after the changes to the Nimbus card scheme, his parents said he had only been allocated the \"difficulty with crowds\" icon on his card.Cheryl said not being able to take her son to Alton Towers would be particularly difficult as he is not currently in nursery or school, and otherwise struggles to leave the house.\"He's learning to be out and about in the world,\" she said. \"They don't understand how massive a problem this is causing to people like us.\"Rob Smith, chief operating officer at Merlin Entertainments, said growing demand had led to issues for people using the passes, but recognised the suggested eligibility changes had \"raised concerns for some guests\".\"Our commitment to supporting neurodiverse guests and those with mental health needs remains,\" he said. \"We are listening carefully to this feedback and are committed to keeping this approach under review ahead of our main season openings in March.\"We remain deeply committed to creating inclusive experiences and ensuring all guests feel supported when visiting our attractions.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoBruce ThainandTom McArthurGetty ImagesElton John and David Furnish (right) at Paris Fashion Week in JanuaryThe filmmaker and husband of Sir Elton John has said the couple have been \"profoundly affected\" by not knowing how many times they were targeted by the Daily Mail, a court has heard.David Furnish and Sir Elton are among seven people, including Prince Harry, Elizabeth Hurley and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, suing the publisher of that paper and the Mail on Sunday for breaches of privacy.The couple's claim relates to 10 articles published between 2002 to 2015, which they say were a result of unlawful information gathering by the papers.Their publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), denies all allegations of unlawful information gathering.In a witness statement read out at the High Court in London, Furnish said he and his partner had a long and difficult history with the Mail.He said the paper had, despite partly moving with the times, \"published countless judgemental, and narrow-minded stories\" that were \"clearly designed to undermine who we are and how we live our lives\".He said one story, published in December 2010, included the publication of their son's birth certificate before they had received it.\"The world had no idea we were having a baby\", Furnish said, adding that the process leading up to the birth was run \"like a military operation\".\"For The Mail to access it before the parents themselves - it was outrageous, invasive, and upsetting. It left us asking, 'If they can get this, what else can they get?'\"Another article, from August 2015, referred to an urgent ambulance journey during which, Furnish's statement said, \"I had never heard anyone in so much pain as Elton was then\".Referring to the incident, Furnish said \"none of this was publicised - it was completely private\".He said at the time the couple had assumed the information in the article came from a leak \"within the ambulance or hospital, somebody being indiscreet\".\"Elton and I are profoundly affected by the uncertainty of not knowing how many times we were targeted, especially in relation to Elton's medicals\", Furnish said.\"We still don't know what was really done to us,\" he added.ANL strongly denies wrongdoing, with lawyers for the publisher previously telling the court that the claims made by Furnish and Sir Elton are \"unsupported by any evidence before the court and utterly baseless\".The trial continues and is expected to end in March.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorGetty ImagesSome seven to eight million people in the UK take statinsCholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, used by millions, are far safer than previously thought, a major review has found. Leaflets in packs should be changed to reflect this and avoid scaring people off using the life-saving pills, say the authors. Statins do not cause the majority of the possible side effects listed, including memory loss, depression, sleep disturbance, weight gain and impotence, says the team funded by the British Heart Foundation. Meanwhile, they can slash a person's risk of heart attacks and strokes. The results, in The Lancet journal, come from trials involving more than 120,000 people comparing statins with a dummy drug or placebo. Statins are highly effective at lowering \"bad\" LDL cholesterol levels and have been repeatedly proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease - a condition that causes some 10 million deaths worldwide and a quarter of all deaths in the UK, say the researchers from Oxford University. As with any medicine, there can be side effects, but these are few.Reports of adverse effects were almost identical in the placebo group that was not on the medication, suggesting statins are not the cause. None of the patients in the trials knew if the pill they were taking was real or a pretend one.In the review, only four side-effects out of 66 listed were found to have any association with taking statins, and only in a very small proportion of patients.The four were:liver test changesminor liver abnormalitiesurine changestissue swellingThere was no increase in liver disease such as hepatitis or liver failure, suggesting that the liver blood test changes did not lead to more serious liver problems.Statin therapy can sometimes cause muscle damage, but this is rare. They can also cause a small increase in blood sugar levels which might bring on diabetes sooner in people who are susceptible. Again, this is rare. Lead author Prof Christina Reith said worries about statin safety had deterred many people who could benefit from taking them.\"Ongoing confusion and concern about side effects mean many people are not willing to start them or stop them. This is a major issue.\" That's not to say people do not experience things while on them,\" she added, \"but we now have really good evidence that statins are not the cause of common problems.\"Our study provides reassurance that, for most people, the risk of side effects is greatly outweighed by the benefits.\"Her colleague Prof Sir Rory Collins, who is the review's senior author, said: \"Now that we know that statins do not cause the majority of side effects listed in package leaflets, statin information requires rapid revision to help patients and doctors make better-informed health decisions.\"Prof Bryan Williams, from the British Heart Foundation, suggested many people were missing out on statins due to stories around unproven possible side effects.\"Prescribers have been intoxicated by this negative publicity. \"We are absolutely delighted to see the outcomes of this study. These findings should provide very powerful reassurance,\" Prof Williams said.Experts stress statins save lives, but if you have any problem with your medication you should chat with your doctor.",

Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were called to Milford Haven Comprehensive School in Pembrokeshire at about 15:20 GMT on Thursday.

    "body": "22 minutes agoBBC\"PM battles for survival\" headlines Metro over Sir Keir Starmer's appointment of Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US. At the time of the appointment, it was public knowledge that Mandelson had maintained a friendship with the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor. Sir Keir has told critics \"you're helping Reform\" by discussing the matter, according to Metro. The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. The PM's apology for \"believing Mandelson's lies\" tops the Independent. The paper reports that pressure from Labour MPs is now building \"to sack key aide Morgan McSweeney\".\"Labour 'women in grey suits' may be sent to No 10 to tell PM to resign\", writes the i Paper, a reference to the so-called \"men in grey suits\" who told Margaret Thatcher to resign in 1990. MPs believe the PM is now \"toast\", but Health Secretary Wes Streeting and former Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner \"won't challenge the Prime Minister yet\", according to the paper.The Times leads with the PM being labelled \"gullible and weak\" by former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman. The paper says Sir Keir's apology to Epstein's victims for Mandelson's appointment comes as \"Labour dismay grows\".The Daily Star says Sir Keir is \"in firing line\" over the fallout from the Epstein files. It headlines on \"the spy who failed me\" adding that the PM \"blamed Britain's spies\" for the appointment of Lord Mandelson to the role of ambassador to the US.The Guardian writes that Starmer is \"in appeal to Labour MPs as pressure grows for No 10 reset\". The paper also reports a private jet owned by \"Trump friend\" and \"Florida property tycoon\" Gil Dezer was used for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation flights. \"Starmer apologises to Epstein victims as crisis over Mandelson ties deepens\" headlines the Financial Times, with one minister saying that the PM could see an \"unedifying end\". The paper also splashes on more details from the Epstein files, saying Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor \"touted felon's business during Queen's visit to UAE\".Former Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner has told friends she is \"ready to go\" on a leadership campaign, according to the Daily Mail. \"As Starmer fights for his political life\", she is \"primed to strike\", it adds.The Daily Telegraph reports that an unresolved investigation into Angela Rayner's taxes could thwart any potential bid for the party leadership. Australian actress Margot Robbie is splashed on the front page as the film adaptation of \"Wuthering Heights\" premieres in London - \"it's me, Cathy\", the Telegraph captions the shot.Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney's son has been \"offered Man U deal\" leads the Sun. The \"teen is target\" as the paper headlines \"on me red, son\". \"Daily statins safe for millions more to take\" writes the Daily Express. A major review has found that the \"cholesterol-busting drugs are not responsible for side effects\", it reports.The Daily Mail believes that the former deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, is eyeing Sir Keir's Starmer job. \"I'm ready to go\" is its headline, reflecting what she's said to have told one Labour MP as the prime minister, in the paper's words, \"fights for his political life\". But the Daily Telegraph reports some MPs, including allies of the former deputy prime minister, believe she may be unable to stand while she awaits the outcome of an HMRC inquiry into her failure to pay a £40,000 stamp duty bill on a flat.The Daily Mirror says there is a \"Keir and present danger\" to the prime minister's tenure because of Lord Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. According to the i Paper, Labour MPs are \"wargaming\" how to get rid of Sir Keir. The paper says they are considering sending a delegation of senior female MPs to Downing Street to tell him to stand down as Tory men in grey suits told Margaret Thatcher to go in 1990.The Times reports that Sir Keir Starmer, his ministers and advisers will be forced to disclose all communication with Lord Mandelson before and after his appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US. The disclosure is expected to be the biggest release of previously confidential government documents since the Covid inquiry. The paper says the release has the potential to be \"politically explosive\".\"Daily statins safe for millions more to take\", declares the main headline in the Daily Express. The paper says a \"landmark study\" has found \"incontrovertible\" evidence that the drugs are not behind conditions such as memory loss, dementia and depression. Writing in the Express, Professor Bryan Williams of the British Heart Foundation says there's \"absolutely no doubt\" that \"statins save lives\". But the paper's editorial says while medicines play a \"crucial role\" for many \"getting active is the prescription\" they need.Related Internet Links",

However, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court convicted him following a trial.Skebas, formerly of Thorold Street, Boston, was remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on 25 February. Lincolnshire PoliceDeividas Skebas will be sentenced at Lincoln Crown Court on 25 FebruaryLilia had been playing with a hula hoop with a friend outside her mother's shop on Fountain Lane.Shortly after 18:20 BST, the pair were approached by Skebas who reached out and stabbed Lilia once in the chest.The 'heinous' child killing that shook a town and the fight for justiceHer mother, Lina Savicke, remembers hearing Lilia call her name before she rushed into the street to see her daughter still clutching the hoop and, moments later, collapsing into her arms.The court heard that, despite the efforts of an off-duty police officer, doctors and paramedics, Lilia died within an hour of being stabbed. Skebas, who had no connection to Lilia, was arrested at his home two days after the attack, and the paring knife he had recently bought from a local shop was found behind a radiator.He was found unfit to stand trial in the months after the stabbing and was later transferred to Rampton high security hospital.In July 2023, a jury found Skebas carried out the act of killing Lilia, and, two years later, following an improvement in his mental health, it was decided he could face a murder trial.During the trial, the jury was told Skebas was assessed by three psychiatrists.All three doctors agreed Skebas had schizophrenia and was showing symptoms of psychosis on the day he killed Lilia.But the prosecution rejected Skebas's claim of diminished responsibility and alleged the killing was \"deliberate and planned\". Lina SavickeLilia was a \"beautiful soul with a strong character\", her stepfather Aurelijus Savickas saidProsecutor Christopher Donnellan KC told the court it was a \"wicked act\", adding Skebas knew he was \"killing a child\".The jury found Skebas guilty of Lilia's murder by an 11 to one majority verdict after deliberating for more than seven hours.Skebas appeared on a video link from Rampton Hospital to hear the verdict and did not appear to show any emotion.Lincolnshire PoliceDeividas Skebas was arrested in Boston on 30 July 2022, two days after the stabbingHe stared straight ahead as the statement of Lilia's mother, Lina Savicke, was read out.It began by stating Lilia would have turned 13 on Monday this week.\"Over these years of loss, both I and my entire family have lived through so much.\"Tears and pain cannot wash away everything we feel.\"The statement added: \"What parent ever thinks they will have to bury their own child?\" Speaking in court, Aurelijus Savickas, Lilia's stepdad, said: \"I came into her life when she was just three years young. \"From that moment on, we loved our journey together through the good days and the bad.\"I loved her as my own. She was a beautiful soul with a strong character and strong personality.\"Lina SavickeLilia \"loved drawing and painting\" and had a wall in her bedroom where she could paint freely, her stepfather saidAs the family impact statements were read out in court, several people could be seen wiping tears from their faces.The judge Mr Justice Choudhury excused the jury from further jury service for ten years.Addressing them, he said: \"I appreciate it has been a difficult experience for you.\"Det Chief Insp Jennifer Lovett, from Lincolnshire Police, said: \"It's taken us three-and-a-half years to bring Skebas to justice.\"It's not lost on me how difficult that must have been for Lilia's family.\"She added: \"It's been one of our most high-profile investigations that Lincolnshire Police has had.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "11 hours agoAlex KleidermanLouvre MuseumThe Louvre issued the first photos of the crown since the raid, showing the damage it sustainedThe crown of French Empress Eugenie was left crushed after being dropped by fleeing thieves during the raid at the Louvre last October - but is \"nearly intact\" and can be fully restored, the museum has said.Raiders stole an estimated 88 million euros (£76m, $104m) in jewels, but left the diamond-studded headpiece belonging to the wife of Napoleon III on their escape route.The museum has issued the first photographs of the crown since the theft, saying it had been left \"badly deformed\" after the thieves tried to remove it through a narrow hole they sawed in its glass display case.The crown is missing one of eight golden eagles that adorned it but retains its 56 emeralds and all but 10 of its 1,354 diamonds.Louvre MuseumIt added the 19th Century crown would be restored to its original state \"without the need for reconstruction\".An expert committee led by the museum's president Laurence des Cars had been selected to supervise the restoration.The heist took place on 19 October and saw the gang use a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. Louvre MuseumOne of the crown's golden eagles is missing but all the emeralds and most of the diamonds remainTwo of the thieves got inside by cutting through the window with power tools. They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the area, and cut through the glass of two display cases housing jewellery that once belonged to French royalty or its imperial rulers.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for less than four minutes before making their escape on two scooters waiting outside.Police have arrested four male suspects who prosecutors allege are the thieves - but the mastermind behind the raid has not been tracked down. The seven other items of jewellery taken, including a diamond-studded tiara that belonged to Eugenie and necklaces, ear-rings and brooches remain missing.ReutersThe undamaged crown of French Empress Eugenie - seen here in a photograph from 2025",

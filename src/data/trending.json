Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Updated 3 hours agoBBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton already has enough on his plate trying to get the better of AI at predictions, but now he has a WWE superstar on his case too.Newly crowned WWE world champion Drew McIntyre, a Rangers fan, has clashed with former Celtic striker Sutton in the past over their Old Firm allegiances.We would love to see them meet in the wrestling ring but, for now, they will attempt to outdo each other - as well as the BBC readers and AI - by trying to pick the right results for the weekend's 10 Premier League matches.Do you agree with their scores? You can pick your own below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, WWEImage caption, Drew celebrates winning the WWE Championship during SmackDown at Uber Arena in Berlin last weekend. He became the first British and only Scottish world champion in WWE history when he first won the belt in 2020.McIntyre is in the UK for the WWE Live Road to Royal Rumble Tour, which continues at Wembley Arena on Friday, and you can watch each event on Netflix.The 40-year-old landed the WWE world crown for the third time in Berlin last week, but his latest success did not impress Sutton too much.\"Drew is getting on a bit now,\" Sutton said. \"Is he really world champion again at his age?\"Fair play to him for winning it but if he wants to fight me when he's over here then I'd probably give him a tougher test than the people he beat to get his belt.\"Honestly, I reckon I would cause him a problem or two. He's all dumbbells and muscles - I've got the greater all-round core strength... and more brains as well.\"But, let's face it, he has to win things himself because his football club don't win a lot.\"Image source, BT SportImage caption, Drew first challenged Chris to meet him in the ring in 2020, leading Chris to begin training to become a wrestling star... he managed to find a suitable outfit, although he did avoid the actual fightMcIntyre dismissed all of Sutton's claims, and said he would be happy to meet him in the ring - although his suggested venue is not exactly neutral territory.\"Chris lives in opposite world,\" McIntyre laughed. \"What he said is the complete opposite of reality.\"I am the champion of the world - I am not at the start of my career, but I assure you that I am in the best shape of anyone who is 25 years old right now.\"Sutton and I could have a 'pose-off' - take our shirts off - and everyone would burst out laughing at the state he is in. They would be like 'he used to play football? He used to be an athlete? That's absolutely hilarious'.\"And when it comes to the mental aspect, I don't know what kind of education he had but I was still at school until I went to WWE and I got my degree in criminology. I could have got a masters, and I could have got a doctorate.\"So, I am not just brawn over here, I am brains too. Sutton isn't brawn or brains - he can just run his mouth, that's his number one talent, so yeah I'll take him on and I'll smash him! We could have ourselves a special attraction match... at Ibrox.\"Oh, and just to clarify, Rangers have been on a roll recently and we are level on points with Celtic. We are both trying to catch Hearts, so neither of us should be bragging right now, but I can assure you that Rangers are the ones who will do that and win the league this season, because finally we've got a manager [Danny Rohl] who knows what he's doing.\"Chris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. Drew McIntyre was speaking to BBC Norfolk's Rob Butler.The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.Premier League predictionsSaturday, 17 JanuaryOld Trafford, 12:30 GMTWell, I know who is going to win this. I'm just not sure about the score.What on earth is going on at Manchester United? It just seems like they are making it up as they go along.I don't get the thinking at Old Trafford, so I'm probably wrong here, but it looks to me like they are waiting to try to get England boss Thomas Tuchel in the summer, or maybe even United States manager Mauricio Pochettino - who could also be free after the World Cup.In the meantime, here we are with United treading water again. It would have been interesting if Darren Fletcher had won the two games when he was manager - would he still be in charge?We will have to see how caretaker boss Michael Carrick lines United up - whether he plays with a back four and what shape he will use - but I don't see it making much difference against Manchester City.I was at St James' Park on Tuesday and City were really comfortable against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup. That was the first time I've seen Rayan Cherki in the flesh and when he came on you could tell what an intelligent footballer he is.Erling Haaland has only scored once, a penalty, in his past six games and he did not get on the scoresheet when City scored 10 against Exeter in the FA Cup.So he is due a goal, and he usually gets at least one against United - he has scored eight in six league games against them - so they need to find a way of stopping him this time.This is such a tough start for Carrick. I am going to give United a goal for their fans to get excited about, but City will still take the points pretty easily.Sutton's prediction: 1-3Drew's prediction: My brother's team is City, which is hilarious because he is Scottish - but he has supported them since the days of Nicky Summerbee, so it is not like he just got into them when the money came in. 1-3AI's prediction: 1-2Stamford Bridge, 15:00Liam Rosenior's Chelsea looked a bit like Enzo Maresca's Chelsea against Arsenal, with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez playing out from the back.It seems they have got a new manager who is going to play the same way as their old one, but is Rosenior going to be a stickler for doing it at all costs the way Maresca was?It finished 2-2 when these sides met earlier in the season, and it will be close this time too.Brentford are on such a good run that has seem them climb to fifth, three places above Chelsea, but I still fancy the Blues at Stamford Bridge even though they have only won one of their past five games there.Rosenior was without several players through injury, illness and suspension against the Gunners, but he will be hoping to have a few of them back for this one.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Drew's prediction: 2-1AI's prediction: 2-1Elland Road, 15:00Leeds lost out to a bizarre stoppage-time own goal at Craven Cottage in September, but they look a different team now - they have come on so much.Mind you, so have Fulham. The only time Harry Wilson has failed to score recently is when I put him in my Fantasy team, and while I thought they would struggle when some of their players went to the Africa Cup of Nations, the opposite has happened - they have been excellent.I'd usually back Leeds to win at home, but Fulham have proved they can nick a goal and a result on the road so I am going to sit on the fence here.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Drew's prediction: Leeds to win this, but only just. 1-0AI's prediction: 1-1Anfield, 15:00Burnley have picked up three draws in their past five league games so they have not given up the fight against the drop, but they have now gone 12 league games without a win and you have to think they have had it.You still don't really know what kind of performance you are going to get from Liverpool, and they huffed and puffed a little bit to get past Barnsley in the FA Cup, but I am still going to back them here.Liverpool needed a stoppage-time Mohamed Salah penalty to win at Turf Moor in September, but I can see it being a lot more comfortable for Arne Slot's side this time.I remember when Burnley boss Scott Parker lost 9-0 with Bournemouth at Anfield in 2022, and he was sacked the next day.I don't see his side shipping as many goals this time, but Parker is going to be under pressure until the Clarets win again. Maybe that will happen when they are at home to Tottenham next week, because they are not getting anything here.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Drew's prediction: [WWE star] Sheamus loves Liverpool so I am going to go with Burnley. 1-3AI's prediction: 3-0Stadium of Light, 15:00Crystal Palace have not won any of their past nine games in all competitions, and their FA Cup defeat at Macclesfield was a huge embarrassment.Eagles boss Oliver Glasner made changes for that tie which did not work, and the squad depth is clearly not there to cope with this busy time of the season.Looking at Sunderland's results, they were not exactly in great form either before they beat Everton in a penalty shootout to reach round four.The Black Cats are without a win in five league games but the difference with Palace is that they drew four of them and, importantly, they also played well in most of those matches too.Regis le Bris's side have been so strong at home that, along with Palace's poor form, I really have to back them here.As their fans keep on pointing out, I've not done too well at predicting Sunderland scores this season, but I will get one of their results right soon... surely!Sutton's prediction: 1-0Drew's prediction: 0-2AI's prediction: 1-1Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 15:00They are calling this 'El Sackio', because both managers are under so much pressure.Tottenham's home form is miserable, with two wins in 10 league games, and there is so much angst amongst their fans at the moment.Similarly, West Ham's players are probably better off away from home right now because of the animosity from their supporters inside their own stadium, but their away record is just as atrocious with only one win in 10.This is one of those games where I like to wheel out one of my favourite sayings in football - these two teams have been so bad recently that they both could lose.It's certainly hard to make a case for either of them to win it. I am going to go with Spurs, because new signing Conor Gallagher has plenty of energy and will add some thrust and drive to their midfield.But it's a lot easier to predict that it will be a dismal game, with Tottenham booed off after a bang-average performance that means Thomas Frank is still under pressure despite winning.As for Hammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo, he is just going to be in even greater danger of getting the sack.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Drew's prediction: A few of the lads on WWE support Tottenham, and it's not Sheamus's team, so I'll go with Tottenham. 3-0AI's prediction: 2-1City Ground, 17:30Nottingham Forest are out of the FA Cup, but by far their biggest result last week was their win at relegation rivals West Ham to end a four-game losing streak in the league.I don't see Sean Dyche's side getting anything here, though. They lost their two previous home games, against Manchester City and Everton, and Arsenal will make it a hat-trick of home defeats.This is the sort of game that Mikel Arteta's side seem to know how to win. It might be close, but I'd still back the Gunners to find a way.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Drew's prediction: 1-2AI's prediction: 1-3Sunday, 18 JanuaryMolineux, 14:00This is a tough one to call because Wolves will feel like they have a little bit of momentum at last, while I am wondering where Newcastle will get their energy from - and how many fit players they have got left.Wolves are three games unbeaten in the league, including their first win of the season against West Ham, and they even looked like they were enjoying themselves when they beat Shrewsbury in the FA Cup - that has not happened very often at Molineux recently.Newcastle have got a few players out, with Jacob Murphy the latest to be injured in their Carabao Cup defeat by Manchester City in midweek.Eddie Howe's side have climbed to sixth on the back of three straight league wins, but after this they have a huge Champions League game with PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday - so it will be interesting to see what team he picks here.Every game is important for Newcastle, but Howe will need to rest some players at some point. If he does it here, it could cost them. I've changed my mind a few times about the outcome of this one, but I am going to go for a draw.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Drew's prediction: 0-3AI's prediction: 1-2Villa Park, 16:30It must be such a wonderful time to be an Aston Villa fan - they have been on an incredible run and their one defeat in their past 15 games, at Arsenal at the end of the year, has not affected their confidence.Villa drew 0-0 at Everton at the start of the season, but their form has picked up a lot since then - they have stacks of belief, and they have lots of goals in them too.Everton will have Jack Grealish back from suspension to face his old club, which is a boost for them and him.David Moyes certainly won't make it easy for Villa, but I'm still expecting them to win.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Drew's prediction: This will get Sheamus as well, let's go for an Everton win because he loves Liverpool so much. 1-2AI's prediction: 2-1Monday, 19 JanuaryAmex Stadium, 20:00Antoine Semenyo is a huge big miss for Bournemouth now he has joined Manchester City, but they are still an attack-minded team and I always fancy them to score.Brighton are the same, in that they look dangerous when they come forward but can also appear very open.So, this should be a very entertaining game and we should see a few goals too. I just can't pick a winner.Sutton's prediction: 2-2Drew's prediction: 0-0AI's prediction: 2-2How did Sutton get on in the FA Cup?Chris correctly picked the winner in 21 of the 31 third-round ties to have been played so far - Salford versus Swindon was postponed and takes place next week.He got the better of his guest, DJ and producer Shadow Child, who started strongly before going for a few too many shocks - and ended up with 16 correct predictions.AI did better by avoiding predicting pretty much any surprise results whatsoever, for a score of 22, but it is the BBC readers who lead the way as things stand, with a tally of 23.Unsurprisingly, Chris, Shadow Child, AI and most of you lot did not see Macclesfield's amazing victory over Crystal Palace coming... BUT out of 25,000 predictions, more than 1,200 of you did back the Silkmen. Well done to whoever got that one right.\"Humans go for shocks and excitement - AI needs to get a life,\" Sutton said. \"It needs to stop number crunching and get itself down the pub.\"How did Sutton do last time in the Premier League?Chris got four correct results from the 10 midweek Premier League matches in week 21 [which took place 6-8 January] with no exact scores, for a total of 40 points.That was enough to beat the BBC readers, who got two correct results with no exact scores, giving them 20 points.AI did a bit better, with four correct scores including one exact result, meaning it ended up on 70 points.But for the second successive week, the win went to Chris' guest. Tony McGuinness of electronic dance music group Above and Beyond got five correct results with one exact score, for a tally of 80 points.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoMaia DaviesBBC NewsEPA/ShutterstockMachado gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed she will lead the country \"when the right time comes\".\"There's a mission, and we are going to turn Venezuela into that land of grace, and I believe I will be elected when the right time comes as president of Venezuela, the first woman president,\" she told Fox News.Her comments come a day after she gave President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom.The US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on 3 January and removed him to New York to face various drugs and weapons charges. However Trump has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, saying she did not have enough domestic support - despite her opposition movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections. He has instead been dealing with the country's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's vice-president.\"I want to serve my country where I am more useful. I got a mandate, and I have that mandate,\" Machado added.She also visited Congress to meet US senators during her visit to Washington, where her remarks to reporters were drowned out by supporters chanting \"María, presidente\" and waving Venezuelan flags.Meanwhile in Caracas, Rodríguez held a two-hour meeting with the director of the CIA \"at President Trump's direction\" aimed at building trust and communication between the two countries, according to a US official.\"Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries,\" the official said.The same day, Rodríguez said she was not afraid to face the US \"diplomatically, through political dialogue\" during her first state of the union address since becoming interim president.She also said Venezuela needed to defend its \"dignity and honour\" and announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment, in a step away from Maduro's policies.Trump called Rodríguez a \"terrific person\" on Wednesday after the pair spoke on the phone, a conversation the Venezuelan leader called \"productive and courteous\".Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal on Thursday",

    "body": "4 hours agoLucy WilliamsonBashmaq border crossing, Iraqi KurdistanFred Scott/BBCPeople and traffic still regularly cross the Iran-Iraq borderAt the border crossing from Iran into Iraqi Kurdistan, the stern face of Iran's former supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, peers down at the trickle of Iranians leaving the territory.Thick snowflakes confetti the lorries and pedestrians arriving at this remote mountain pass.Metres away, just beyond the border post, an Iranian flag flutters in the snow.Iran has shut down the internet and blocked phone calls into the country, but its borders are still open.Inside the arrivals hall, we find dozens of men, women and children – many arriving to visit family on the Iraqi side of the border. No-one we met said they were fleeing Iran because of the recent protests and government crackdown, but one man – who asked us to hide his identity – told us security forces had shot him during a protest in central Iran last Friday.\"I was hit in the face by seven pellet rounds,\" he said, pointing out several weals and bruises on his face. \"They struck above my eyelid, on my forehead, my cheek, my lip, under my ear and along my jaw. I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out.\"He told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them.\"One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round,\" he told us.  \"His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone.  They're terrified of going to hospital to have it removed.\"Iran's regime has treated these protests as an existential threat.  Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed.But several people here told us that demonstrations had continued, at least into this week. The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere.\"Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran,\" he said.  \"My friends were there.  We were constantly on the phone.  On Tuesday night, the protests were still going on, but I haven't had any updates since then.\"Iranians don't need a visa to cross here, and officials say there is regular traffic back and forth.Another man we spoke to at the border said he had been in Tehran on Wednesday, and seen protesters on the street.  It's not clear what form of protest that was, or how many were taking part.The BBC has seen no hard evidence that street protests are still continuing. Very little footage at all is trickling out, and the reports we heard today are impossible to confirm. The BBC, along with other international media, is barred from reporting inside Iran.Fred Scott/BBCThe Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout more than a week agoThe government's repression largely seems to be working. But the economic problems that sparked this crisis haven't gone away.A teacher from a town close to the border told us she didn't care who the leader was, she just wanted the economic situation to improve.\"We don't want anything more than our basic rights,\" she told me. \"To own a house, to own a car, to have a normal life. My salary lasts 10 days, and I have to borrow money to cover the rest of the month. It's very bad.\"I ask about US President Donald Trump, and his threat of military strikes if the regime kept killing protesters.\"We're waiting to see what Trump does,\" he told me. \"In the meantime, civilians are getting killed.\"The force with which Iran's leaders have crushed this protest signals their weakness.  The regional proxy groups they once used as defences against attack have been weakened by Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and by the fall of the former Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad.And the Israeli-US war with Iran last year has depleted its military capabilities, and left it vulnerable to attack.Hidden behind this mountainous border, Iran's regime is re-imposing its control.But hidden behind that repressive control is the growing fear of the Islamic Republic, unable to meet its people's most basic demands: protection from foreign attacks, and prosperity at home.Additional reporting by Samantha Granville and Maad Mohammed",

    "body": "6 hours agoEmer MoreauandJemma Crew,Business reportersGetty ImagesThe increasing popularity of weight loss jabs presents an \"opportunity\" for the fast-food chain Leon, its boss believes.John Vincent told the BBC the dishes the brand is serving are the \"sort of food people on weight loss jabs want to eat\".Vincent, an original co-founder of the chain, bought the company back from Asda last year. Last month the firm appointed administrators and announced a major restructuring of its 71 restaurants, which employ 1,000 people.Speaking to the BBC's Big Boss Interview podcast, he also set out his plans to revive the chain, which includes opening more restaurants in service stations, airports and train stations, after closing 20 on the High Street.Asked if the rise in weight loss jabs posed a challenge to the chain, Vincent told the BBC he thought \"there is definitely an opportunity for Leon-type food\", which he said was typically low sugar and flavoured with herbs and spices. \"We are actually seeing the food we enjoy eating at Leon, and we used to enjoy serving and we increasingly enjoy serving now, is actually the sort of food people on weight loss jabs want to eat.\"Helping people on the injections get enough protein and maintain their muscle mass \"is just as important as calories I think\", he added.He agreed the impact of the popular appetite suppressing drugs meant Leon would \"definitely\" need to think about portion sizes.Last week, the boss of Greggs said there was \"no doubt\" the drugs have led to people looking for \"smaller portions\", affecting the company's sales.Vincent also spoke about the impact of tax rises, which he said were \"incredibly toxic\" for the hospitality industry.He said the upcoming rises in business rates along with overall cost increases meant the High Street was no longer as profitable. Leon has been losing £10m a year.If taxes on businesses increase further, he said, \"the only people that are going to survive are those selling... food that's not very good quality\".In April, business rates relief for the hospitality sector which came in during Covid will end. At the same time, increases in the rateable value of premises take effect. The Treasury has indicated it will announce further assistance for pubs in the coming days but has faced a backlash from other hospitality businesses over why they are not included. Chancellor Rachel Reeves told a press conference on Wednesday she was \"working with the hospitality sector\". LeonJohn Vincent told the BBC Leon had moved away from its original mission of good-quality fast food for the massesVincent said that traditionally, \"the more fast food units you have, the better the operations, the better the supply chain, the better you can buy, the better your systems can be\".However, he added: \"I'm not sure this is true anymore because of pressure on the market.\"Vincent said he would be initially concentrating on London, plus service stations, train stations and airports, but added the high costs of operating in the capital was making business there \"incredibly difficult\" with \"incredibly high upward-only rents\".He said even though airports in particular take a large slice of a retailer's takings, a 2% profit margin there \"is worth the same as a 6% on the High Street\".\"You might be doing two or three times the revenue in that airport than you might in a High Street location,\" Vincent said.Responding to Vincent's comments, a Treasury spokesperson said: \"We're backing hospitality businesses with a £4.3bn support package to limit bill rises.The spokesperson said this was in addition to \"capping corporation tax at 25%, cutting red tape and taking action on the cost of living to boost high streets\".Aside from rising costs, Vincent feels Leon is struggling because it has drifted from its original mission of good-quality fast food for the masses.The menu started out simple: meatballs, a superfood salad and tapas - relatively healthy offerings at a time when fast food was dominated by burgers, fried chicken and kebabs, Vincent said.But Leon \"lost chutzpah, leadership and confidence\" after it was sold in 2021, which resulted in \"a lack of clarity about what it wants the menu to be\", he said.He has previously said he sympathises with the company's previous owners, because of the challenges that restaurants have faced since the pandemic.\"I think Leon needs to make sense again,\" he said. \"We don't always make sense to people at the moment.\"He plans to bring simplicity back with menu changes this year: \"We do have to, as a brand, realise and remember, we were always about the best food for the most people. \"We were not about posh fast food for posh people. That was never our intention.\"",

Her mother, Sarah Keeling, 45, and passer-by, Mark Ratcliffe, 67, both died after trying to save her.The force said emergency services had attempted to retrieve the body, which was found among the rocks on the beach at Withernsea on Thursday at 08:30 GMT, but was unsuccessful due to tide times and other conditions.Specialist officers have been in contact with Grace's family and have asked people to \"refrain from speculation\" and \"respect their privacy\".Police said emergency services, including HM Coastguard, had cordoned off an area of Holmpton Road and remained at the scene.Det Supt Simon Vickers said: \"Officers and specialist teams have been working to explore every possible option in very complex circumstances to delicately recover the body.\"Due to tide times, conditions and the location, the recovery could not be immediately carried out and has therefore been paused until it is safe to resume.\"Darrin StevensA major search operation was launched on 2 January following reports of people in the waterA major operation was launched involving HM Coastguard, lifeboats and helicopters after calls to the emergency services at about 15:00 GMT on 2 January.Ratcliffe was pulled unconscious from the sea and died at the scene. Sarah Keeling's body was recovered later the same evening.In a tribute, Ratcliffe's family described him as a \"true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".Joanne Gee, a close friend of Sarah Keeling, said the 45-year-old \"left a mark with absolutely everyone she met\".Jasmine Lowe / BBCOne of many heartfelt tributes placed at the scene in WithernseaHumberside Police said no formal identification of the body had taken place but recognised the discovery had followed 13 days of \"extensive searches\" for Grace.Vickers added: \"I appreciate this update will understandably cause concern to members of the public.\"We have a dedicated team of specialists who are doing everything they can in their efforts to carry out the recovery as safely and as quickly as possible.\"Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoKate Whannelpolitical reporterThe Liberal Democrats have proposed introducing film-style age ratings to limit which social media apps children can access.Under the party's plan, platforms that use addictive algorithmic feeds or host \"inappropriate content\" would be restricted to users over 16 years old, while sites with \"graphic violence or pornography\" would be rated 18-plus. This approach, the Lib Dems have argued, would \"avoid the unintended consequences\" of banning all under-16s from using social media, as advocated by the Conservatives. In recent days, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated he is open to the idea of an outright ban, telling reporters that \"all options are on the table\". He said he would be watching to see how a ban recently introduced in Australia was working. The new Australian law, which came into force in December, requires certain social media companies including Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, X and TikTok to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep children off their platforms. In order to ascertain a user's age, the companies can use government-issued identity documents, face or voice recognition or analyse online behaviour to estimate a person's age. The Conservatives have said that, if elected, they would follow the same approach as the Australian government and ban under-16s from accessing social media. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"The internet is a Wild West, social media in particular, we don't want children to be on there.\" However, Victoria Collins, the Liberal Democrats' science and technology spokesperson, said the proposal for a \"blanket ban\" was a \"blunt instrument that doesn't work in a digital age\". She said it showed Conservatives \"just don't trust parents\".The Liberal Democrats have argued that their \"tailored approach\" would allow governments to \"quickly categorise\" newly-emerging social media platforms based on the addictiveness or harmfulness of their content. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Our message to social media giants is clear: if your platform spreads harmful content or relies on addictive and harmful algorithms, you should not be allowed anywhere near our children.\"This issue cannot be kicked down the road any longer.\"The party says that under its proposal, apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would be classified as unsuitable for under-16s \"unless these companies fundamentally rewrite their code to remove addictive algorithmic feeds and inappropriate content\". The age ratings would be enforced by media regulator Ofcom, who could issue fines for companies that do not comply. Peers in the House of Lords could get a chance to vote on the proposal next week, when the Liberal Democrats seek to add it as an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill.During the same debate, a group of cross-party peers will push a different amendment which would prevent under-16s from accessing social media. It has been tabled by Lord Nash, a Conservative former education minister, but is jointly-sponsored by Baroness Benjamin, the Liberal Democrat peer and former children's TV presenter; the Labour peer Baroness Berger and Baroness Cass, an independent member of the House of Lords, who is a paediatrician.Those involved in the amendment are optimistic it will pass.The NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) has urged  peers to oppose a total ban saying \"action is needed but a complex problem requires more than a blanket solution. Bans are not the answer.\"The charity is backing the \"film ratings\" approach, arguing that children and young people should be protected but not \"shut out from the online world and the benefits it can offer for connection, fun, learning and support\". The Molly Rose Foundation - set up in memory of Molly Russell who took her own life at the age of 14 after being exposed to images of self harm and suicide on social media - has also expressed concerns about a social media ban.The charity has warned of \"unintended consequences\" including \"pushing harm to unregulated areas\". Some social media companies have argued that a ban would be difficult to implement and easy for users to circumvent. Apps such as TikTok and Instagram generally restrict accounts to those aged 13 or over.Some of the big platforms also put in place protections for teenagers.For example, teen accounts on Snapchat are private by default and public accounts are only available to those who are 16 or over.  Snapchat has said it will comply with the ban in Australia but warned that \"disconnecting teens from their friends and family doesn't make them safer - it may push them to less safe, less private messaging apps\".

    "body": "55 minutes agoPhil Sim,Scotland political correspondentandJames Delaney,BBC ScotlandGetty ImagesThe Scottish government's bottle return scheme was postponed in 2023A court has thrown out a £50m lawsuit against the Scottish government over its failed deposit return scheme (DRS).Waste firm Biffa claimed a letter from the former Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater in 2022 was akin to a guarantee the plans would go ahead – prompting them to invest millions in the scheme which collapsed a year later.They alleged the detail in the letter was a misrepresentation of the government's position at that time and sought £51.4m in damages.However, judge Lord Sandison rejected the claims, describing the way Biffa interpreted the letter as \"wishful thinking\" on a par with trying to turn \"base metal into gold\".A spokesman for Biffa said it was \"reviewing its position with its legal advisers\".The Scottish government said it could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.Ministers were forced to drop proposals for a Scotland-specific bottle return scheme in June 2023 following a dispute with the UK government.Under the plans, shoppers would be charged an extra 20p to buy products in a single-use bottle or can, which would be repaid when returned to machines.Biffa held talks with the Scottish government over becoming the main logistics partner.In May 2022, Slater, who was then circular economy minister as part of the Greens power-sharing agreement with the SNP, wrote to Biffa after being forced to delay the start date by a year.Biffa said it later signed a 10-year contract with Circularity Scotland, the now-collapsed firm set up to run the DRS, as a \"direct result\" of that letter.The company claimed the letter was an assurance ministers had taken \"all necessary steps to ensure the viability and deliverability of the scheme\" at the time.But the UK government then denied the DRS an exemption under the Internal Market Act, which would have allowed it to proceed in full.A more limited version of the DRS, which excluded glass, was given approval.PA MediaFormer Green minister Lorna Slater wrote to Biffa in May 2022It later emerged Scottish government officials had been aware of the potential issue in 2021 and had known in March 2022 that an application for an exemption would be required.Biffa claimed it was \"disingenuous in the extreme\" for Slater not to mention that in her letter.The former Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, agreed, describing it as \"utterly irresponsible\" to encourage investment without mentioning the \"huge level of risk\".Slater said the letter was not a project update which detailed that risk and was simply designed to reassure the firm that the Scottish government was still committed to the plans.Getty ImagesBiffa claimed the letter was an assurance the scheme would go aheadIn his ruling at the Court of Session, Lord Sandison said a \"reasonable person\" could not have believed the letter gave \"any assurance as to the legislative sufficiency of the scheme\".He said if Biffa wanted more information about potential legal hurdles with the scheme, they should have asked for it, but \"no such enquiries were made\".Lord Sandison also denied Biffa's claim the Scottish government \"deliberately sought to conceal\" potential issues with the Internal Markets Act.He added Slater \"genuinely held on at least colourable grounds\" the belief that an issue with the Act was \"unlikely actually to pose a problem for the scheme\".Lord Sandison said he believed Slater and Lord Jack had given evidence \"truthfully and good faith\".A spokesperson for the Scottish Greens said the case had shown \"the worst of Westminster\".They added: \"MSPs voted to introduce a recycling scheme, with businesses investing money to make it happen.\"The fact that one person in Westminster was able to topple the scheme against the will of the Scottish Parliament underlines the urgent need for our country to have the same powers as every other self-governing nation.\"",

    "body": "I didn't give up, I let go. How I came to terms with not having children15 hours agoLucy HookerCaroline StaffordTry hard enough, we are often told, and eventually you'll get what you want.But sometimes the hardest - and bravest - thing to do, is to stop trying.After years of hoping to start a family, including the painful rollercoaster of fertility treatment and a devastating miscarriage on Christmas day, Caroline Stafford, found the only way to find some kind of peace again was to accept it was not going to happen and to build a different future. But that meant overcoming what she calls the \"don't give up\" narrative. Like many people, Caroline and her husband Gareth, who she met at school, took it almost for granted they would have children in due course. \"We spend all our lives trying not to get pregnant. I just assumed as soon as I wasn't trying not to, I would,\" she says.Caroline StaffordCaroline and Gareth met at school in NottinghamshireNearly one in five women in the UK do not have children.That can be for a variety of reasons, including personal choice. But some simply find that the family life they had imagined, does not happen.After a year of failing to conceive Caroline and Gareth went to see the GP. A round of IVF in the UK was followed by more rounds abroad - a process of anxious appointments, medications and injections.At the same time she watched as her friends fell pregnant and had babies of their own.\"We were absolutely delighted for them, but the truth was, it was the worst thing to hear,\" she tells Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett.For anyone in Caroline's situation, simply seeing a parent with a pram can be painful, the source of a gnawing envy.That feeling ate away at her, changing who she was.\"Your world view becomes smaller and often more negative.\"I started to not really like how I was feeling towards other people,\" she says.Friends would tell her not to worry, it would happen in the end, or that she should stop trying, because then she would fall pregnant.Then in November six years ago, out of the blue, her friends were proved right.  Not trying seemed to have worked.She and Gareth had been living in a big farmhouse, in Rutland. They had just moved to a small cottage in a village, a kind of acceptance on some level that the large family they had been dreaming of was not going to be.As the festive season approached they began to share the good news with friends and family.Then on Christmas morning Gareth went out to deal with the dairy herd. By the time he was back she had lost the baby.\"It was the timing, the way it happened. It just felt so cruel.\"Her memories of that day are hazy.But both of them feel that it was the turning point.Caroline StaffordTaking up long-distance running allowed Caroline to change her relationship with her body\"It felt like we both knew it was time to begin to try to let go,\" she says, but that in itself required a huge effort.\"I didn't know at the point whether I was right. But we just began to tread forward,\" she says.She threw herself into work. She had started her business, selling biscuits stamped with personalised messages, during their second round of IVF.At first if people said her business was her baby, she would bristle. These days she finds it comforting. After all, it is something she has nurtured for a decade.She now has a team of 14 in the bakery, sends her biscuits all over the country, and has partnered with a mail order flower firm.For Gareth letting go has meant rethinking his work altogether. He is about to start a new job as a greenkeeper at his golf club.People do ask her if she considered adopting, but she says it \"wasn't the path that we chose.\"\"Adoption isn't just another way to become a parent. It's a major decision.A decade of IVF had changed Caroline's relationship with her own body.\"I was focusing on this one thing it couldn't do,\" she says.She started long distance running and instead of berating her body over its failure, she started celebrating what it could do instead. She has now done four half and full marathons, while Gareth is on his sixth.\"I love the life I've got. \"I don't feel that direct sense of loss any more. It's a different, a softer kind of sadness now.\"She has found a greater sense of peace as time passes. Even that comes though with pangs of guilt, wondering whether coming to terms with her childlessness, means she did not want it enough, or try hard enough.She knows that's still the \"don't give up\" message, nagging at her conscience. \"We're taught growing up that effort equals results, but it's often not how it works.\"Life can still have meaning and it can still have purpose, even when it looks so drastically different from what you expected.\"If you, or someone you know, have been affected by pregnancy issues, please visit BBC Action Line to find information on organisations that can help.All episodes of Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett are available on BBC Sounds.

    "body": "12 hours agoLyse DoucetChief international correspondentWatch: BBC asks Trump if breakup of Nato is price he is willing to pay for GreenlandOn day one, he put the world on notice. \"Nothing will stand in our way,\" President Donald Trump declared, to thunderous applause, as he ended his inauguration speech in a cold Washington winter on this day last year, at the start of his second term. Did the world fail to take enough notice?Tucked into his speech was a mention of the 19th Century doctrine of \"manifest destiny\" – the idea that the US was divinely ordained to expand its territory across the continent, spreading American ideals.At that moment, the Panama Canal was in his sights. \"We're taking it back,\" Trump announced.Now that same declaration, expressed with absolute resolve, is directed at Greenland. \"We have to have it,\" is the new mantra. It's a rude awakening in a moment fraught with grave risk.US history is littered with consequential and controversial American invasions, occupations, and covert operations to topple rulers and regimes. But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will.No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two.There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity.Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most \"transformative\" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing.\"It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing,\" was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on the stage at the Davos Economic Forum, without directly mentioning Trump by name.EPA/ShutterstockFrench President Emmanuel Macron spoke at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday but avoided any direct mention of TrumpThere is mounting concern over a possible painful trade war, even worry in some circles that the 76-year-old Nato military alliance could now be at risk if, in the worst case scenario, the US commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force.Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his \"America First\" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order.When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: \"I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing.\"Fine introduced a bill called \"Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act\" in Congress last week.How do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way?Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief.\"We need to take him seriously but not literally,\" comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue.It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again.\"He's a real estate mogul,\" says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded table.He doesn't talk like a traditional politician,\" explains his top diplomat, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he is repeatedly questioned about Trump's tactics. \"He says and then he does,\" is his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents.Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office.But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right.\"He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power,\" says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine.\"He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of values; he doesn't give two hoots about that.\"And he doesn't hide it.\"Nato is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit,\" Trump told the New York Times in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \"We're tremendously feared.\"If security was the issue, the US already has forces on the ground in Greenland and under a 1951 agreement could send in more troops and open more bases.\"I need to own it,\" is how Trump flatly puts it.And he often makes it clear, \"I like to win.\" There's a growing body of proof that's what it is about.His policy back flips in the past year have been baffling.ReutersMerchandise opposing a US takeover of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, have appeared in shops in CopenhagenIn the Saudi capital Riyadh in May, we watched how his major speech on his first foreign trip of his second term met a rapturous reception.Trump took aim at the American \"interventionists\" whom he excoriated for having \"wrecked far more nations than they built... in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.\"In June when Israel attacked Iran, Trump reportedly warned Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to put his diplomacy at risk with his military threats against Tehran. By the end of the week, when he saw Israel's success in assassinating top nuclear scientists and security chiefs, Trump exclaimed: \"I think it's been excellent.\"\"Sane-washing\" was the phrase coined months ago by Edward Luce of the Financial Times to describe the world's polite portrayals of Trump, the succession of leaders landing at his door with glittering gifts and gilded praise to try to win him over to their side.\"Trump's apologists – a more numerous crowd than true believers - work round the clock to sane-wash his policies into something coherent,\" Luce wrote in his latest column.ReutersTrump met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh in May 2025It was on full display last October when leaders the world over were summoned to join him at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh to celebrate his ringing declaration that \"at long last we have peace in the Middle East\" for the first time in \"3,000 years.\"The first significant phase of his peace plan had brought about a desperately needed ceasefire in Gaza and the urgent release of Israeli hostages. It was Trump's muscular diplomacy that forced Netanyahu, as well as Hamas, to agree to it. It was a major breakthrough only Trump could achieve. But it wasn't – sadly - the dawn of peace. No-one there said the quiet part out loud.Last year Trump's approach was framed as manifest destiny. This year it's the early 19th Century Monroe Doctrine now updated, since the Venezuela invasion, as the \"Donroe Doctrine.\" President Trump now owns it, bolstered by his fervent backers on his team, with his belief that America can act at will in its backyard, and beyond, to protect American interests.ReutersIn October, Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White HouseSometimes he is called an isolationist, sometimes an interventionist. But there's always that slogan which returned him to power - Make America Great Again.And his letter to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre highlighted his obsessive pique over not winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Trump informed Støre: \"I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\"\"It's a good day to have a Nordic temperament,\" Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide diplomatically remarked to me when I asked about this moment. Norway has been calm, with ice-hard firmness, in its defence of Greenland and Denmark and collective security in the Arctic.European responses still stretch across this slippery political ice.Macron has vowed to launch the EU's \"trade bazooka\" of counter-tariffs and restricting access to the EU's lucrative market.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, one of the American president's closest European allies, has vaguely spoken of a \"problem of understanding and miscommunication.\"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has strongly and publicly defended Greenland's territorial integrity but wants to protect the strong personal bond he's built over the past year by avoiding retaliatory tariffs.ReutersSir Keir Starmer has maintained a largely cordial relationship with Trump since he started his second term as presidentThe gloves are off for Trump as he posts the private messages he's receiving from leaders using the old tools of statecraft to try to keep him on side.\"Let us have a dinner in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the US,\" suggested the French president who also queried, in the midst of praise for other foreign policy successes, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland\".\"Can't wait to see you\", wrote Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who once called Trump \"daddy\" for his forceful handling of the Iran-Israel 12-day war last year.Nato boss commends 'daddy' Trump's handling of Israel-Iran conflictRutte, and others, have credited Trump's blunt threats for forcing Nato members to significantly increase their defence spending in recent years. Trump's warnings, going back to his first term, accelerated a trend called for by previous US presidents and started by Nato members themselves in the shadow of Russian threats.On the other side of the Atlantic, the country which has long lived in America's shadow has been trying to forge a different path forward, albeit with challenges of their own.\"We have to take the world as it is, not the way we want it to be,\" was the candid reflection of Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney on his trip to China last week.It was the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since 2017, after years of sharp tension, and it sent a clear signal of this fast changing world.Watch: Canada-China trade relationship \"more predictable\" than with US, says CarneyTrump's astonishing threat to annex his neighbour to the north surfaced again this week in a post on social media which showed the western hemisphere, including Canada and Greenland, covered in stars and stripes. Canadians know there's still a risk they could be next.Carney, the former central banker, rose to Canada's highest office last year buoyed by Canadians' belief he was the best prepared to take on Trump. He responded \"dollar for dollar\" from the start, imposing retaliatory tariffs – until it became too painful for the much smaller Canadian economy, which sends more than 70% of its trade south of its border.When Carney took to the stage at Davos on Tuesday, he also focused on this jarring juncture.\"American hegemony in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes,\" he said, adding bluntly: \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.\"On Wednesday Trump will speak from that same podium with the world watching.Asked by the New York Times this month what could stop him, Trump replied: \"My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me.\"That's what lies behind an armada of allies now seeking to persuade, flatter, force him – to change his mind.This time, it's not certain they will succeed.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoSnapchat's parent Snap has settled a social media addiction lawsuit just days before the landmark case was due to go to trial in Los Angeles.Terms of the deal were not announced as it was revealed by lawyers at a California Superior Court hearing, after which Snap told the BBC the parties were \"pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner\".Other defendants in the case include Instagram parent Meta, ByteDance's TikTok and Alphabet's YouTube, none of which have settled.The plaintiff, a 19-year old woman identified by the initials K.G.M., alleged that the algorithmic design of the platforms left her addicted and affected her mental health. In the absence of a settlement with the other parties, the trial is scheduled to go forward against the remaining three defendants, with jury selection due to begin on 27 January.Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify, and until Tuesday's settlement, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel was also set to take the stand.Meta, TikTok and Alphabet did not respond to BBC inquiries seeking reaction to the settlement.Snap is still a defendant in other social media addiction cases that have been consolidated in the court.The closely watched cases could challenge a legal theory that social media companies have used to shield themselves.They have long argued that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 protects them from liability for what third parties post on their platforms.But plaintiffs argue that the platforms are designed in a way that leaves users addicted through choices that affect their algorithms and notifications.The social media companies have said the plaintiffs' evidence falls short of proving that they are responsible for alleged harms such as depression and eating disorders.",

    "body": "3 hours agoEuropean leaders hitting back at Donald Trump's Greenland threat at the World Economic Forum in Davos dominates Wednesday's papers. The Guardian leads with a photo of French president Emmanuel Macron wearing sunglasses while delivering his speech, during which he warned that now was \"not the time for new imperialism or new colonialism\".\"Macron takes aim at 'bully' Trump\" says the Independent, focusing on the French president denouncing \"bullies\" and calling for the \"rule of law over brutality\".The Financial Times reports that the \"rift with Europe deepens\" as Donald Trump continues to stand firm on his intent to seize Greenland. The paper quotes the US leader saying there was \"no going back\" as he opens the door for talks ahead of his arrival in Davos on Wednesday.\"We'll work something out\" is the message Donald Trump sent to Nato allies before his departure for the World Economic Forum, according to the Times. When asked how far he was prepared to go to acquire Greenland, Trump said: \"You'll find out,\" the paper says.In a bid to reassure Donald Trump Europe can defend itself, the i Paper says surveillance units from the UK military could join a \"tripwire\" of troops stationed in Greenland. It adds that the Arctic deployment could include sea and air reconnaissance units.The Metro shifts its focus to Donald Trump's criticism of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a \"stunning\" social media post on Tuesday. The paper fills its front page with a screenshot of the US president's Truth Social message, accusing the PM of \"giving away\" the Chagos Islands where the US has a military base and calling it \"an act of great stupidity\".Following the post, the Daily Telegraph details more criticism from Donald Trump of the UK PM when he spoke to reporters. When asked about his relationship with Sir Keir, Trump said the prime minister needed to \"straighten out\" the UK because \"London is having a lot of problems\".Echoing Donald Trump's attack on the prime minister is Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch writing in the Daily Express. Badenoch says Sir Keir is \"out of his depth\" on the world stage and praised the US president as being \"dead right\" for denouncing the Chagos Island deal.The Daily Star keeps its eye on the fallout from Brooklyn Peltz Beckham's bombshell statement on the family feud with his parents Sir David and Lady Victoria Beckham. \"Becks bites back\" is the headline on the paper's top story as it features Sir David's first comments after his eldest son's Instagram post, saying \"kids make mistakes\".Quotes from think pieces on the Beckham family saga are plastered across the Daily Mail's front page. Elsewhere, the paper reports on national security warnings from spy chiefs to Sir Keir Starmer after the government approved plans for a Chinese super-embassy in London.Finally, the Sun headlines its Beckham coverage with \"Becks, 'lies' and videotape,\" highlighting one of Brooklyn Peltz's Beckham's claims that his mother danced with him \"inappropriately\" at his wedding.The Times reports that Donald Trump will \"confront\" his fellow leaders when he attends the World Economic Forum in Davos after they accused him of unravelling the global order by threatening to seize Greenland. With the headline, \"we'll work something out\", the paper notes the US president's suggestion that a deal could be reached, but also says he \"continued his menacing approach\" by replying \"you'll find out\" when asked how far he was prepared to go to acquire the semi-autonomous Danish territory.The Guardian says European leaders \"lined up yesterday\" to condemn Trump's \"new colonialism\" with the growing row plunging trade relations between the EU and US into \"fresh chaos\".  According to the Financial Times,  trust between Washington and European capitals has \"vaporised\".  The i Paper says surveillance units from the RAF and Royal Navy could be deployed in the Arctic, as part of British efforts to reassure the US president that Europe can defend itself and persuade him not to annex Greenland.Donald Trump's comments about Sir Keir Starmer and criticism of the UK's decision to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands are highlighted by the Daily Telegraph.  It says the US president told reporters the prime minister must \"straighten out\" the UK as London has \"a lot of problems\", and described the Chagos deal as an \"act of stupidity\". Writing in the Daily Express, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, claims Trump is \"dead right\" about what she calls the \"surrender\" of the islands, arguing it shows Sir Keir is \"out of his depth\" in the new international order.Criticism of the government is also featured by the Daily Mail after ministers approved plans for a huge new Chinese embassy in central London. The paper says Sir Keir Starmer has been accused of giving up national security in return for a better trading relationship with Beijing after spy chiefs warned of the risks posed by what will be the biggest embassy in Europe.  The government says national security is its \"first duty\" and an extensive range of measures have been developed to manage any concerns.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Photos leaked to BBC show faces of hundreds killed in Iran's brutal protest crackdown2 hours agoMerlyn Thomas,correspondent, BBC Verify,Shayan Sardarizadeh,senior journalist, BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,senior journalistBBCWarning: this story contains graphic content which some readers might find distressingHundreds of photos revealing the faces of those killed during Iran's violent crackdown on anti-government protests have been leaked to BBC Verify.The pictures, which are too graphic to show without blurring, reveal the bloodied, swollen and bruised faces of at least 326 victims - including 18 women. The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones.Many of the victims were too disfigured to be identified, and 69 people had been labelled in Persian as John or Jane Doe, suggesting their identity was unknown when the photo was taken. Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos.Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far.The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah. The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as \"seditionists\".Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out.Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify.We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. \"It was just too much,\" they said.Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen. Crowds of anti-government protesters in TehranThe slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment.Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming.Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession.BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.BBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.",

    "body": "10 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterElon Musk has suggested he could buy Ryanair and called for its chief executive to be fired amid a deepening spat between the pair. The budget airline on Tuesday branded the Tesla chief executive an \"idiot\", and used the extraordinary row to promote its January sale. Musk and Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary have been trading insults over the past week after O'Leary rejected the idea of using Musk's Starlink technology to provide wi-fi on flights.The two are among the world's most outspoken business chiefs, with Musk the world's richest man with an estimated net worth of $769bn (£573bn), and O'Leary running Europe's busiest airline. A statement on Ryanair's X account on Tuesday evening said: \"Perhaps Musk needs a break??\"Ryanair is launching a Great Idiots seat sale especially for Elon and any other idiots on 'X'.\" It came after Musk floated the idea of buying Ryanair several times on X in the past week, suggesting that O'Leary should be sacked for rejecting the use of Starlink to provide wi-fi on Ryanair flights.EU-based airlines must be majority owned by people from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.The Irish airline also said O'Leary would hold a press conference in Dublin on Wednesday to \"address\" Musk's latest move.Ryanair's social media is known for its punchy posts, often mocking criticisms of the airline or weighing in on current events.Last week, after German airline Lufthansa announced it would install Starlink on its planes to provide all passengers with free wi-fi, O'Leary said Musk knew \"zero\" about flight aerodynamics.He told Irish radio station Newstalk that passengers would not want to pay a small charge for wi-fi on an hour-long flight, and that Starlink hardware would increase fuel costs because of drag.\"We [would] have to put an aerial antenna on top of the aircraft. It would cost us about $200-250m a year, in other words about an extra dollar for every passenger we fly.\"We can't afford those costs. Passengers won't pay for internet usage... so we're not putting it on board.\"O'Leary called Musk an \"idiot\", with Musk using the same insult in response.Airlines have become increasingly important for Starlink, a network powered by thousands of low-earth orbit satellites.The technology is already being rolled out by airlines such as Qatar Airways and United Airlines.Both Musk and O'Leary have been known to court media attention with provocative public statements.",

    "body": "14 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the \"old order is not coming back\" and urged fellow middle powers to come together in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said on Tuesday, adding that he believed powerful nations were using economic coercion to get what they want.He also affirmed Canada's support for Greenland, Denmark and the Nato alliance, drawing applause. Carney did not mention Donald Trump by name, but some of his remarks seemed aimed at the US president, who is threatening to tariff European allies and the UK unless Greenland is surrendered to the US. \"Great powers\" are often defined as countries with permanent seats on United Nations Security Council - China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States - which shows their economic and military dominance in the world. Middle powers, such as Canada, Australia, Argentina, South Korea and Brazil, are nations that still exert large influence in global politics, even though their economies are smaller.In his speech, Carney said the world is \"in the midst of a rupture, not a transition\".\"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,\" he said.He also said \"Canada was amongst the first to hear the wake-up call\" that geography and historic alliances no longer guaranteed security or prosperity.When Trump returned to office, he frequently referred to Canada as the \"51st state\" and threatened to join Canada and the US through \"economic force.\" The US then hit its northern neighbour and major trading partner with steep tariffs.Canada's deal with China signals it is serious about shift from USFrom surge in patriotism to fewer US trips - Trump's impact on CanadaRecently, Trump added Canada to his push to take control of the partly sovereign territory of Greenland, which has grown stronger and more overt in recent days, by posting on social media a map of the US, Canada and Greenland with an image of the American flag laid over it. As a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), Canada stands firmly with Greenland and Denmark and supports \"their unique right to determine Greenland's future\", Carney said in his speech.\"Our commitment to Article Five is unwavering,\" the prime minister added, referring to a clause in the Nato agreement that states an attack against one member state is considered an attack on all.Canadian media outlets reported earlier this week that Canada was considering sending a small contingent of troops to Greenland to join Danish and other European troops for military exercises in the region. Asked about it in Davos, Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said \"we regularly participate in Nato exercises, and we participate in exercises that the Canadian Armed Forces itself leads\". She added that the Minister of National Defence and the chief of defence staff make decisions on future deployments.The BBC has reached out to the Canada's Department of National Defence for comment.Carney said in his speech that to adapt to shifting geopolitics, Canada is now focused on engaging with other countries and building \"different coalitions for different issues based on common values and interests\".The prime minister pitched Canada as a \"stable and reliable\" partner, and noted recent trade and investment deals that were struck with China and Qatar, as well as a defence procurement pact Canada signed with the EU earlier last year.Carney is among several world leaders at the World Economic Forum this week. Trump is scheduled to deliver his own speech on Wednesday. ",

    "body": "Driving test cheating soars as candidates turn to Bluetooth headsets and impersonators8 hours agoKaty Austin,Transport correspondentandSimon Browning, Transport reporterGetty ImagesCheating cases during practical and theory driving tests rose by nearly 50 per cent last year in England, Scotland and Wales, new figures show.The cheating methods varied, according to freedom of information data from the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), with more than 1,100 cases involving the use Bluetooth headsets. Overall, nearly 100 offenders were prosecuted for trying to cheat themselves or for impersonating driving test candidates.Industry leaders blamed the increase on the nationwide shortage of tests and drivers' desperation to pass, while the DVSA blamed a general rise in cheating and improved detection. A Press Association News Agency freedom information request revealed 2,844 attempts to cheat during driving tests in the year to September 2025, 47% higher than the previous year. Of those, more than a third (1,113) involved the use of technology, such as an earpiece connected via Bluetooth to a concealed phone, to try to cheat at a theory test.Meanwhile people attempted 1,084 times to try to take theory tests while impersonating the registered candidate.  And in 647 incidents, people pretended to be the registered candidate for a practical test.Dr Rasha Kassem, leader of the Fraud Research Group at Aston University, warned of the dangers of people passing tests illegally without actually knowing how to drive.\"It means that there will be more accidents, collisions, insurance issues as well, damage to the car, and damage to human beings, injuries, and in some cases, death,\" she said.\"There has to be public awareness, because this is a serious crime, from my perspective, and also in the eyes of the law. It is fraud.\"Impersonators, and those who use them, face punishments ranging from driving bans to prison sentences. They can also be ordered to carry out unpaid work or made to pay court costs. Ninety-six people were prosecuted for attempting to cheat on driving tests or impersonate candidates in the 12 months to September last year.Steps taken to try and prevent fraud including matching a practical test candidate's face with their photo ID, as well as asking theory candidates to roll up their sleeves and show their pockets are empty. Examples of people prosecuted last year, reported by the Press Association News Agency, include 23-year-old Qounain Khan, who was handed an eight-month prison sentence in June 2025 after pleading guilty to impersonating learners at theory test centres 12 times.The court heard impersonators could be paid up to £2,000 for passing a test.Sorina-Ana Turcitu, 42, admitted attempting to take a practical driving test on behalf of someone else. She was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 18 months in September 2025.And Ali Rasul, 22, was handed a two-year prison sentence  in November 2025 after being caught repeatedly trying to cheat the theory test over an eight-month period either by using a hidden earpiece or an impersonator.The rise in reported cheating comes as learner drivers face persistently long waits for practical tests slots. The DVSA said it had no evidence cheating was linked to waiting times.However, Carly Brookfield, chief executive of the Driving Instructors Association, told the BBC she was not surprised that fraud was on the rise in this context.\"It almost seems inevitable in an era of lots of demand, but very little consistent supply, that you are going to get people engaging in risky behaviours, like using a cheat service to try and pass.\"She said people who \"don't want to risk going on the torturous merry-go-round and trying to get another slot...might take the risk, unfortunately, of cheating.\" Dr Kassem also believed long wait times to book a slot was likely to be a factor, with some people resorting to fraud for reasons such as needing to get a licence quickly for a job.In December, the National Audit Office warned that the driving test backlog would not be cleared until November 2027.Causes include poor recruitment and retention of examiners and third-party websites booking up slots using automated programs known as bots.The Department for Transport (DfT) previously announced more action to try to get the backlog down, including employing military driving examiners and only allowing learner drivers to book and manage their practical driving tests from the coming Spring.Marian Kitson, the DVSA's director of enforcement services, said the organisation was committed to tackling practical and theory test fraud, and had increased its detection capabilities.\"It is essential that all drivers demonstrate they have the right skills, knowledge, and attitude to drive safely. People who attempt to cheat driving tests put all road users at risk by trying to obtain a driving licence fraudulently,\" she said.\"Our counter-fraud team carries out robust investigations into suspected fraud, working with the police to bring fraudsters to justice and keep Britain's roads safe.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "4 hours agoHideharu Tamura,TokyoandKelly Ng,SingaporeThe man who killed Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe has been sentenced to life in prison, three and a half years after he shot him dead at a rally in the city of Nara in 2022.Tetsuya Yamagami had pleaded guilty to murder at the trial's opening last year, but how he should be punished has divided public opinion in Japan. While many see the 45-year-old as a cold-blooded murderer, some sympathise with his troubled upbringing.Prosecutors said Yamagami deserved life imprisonment for his \"grave act\". Abe's  assassination stunned the country, where there is virtually no gun crime.Seeking leniency, Yamagami's defence team said he was a victim of \"religious abuse\".  His mother's devotion to the Unification Church bankrupted the family, and Yamagami bore a grudge against Abe after realising the ex-leader's ties to the  controversial church.Nearly 700 people lined up outside the Nara district court on Wednesday to attend the sentencing hearing. Abe's shocking death while giving a speech in broad daylight prompted investigations into the Unification Church and its questionable practices, including soliciting financially ruinous donations from its followers.The case also exposed links with politicians from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and resulted in the resignations of several cabinet ministers.Journalist Eito Suzuki, who covered all but one of Yamagami's court hearings, said Yamagami and his family seemed \"overwhelmed with despair\" throughout the trial.Yamagami \"exuded a sense of world-weariness and resignation\", recounts Suzuki, who began looking into the Unification Church long before Abe's shocking murder.\"Everything is true. There is no doubt that I did this,\" Yamagami said solemnly on the first day of his trial in October 2025. Armed with a homemade gun assembled using two metal pipes and duct tape, he fired two shots at Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022.The murder of Japan's most recognisable public figure at the time – Abe remains the longest-serving PM in Japanese history – sent shockwaves around the world.Calling for a jail term of no more than 20 years, Yamagami's lawyers argued that he was a victim of \"religious abuse\". He resented the church because his mother donated to it his late father's life insurance and other assets, amounting to 100 million yen (S$828,750), the court heard.Yamagami spoke of his grievance against Abe, who was 67 when shot, after seeing his video message at a church-related event in 2021, but said he had initially planned to attack church executives, not Abe. Suzuki recalls Abe's widow Akie's look of disbelief when Yamagami said the ex-leader was not his main target. Her expression \"remains vividly etched in my mind\", Suzuki says.\"It conveyed a sense of shock, like she was asking: Was my husband merely a tool used to settle a grudge against the religious organisation? Is that all it was?\" In an emotional statement read to the court, Akie Abe said the sorrow of losing her husband \"will never be relieved\". \"I just wanted him to stay alive,\" she had said.Founded in South Korea, the Unification Church entered Japan in the 1960s and cultivated ties with politicians to grow its following, researchers say.While not a member, Abe, like several other Japanese politicians, would occasionally appear at church-related events. His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, also a former PM, was said to have been close to the group because of its anti-communist stance.In March last year, a Tokyo court revoked the church's status as a religious corporation, ruling that it coerced followers into buying expensive items by exploiting fears about their spiritual well-being.The church has also drawn controversy for holding mass wedding ceremonies involving thousands of couples.Yamagami's sister, who appeared as a defence witness during his trial, gave a tearful testimony on the \"dire circumstances she and her siblings endured\" because of their mother's deep involvement with the church, Suzuki recalls.\"It was an intensely emotional moment. Nearly everyone in the public gallery appeared to be crying,\" he says.But prosecutors argue there is \"a leap in logic\" as to why Yamagami directed his resentment of the church at Abe. During the trial, the judges also raised questions suggesting they found it hard to understand this aspect of his defence.Observers, too, are divided on whether Yamagami's personal tragedies justify a reduced penalty for his actions.\"It's hard to dismantle the prosecution's case that Abe didn't directly harm Yamagami or his family,\" Suzuki says. But he believes Yamagami's case illustrates how \"victims of social problems are led to commit serious crimes\". \"This chain must be broken, we must properly examine why he committed the crime,\" Suzuki says.Rin Ushiyama, a sociologist at Queen's University Belfast, says sympathy for Yamagami is largely rooted in \"widespread distrust and antipathy in Japan towards controversial religions like the Unification Church\".\"Yamagami was certainly a 'victim' of parental neglect and economic hardship caused by the [Unification Church], but this does not explain, let alone justify, his [actions],\" Ushiyama says.",

    "body": "Driver killed in second deadly Spain train crash in days5 hours agoThomas Mackintosh,Guy HedgecoeandToby MannCatalonian fire serviceFire crews inspect the wreckage of the train in CataloniaA train driver has been killed and at least 37 people injured, five seriously, after a commuter train derailed and crashed near Barcelona two days after a deadly two-train collision in southern Spain.According to local officials, on Tuesday evening the Rodalies train collided with a retaining wall which fell onto the track between Gelida and Sant Sadurní. Catalonia regional fire Inspector Claudi Gallardo said all passengers had been removed from the train.The incident occurred as heavy storms battered north-eastern Spain, as coastal areas in the east and north-west of Spain are on high alert because of the weather. Eleven ambulances were on the scene in Gelida, Catalonia - around 35km (21.7 miles) west of Barcelona - treating those injured, emergency services said.The local fire service said 35 crews had been sent to the area and one passenger trapped inside the train had been rescued.In a later update it said that no-one remained inside and that its crews were conducting a sweep of the area to rule out any further victims.Emergency services said they had evacuated some of the injured to nearby Moisès Broggi, Bellvitge, and Vila Franca hospitals.As well as the five seriously injured people, six were in a less serious condition and 26 were in a \"mild\" condition, emergency medical services said.MossosLocal police shared an image of emergency services at the scene near GélidaServices suspendedAnother train on the Barcelona commuter network also derailed on Tuesday.\"The axle was struck by a rock dislodged by the storm,\" Spain's rail network operator Adif said in a statement.The train was running between Blanes and Maçanet-Massanes, north-east of Barcelona.No injuries have been reported and services have been suspended.About 400,000 commuters are expected to be without train services on Wednesday morning, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported.Services across the Rodalies commuter rail network have been suspended completely while safety checks are carried out.Rail operators are expected to meet with authorities after the inspections.The crashes in Catalonia come two days after two high-speed trains collided in Adamuz, Andalusia, in one of the worst Spanish rail accidents in over a decade.At least 42 people are known to have died after carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks and then collided with an oncoming high-speed train.",

    "body": "While speaking at the Davos summit on Tuesday, French president Emmanuel Macron drew attention for his stern rebuke of US leader Donald Trump's threat to tariff eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland. But another aspect of Macron's speech also made an impression: his choice of eyewear. The French leader wore a striking pair of blue reflective aviator sunglasses indoors while addressing world leaders at the World Economic Forum.While Macron did not explain the reason for the accessory during his speech, French reports have attributed it to an ongoing medical condition.Last week, he appeared at a military event in southern France with a red eye and at one point donned a similar pair of sunglasses.While addressing troops, he downplayed his condition and said it was \"totally benign\" and \"completely insignificant\", adding: \"Please pardon the unsightly appearance of my eye.\"Macron even joked about it, calling it \"l'oeil du tigre\" or the \"eye of the tiger\", in a reference to rock band Survivor's song used in the 1982 boxing movie Rocky III.\"For those who get the reference, it's a sign of determination,\" he said.French reports said that Macron appeared to have a sub-conjunctival hemorrhage, which is a broken blood vessel in his eye.It is harmless, painless and does not affect vision. It also does not cause permanent injury to the eye as it usually clears within a fortnight.It sometimes occurs when a person sneezes or coughs vigorously, or pokes or rubs their eye. Those with diabetes and high blood pressure are more at risk of suffering from the condition.While sunglasses are not necessary to protect vision, those who have the condition may choose to wear glasses to avoid attracting attention.Macron \"opted for this style for aesthetic reasons, because he's a public figure,\" medical doctor and media commentator Jimmy Mohamed told French broadcaster RTL.\"Some people might think he's ill, so to avoid being photographed in that state, he decided to wear sunglasses. The glasses protect his image, but not really his eye.\"His decision has stirred discussion on social media, where some have called Macron \"kéké\", which is French slang for a show-off. Others joked that he was a \"cyborg\" or emulating Hollywood actor Top Cruise in Top Gun, the 1986 movie that made wearing aviators a fashion statement.In the speech he made while wearing the shades, Macron warned against a shift towards autocracy and \"a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot\" and \"imperial ambitions are resurfacing\".This was even more so the case when these tariffs are \"used as leverage against territorial sovereignty\", he said. Trump has also threatened to impose 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne imports over France's refusal to join his \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.",

    "body": "Finger-prick blood test could be early warning for children with type 1 diabetes7 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorDiabetes UKThanks to the study, Imogen, who is 12, is now receiving medication to help delay her diabetesAll UK children could be offered screening for type 1 diabetes using a simple finger-prick blood test, say researchers who have been running a large study. Currently, many young people go undiagnosed and risk developing a life-threatening complication called diabetic ketoacidosis that needs urgent hospital treatment.Identifying diabetes earlier could help avoid this and mean treatments to control problematic blood sugar levels can be given sooner. Some 17,000 children aged three to 13 have already been checked as part of the ELSA (Early Surveillance for Autoimmune diabetes) study, funded by diabetes charities. Diabetes UKDoctors hope the immunotherapy drug will delay Imogen's diabetesImogen, who is 12 and from the West Midlands, is one of those found to have diabetes thanks to the screening. Her mum Amy says knowing what's coming, rather than being taken by surprise,  has made a massive difference to their confidence and peace of mind.\"Imogen took part in the study to further research and help others, but it has helped her too – being forewarned is being forearmed. \"She was always going to develop type 1 diabetes, but through ELSA we've been able to slow down the process and prepare. We know what's coming, but we're not scared.\"Imogen is being given ongoing support to prepare her for what is to come. Amy, who is 44 and has type 1 diabetes herself, is aware of the risks with the disease. She was diagnosed aged 13 after developing diabetic ketoacidosis. \"When I was diagnosed, I had no warning and ended up quite poorly in hospital,\" she recalls. Imogen is now trying a new type of drug designed to delay her diabetes. It's an immunotherapy called teplizumab that helps calm her immune system to slow its attack of her pancreas. In trials, the drug has been shown to delay the onset of diabetes by about three years, on average. It is not yet widely available on the NHS. Imogen is only the second child in the UK to get it. How the diabetes screening test worksThe finger-prick blood test checks for autoantibodies - proteins that the immune system makes which can attack the body's own tissues. In diabetes, these autoantibodies attack the pancreas - the organ which has the job of making insulin to control blood sugar. Family history can increase your risk of type 1 diabetes and  scientists believe some things in the environment, like viruses, play a role in triggering it. Preliminary findings from ELSA in the 17,283 children, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal and funded by Diabetes UK and Breakthrough T1D, show: 75 children had one autoantibody, signalling increased future risk of type 1 diabetes160 had two or more autoantibodies but did not yet require insulin therapy, indicating early-stage type 1 diabetes7  were found to have undiagnosed type 1 diabetes, with all needing to start insulin immediatelyChildren without autoantibodies are unlikely to develop type 1 diabetes.Dr Elizabeth Robertson from Diabetes UK said: \"For too many families, a child's type 1 diabetes diagnosis still comes as a frightening emergency. But that doesn't have to be the case. \"Thanks to scientific breakthroughs, we now have the tools to identify children in the very earliest stages of type 1 diabetes - giving families precious time to prepare, avoid emergency hospital admissions, and access treatments that can delay the need for insulin for years.\"Rachel Connor, from Breakthrough T1D, added: \"The findings from ELSA's first phase signal a major step towards a future in which type 1 diabetes can be detected early, managed proactively, and potentially delayed through immunotherapy.\"The next phase of the study - called ELSA 2 - will now expand the screening offer to children aged 2 to 17. The finger-prick test can be done at home, in school or at a GP surgery. Several other countries are also exploring whether to introduce diabetes screening for children. Italy already has for those aged 1 to 17. It would be up to UK ministers, advised by the National Screening Committee and studies like ELSA, whether to do the same. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes The NHS says the most common symptoms of type 1 diabetes are:peeing more than usual, especially at nightfeeling very thirsty and drinking more than usualfeeling very tiredlosing weight without trying to or looking thinnerChildren may have heavier nappies or they may start wetting the bed because they're peeing more.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAntonia MatthewsBBC WalesVast amounts of fly-tipped waste cascades down Bwlch mountain A farmer says she is \"devastated\" by a \"disgusting\" river of fly-tipped waste dumped down the side of a mountain.Katie Davies, whose family has owned land on Bwlch Mountain in Treorchy for 90 years, said the clean up could cost thousands of pounds and could also harm her sheep which graze on the land.Travel blogger Nathan Dixon, who captured drone footage showing the scale of the discarded waste, said the mess could be seen from \"three to five miles away\", adding that it \"sticks out like a sore thumb\".Rhondda Cynon Taf council said it always took action to hold those responsible for fly-tipping to account, while Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said fly-tipping was a serious crime.Nathan DixonThe waste can be seen from miles away and appears to include household goodsDavies, who runs small family business Nantymoel farm which produces Welsh beef and lamb, said the mess \"keeps me up at night\".She said it was not the first time waste had been dumped on the land, and praised Rhondda Cynon Taf council for its support helping her to clean it before, when volunteers dragged the rubbish down the mountain before the council disposed of it.Davies said the clean-up operation would likely prove even more difficult this time, however, and may require specialist crews to drag it down from the sheer cliff face. \"I'm extremely frustrated and upset,\" Davies said. \"It's just devastating.\"Nathan DixonThe council said many of the fly-tipped items could have been taken to one of its recycling centresNot only is the waste an eyesore, it is also damaging to sheep grazing on the land as well as nesting birds and other wildlife, she said.\"It's horrendous. It's really heartbreaking. I need a long-term solution, I can't keep doing this.\"Davies said she had asked the council to close the lay-by on the mountain from where the waste was fly-tipped.Rhondda Cynon Taf council said it was \"important to find the right balance between deterring what is blatant and reckless vandalism of this beautiful landscape, with the enjoyment of the thousands of conscientious visitors\".Dixon, 37, who grew up in the village beneath the mountain, said he recently scattered his father's ashes there and expressed his sadness at seeing such a special place treated with so little respect. \"That's my father's final resting place. He walked those mountains all of his life,\" Dixon said.\"It's where he always wanted to be.\"Nathan DixonFly-tipping is a serious crime, Natural Resources Wales saysRhondda Cynon Taf council said it had placed covert cameras and signs in the area and that it was looking at using new technology to help catch those responsible in the act.\"The Bwlch Mountain is home to breathtaking scenery that is world renowned - unfortunately, there are some shameless people who decide to fly-tip and dump their waste, spoiling it for the majority,\" the council said.\"As a council we take fly-tipping incredibly seriously and always take action to hold those responsible to account,\" it added, saying anyone found fly-tipping in the local authority would receive a fine of at least £400 and could face a criminal sentence.It said many of the fly-tipped items could have been taken to one of its recycling centres or collected from the kerbside at no extra cost.Nathan DixonLandowner Katie Davies says the clean up could cost thousands of poundsNRW said: \"Fly-tipping is a serious crime that harms our environment, endangers wildlife and disrupts local communities. It's also expensive to clean up.\"It said more than 70% of fly-tipping incidents in Wales involved household waste and were often the result of people unknowingly using unlicensed waste carriers who dump the waste, leaving people at risk of being fined.\"If you're paying someone to remove your waste, you must check that they are a registered waste carrier,\" NRW added.More top stories",

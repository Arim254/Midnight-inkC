What’s really going on with Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine?AmericastAvailable for over a yearDonald Trump has posted on social media that ‘something good just may be happening’ when it comes to negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, after overnight talks in Geneva.\nEuropean leaders criticised a 28-point US peace plan when it emerged last week, saying it was too favourable to Russia. A new plan has been promised, but President Zelensky has played down Trump’s hopes of progress.\nSarah, Anthony and Marianna join Matt Chorley on 5 Live to answer your questions. We look at who’s actually involved in putting the plan together? And what does Donald Trump stand to gain from the proposed deal?\nPlus, the MAGA icon and Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene says she will resign from Congress following her bitter feud with the president last week. Could we start to see power shifts within the MAGA movement following her departure? And why did Trump say the behaviour of some Democrats was “punishable by death”?\nPlus, what happened when the mayor-elect of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, met Donald Trump in the White House on Friday? Clips of the meeting quickly went viral, with users commenting on the warmth between the two leaders. Is this the start of a fruitful friendship between Trump and Mamdani - or is it all just for show?\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Two climbers have died after falling from New Zealand's highest peak on Aoraki, or  Mount Cook, which is known for its brutal terrain.They were in a group of four that was trying to climb the 3,724m-high summit. The other two were uninjured and rescued by helicopter early on Tuesday, after contacting emergency services the previous night. Hours later they found the bodies of the dead climbers, still connected by the climbing harness. But authorities are working to recover them \"in a challenging alpine environment\".Hikes to the top of Mount Cook, which towers over the Southern Alps running the length of the South Island, are difficult even for experienced climbers because of large crevasses and unpredictable weather.None of the climbers have been publicly identified, but New Zealand media outlet Stuff reported that one of those killed was a well-known,  internationally recognised mountain guide.Nearly a year ago three climbers from the US and Canada disappeared on the mountain. They were eventually declared dead after a multi-day search even though their bodies were never found - authorities say the search was hampered by bad weather.Dozens of people have died trying to make it to the summit of Mount Cook. Hardly a climbing season goes by without at least one fatality, according to the New Zealand alpine club ClimbNZ. ",

    "body": "Are we going to have a white Christmas this year?Image source, Getty ImagesBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter As the nights draw in and festive lights are getting strung up, some of us might start to hope - or dream - of seeing some Christmas snowfall.Christmas cards often depict scenes blanketed in snow. While this is a rare sight in much of the UK, a 'white Christmas' is more common than you might think.The definition of a white Christmas means that more than half of all Christmas Days in the UK have seen snow falling somewhere.So, although the odds are technically stacked in favour of a white Christmas, the detailed festive forecast for this year won't be confirmed for a while yet. At this early stage, what do we actually know about the chances of this Christmas being 'white'?For a Christmas to be officially considered 'white', the snow doesn't need to be 'deep and crisp and even.'In fact, just a single snowflake has to be recorded falling at any point during the 24 hours of 25 December at any of the Met Office's network of around 300 observing stations.The definition has changed over the years and has been broadened to include data from automated weather-recording stations as well as manned or manual sites.Snow already lying on the ground on Christmas Day may make things look merry and bright, but it does not count under the official definition of a white Christmas.When will we know for sure that we'll have a white Christmas?Image caption, In December 2010, the UK experienced very low temperatures and significant snowfalls. Lying snow was reported in many places on Christmas Day It's still too early to know for sure. The festive forecast will become much clearer about five days before Christmas, so keep an eye on the BBC Weather app or website for the latest updates. You can also read our thoughts further ahead in our monthly outlook.Forecasting snow in the UK is notoriously difficult because, as an island nation, it is most frequently influenced by mild Atlantic weather patterns.However, longer-range weather forecasting models are beginning to show possible trends for the Christmas period, influenced by wider teleconnections - large-scale interactions in which weather patterns in distant regions create atmospheric waves and flows that affect conditions thousands of miles away.One such potential influence to our winter weather is a 'warm blob' in the Pacific Ocean which could favour higher pressure and colder conditions developing in Europe.Meteorologists are also keeping an eye on the development of a potential La Niña event over the coming months - the colder phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. Whilst the link between La Niña and UK weather isn't clear cut, the Met Office suggests that historically it promotes high pressure to develop in the Atlantic in early winter.  This could mean a higher than average chance of colder weather to start December.Overall most computer models are hinting at a trend towards slightly calmer and colder conditions developing towards 25 December, so perhaps there's a chance of seeing something white on the big day! When was the last white Christmas in the UK?The last time the UK saw a widespread white Christmas was back in 2010, when snow fell at 19% of weather stations, and very unusually, 83% of stations reported snow lying on the ground.Since 2020, every year except 2024 has officially been a white Christmas. However, in each of these years, very few places reported any snow actually settling on the ground.What are the \"white Christmas\" odds?The chances of festive snowfall vary a lot in different locations, with much better odds the further north and the higher up you venture. The places most likely to get a white Christmas Day are northern and eastern Scotland, northern England, north Wales and the north-west Midlands.Image caption, Christmas Eve snow is now less likely in much of Europe, some parts of the UK have seen an upward trend in recent yearsAs our climate warms, winters in the UK are becoming milder and wetter. A rise in land and sea temperatures has generally reduced the chances of a white Christmas, especially when compared to the 18th and 19th centuries. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoOn the eve of the Budget, speculation about Chancellor Rachel Reeves's fiscal statement dominates the papers. The Times reports that she is urging Labour MPs to \"unite for her Budget\", hitting out at what she calls \"misogynist critics\". Pre-Budget leaks had been \"incredibly destabilising\", she adds, with the paper quoting her address to MPs at the Commons. \"The Chancellor will significantly cut the annual £20,000 cash Isa (Individual Savings Account) allowance to £12,000,\" the Daily Mail reports. Lowering the tax-free interest limit could \"punish savers while potentially causing mortgage rates to rise\", according to the paper. It reports the chancellor could use her fiscal statement to argue the \"billions of pounds sitting in the savings accounts would generate better returns if it was invested in the riskier stock market\".A proposal to introduce a council tax surcharge on properties worth more than £2m could turn into a \"'sticking plaster' for the government\", the i newspaper writes. It describes the measure as a \"mansion tax\", quoting warnings from the former Institute for Fiscal Studies economist Paul Johnson, who tells the paper the system \"needs a complete overhaul\".The Silver Voices campaign group cautions the chancellor that \"many older people will struggle to heat their homes without help with the cost of living\", the Daily Express reports. \"Frozen income tax thresholds expected in tomorrow's Budget will lead to frozen homes\", the paper writes, adding that people already struggling with soaring energy costs \"are hammered with higher tax bills\". The Independent leads with \"reports that efforts to grow the economy have stalled\", citing unpublished analysis from the economic watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The paper says the OBR has \"reportedly downgraded its forecast for growth in each year until 2029\", adding that the news \"could not come at a worse time for the beleaguered chancellor\". US and Ukrainian negotiators drafted an incomplete peace proposal in Geneva, which \"leaves big calls to presidents\", the Financial Times says. \"Washington had been pressing Kyiv to agree a 28-point proposal developed by US and Russian officials\", the paper writes. Parts of the plan, such as territorial concessions, crossed \"Ukrainian red lines\". The paper says the outstanding \"politically sensitive elements\" of the Geneva plan will be decided by Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky.\"1,000 abuse victims safer,\" writes the Metro, reporting on the number of domestic abuse protection orders (DAPOs) imposed in the year since they were introduced. The paper says the DAPOs \"limit perpetrators' movements, with breaches punishable by up to five years\". Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable unpaid carers will have their cases reassessed after a damning official review, the Guardian writes. Some carers were \"plunged into hardship; others were jailed\" after \"draconian penalties of as much as £20,000\" were foisted on some carers. A review blames \"government failure and maladministration\", according to the paper. The Daily Telegraph reports that BBC chair Samir Shah \"has insisted he will not resign despite deep divisions at the broadcaster\". It writes board members are split over how to respond to the Telegraph's \"disclosure of bias at the corporation\", based on a leaked memo. \"Reform's Russia crisis\" is the Daily Mirror front page headline, as the paper says party leader Nigel Farage is facing \"mounting pressure to investigate pro-Putin links\" in the party. This follows the jailing of former Welsh Reform UK leader Nathan Gill for taking pro-Russian bribes. The Daily Star leads with darts champion Luke Littler supporting the paper's campaign to give a knighthood to motor neurone disease charity campaigner and ex-rugby league star Kevin Sinfield. TV star Jeff Brazier has separated from his wife Kate Dwyer, the Sun reports. It says the split comes 16 years after the death of Brazier's ex-partner Jade Goody, who appeared on Big Brother years earlier.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy,  moved many Americans over the weekend with her emotional essay about being diagnosed with terminal cancer shortly after giving birth to her second child. In the New Yorker, the 35-year-old stunned readers, writing that she was battling acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive blood cancer, and had less than a year to live. Doctors and researchers say the essay helped raise awareness about the deadly illness and critical need for more funding and research to tackle treatment-resistant cancers.   \"It's such an obviously moving and courageous essay,\" said Vijay Sankaran, a physician with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. \"She comes from a very prominent family, and yet anybody can be affected by cancer, even people who are young, who are seemingly healthy.\"In the essay, titled A Battle With My Blood, Schlossberg said she was diagnosed  after doctors noticed an abnormally high white-blood cell count after giving birth to her daughter in May 2024. The daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy, she said she was shocked by the diagnosis, as she considered herself \"one of the healthiest people I knew\". One of the dangers of acute myeloid leukaemias is that they can emerge suddenly, going from being undetactable to affecting hundreds of cells in a matter of days, said Dr Sankaran. The cancer - affecting both the bone marrow and blood - is rare, sickening four in 100,000 adults each year.  Schlossberg's subtype of leukaemia - a chromosomal abnormality formerly called Inversion 3 - is even rarer, affecting only 1% to 2% of people with acute myeloid leukaemia. The rare genetic mutation makes Schlossberg's cancer even more dangerous. It is one of the few subsets of acute myeloid leukaemia for which there are few effective therapies - meaning remissions or cures \"are the minority\", said Courtney DiNardo, professor of leukaemia at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The most common treatments involve bone marrow transplants, chemotherapy and clinical trials. Schlossberg tried them all.She described in her essay the transplant doctors drained from her sister's arms and chemotherapy that made her once \"great hair\" fall out. She joined a clinical trial for CAR-T-cell therapy, a type of immunotherapy for certain blood cancers, in which she said scientists \"engineered my sister's T-cells, directing them to attack my cancer cells\". Though the therapy has been revolutionary for other types of leukaemia, it is less so for acute myeloid leukaemia, Dr Sankaran said. In the last clinical trial, her doctor told Schlossberg that he could \"keep me alive for a year, maybe\". She also discussed battling cancer while watching her cousin, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, make massive cuts to research funding, including for cancers. She and other family members are ardent critics of Kennedy since his unsuccessful presidential campaign and nomination for the health role. \"As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors, nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I watched as Bobby cut nearly a half billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,\" Schlossberg wrote. Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, announced in August that he was pulling the funding over claims that \"mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits\" for certain respiratory viruses. He also revoked funding for hundreds of research grants through the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Even though cuts to mRNA funding were only for respiratory viruses, they have had a chilling effect in the entire mRNA research community, said Jeff Coller, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University focused on RNA therapeutics. \"We've seen that researchers are, quite frankly, afraid to put together proposals for clinical trials that would be using mRNAs. And we call these cancer vaccines,\" he said. The NIH was once a global leader in funding for biomedical research, but that has changed this year, Dr Sankaran said. \"That's been limiting, because you could just imagine you need to take more shots on goal to actually have research that will successfully lead to therapies,\" he said. Schlossberg's battle - while having access to the best care as a member of a prominent American family - highlights the need for more funding to develop better screening tools and treatments for all patients, physicians said. \"[Schlossberg] continues to have a poor prognosis with even the best available tools that we have, and so I think it just really emphasizes our need to do better for many of our patients,\" Dr Sankaran said.

    "body": "President Donald Trump has said he agreed to visit Beijing in April and invited Chinese President Xi Jinping for a state visit later next year, following a phone call between the two leaders.Trump and Xi - who met nearly a month ago in South Korea - discussed a range of issues including trade, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl and Taiwan, according to the president and China's foreign ministry.\"Our relationship with China is extremely strong!\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.China's state new agency released a statement that said both countries should \"keep up the momentum, keep moving forward in the right direction on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit\". The leaders met in Busan, South Korea in October, after which they agreed to a truce on tariffs. The US decided to cut a 20% tariff in half aimed at decreasing the flow of fentanyl. Tariffs remain on Chinese goods and average just below 50%. \"Since then, the China-US relationship has generally maintained a steady and positive trajectory, and this is welcomed by the two countries and the broader international community,\" the Chinese statement said.Xi and Trump find temporary truce as China plays longer gameTrade, tariffs and TikTok: Why it matters that Trump and Xi are talking againThe US then pulled back a threat of 100% additional tariffs on Chinese goods, while China delayed its plan to introduce its latest round of rare earth export controls. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Monday call with Xi - which lasted about an hour - was focused on trade.\"We are pleased with what we've seen from from the Chinese, and they feel the same way,\" she said.In addition to discussing trade, Xi and Trump broached the topics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan.Xi told Trump that Taiwan's \"return to China\" is essential for China's vision for the \"post-war international order\".China has been marred in a diplomatic battle with Japan, a US ally, over the longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.Earlier this month, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said any Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a Japanese military response.Trump, however, did not mention Taiwan in his Truth Social post about the call. US Ambassador to Japan, George Glass, previously said the US backs Tokyo in the wake of China's \"coercion\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoNardine Saadin Los Angeles Records about the death of Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl whose body was found in singer D4vd's car, have been barred from public release, officials said. The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Ms Rivas Hernandez's death can be released or posted on its website.The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers \"receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public\".Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is \"virtually unheard of in other counties\" and \"has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system\". \"We are dedicated to serving our community with full transparency; however, the law precludes us from doing so while the court order remains in this case,\" Dr Ukpo added.Police discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded Tesla on 8 September, after responding to reports of a foul odour at a Hollywood tow yard. Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner.The car, registered to D4vd, had been towed from the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood five days after it had been abandoned. D4vd, 20, whose real name David Anthony Burke, released his debut album in April and was on tour when the remains were discovered. He has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.A police spokesperson said the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division. No arrests have been made. The county's medical examiner previously said Ms Rivas Hernandez's body was \"severely decomposed\" when it was found in September and deferred making a ruling on how she died pending the death investigation.When her remains were found in a bag in D4vd's car on 8 September, the medical examiner said that she was wearing a tube top, size small black leggings and jewellery, including a yellow metal stud earring and a yellow metal chain bracelet.She also had a tattoo that read \"Shhh…\" on her index finger - a marking nearly identical to that on the pop singer's own index finger.The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators said.The girl, who lived about 75 miles away from where her body was discovered - had run away from her home repeatedly.Neighbours recognised the first-generation daughter of immigrant parents from El Salvador, as as a girl who would visit the corner store almost daily to buy candy and soda, according to the Los Angeles Times.Her family, who described her as a beloved daughter, sister, cousin and friend, has said they are \"heartbroken and devastated by this tragic loss\". They solicited money on a crowdfunding website to pay for her funeral, which took place in October.The case has also derailed the aspiring career of the viral hitmaker.His world tour was cancelled within days of the discovery, and Sony Music Publishing reportedly suspended promotion of his sophomore album.Los Angeles police soon raided the posh Hollywood Hills mansion where the singer was living, just blocks from where his Tesla had been towed.US retailer Hollister and footwear giant Crocs dropped D4vd from marketing campaigns and Telepatía singer Kali Uchis announced she was taking down their collaboration, Crashing.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has ordered officials to examine whether to designate some chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorists groups, a move that would target the group with economic and travel sanctions.His executive order on Monday calls for his top aides to produce a report investigating whether the branches in Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan should be listed as foreign terrorist organisations and specially designated global terrorists.The order cites the groups' alleged ties to Hamas, and \"destabilization campaigns that harm their own regions, United States citizens, and United States interests\".The Muslim Brotherhood, founded almost 100 years ago, is banned in Jordan and Egypt. The executive order directs US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to consult Attorney General Pam Bondi and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and to produce a report within 30 days.It then gives the US officials 45 days to levy sanctions if they are determined to be warranted.The designation, which Trump could order at any time, would make it illegal to provide support for the group. It would also lead to economic sanctions, and the banning of its members from entering the US. \"President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood's transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against US interests and allies in the Middle East,\" the White House said in a statement. Last week, the governor of Texas declared the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organisation and transnational criminal organisation. The Texas order also assigns the same status to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the largest Muslim advocacy group in the US, and prevents both groups from being able to purchase land in the state. The Brotherhood was founded in Egypt almost 100 years ago and has local branches across the world. Each chapter varies in ideology, and one of its aims is to create a state ruled by Islamic law, or Sharia.Trump considered designating the group a terrorist organisation during his first term after meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi. It is outlawed in Egypt and several Arab countries, whose governments see it as a threat.In April, Jordan banned the group after arresting members on suspicion of planning rocket and drone attacks.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesMarjorie Taylor Greene's five years in Congress will come to an early end on 5 January after she unexpectedly announced her resignation following a bitter rift with President Donald Trump.The surprise move from the Georgia congresswoman - a rising star in the Republican party - has left many speculating about her next steps.Her decision follows a public fallout with Trump, who branded her \"a traitor\" and said he would endorse her opponent in next year's election. It comes after months of Greene's blistering criticism on the Trump administration's refusal to release files related to the investigation into the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein - as well as several of Trump's policy positions.Rumours have already begun circulating that Greene, 51, might run for president in 2028, which she immediately shot down. So, if not the Oval Office, what is next for Greene? Run for president in 2028Although she claims she has no interest in the presidency now, having a future change of heart is not an unknown feature of US politics.When Greene signed a petition to force a vote requiring the release of the files related to Epstein - over Trump's objections - it went on to a bill authored by her Democratic colleague, Ro Khanna. Khanna told NBC News after Greene's latest announcement that she was \"likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate\", adding that she was \"more in touch\" with Trump's base than his number two, Vice-President JD Vance. Time Magazine also reported that Greene \"privately told allies\" she was considering a presidential bid, but Greene quickly dismissed the assertion as a \"complete lie\".\"I'm not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,\" Greene wrote on social media, re-posting Time Magazine's article. Greene has notably distanced herself from her party's positions - and from the president - for whom she once was an ardent supporter. She has spoken out against issues including Epstein files, Trump's global tariffs, support for Israel and healthcare funding. A possible run for governor or Senate Greene has not been quite as explicit about ruling out the possibility of running for Georgia governor or to represent her state in the US Senate.Elections for both take place in 2026.Two-time Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is up against his term limit and unable to run again, widening the field of possible replacements. Greene could also use her clout to pursue the race for the US Senate and attempt to unseat Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year.Both the role of governor and US senator are ones that Greene has expressed interest in, at least according to Trump.In the president's public spat with Greene following her resignation announcement, Trump wrote on social media that the feud began \"when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor\".\"She was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get!)\", he said.Kennesaw State University Professor of Political Science Kerwin Swint, who lives in Greene's congressional district, says that Trump is aware of her unpopularity outside of her immediate district, and that she would probably \"get obliterated\" if she ran for statewide office.Without those options, the only other office she may have her sights on is president, despite her protestations.\"I don't see that happening,\" Swint says. \"She would be such an amazing longshot to dark horse. \"But most politicians have a big enough ego that they look in the mirror, they see a future president. So it's not out of the question.\"Entering the conservative media landscape Swint predicts that she'll start a podcast and attempt to remain in the public spotlight by continuing to build her media profile.\"I think she wants to be an influencer basically. And so I think someone who wants to do that is going to reach for these media opportunities,\" he says.If she chooses a life outside of politics, Greene would join a host of former politicians and political operatives who have launched careers in the podcast arena. After Republican Representative Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress to accept his failed nomination to become Trump's US attorney general, he started his own podcast. The trend has even caught hold on the left, with Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom also hosting his own podcast. Meanwhile, FBI deputy director Dan Bongino went on to join the Trump administration after success as a radio host and commentator.Greene could also decide to become a conservative commentator on more left-leaning networks, like CNN, where she has made frequent appearances in recent days. \"I knew she was going to be the next co-host of The View!\", conservative personality Megan McCain wrote on X, referring to Greene's recent appearance on ABC's liberal-leaning daily chat show.Leave politics behind completelyIn the 10-minute video announcing her resignation, Greene also suggested she might leave politics to spend more time with her family who she said she missed \"precious time with\" as she fought for Trump. Throughout her time in politics, Greene said, she faced \"never ending personal attacks\" and \"threats\". \"It has been unfair and wrong, not only to me, but especially to my family,\" she said.  Since her public feud with the president, Greene said the threats against her have only increased.In addition to being a member of Congress, Greene is also the owner of a commercial construction and renovation company called Taylor Commercial. The company has managed roughly $250m in construction projects, since Greene acquired it in 2002, according to her website. With reporting by Max Matza",

    "body": "Judge dismisses cases against ex-FBI director Comey and NY attorney general James7 hours agoAna FaguyComey: \"Donald Trump will probably come after me again\"A US judge has dismissed criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the charges was unlawfully appointed.Judge Cameron Currie said that Lindsey Halligan, who was handpicked by Trump to bring the charges against two of his political adversaries, was never eligible to assume the post.Both Comey and James have maintained their innocence and described the prosecutions as political in nature. In response to the ruling, the White House told the BBC:  \"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed and this will not be the final word on this matter.\"President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Comey and James, declaring in one social media post, \"They're all guilty as hell\", and later adding \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" In her decision on Monday, Judge Currie wrote that Halligan, a former White House aide who had never prosecuted a case before, was not authorised to present the charges to the grand jury.\"All actions flowing from Ms Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr Comey's indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,\" Currie ruled.Getty ImagesLindsey HalliganHalligan was named as a replacement for Erik Siebert, an interim US attorney who resigned in September amid the Trump administration's pressure to file charges against both Comey and James.Judge Currie determined that Halligan's appointment violated the statute governing interim US attorneys. Under that law, the attorney general has 120 days to make an interim appointment - a period that began on 21 January with Siebert's designation, the judge noted.When that 120-day window closed on 21 May, the attorney general's authority to appoint an interim replacement expired as well, Judge Currie wrote. As a result, Halligan \"has been unlawfully serving in that role\" since her 22 September appointment.The cases were dismissed \"without prejudice\", meaning the justice department could potentially refile the case at a later date.The department did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the justice department would appeal against the dismissal of Comey and James's cases \"very soon\".She said the administration's position was that Halligan had been legally appointed. Leavitt also accused the judge of \"trying to shield\"  Comey and James.Getty ImagesLetitia JamesAfter the ruling, Comey said he was grateful a prosecution \"based on malevolence and incompetence\" had ended, but noted \"Trump will probably come after me again\".Comey was fired by Trump during his first term, after leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The former FBI director was charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice in September, after Trump called for his prosecution and appointed a new federal prosecutor to pursue the case. James issued a statement saying she was \"heartened by today's victory\".\"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day,\" the statement continued.James was facing federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. She previously brought charges against Trump before he won re-election, and later became a target of the Trump administration.

    "body": "Five key moments after MPs question top BBC figures7 hours agoLauren TurnerCulture reporterVuk Valcic/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesFive senior BBC figures, including its chairman, faced questions from MPs for more than three hours after a leaked memo raised claims of bias at the corporation. It comes after BBC director general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness resigned earlier this month over a Panorama episode that edited together parts of a 2021 speech by US President Donald Trump.That edit was highlighted in the memo, which was leaked and published by the Daily Telegraph. The memo's author Michael Prescott was among those facing MPs' questions on Monday.Prescott appeared alongside Caroline Daniel, his fellow former external editorial adviser to the BBC, at the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee. BBC chairman Samir Shah and fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson also appeared.'Real work needs to be done at the BBC'Prescott, a former Sunday Times political editor, was clear when asked if he thought there was institutional bias at the BBC.\"No, I don't,\" he told MPs. \"Let's be clear, tons of stuff the BBC does is world class.\" But he said there were problems with dealing with editorial issues, adding that \"the BBC was not, and I hope they will change, treating these as having systemic causes\". \"There's real work that needs to be done at the BBC,\" he added.Prescott said he wrote the memo \"because I am a strong supporter of the BBC\". But he stressed there were \"incipient problems\" not being tackled. In other words, issues at an early stage he felt were not being dealt with.He singled out a now-removed BBC Verify story from 2024 that incorrectly reported that people from ethnic minorities paid higher car insurance premiums. This story was found to be \"utterly untrue\", Prescott said, saying this was a \"dreadful thing to have put out\". There were \"multiple levels\" of editorial failure on this story, he added, as well as the apparent absence of an inquiry into what happened and why.We were too slow to apologise, says Shah Shah started his evidence to the committee by apologising to all those who believe in the BBC, licence fee payers, and to BBC staff, saying: \"I regret the mistakes that have been made.\"This comes after he made an apology to the committee - and after the BBC also made an apology to Trump.Shah admitted action should have been taken sooner after issues with the Trump speech edit became known at board level.Former Newsnight journalist David Grossman, who wrote internal reports commissioned by the BBC board, first flagged the edit in January and it was then discussed further in May, the committee heard.\"Looking back, I think we should have made the decision [to respond] earlier, in May,\" said Shah.He told the committee that Turness, the BBC News chief, had wanted to apologise for the edit sooner, but he did not think this was \"sufficient\" as the real issue was the impression given that Trump \"encouraged a call to violent action\".\"I think there is an issue about how quickly we respond, the speed of our response, why do we not do it quickly enough,\" he said, adding: \"We should have pursued it to the end and got to the bottom of it, and not wait as we did until it became public discourse.\"Asked if there was pressure from the board to delay the apology, he said \"absolutely not\". Shah vowed to stay in his role to fix the problems.Difference of opinion over apologyThomson, who worked at the BBC until 2012 and returned this year as a non-executive board member, also spoke about the timing of the BBC apology. She said there was a \"continuing and sharp difference of opinion\" between members of the board and Turness about whether they were going to apologise for the edit or the impact of the edit. Thomson told the committee she thought the edit gave a \"misleading\" impression of what the US president said.She added that news bosses continued to maintain the impression given was correct because of the content of Trump's speech that day, saying: \"They felt that the edit was justified, but it should have been a more transparent edit.\" Sir Robbie told the committee it came down to whether \"there was a serious error\". He said he felt that the edit gave the impression that Trump's comments were a call to arms, adding this \"was a breach of editorial policy\".Chairman urged director general not to resignAsked if he tried to stop Davie stepping down, Shah said \"I did indeed\". He described the actions of Turness as \"honourable\" and \"proper\", repeating her assertion that the \"buck stops\" with her. But on Davie, he said: \"I wish, and the board wishes, that the director general had not resigned. He had our full confidence throughout.\" \"I am very sorry to lose him,\" he added. House of CommonsBBC chairman Samir Shah said he urged Tim Davie not to resignShah also told the committee the role of director general is \"too big for one person\" and that he is \"inclined to restructure the executive in the future, once we get a new director\". The BBC officially launched its search for a new boss on Monday, with the advert for the next director general now on its careers site.\"The lens through which we examine potential candidates for the director general includes the idea that there will be a deputy director general, who would be focused on journalism,\" Shah told the MPs.Sir Robbie Gibb claims he was 'weaponised'Sir Robbie, who spent over 20 years working at the BBC and was director of communications for former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, was asked how he managed his own bias. \"I have impartiality through my bones,\" he told the committee, saying it was \"drummed\" into him when he joined the BBC in 1991.He said he felt he had become \"weaponised\" in the way he had been perceived. Asked about Sir Robbie during the session, Shah said he had \"absolute faith\" in him. Sir Robbie also dismissed claims of there having been a \"board-level orchestrated coup\" over the leaking of the memo as \"complete nonsense\".\"It's also deeply offensive to fellow board members who are people of great standing in different fields,\" he added.

    "body": "The controversial, US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) says it is winding down its aid operations in the Palestinian territory, after almost six months.The organisation had already suspended its three food distribution sites in Gaza after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect six weeks ago.The GHF aimed to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Gaza's population. UN and other aid agencies refused to co-operate with its system, saying it was unethical and unsafe.Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites, mostly by Israeli fire, according to the UN. Israel said its troops fired warning shots.The GHF said on Monday that it was winding down operations now because of the \"successful completion of its emergency mission\", with a total of three million packages containing the equivalent of more than 187 million meals delivered to Palestinians.The GHF's executive director, Jon Acree, also said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) - which has been set up to help implement US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan - would be \"adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted\".US state department spokesperson Tommy Piggott wrote on X: \"GHF's model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire.\"Hamas - which denies stealing aid - welcomed the closure of the GHF, Reuters reported. A spokesman for said GHF should be held accountable for the harm it caused to Palestinians.\"We call upon all international human rights organisations to ensure that it does not escape accountability after causing the death and injury of thousands of Gazans and covering up the starvation policy practised by the (Israeli) government,\" Hazem Qassem wrote on his Telegram channel.The GHF began operations in Gaza on 26 May, a week after Israel had partially eased a total blockade on aid and commercial deliveries to Gaza that lasted 11 weeks and caused severe shortages of essential supplies. Three months later, a famine was declared in Gaza City.The GHF's food distribution sites in southern and central Gaza were operated by US private security contractors and located inside Israeli military zones.The UN and its partners said the system contravened the fundamental humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence, and that channelling desperate people into militarised zones was inherently unsafe.The UN's human rights office said it recorded the killing of at least 859 Palestinians seeking food in the vicinity of GHF sites between 26 May and 31 July. Another 514 people were killed near the routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added. Most of them were killed by the Israeli military, according to the office.The Israeli military said its troops had fired warning shots at people who approached them in a \"threatening\" manner.The GHF said there were no shootings at the aid sites and accused the UN of using \"false and misleading\" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.The GHF's future had been uncertain since Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire deal to implement the first phase of Trump's peace plan.It said aid distribution would take place \"without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner\" with Hamas and Israel.UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday that the GHF's shutdown would have \"no impact\" on its operations \"because we never worked with them\".He also said that while more aid was getting into Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October, it was \"not enough to meet all the needs\" of the 2.1 million population.",

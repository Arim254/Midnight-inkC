    "body": "Woman who drove round bend at 85mph admits killing three men3 hours agoAlan SimpsonJorja Colville will be sentenced in JanuaryA 21-year-old woman who crashed a car after driving round a bend at more than 85mph has admitted killing her three passengers.Reece Williams, 23, Lewis Soden, 24, and Connor Page, 21, all died after the Ford Focus being driven by Jorja Colville crashed near Falkirk in July last year.  The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Colville was also speeding at more than 90mph shortly before the accident outside the village of Dunmore. Colville admitted causing death by dangerous driving and will be sentenced on 8 January at the High Court in Stirling.Her bail was continued.Police ScotlandConnor Page, Lewis Soden and Reece Williams were all killed in the crashJudge Lady Ross told Colville a prison sentence was \"inevitable\" and that there was nothing that could be said to take away \"the desperate pain\" in the lives of the three victims' families.Colville, of Stirling, admitted causing the deaths of the men on 26 July last year by driving dangerously at excessive speed, failing to maintain control of her car, causing it to leave the road and travel onto a verge where it struck a tree.Advocate depute Scott McKenzie told the court that Colville, an early years assistant, had no previous convictions.'Screaming for help'The prosecutor said that on the day of the crash, witness Kirstin Scobbie was driving on Moss Road on the approach to the collision site when she saw Colville's car behind her.She was travelling at about 60 mph, the appropriate speed limit, when the Focus overtook her before pulling back in close to the front of her vehicle.Mr McKenzie said: \"The white Ford Focus pulled away from her at speed.\" Following a series of bends in the road she noticed debris on the roadway and then saw the Focus in bushes.The prosecutor said: \"She noted the vehicle was on its side and had sustained serious damage. \"She stopped her vehicle as she approached the white Ford and saw Jorja Colville covered in blood and screaming for help.\"The court heard that Colville said that there were three people in the car who could not get out.Mr McKenzie said: \"She described that none of them were awake and that she did not know if they were breathing.\"Another driver, Dean Norris, saw the Focus approaching him in the opposing lane and said it momentarily left the road surface due to the dip on the road and formed the impression it was travelling at excessive speed. \"He saw the vehicle land back on the road surface before it lost control as it passed him,\" said the prosecutor.Mr Norris turned back to offer help and went to the Focus, but could not find any signs of life from the three men inside the vehicle. When police arrived Colville confirmed she was the driver and said her boyfriend Reece Williams was in the car along with her friends.Mr Williams had sustained blunt-force injuries to his head, chest, abdomen and limbs in the crash.Mr Soden suffered multiple injuries to his head, neck, chest abdomen and pelvis and Mr Page died from multiple blunt-force head and neck injuries.The court heard that data recovered from the car showed its speed increased greatly on the approach to the crash scene, hitting a maximum speed of 92.6mph prior to a bend and continuing through the bend at speeds in excess of 85mph.Collision investigators said the crash occurred because the driver was \"driving at significantly excessive speed for the road layout and approaching hazards of which she was warned of\".The court heard that a section of the road before the crash site has a series of peaks and troughs with a warning sign in place to alert drivers.Defence solicitor advocate Gordon Martin KC told the court that Colville, who suffered a broken shoulder and ribs, has not driven since the incident.",

    "body": "A woman has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for her role in the murders of three tourists during a carjacking in Mexico last year.Ari Gisell, 23, pleaded guilty to instigating the violent assault on Australian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and their American friend Carter Rhoad, who were on a surfing trip in the northern Mexican state of Baja California in April 2024 when they disappeared.Their bodies were later found with gunshot wounds to the head at the bottom of a deep well.Ari Gisell had expressed interest in the tyres on the surfers' car and told her then-boyfriend Jesús Gerardo to \"bring me a good phone and good tyres for my pickup truck\", the court heard.Only the first and middle names of the defendants were revealed. Surnames were not, in line with Mexican court reporting rules.Jesús Gerardo and two others, Irineo Francisco and Ángel Jesús, tailed the vehicle to the campsite where the foreigners were staying, then robbed them before shooting them dead. The cases against these three men are still before the courts.According to Mexican newspaper La Silla Rota, Jesús Gerardo and Irineo Francisco have ties with the powerful drug cartel Sinaloa, which was for many years led by the notorious drug lord Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán.Because of these links, both men are being held in El Hongo, a maximum-security prison in Baja California. Ángel Jesús has been detained in a separate facility in the city of Ensenada.Prosecutors do not suspect any connections between the murders and organised crime, however, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).The victims' families, who appeared via video conference, made emotional statements at the hearing on Wednesday.\"We dreamed of seeing them grow older, of having children. That's all taken now,\" said Callum and Jake's mother Debra Robinson, as reported by ABC. \"We live with their absence.\"Callum Robinson, 33, was a member of Australia's national lacrosse team and was living in San Diego, just across the US-Mexico border from Baja California.His younger brother Jake, 30, lived in Australia and had travelled to North America to visit Callum. He was due to start a new job as a doctor when he returned.Their friend Rhoad, 30, was a San Diego resident and worked in a technology services company. Rhoad was months away from marrying his fiancee when he was killed.\"He was my safety in the world,\" his fiancee Natalie Wiertz told the court. \"My life is now a nightmare.\"Ari Gisell gave a tearful apology in court, acknowledging that \"nothing I can say will compensate you or give you peace\".\"I am focused on being a better person, and I am very sorry for your losses,\" said the single mother, as quoted by La Silla Rota.",

Another woman, aged 58, was arrested in Bishopbriggs near Glasgow.Police Scotland launched Operation Koine launched in April last year after several families reported they had been given the wrong ashes.The force received reports about the funeral directors from more than 70 people, but believe a larger number may be affected.In May 2024 police searched A Milne's office in Springburn, Glasgow, and recovered 19 containers with ashes, just days after eight urns were handed over to Argyll and Bute Council.The firm was then expelled by the National Association of Funeral Directors.The majority of complaints related to alleged fraudulent prepaid funeral plans.Families involved previously told BBC Scotland News of the upset caused after learning the ashes of what they believed were relatives were actually strangers.Specialist officers, including those from the Financial Investigations Unit, are involved in the investigation.Victim supportPolice Scotland Det Supt Robert Bowie said the force was continuing to work through lines of inquiry in an \"unprecedented investigation\".He added:  \"I'd like to thank everyone who has come forward with information on this investigation and members of the public for their continued support.\"A victim support drop-in clinic will be held on 5 December. It is for people who have already been in contact with police with concerns about the funeral directors.Police Scotland said the three people arrested would be reported to the Crown Office Procurator Fiscal Service.

    "body": "4 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterFriends fans in the US can finally watch the last eight episodes of the hit sitcom's ill-fated spin-off show Joey, starring Matt LeBlanc as the hapless but loveable Joey Tribbiani.The 2004 NBC sitcom was cancelled in 2006 midway through its second season following poor ratings, meaning US fans never got to see the final instalments.Now, almost 20 years later, those episodes have been made available to watch on the Friends YouTube channel.The show, which first aired just four months after Friends ended, saw Joey move to Los Angeles, where, ironically, his new sitcom was cancelled, forcing him to move in with family.\"To the person that runs the Friends YouTube channel, thank you,\" one fan wrote. \"I never got a chance to watch this series and the fact that you kept with it is amazing.\"Another wrote: \"The show, despite its critics, made me laugh on every episode and rewatching it now after all theses years was therapeutic. Farewell Joey, you have made an impact in my life and I will cherish it.\"Someone else said: \"I hope Matt Le Blanc and the rest of the cast read the comments on this channel some day and realise that, contrary to public opinion, there was a community that absolutely adored this TV show.\"The cast also included Jennifer Coolidge, Drea de Matteo, Paulo Costanzo, Miguel A. Núñez Jr and Ben Falcone.While Joey's pilot episode was watched by a decent 18.6 million viewers, ratings slid as the series progressed, averaging 10.2 million viewers in its first season and 7.1 million in its second.Joey was then removed from its Thursday slot - the same one that Friends had aired in - in December 2005, returning to NBC on Tuesdays in March 2006.It was pulled again, this time after just one more episode. The show was officially cancelled after two seasons in May the same year.Some international fans were able to watch the full two seasons in their own countries at the time.UK fans could watch on Channel 5, which aired the second season aired in its entirety in 2007.Joey has a 50% rating on film review site Rotten Tomatoes - compared with 78% for Friends.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMariam IssimdarBBC Children in NeedChildren in Need confirmed its recently appointed chair, Terry Duddy, has resigned following a driving convictionThe chair of BBC Children in Need has resigned just weeks into the role after he was convicted of careless driving for crashing into a cyclist. Terence Duddy's BMW knocked a woman off her bike as he turned right on High Street, Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, on 21 June.  The 69-year-old admitted causing serious injury by careless and inconsiderate driving at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court on 13 November and was given an eight-month custodial sentence, suspended for 18 months. BBC Children in Need confirmed Duddy, who was appointed as chair on 21 October, had resigned, saying \"he could not continue in this role\".The collision was in Buckinghamshire in June As well as the suspended prison sentence, the court disqualified Duddy from driving or obtaining a licence for 18 months, fined him £85 costs plus £175 victim surcharge. He will also have to carry out 200 hours of community service in the next 12 months.  Thames Valley Police posted details and footage of the crash with the woman, who was in her 50s, to its Facebook page. It added: \"The cyclist had right of way and a moment of carelessness from the driver, by not properly checking the road was clear to cross, has had a life changing impact on the cyclist.\"Children in Need issued a statement following the sentencing. It stated: \"On Tuesday 18 November, our new chair Terry Duddy informed us that he had been convicted last week of causing serious injury through careless driving. \"In light of this he offered his resignation, which the board accepted, agreeing he could not continue in this role.\"The charity also confirmed \"robust\" checks were carried out prior to Duddy's appointment. A spokeswoman said: \"In accordance with established processes for all senior hires at the BBC robust due diligence was undertaken, including a DBS [criminal record] check. \"No concerns were identified or disclosed during this process.\"The charity confirmed James Fairclough, a trustee since 2021, would be replacing Duddy having formally been appointed chair \"with immediate effect\". \"We remain focused on helping children and young people thrive,\" it said. When Duddy was appointed to the role, the charity said he brought \"a wealth of governance and leadership experience across both the charity and commercial sectors, along with a strong commitment to supporting children and young people\".He was a trustee of the London Marathon Foundation, chair of London Marathon Events and chair of the charity Catch 22.  He has previously held senior commercial roles, including chief executive of Home Retail Group Plc.Children in Need is one of the BBC's corporate charities and last week it raised more than £45m to help children and young people across the UK.It operates independently with its own board of trustees, relying on public donations and other partners to fund its work.Related internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoGetty ImagesTeachers could work a \"flexible\" four-day teaching week under new proposals announced by the Scottish government.Plans also include reduced classroom contact time with pupils and agreed national minimum standards for pupil learning hours. It would leave a fifth day for \"professional learning\" activities outside of the classroom, including lesson preparation, marking and training.Scotland's education secretary Jenny Gilruth said it demonstrated a \"clear commitment\" to teachers. But the EIS union said was \"not aware\" of how a four-day week would work.The EIS and NASUWT unions are currently balloting members on strike action over a failure to reduce class contact time - periods when teachers are directly teaching pupils.At the last Holyrood election, the SNP promised to cut contact time by 90 minutes a week to allow more time for other activities.  The new proposals could enable later start times, extended breaks, or restructured school days.The teaching unions emphasised that any allocated time outside of the classroom should be used as teachers see fit.PA MediaJenny Gilruth said the proposals showed a \"clear commitment to teachers\"The education secretary said the plans, along with a new pay deal, would form a new \"National Deal\" for teachers.Jenny Gilruth acknowledged that unions had \"strong\" opinions on these plans and said she would meet with the EIS later.She told BBC Scotland: \"The move to a four-day teaching week would really help to lighten the load in terms of workload, but also to create headspace for the teaching profession.\"We've come forward with some pragmatic solutions and we very much look forward to engaging with local government and also with the teaching trade unions on securing an agreement to ensure we can improve conditions for teachers.\"'Red line for teachers'A survey by the EIS in June found that the workload in schools was \"unfair, unhealthy and unsustainable\". Teachers said they were rarely or never able to do the work, preparation and correcting they had been asked to do within their working week.EIS general secretary Andrea Bradley said the promised 90-minute reduction in class contact time was a \"red line for teachers\".\"There can be no government or employer diktat over how this time should be utilised by teachers,\" she added.Ms Bradley told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the union was not yet aware of how a flexible four-day week would be implemented.She said the Scottish government's proposals did \"not amount to a plan that can be properly scrutinised\" and said it would not affect the EIS strike ballot.NASUWT said it was pleased with the proposals but it needed \"assurance that teachers will have the responsibility for deciding how such time should be used\". A spokesperson added: \"Our members are frustrated at the ongoing delays in the delivery of a clear Scottish government promise to them, which is why we have opened a ballot on industrial action on this matter.\"This is not a proposal to put teachers onto a four-day working week. The discussion is about exactly how a teacher's five day week might be structured.Any changes would come after negotiations involving the unions and councils. But there are clearly important practical issues which need to be looked at, not least in primary schools. Having a different teacher one day a week is different to having a different teacher for an hour, perhaps for PE or another specific subject. But there is real frustration among some teachers over their workloads. The unions want reduced contact time to help cut the amount of work teachers say they have to do in their own time in the evenings and at weekends.Strike ballots over this issue continue.Even if the proposals do not become the definitive long-term solution, will they be enough to avert the risk of a strike in the months before the Scottish election?",

    "body": "40 minutes agoKate Whannel,Political reporter and Ewan SomervilleTrans people could be asked about whether they should be accessing single-sex services based on their physical appearance or behaviour, new guidance seen by the BBC has said.A code of practice, produced by the equalities watchdog and awaiting ministerial approval, says it may be legitimate for businesses or services to ask individuals to provide confirmation that they are of the eligible sex \"by proportionate means\". It acknowledges that there is \"no type of official record or document in the UK which provides reliable evidence of sex\" because people can self-identify on documents such as passports.Equalities minister Bridget Phillipson said she'd take the time needed to \"get this right\".Phillipson, who received the code nearly three months ago, added that it was important to make sure women had access to single-service provisions such as rape crisis centres while ensuring that trans people are treated with \"dignity and respect\".The 300-page document was drawn up by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) after the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that legally a woman should be defined by biological sex for the purposes of the Equality Act. The EHRC has to provide practical advice to businesses and services about how this should work. Following the Supreme Court ruling in April, the EHRC guidance says single-sex spaces should only be open to people of the same biological sex, otherwise they cease to be single-sex areas. That would mean, for instance, that a trans woman – a biological male who identifies as a woman - would not be able to use women's toilets and changing rooms. The guidance says transgender people, who are also protected by equalities law, should be treated with dignity and respect.The updated code of practice is awaiting approval. It can only gain legal force once it has been signed off by ministers and laid in Parliament for 40 days. The guidance, first reported by The Times, says that if there are concerns then decisions about access to spaces may need to be based on how someone looks. It also says that if a transgender person is excluded from a space, the organisation should consider alternatives and that it would not be proportionate to leave the person without essential services, such as toilets. The guidance acknowledges that providing alternatives may not always be possible due to space constraints or cost.Last month, interim guidance was withdrawn and EHRC chair Baroness Falkner urged the government to speed up its approval of the new code, warning that some organisations were operating under old guidance, which had become unlawful in the light of the court's decision.Conservative shadow women and equalities minister Mims Davies has previously suggested Phillipson had chosen not to sign off the guidance because she did not want to damage her chances in the Labour Party deputy leadership election, which ended last month.A source close to Phillipson described the claim as \"utter nonsense\". Approving the guidance could be unpopular in some parts of the Labour Party.During the deputy leadership contest, Lucy Powell, who eventually beat Phillipson to the job, said \"I think we have got some of the language not right on this, and particularly around some of the guidance that's coming forward.\"Last month, 32 Labour MPs wrote to the EHRC arguing that the interim guidance it issued in April, would \"open the door to discrimination and harassment against trans people\". The interim guidance, which was withdrawn in October, is being challenged in the courts. During the hearing in the High Court, the lawyer, representing the government, suggested the interim guidance may have been too simplistic and that access to spaces such as toilets could be judged on a case-by-case basis.Speaking to Times Radio, education minister Josh MacAllister said the government was working \"as fast as we can\" but that there was no deadline for reaching a decision. \"We want to get it right, and if we don't get it right it does risk putting this back into the courts and providing even greater uncertainty for people.\"Asked if the government was avoiding making a decision in the hope the issue would be forgotten about, he said that would be \"really bad politics... because the problem isn't going to go away\".\"These are massive issues... when you drill down into examples of how this might be applied, it has big implications for individuals, it has big implications for businesses and public services,\" he said.\"The guidance, as it's written, has implications for both how physical buildings are set up, but also how staff in those settings would need to determine and judge even whether somebody might look like a woman.\"And so we want to avoid being in a position where toilets are being policed by people.\"",

    "body": "Why an AI 'godfather' is quitting Meta after 12 years5 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGetty ImagesProf LeCun is known for advancing the deep learning field of AI, and for his jazzy bowtiesJust a couple of weeks ago, one of the \"godfathers\" of artificial intelligence was in St James's Palace being handed an award from King Charles for his work in artificial intelligence (AI).Professor Yann LeCun was being honoured along with six other recipients for his contributions to the field, which have been credited as advancing deep learning. But Mr LeCun is at odds with some of the AI world over the future of the generation-defining technology.And now he is going all-in on his idea of \"advanced machine intelligence\" after announcing he is leaving his role as Meta's chief AI scientist to start a new firm.During his 12 years at the company, Prof LeCun won the prestigious Turing Award and witnessed several flurries of excitement around AI - not least the most recent boom in generative AI accelerated by rival OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.But his departure comes amid speculation the AI boom could meet an abrupt end should the so-called \"AI bubble\" of ballooning valuations and soaring spending burst.Investors, analysts and even big tech bosses like Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai have said a market correction to the AI sector would ripple across the wider economy.What LeCun thinks the AI world gets wrongProf LeCun announced his planned departure from Meta on Wednesday after more than a week of rumours and reports of his exit.In a series of posts on Threads, he thanked the company's founder Mark Zuckerberg and highlighted its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab as his \"proudest non-technical accomplishment\".\"As many of you have heard through rumours or recent media articles, I am planning to leave Meta after 12 years: 5 years as founding director of FAIR and 7 years as Chief AI Scientist,\" he wrote.\"The impact of FAIR on the company, on the field of AI, on the tech community, and on the wider world has been spectacular.\"The lab has over the years focused on developing systems and techniques to advance machine learning and translation.But, like large parts of the sector, Meta has looked to concentrate much of the company's research and spending on large language models (LLMs) - the systems at the heart of generative AI tools such as chatbots and image generators.Prof LeCun has suggested LLMs will be less useful in attempting to create AI systems that can match human intelligence.Instead, he wants to pursue what he called \"advanced machine intelligence\".It trains AI models primarily by using visual learning - trying to replicate how a child or a baby animal learns.That differs to LLMs, which are fed vast amounts of existing data, and then asked to generate a result based on the data and a prompt.Prof LeCun will still have a relationship with Meta once he sets up his new company,  he said - adding in posts about his departure it would be a partner of his new firm.But reports suggest he has been increasingly moving away from the approach the company wants to take. Unlike his fellow AI godfathers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, Prof LeCun has cast doubt on the idea AI might pose an existential threat to humanity.In 2023, he called such fears \"preposterously ridiculous\".\"Will AI take over the world? No, this is a projection of human nature on machines,\" he told the BBC.But some have also questioned Prof LeCun's characterisation as an outlier or visionary in the industry.\"Yann LeCun has, without a doubt made genuine contributions to AI, and I am pleased to see him speak out again the limits on LLMs,\" said AI expert and professor Gary Marcus in a recent blog.\"But he has also systematically dismissed and ignored the work of others for years,\" he added, including himself among those whose work he suggested Prof LeCun had often overlooked.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterAndy Burnham has repeatedly failed to rule out a Labour leadership bid, after an MP said he would vacate his seat so the Greater Manchester mayor can return to Westminster.Burnham has been at the centre of speculation about a move against Sir Keir Starmer since Labour's autumn conference but could only do so if he was an MP, under Labour Party rules. On Wednesday, Norwich South MP Clive Lewis said he was willing to step down to potentially make way for Burnham to return to the Commons via a by-election.Burnham was quizzed on the MP's offer on BBC Breakfast,  BBC Radio 4's Today programme, BBC Radio Manchester and BBC 5Live, but would only say he is \"fully focused\" on his current role.'I don't know what the future holds': Burnham refuses to rule out Starmer challengeOn BBC Breakfast, presenter Naga Munchetty tried to pin Burnham down on whether he would see out his full term as mayor, running until 2028.\"I don't know what the world holds but I'm focused on my job here in Greater Manchester,\" he responded. Pushed further, he said \"I haven't launched any leadership challenge\" before adding \"I'm not going to sit here this morning and rule out what might or might not happen in future - I don't know what the future will hold.\"Burnham then criticised journalists for speculating, saying he is \"constantly answering hypothetical questions\" and claimed MPs in Westminster were \"constantly speculating and not putting forward solutions\".He insisted the focus should be on his announcement about a pioneering £1bn growth plan for Manchester, with 30 new projects to create housing and jobs.The Labour Party rules for any leadership challenge state that candidates must be an MP and also secure the backing of at least 80 MPs to run against the incumbent.Two Manchester MPs, Andrew Gwynne and Graham Stringer, previously ruled out stepping down from their seats so Burnham could run.On Wednesday, Lewis told BBC's Politics Live that stepping aside for Burnham was \"a question I've asked myself,\" adding that the answer would have to be \"yes\".The MP, who has represented Norwich South for 10 years, later told The Sun he had \"no plans to stand down\" and had been answering a \"hypothetical question\".The Norwich South MP last week said Sir Keir's position as prime minister was \"untenable\" and told Channel 4 News that Burnham should be given the chance to \"step up\".On the Today programme, presenter Emma Barnett asked Burnham whether he would take Lewis up on his offer of vacating a seat, but he would only say \"I appreciate the support\" and repeated how he was focused on his current job.In his regular Thursday \"hot seat\" session on BBC Radio Manchester, presenter Mike Sweeney asked: \"You could put this to bed now, you could say 'I have no intention whatsoever of returning to parliament' and that isn't a statement that you've made?\"Burnham replied: \"The statement I can make is that I can't make a challenge as it stands because I'm not a member of parliament.\"Asked what could happen if an MP stood aside, he added: \"I'm also going to say I don't know what the future holds... You just don't know do you? No-one goes into an office and speculates about their own future in front of everybody.\"On BBC Radio 5Live, Burnham repeated his lines for a fourth time, until he was asked by Matt Chorley to say whether he had \"full confidence in Keir Starmer serving his full term and leading Labour into the next election\".Burnham said: \"I have confidence in the prime minister.\"He won a really impressive election victory and, as I've said before, you cannot as a government get everything going in the way that you want to in 18  months and I think it's barely 18 months that they've been in office.\"So absolutely this is a moment now, particularly with the budget, to strike out and set a course and get things going and I'm trying to help by bringing forward a plan for growth in Greater Manchester.\"Before becoming Manchester mayor in 2017, Burnham served as a cabinet and shadow cabinet minister under successive Labour leaders and made two unsuccessful Labour leadership bids.Lewis first won his seat in 2015, and last year he increased his majority to more than 13,000.But if he were to step down, any would-be successor would first need to win a selection contest before a by-election was held.",

The legislation, which calls for the release of the files \"in a searchable and downloadable format\" within 30 days, was approved overwhelmingly in both chambers of Congress, the House of Representatives and Senate, on Tuesday.Trump then announced on his Truth Social platform that he had signed it on Wednesday, starting the clock on release of the files. Under pressure from Epstein's victims and rank-and-file Republicans, Trump on Sunday made a major reversal in his stance on the files and gave his blessing to passing the legislation. For months, he had resisted unsealing many documents from the federal investigation into the late financier. Congress' lower chamber began debating the measure on Tuesday morning and voted within hours. Several of Epstein's victims spent the day on Capitol Hill advocating for the bill's passage. Nearly all the House lawmakers voted in favour of the resolution, which passed  427-1. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, was the only lawmaker who voted against the bill. Two Republicans and three Democrats did not vote. The Senate then passed the resolution.The House Oversight Committee has already made public thousands of documents from the Epstein estate relating to the late financier, but the resolution covers material currently in the possession of the justice department.Those records could, in theory, include files about imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as figures - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents. When did Trump sign the bill? On Wednesday morning, the Senate confirmed that it had passed the Epstein bill and sent it to Trump.Later that evening, Trump posted on social media that he had signed it into law. While the press and others are often invited to witness Trump's bill-signings, this was done out of public view, and the announcement was included in a long post that also blasted Democrats he claimed were tied to Epstein, touted the president's record during this second term, and addressed the two impeachment trials of his first term.\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.He added that because he had asked Republican lawmakers to support the measure \"the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage.\"The justice department now has 30 days to release its materials on Epstein.But there are obstacles to the files being shared.The House bill said the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\". That could potentially lead to delays, given that Trump has called for investigations into Epstein's links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton and Larry Summers, \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\".Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, whereas Summers has apologised for his \"misguided decision\" to continue communicating with Epstein until 2019.\"That's a potential hurdle,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC. \"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\" For those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage. Several Republican lawmakers have expressed worries that Trump's order to the justice department to investigate Epstein's ties could slow the release of the files.Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman, vowed that he and fellow Republican dissident Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, would \"absolutely\" go to the floor of the House and read out the names of \"some of the men\" in the files if the records were not duly released by the justice department.Watch: How much do Americans care about the Epstein story?Will the files be redacted?In addition to possible delays, the public is also likely to see lots of redactions in any release of new Epstein documents. In the tranche of files released by the House Oversight Committee last week, names and phone numbers were frequently blacked out to protect privacy. The latest bill says the attorney general can \"withhold or redact\" records that include victims' names, medical files and other personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".\"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Prof Entin said. The attorney general can also withhold classified material and images of sexual abuse.The justice department has already said that a \"large volume\" of its 300 gigabytes of data from Epstein investigations includes images and videos of minors and thousands of downloaded videos and images of child sex abuse.Other information in the documents could be protected by grand jury secrecy rules, which the latest bill does not explicitly address.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Wednesday morning when asked about the Epstein files during an unrelated news conference: \"We'll continue to follow the law with maximum transparency, while protecting victims.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoHarry Farley,Political correspondent and Sam Francis,Political reporter Migrants who are in the UK legally could have to wait up to 20 years before they can settle permanently, under government proposals.The Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain will be extended from five to 10 years, and will apply to the estimated 1.6 million who arrived since 2021.The changes will not apply to people who had already obtained settlement.Mahmood said becoming part of the UK is \"not a right but a privilege - and one that must be earned\".The package is the latest in a string of changes to the immigration system announced by Mahmood over the past week.Currently, most work and family visa holders can apply for settlement after five years. Under the proposed changes the standard wait will be 10 years - with a range of criteria that would lengthen or shorten that period.Legal migrants who claim benefits for less than 12 months will have to wait 15 yearsPeople who arrived on post-Brexit health and social care visas would have to wait 15 years, up from five year currentlyMigrants reliant on benefits for more than 12 months face a 20-year wait for settlement, four times more than the current period and the longest in EuropeAnnouncing the changes in the Commons, Mahmood said: \"Migration will always be a vital part of Britain's story. \"But the scale of arrivals in recent years has been unprecedented.\"Home Office figures show net migration added 2.6 million people to UK population between 2021 and 2024.Because of this, settlement grants are also expected to spike over the next five years, with around 1.6 million people forecast to settle between 2026 and 2030.Settlement, also known as Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), allows someone to live in the UK permanently, work without restrictions and access public services. It is also a key step towards British citizenship.Ministers plan to introduce an \"earned settlement\" system, requiring migrants to demonstrate social integration, economic contribution and good \"character\" before being granted settled status.Applicants will need to meet stricter minimum requirements including the equivalent to A-level standard English language, a clean criminal record and earning above £12,570 a year for at least three years.There will be accelerated routes for those who make an \"outsized contribution\" to the UK.Doctors and nurses working in the NHS will be able to settle after five years. The \"brightest and best\" international talent could have settlement fast-tracked, with high earners and entrepreneurs able to stay after just three years.Family members will not gain automatic status when the main applicant qualifies. Children who came to the UK under the age of 18 may settle with parents, but older dependants could face separate requirements.Existing fast-track routes for victims of domestic abuse, bereaved partners and resettled refugees will remain.The government plan to roll out changes from spring 2026, after a consultation ends on 12 February.On Monday, Mahmood announced a sweeping overhaul of the UK's asylum system – including plans to end permanent refugee status and replace it with temporary status subject to review every 30 months.",

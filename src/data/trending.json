Orban wants to keep buying it, but Trump wants countries to wean themselves off Russian energy and help put the brakes on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Will Trump choose to keep an old friend close, or put pressure on Putin? We speak to Nick Thorpe, the BBC’s correspondent in Budapest, who has covered Orban since the 1980s. \nProducer: Viv Jones \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nMix: Travis Evans  \nPhoto: U.S. President Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

    "body": "3 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterPA MediaThe BBC's leadership is treating allegations over \"systemic bias\" with \"the seriousness that this demands\", the culture secretary has said.Lisa Nandy's comments on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme came after reports that a Panorama documentary misled viewers by editing a speech by US President Donald Trump.The Telegraph published details of a leaked internal BBC memo suggesting the programme edited two parts of Trump's speech together so he appeared to explicitly encourage the Capitol Hill riots of January 2021.BBC chair Samir Shah will provide a response to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Monday. The BBC is expected to apologise for the way the speech was edited.The leaked memo came from Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the broadcaster's editorial standards committee. He left the role in June.Nandy said the Panorama issue was \"very serious\" but there were a series of \"very serious allegations\" that had been made about the broadcaster, \"the most serious of which is that there is systemic bias in the way that difficult issues are reported at the BBC\".She added she had \"complete confidence\" Shah and BBC director general Tim Davie were treating the allegations seriously.Mr Prescott raised concerns over the documentary Trump: A Second Chance?, which was broadcast last year and made for the BBC by independent production company October Films Ltd, which was also approached for comment.In his speech in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, Trump said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"However, in the Panorama edit he was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"The two sections of the speech that were edited together were more than 50 minutes apart.The \"fight like hell\" comment was taken from a section where Trump discussed how \"corrupt\" US elections were. In total, he used the words \"fight\" or \"fighting\" 20 times in the speech.The culture secretary added: \"I do want to see [Shah's] response to the select committee, and I will, of course, consider it and have further conversations with them about the action that they're taking.\"Nandy said she had two primary concerns in relation to the BBC, including the use of \"inconsistent\" language when reporting.She said: \"What tends to happen at the BBC is that decisions about editorial standards, editorial guidelines, the sort of language that is used in reporting is entirely inconsistent.\"It doesn't always meet the highest standards, it's not always well thought through, and often it's left to individual journalists or newsreaders to make decisions.\"That's something I have discussed at length with the director general and the chair, and it's something I expect them to grip.\"My second concern about the BBC is that, increasingly, they're operating in a news media environment where news and fact is often blurred with polemic and opinion, and I think that is creating a very, very dangerous environment in this country where people can't trust what they see.\"As well as the Panorama documentary, the BBC has come under scrutiny over a number of different issues in recent weeks.The Telegraph also reported that Mr Prescott raised concerns about a lack of action to address \"systemic problems\" of bias in BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.In response, a BBC spokesperson said \"where mistakes have been made or errors have occurred we have acknowledged them at the time and taken action\".They added: \"We have also previously acknowledged that certain contributors should not have been used and have improved our processes to avoid a repeat of this.\"Reports also said Mr Prescott raised concerns about the BBC's coverage around trans issues.On Thursday, the BBC upheld 20 impartiality complaints over the way presenter Martine Croxall altered a script she was reading live on the BBC News Channel, which referred to \"pregnant people\" earlier this year.The presenter changed her script to instead say \"women\", and the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit said it considered her facial expression as she said this gave the \"strong impression of expressing a personal view on a controversial matter\".",

    "body": "HMRC to review suspending 23,500 child benefit payments5 hours agoEimear DevlinBBC Money Box reporterEve CravenEve Craven had her child benefit halted after she went on a five-day trip to New York with her sonThe UK's tax body is reviewing its decisions to strip child benefit from about 23,500 claimants after it used travel data to conclude they had left the country permanently.Normally the benefit runs out after eight weeks living outside the UK, but many people affected complained that HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) had stopped their money after they went on holiday for just a short time.The move came after MPs on the Treasury Select Committee demanded answers from the tax authority.HMRC has apologised for any errors and says anyone who thinks their benefits have been stopped incorrectly should contact them.In September, the government began a crackdown on child benefit fraud which it believes could save £350m over five years.The new system allows HMRC records to be compared with Home Office international travel data, and the tax authority had used this data to stop payments to thousands of families.But it is now reviewing all of the cases following a growing number of complaints from people affected who said they had been on holiday, and had returned to the UK after a short time.Eve Craven went on a five-day break with her son to New York. She told the BBC's Money Box programme that about 18 months after the trip she received a letter saying the child benefit for her son had been stopped.The letter cited her trip to the US, saying it had no record of her return.\"It gave me a month basically to give them all the requested information to prove that I'd come back to the UK,\" she said.\"It's just a very big ask for something that they've messed up on, and they should have been able to sort out themselves.\"Eve's child benefit has now been reinstated with missing payments backdated.The issue was first identified in Northern Ireland, where some families had flown out of the UK from Belfast, but then returned to Dublin – which is in the EU - before driving home over the border.UK and Irish citizens can travel freely into each other's countries under the Common Travel Area arrangement.There are no routine passport checks when travelling through the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, meaning the UK government has no data to show that someone may have returned to Northern Ireland.It is not clear how many errors have been made in total, or how.HMRC told Money Box it would be reviewing all past cases \"using PAYE data and where continued UK employment is found, will be reinstating payments and making any back payments necessary\".It is aiming to complete its review by the end of next week.MPs on the Treasury Select Committee are also now investigating.Additional reporting by Nick Edser",

    "body": "41 minutes agoRumeana JahangirNorth WestBBCA BBC Panorama investigation revealed some patients were abused at a mental health unit in Greater ManchesterTwo care workers have been charged with the ill-treatment of four people at a mental health unit which featured in an undercover BBC investigation.The Panorama programme, broadcast in 2022, revealed that patients were humiliated and bullied at the Edenfield Centre in Prestwich, Greater Manchester.Support worker Sheryl Price, 45, of Eldergreen Close in Bolton, faces 14 charges, while 42-year-old nurse Sara Coleman, of Mitford Street in Stretford, is accused of five. Both have been bailed and are due to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on 25 March.'Patient safety concerns'A undercover Panorama reporter filmed staff at the Edenfield Centre - one of the UK's biggest mental health hospitals - using restraint inappropriately and patients enduring long periods of seclusion in small, bare rooms.Staff swore at patients and on occasion were seen slapping or pinching them.Some workers were sacked after the BBC's findings were broadcast.The programme sparked an independent report, which found Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust repeatedly missed opportunities to act on concerns and had a culture of \"suppressing bad news\".The trust was again rated \"inadequate\" by the Care Quality Commission earlier this year despite some improvements having been made.Criticisms included issues with patient safety and pressures on staff, with some still feeling unable to speak up about their concerns.The Edenfield site has since been rebranded as the Riverside Centre.Related links",

    "body": "Super typhoon makes landfall in Philippines as nearly a million evacuated9 minutes agoKathryn Armstrong, André Rhoden-Paul and Lulu Luo,Aurora, Philippines The BBC's Jonathan Head says the Philippines is braced for an \"absolutely massive storm\"Typhoon Fung-wong has made landfall in the Philippines, where more than 900,000 people have been evacuated and two people have died.The storm was upgraded to a super typhoon before hitting land, with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph). The eye of the storm hit Aurora province in Luzon - the Philippine's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT). The country's meteorological service warned there is a \"high-risk of life-threatening and damaging storm surge\" as the typhoon moves north-westerly across Luzon.Fung-wong - known locally as Uwan - comes days after an earlier storm, Kalmaegi, left a trail of destruction and nearly 200 people dead.Eastern parts of the Philippines had already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds on Saturday evening, a weather official said. Residents in Catanduanes, an island in the east of the Bicol region, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, had been urged to move to higher ground by Sunday morning.The storm passed near the eastern Bicol region on Sunday morning, before making its way past the Polillo Islands on Sunday afternoon.The civil defence office reported that one person drowned and firefighters recovered the body of a woman trapped under debris in Catbalogan City. The civil aviation regulator has closed several airports, and almost 300 flights have been cancelled. Fung-wong was expected to weaken after making landfall, but is likely to remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon.More than 200mm of rain is forecast for parts of Luzon, with even 100-200mm in the Metro Manilla area. This is expected to cause severe flooding and landslides.  CHARISM SAYAT/AFP via Getty ImageA landslide-hit residential area in Guinobatan town, Albay province, south of ManilaIn the Aurora region, in eastern Luzon, BBC News spoke to Hagunoy, 21, who works at one of the dozen hotels which line the coast in Sabang.He said police had repeatedly visited in recent days to ensure all guests were evacuated ahead of the storm. The hotels were all deserted on Sunday morning.While the tide had risen sharply, Hagunoy said he would stay as long as he could to guard the property, before riding his motorbike home to safety. Staff had secured the gates and tied windows shut with rope to try to stop the glass from shattering in the wind.EPA/ShutterstockThe Filipino Coast Guard undertook evacuations ahead of the typhoon in Quezon provinceIn central Aurora, more than 200 people arrived at a shelter in a sports centre. Many parents have brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013. \"We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,\" Jessa Zurbano told the BBC.Another evacuee Patry Azul said: \"Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe.\"Fung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.Families gathered at this shelter in a sports centre in central Aurora in eastern LuzonThe Filipino government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Kalmaegi has left them even more anxious about the storm to come.\"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge.\"How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.",

    "body": "Bend It Like Beckham director has a sequel - and a spin on a Christmas classic14 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterChristmas KarmaGurinder Chadha has written and directed a new festive film, Christmas KarmaWhat does Bollywood have to do with Christmas?I put this question to film director Gurinder Chadha and the answer, it turns out, is quite a lot.\"Bollywood is all about singing, dancing, joy,\" she said. \"So I think that for me, the idea of making a joyful Christmas film, with singing and dancing, it comes naturally for this time of year.\"And that's exactly what Chadha - best known for directing the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham - has just done.With a cast including Kunal Nayyar, Hugh Bonneville, Pixie Lott, Boy George, Danny Dyer, Charithra Chandran and Eva Longoria, her new musical film Christmas Karma is a Bollywood spin on Charles Dickens' classic, A Christmas Carol.But Chadha says it's also \"a British film\" celebrating a wide range of musical traditions.The 65-year-old, who wrote and directed it, has also been busy working on her sequel to Bend It Like Beckham. This summer, she confirmed to the BBC that a revival is in the works.Speaking to me at a central London hotel earlier this week, she indicated she was feeling the pressure to get it right.“I’m working on the characters. These are big boots to fill,” she said. “I don’t want to rush it. The last thing I want is people to go, 'it's not as good as the original'.”Christmas KarmaThe Big Bang Theory's Kunal Nayyar stars as a contemporary Scrooge, called Mr SoodFirst published in 1843, A Christmas Carol tells the story of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge, who hates Christmas, but is transformed after a series of ghostly visits.In Christmas Karma, we are met with a modern-day Scrooge called Mr Sood, who goes on a similar journey of redemption.Nayyar, best known for playing Raj in The Big Bang Theory, plays Mr Sood - but says he is nothing like Scrooge in real life. \"I love Christmas,\" he tells me. \"Who doesn't love Christmas? Of course I love Christmas.\"The actor said he always celebrated Christmas growing up in New Delhi. \"Indians have a beautiful procurement to celebrate all festivals,\" he said.Christmas KarmaHugh Bonneville is barely recognisable as the ghost of Jacob MarleyThe first ghost to visit Mr Sood is his former partner, Jacob Marley, played by Paddington and Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville.He's also visited by American singer and actor Billy Porter, who acts as The Ghost of Christmas Present.Porter says that up until this film, he was \"definitely\" more of a Scrooge.But Bonneville professes to be a huge Christmas fan. He also rejects suggestions that November is too early for a festive film to come out in cinemas.\"I used to be Bah Humbug about it, and want Christmas decorations to go up on, frankly, Boxing Day, but I'm getting earlier and earlier,\" he said.\"Although I do draw the line at certain Christmas songs being played too early, I think they should be banned.\"As a sidenote, I had to ask Bonneville about whether he's planning to go and see the new Paddington musical. \"I'm going next week,\" he told me. \"I'm looking forward to seeing that equally timeless story being told.\"Christmas KarmaIn the film, Danny Dyer plays a cabbie who drives around Kunal Nayyar's ScroogeIn Christmas Karma, Mr Sood is depicted as being among the 28,000 Ugandan Asian refugees who came to the UK in 1972 after being given 90 days to leave the African country by military dictator Idi Amin.In later life, we see Mr Sood being dismissive of refugees seeking asylum in the UK. \"The rich ones always forget their roots,\" one bystander remarks.But after being guided by the ghosts of Christmas - played by Eva Longoria, Billy Porter, and Boy George - Mr Sood reconnects with his past.Chadha says the inspiration for her Scrooge came from a “Grinch-like” family member who used to criticise them for celebrating Christmas. “‘I don’t know why you’re all doing this. You’re not white’,” she says he would tell them.Later, she came to understand that, like Mr Sood, he was “carrying the trauma” of having been forced to leave his home country as a child.But she also says she was inspired by certain politicians.“It also made sense to me to make my Sood say slightly right-wing things, because when I was writing it [during lockdown], we did have a government that had members of the Asian community who would have a similar background,” she said.Christmas KarmaLeo Suter and Pixie Lott star as a couple celebrating Christmas with their childrenFor Leo Suter, who plays Mr Sood's underpaid employee Bob Crachett, there’s an important message he hopes people take away from the film.“Dickens's work has lasted… a very long time, because of the message at the core of it. The original text is that empathy, morality, generosity is better than being a Scrooge and being miserly,” he said.“And what the film does so well is totally bring that spirit into quite a complex and nuanced discussion of migration and racial things going on in modern Britain,” he said.The film also has a Bhangra Christmas song, and a tribute to George Michael with Bollywood superstar Priyanka Chopra Jonas singing a desi take on Last Christmas.“I feel like it's got all the things that you want in a Christmas film,” adds Pixie Lott, who plays Suter's on-screen wife Mary Crachett.“It makes you cry, it makes you laugh. It's so feel good, but it also touches you in a way that makes you think about your own life.”Christmas Karma is in cinemas from 14 November.",

    "body": "11 hours agoBen Wright,BBC Political Correspondent and Tabby WilsonAn independent review into the rising number of young people not working or studying is being launched by the government.Former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn will lead the inquiry into \"Neets\" - the acronym for young people who are not in education, employment or training.According to Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden, the persistently high number of 16-24 year olds falling out of education or work is a \"crisis of opportunity\" requiring urgent action. It is not a new problem but the number of young people who are Neet - now one in eight - has been rising in recent years and is approaching one million.A quarter cite long-term sickness or disability as a barrier and the number claiming health and disability benefits is rising too. The government says Alan Milburn's review will dig into the reasons behind the rise and examine ways of cutting the long-term costs of youth inactivity and getting young people off benefits and into work.Its conclusions will be published next summer. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called the broader benefits system unsustainable and unfair but so far selling welfare reform to Labour backbenchers has proved a political minefield for Number 10.According to the Department of Work and Pensions, the number of young people claiming UC Health and Employment Support Allowance has risen by more than 50% over the past five years. Some 80% of young people on the UC Health element currently cite mental health reasons or a neurodevelopmental condition.Asked whether he thought over-diagnosis was fuelling a mental health crisis among young people, McFadden was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: \"I don't want to play amateur doctor. I want to approach this with sensitivity.\"The question I'm asking is, given the higher reported number of these conditions among young people, what is the best policy response? I don't believe there should be an automatic link between diagnosis and benefits.\"\"If we get this right,\" he added, \"the prize is huge: transforming lives and life chances, with the pent-up potential of the next generation firing our economy and building a better future for all.\"We cannot afford to lose a generation of young people to a life on benefits, with no work prospects and not enough hope.\"Milburn said his review would be \"uncompromising\", and expose any failings in employment support, education, skills, health and welfare.\"We cannot stand by and let a generation of young people be consigned to a life without employment or prospects,\" he said. \"It's clear urgent action is needed.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoAmy WalkerSir Richard Knighton: \"We don't yet know... the source of those drones\"Britain is providing military support to Belgium after a series of suspected Russian drone incursions into its airspace, the new chief of the defence staff has said.Sir Richard Knighton told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that his Belgian counterpart had asked for assistance earlier this week and that equipment and personnel were now on the way.Brussels Airport was forced to close temporarily on Thursday night after drones were spotted nearby. They were also seen in other locations, including a military base.It follows a series of drone incursion over several Nato nations that disrupted air travel. Russia has denied accusations of conducting \"hybrid warfare\" on allies of Ukraine.Sir Richard said it was not known for sure if the incursions were by Russia, but that it was \"plausible\" they had been ordered by Moscow.Defence Secretary John Healey said in a statement: \"As hybrid threats grow, our strength lies in our alliances and our collective resolve to defend, deter and protect our critical infrastructure and airspace\".Members of the RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing are likely to be deployed, the BBC understands.Alongside Nato allies, Sir Richard added that the UK would help Belgium \"by providing our kit and capability\". The German defence ministry said on Friday that it too would support Belgium with anti-drone measures after a request from Brussels.About 3,000 Brussels Airlines passengers were affected by Thursday's disruption, with the carrier saying it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and the Belgian security services have said they suspect Russia of being behind the incursion, but Belgian Defence Minister Theo Francken previously indicated there was no evidence to suggest this.\"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Francken said earlier this week.\"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"Instagram/Royal Air Force RegimentThe RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing was deployed in an anti-drone role to the Paris Olympics in 2024Sir Richard said Russia was, broadly speaking, \"the most pressing threat right now\" to Europe. \"The illegal invasion of Ukraine has shown the barbaric nature of Russia's war efforts.\"He added that sabotage and killings had been carried out by Russia on UK soil, and that so-called hybrid warfare was an area in which \"we [the UK] need to strengthen ourselves\".Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and currently controls around a fifth of its territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014.Hybrid threats use a mix of military and non-military tactics and are designed to interfere with infrastructure or institutions, according to Nato. The shadow defence secretary welcomed the decision to assist Belgium, saying there was \"a heightened threat environment\" and that a key part of deterring threats was \"by acting with other countries through Nato\". But James Cartlidge also criticised the government's approach to increasing defence spending, saying more urgency was needed.In spring, the government announced defence spending would rise to 2.5% of GDP from April 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament. Sir Richard said the funding was \"more than I've ever known in my career\".The incursion into Belgian airspace follows similar incursions across European nations including Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany. All are Nato allies that have provided support to Ukraine.While some have pointed the finger at Russia, officials have not produced evidence linking the incursions to Moscow, while the Kremlin has consistently denied any involvement.Suspicions have been fuelled by more overt airspace incursions by Russia in Eastern Europe in recent months, involving fighter jets and larger attack drones. Mocow has denied these were intentional.The UK has recently sent RAF Typhoon jets to take part in defence missions over Poland as part of Nato's mission to bolster the eastern flank in response to incursions.Pistorious has suggested the latest sightings could be linked to EU-wide discussions to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine in the form of a €140bn loan.",

    "body": "18 hours agoCBSMaria Florinda Rios Perez was fatally shot after arriving at the wrong home for a house-cleaning appointment US officials are looking into whether to file charges against an Indiana homeowner who shot and killed a house cleaner who mistakenly showed up at the wrong address.Police say they found Maria Florinda Rios Perez dead in her husband's arms on the front porch of a home on Wednesday shortly before 0700 local time (12:00 GMT). Authorities had been responding to a call about a possible home invasion in the Indianapolis suburb of Whitestown. The two did not appear to have entered the home, police said in a statement. They have formally submitted the case to the Boone County Prosecutor's Office for review to determine whether criminal charges will be brought in the case. Police have not identified the people in the home or who fired the shot, saying in a statement on Friday that it is a \"complex, delicate, and evolving case, and it would be both inappropriate and potentially dangerous to disclose that information\". They urged patience, warning of a \"concerning spread of misinformation online\" about the case.Mauricio Velazquez, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he wanted justice for his 32-year-old wife. News reports say that she was a mother of four and originally from Guatemala. In an interview with CBS affiliate WTTV, Mr Velazquez said the bullet came right through the door of the home. \"They should've called the police first instead of just shooting out of nowhere like that,\" he said through an interpreter.CBSMauricio Velazquez said the bullet that killed his wife came through the door of the home they went to early on WednesdayBoone County prosecutor Kent Eastwood told The Indianapolis Star that the case is complex due to the language of the state's stand-your-ground law.Stand-your-ground laws are in place in many US states and most permit an individual to protect themselves with the use of reasonable force, including deadly force, to prevent death or great bodily harm.Similar incidents have made headlines across the US in recent years. In 2023, Ralph Yarl, who was then 16, was shot twice after ringing the doorbell of the wrong home in Missouri. Andrew Lester, who was in his 80s, pleaded guilty and died while awaiting sentencing. In New York, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis died after being shot upon entering the wrong driveway. The homeowner who shot her is now serving a 25-year sentence. ",

    "body": "1 hour agoGeorge Wright and Andre Rhoden-PaulReutersIsrael has received the body of a hostage after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was expecting the remains of a soldier killed in 2014 to be returned.The body was being taken to be formally identified, the Israeli military said.Earlier, Netanyahu said Israel was due to receive the body of Hadar Goldin, a soldier who was killed in an ambush by Hamas during a previous conflict in 2014 and whose body has been held in Gaza since then. Hamas's armed wing also said on Sunday that it would hand over Hadar Goldin's body.If the body is confirmed to be Lt Goldin's, Hamas will have returned all 20 living hostages and 24 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a ceasefire deal.Netanyahu said Lt Goldin's family would now be able to give him a Jewish burial and reiterated his intention to bring back the bodies of all deceased hostages.  \"We have returned 250 so far. We will bring them all back,\" he said. On Saturday Lt Goldin's family said \"an entire nation is waiting for Hadar to be returned to us\". \"We are waiting for official confirmation that Hadar has returned to Israel. We don't give up on anyone in this country, ever. We ask everyone to remain calm. Until it's final, it's not over,\" the family said in a statement.ReutersIDF soldier Hadar Goldin was killed in Gaza in 2014Lt Goldin, from Kfar Saba, is the only deceased hostage whose remains were being held in Gaza before the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the latest war. He was killed in combat on 1 August 2014, not long after the start of a ceasefire in that year's war between Israel and Hamas. He was among a group of Israeli soldiers who were patrolling an agricultural area near Rafah in southern Gaza when they were attacked by a group of Hamas fighters. The Israeli military determined that Lt Goldin was killed along with two other soldiers in a firefight, and that his body was then dragged into an underground tunnel by the Hamas fighters.The Israeli military unleashed massive firepower to try to prevent Hamas from taking Lt Goldin hostage. Scores of Palestinian civilians were killed in the bombardment of Rafah, which continued for four days, including after Lt Goldin was declared dead.On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had identified a body handed over from Gaza as that of Israeli-Argentinian Lior Rudaeff.Also on Saturday, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in Gaza. The Israeli military said two people had crossed the yellow line that marks the line of Israeli control in Gaza and posed an \"immediate threat\".Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. At least 69,169 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, the health ministry reported.",

There might be subtle signs she has a boyfriend, like the back of a head, or two clinking wine glasses at dinner, but the 24-year-old says she has no intention of posting his face.\"I'm just girl-coded,\" Tawana says. \"As a woman, you want to come across strong, like, 'I've got my stuff together'.\"The influencer has curated a brand that doesn't include a boyfriend.\"You don't want any part to feel like it's been helped by a man.

In the viral article, writer Chante Joseph suggests there has been a shift in how heterosexual women present their relationships online, writing that women want to reap the \"social benefits\" of having a partner, without appearing \"boyfriend-obsessed\". Posting your partner frequently can come across as \"cringe\" and \"culturally loser-ish\", Joseph writes. On a more serious note, she says having a boyfriend is no longer \"considered an achievement\", and isn't seen to make you any more - or less - of a woman in the way it might once have done. She believes women are hesitating to post their partners because of the \"patriarchy we live under, and how oppressive it is to women\".\"A lot of women have been saying, it's cool to have a fiance. It's cool to have a husband,\" Joseph told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Wednesday. \"It's not. We need to re-evaluate our relationship with men in this political climate.\"'1,000 people unfollowed me'Stephanie YeboahYeboah received a \"plethora of DMs\" when she first posted her boyfriendStephanie Yeboah, a content creator and author from South London, told British Vogue she regretted posting her boyfriend on Instagram.She tells BBC News she received a \"plethora of DMs\" from people telling her they'd unfollowed her because they could no longer relate to her content once she had a boyfriend.\"That day I think about 1,000 people unfollowed me,\" Yeboah recalls.But she says she understands why people can find boyfriend-related content too much.\"A lot of relationship content is corny - I think people kind of just cringe now when they see it.\"Dr Gillian BrooksDr Brooks says influencers sell a \"distinct aesthetic\" to their audiencesFor people who make money from social media, not posting a new partner may be a question of consistency, says Dr Gillian Brooks, associate professor of influencer and social media marketing at King's College London. \"They're selling a distinct aesthetic, a distinct taste,\" Dr Brooks explains. \"They're catering to a very devoted and distinct audience, so if they go off brand they confuse their audience base, and people will just leave them.\"'I don't want to come across as reliant'But it's not just influencers who don't want to post their boyfriends.Milly is engaged to her partner of nearly five years, but the 25-year-old says she is hesitant to post her fiance on social media.\"I don't want to come across as reliant on my partner, or that our relationship is my entire personality,\" she explains.\"Social media creates a very narrow image of a person,\" she adds. \"When it's just pictures and stories of me and my partner, it creates an image of a little bit of obsession.\"'Relationships should be more private'Charlotte has been with her partner for two years. The 20-year-old says she chooses to not post her boyfriend on social media for a few reasons.On an aesthetic level, she says they don't have many pictures together she would \"consider Instagrammable\". But beyond this, she believes a relationship should be \"more private than friendship\".She continues: \"I also feel like if I posted [my relationship], it would be to say, 'Look at me and my perfect relationship', which, unfortunately, isn't the case.\"Athera, not her real name, also prefers privacy. The 21-year-old says a lot of her friends are the same and reference the \"evil eye\" as a reason for not posting their partners.\"Evil eye\" is a supernatural belief in a curse transmitted through a malicious glare, usually one inspired by envy.\"I wouldn't post him to prevent someone accidentally putting their jealousy, even if it's unintentional and subconscious, as evil eye onto my relationship,\" says Athera.Anxiety behind posting Dr Gillian BrooksDr Seidman says people are realising social media is \"eternal\"Dr Gwendolyn Seidman, a social psychologist at Michigan State University, studies how people communicate online - with a particular focus on romantic relationships.Sharing such a personal part of your life online can sometimes come with anxiety - something Seidman believes is down to a fear of online permanency.\"People are not posting as much stuff online [now],\" Dr Seidman observes, \"and part of it is that people sort of realise that this stuff is eternal.\"You can't really get rid of it and so you want to be a little bit more careful.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "51 minutes agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondent, the Cenotaph, WhitehallWatch: King Charles leads Remembrance Sunday service silence at CenotaphKing Charles led the annual Remembrance Sunday commemorations, laying a wreath at the solemn ceremony held at the Cenotaph on Whitehall in central London.With autumn leaves falling, he was joined by other members of the Royal Family, senior politicians and dignitaries, sharing the echoing two-minute silence.But among the 10,000 veterans marching, there were now only about 20 who had served in World War Two, including six now 101 years old.This was still living memory, rather than a history lesson, for these last survivors of the conflict.Many are now in wheelchairs and they drew warm applause from the crowds, aware that they were seeing history inching out of view.Sid Machin, aged 101, says it's been an \"emotional year\" remembering those who served with him in the Far East. This summer saw events marking the 80th anniversary of VE Day and VJ Day, the end of the World War Two in Europe and the Far East.\"I will be thinking of everyone I served with and especially those that didn't make it home,\" he said.PA MediaThere were about 20 veterans of World War Two at the Cenotaph serviceReutersThe King laid a wreath on the Cenotaph in WhitehallDonald Poole, also aged 101, who served with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, wanted to \"pay tribute to the poor souls who have died in all conflicts and I know how lucky I am to still be here\".While others were lining up to thank his generation, he paid his own thanks to the civilian services, \"particularly the fire service who saved so many lives during the Blitz\".That was a reminder that as well as the military veterans, the commemoration by the Cenotaph brings together representatives of other types of service.There were police, fire services, ambulance staff, transport workers and coastguards laying wreaths and marching.The Remembrance service is a time to pause in a noisy world. There's the two-minute silence and then the Last Post is played by a bugler, reverberating around Westminster rather than the usual roar of traffic.The scandals surrounding the King's brother Andrew have been like a howling gale in recent weeks, but this was a moment of quiet and stillness.ReutersThere were 10,000 veterans in the parade past the CenotaphIt is a ceremony that is about keeping the faith with previous generations. The King, wearing a field marshal's uniform, laid a wreath that is the same as the wreaths once placed here by his grandfather George VI, with 41 paper poppies on an arrangement of black leaves.They both would have stood in the same place facing the same message - the Glorious Dead - carved on the Cenotaph.King Charles's uniform still has the cypher of his mother Elizabeth II.What was he thinking in the big silence?The Prince of Wales, back from presenting his Earthshot environmental prize in Brazil, joined his father in laying a wreath. Queen Camilla and the Princess of Wales looked down from the Foreign Office balcony.PA MediaQueen Camilla and the Princess of Wales watched from a balconyMore than 20 different faith groups were represented around the plain stone of the Cenotaph, with clerical robes mixing in with the military uniforms.Sarah Mullally, who is going to become the first female Archbishop of Canterbury, delivered a reading before a hymn was sung.And like the ghosts of Christmas past, eight former PMs were lined up. Sir John Major is now the elder statesman among them.The current incumbent, Sir Keir Starmer said of the moment: \"We remember a generation who stood against tyranny and shaped our future. Their legacy is peace, and our duty is to protect it.\"ReutersKemi Badenoch and Keir Starmer standing in front of David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Tony BlairConservative leader Kemi Badenoch stepped forward with her wreath.In a perhaps unexpected connection, Prince William was standing near to former PM Gordon Brown. The two are now working together on a homelessness project, having shared a different type of stage recently in Sheffield, talking about tackling poverty.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood lay wreaths on behalf of the intelligence agencies, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.PA MediaCherie Blair, Akshata Murty and Lady Starmer were also at the Remembrance Sunday serviceThere was also a reminder of current military threats and conflicts, with a Ukrainian flag flying above the Foreign Office building as the veterans marched past.But on this mild November morning, there was no escaping the sense of time passing and an awareness this will be among the last big anniversaries where veterans of the World War Two will be present.Last year there were six veterans of the D-Day landings in 1944, this year there were three.\"We reflect on the bravery and sacrifice of the Second World War generation, aware that this is one of the nation's last opportunities to recognise, thank and honour the small number of veterans still with us today,\" said Philippa Rawlinson, director of Remembrance at the Royal British Legion.",

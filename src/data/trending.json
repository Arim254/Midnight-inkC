    "body": "The Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment join host Kelly Somers for bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport.We'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.Interviews will drop on Saturdays across BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week it will be shown on BBC One at 23:35 GMT (and after Sportscene in Scotland).Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a Manchester United legend.As a player, he scored their Treble-clinching injury-time winner against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final.It was one of 126 goals he scored in 366 appearances for the club.The Norwegian later managed the Red Devils for three years from 2018 - guiding them to second in the Premier League and also the Europa League final in 2021, before he was sacked after a poor run of form.Capped 67 times by Norway, he played for his country at the 1998 World Cup - their last appearance on that stage, though they have recently qualified for next year's tournament in North America.Solskjaer sat down with Kelly Somers to talk about his childhood, his legendary goal in the Nou Camp, why he would have been an accountant if not a footballer, and his dreams of managing his country in the future.Kelly Somers: Ole, good to see you. Let's start with football. Why football? Why did you end up in the game?Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: Because football is the best game in the world. I think it's such an easy game. It connects everyone. But for me, I can't remember life without football since I was young. I think my mum and dad, they told me one of the first things I kicked was one of the lamps. So I just enjoyed kicking! It's given me my life. Everything.Kelly: Can you remember a moment when you thought not only could playing football be something you enjoy but potentially, 'I could make it'.Ole: Not really because as a kid I always used to score goals, but when I got to 15/16 I was a very late developer, so then I thought I wasn't going to make it in football and I thought I would just enjoy football. Then I went into the army when I was 19 to 20 and that probably said OK, I wasn't going to be a footballer - but when I got back from the army I went for it for a couple of years and suddenly I was in the under-21 national team and playing for Molde and did well.Kelly: That's quite a journey, isn't it? And that's quite a change to go from football, army, football. What did being in the army do for you?Ole: It made me more independent. I had to grow up. Suddenly I wasn't living with my mum and dad and my sister any more. I think I became a lot more mature. I learnt a lot socialising with people from different places in the country. We were placed there together in a room of six or eight, and we just had to get on. It was a great year, actually.Kelly: Is it mandatory to go into the army?Ole: YeahKelly: So you always knew you were going to have to do it?Ole: Yes, unless you have a special talent or maybe you're in the national teams and all this.Kelly: Didn't you have a special talent?Ole: No, I didn't. We had like an army football team... we had a training session maybe once or twice. There was like a Norwegian championship of army teams. I was not in the team in my camp, so that's another thing... 'OK, I know I'm better than him, I will be better than him' ... but it's other people's view in that maybe I wasn't maybe strong enough or big enough in that team, so it was a kind of a revenge when you look back and say: 'OK, they didn't believe in me, but I showed all of them.'Kelly: You had an illustrious playing career, but of course it's headlined by Manchester United. Talk to me about the first time you knew of a possibility to come over here to England - to one of the most decorated clubs in the world?Ole: So for Norway, this is probably one of the most important games in my career. We played Norway against Azerbaijan and I scored two very good goals. Coincidentally, Jim Ryan - the assistant manager - was watching Ronny Johnsen, who we signed. He was sitting next to Mark McGhee, who at that time was Wolverhampton manager, chatting as they do. Mark McGhee is looking for a centre-forward, Jim Ryan's watching the game and I score two goals. So he thinks, 'OK, Wolverhampton will probably sign this boy'. He rang Sir Alex [Ferguson] that night and said: 'I think I found one and he won't be expensive. It's a cheap one, but we've got to be quick because Wolverhampton are also signing a centre-forward.' It went really, really fast.Kelly: That must have been a whirlwind for you...Ole: Brilliant. Absolutely top. But then you're never 100% sure until you signed the deal. But I more or less knew, so before my last game for Molde, I said to Age Hareide, who was the coach, that if I scored, I'm going to take my shirt off, throw it into the stands and run off the pitch. He said: 'No, you can't do that... but [if you have to] wait until 10 minutes before full-time.' That's exactly what happened. I think I scored a fifth goal, 5-1, and I just threw the shirt and ran off the pitch and we had no subs ready to come on, so we had to play a few minutes with 10 men. It was a whirlwind of a time. The media were outside my apartment. They wanted interviews and I just tried to stay away from all that.Kelly: Was that all new? Like a whole new level of fame?Ole: Of course. Because 18 months before Manchester United, I played for Clausenengen, my local team, in front of 50 people, so it was a big step up in attention. But I think I've been quite OK in handling these situations.Kelly: I always ask players - and with you, it feels even more prominent because you've played in some of the biggest games - if you could relive one game from your career, what would it be?Ole: Of course, the Champions League final in '99. I was 80 minutes on the bench like really unhappy with the manager - 'why don't you put me on?' - and we're losing the game and football's so emotional. You're so low and you want to get on the pitch. So 80 minutes of real agony but then I managed to play 15 minutes and those 15 minutes I'd really love to play again. It changed history, of course. It changed my life. It didn't make me a better footballer but that changed my life as in we made history and I was the one that was fortunate enough to score that goal. And so many men have come up to me and thanked me for giving them the best moment of their lives. [They say] 'Don't tell my wife, please, will you?'Kelly: You mentioned before that you were annoyed with Sir Alex. Obviously you would have always wanted to start, but you gained this incredible reputation, didn't you? As a super sub. I know every footballer wants to start every game. How did you embrace that?Ole: I had discussions with Sir Alex. I signed a long, long-term contract. What I did was I put my career in his hands really. I more or less said to myself: 'Just do your best.' I've seen so many strikers sulking when they're on the bench. I felt, 'OK they've played 70 or 80 minutes, defenders are tired, I can come on, I can make a difference, I'm fresh, as long as my head is fresh and my mentality is good'. If we were winning 1-0, I was never going to come on. At 0-0 I was like, 'don't score, don't score until he puts me on'. At 1-0 down, yeah, definitely I am coming on. At 2-0 up, he would always give me the 15-20 minutes just to make me feel part of it. He was very good at giving me enough minutes but I knew at 1-0 just to sit down as you're not going to come on. So 1-0 down against Bayern, I was like, 'come on then, it's like 20 minutes...' It is one of the best 13-15 minutes of my football career.Kelly: When did management become the thing?Ole: When I was a kid, I was very into football. Me and my cousin always used to buy the Rothmans Yearbook every year and that was our bible. We knew every player in every division in England and we used to make our own game, like a management game, that was the probably the prequel to the Championship Manager game. We should have copyrighted that one! We were really like nerdy, freaky into football, and I was always playing the computer games, the management games instead of Fifa, where you play. I've always been into coaching or management and picking teams. I used to coach the younger boys in my local streets. We used to make a street team for these tournaments and I was the boss.Kelly: How old are you at this point?Ole: 13 or 14. So probably I've always had this manager in me. Then I played at Manchester United, and I didn't know if I had the personality to be a manager. It is different to managing now. Then I got injured, and that's the moment where I decided I need to stay in the game. That's the time where I decided I will start all these coaching courses and starting to write whatever Sir Alex says.Kelly: I read somewhere that you wrote everything, you kept a notebook?Ole: Not everything, but yes I did suddenly start to try to - instead of just being a player that was told. I was learning from the best teacher in the world. How does he get the best out of all these players? What does he do tactically? What is he changing in his staff and changing the players? I just started keeping more of an eye on him and that part of football.Kelly: It is the biggest club in the world, one of the biggest clubs. You knew that as a player but as a manager that pressure - particularly when things are not going right - must have been really tough?Ole: I remember one game, against Everton. I'm stood there in my technical area, fourth official next to me. [Everton manager] Carlo Ancelotti comes across, so he's more or less in my technical area, and the fourth official says: 'Carlo, you need to get back into your technical area unless you want Ole's job.' Carlo, as Carlo is, he's always got a comment and a smile. He said: 'No, no, no. Too much pressure. That job is too much pressure.' So he walked back to his technical area and I thought, 'pressure is a privilege'. He always said that as well. I felt privileged to be the manager of Manchester United, but of course it's not the same as playing. As a player, you just do your job. Suddenly now you're the manager, you're the face of everyone. You think about all these supporters, players, everything surrounding Manchester United. But that pressure is a privilege because I was allowed to do that and I was allowed to deal with it in my way. And that was having great staff around us, an environment in and around the club that was very positive. But in the end, it doesn't matter if you enjoy coming to work every day, training sessions... you need results and we unfortunately had a very bad six -week spell and that's too long at a club like Manchester United and they made a change, which is fine. Reflecting back on it, it was sad. We lost to Watford of course, and I knew this was more or less the end. I drove my family to the airport, they went back to Norway, and I was going to work. I got a text - 'Ole, I need to see you in my office' - and I knew what was going to happen, so I rang my wife and said: 'I'll catch you up, I'll probably be back home before you!'Kelly: Did it feel a bit sudden?Ole: Sudden but not surprising. If you don't get results, you do make a change, that's football. But I felt we had something going. Kelly: Do you feel like when you look back on your period in charge that now people understand - given what's happened to Manchester United since and the struggles? Do you think you're given maybe the credit that you deserve for your time?Ole: It's not about getting the credit, but it was the worst time to be the manager of Manchester United. You have Jurgen Klopp with his Liverpool team and you have Pep Guardiola with his Manchester City team. Best managers in the world at the time and probably the two best teams in the world at the time. But we got second and third. So with the staff, we had something going but we couldn't take the next steps. Hopefully we can get back as a club later on.Kelly: What was it like growing up in your household? What can you remember?Ole: Me as a kid, obviously, at school football in every recess or every break.Kelly: Did you work hard at school?Ole: I was decent at school and my best subject was maths, so if I wasn't a footballer I probably would be an accountant or something with numbers or maths.Kelly: You are a dad now - three children - and you've passed the football bug on, I hear?Ole: I think they're environmentally damaged! They all play football. Kelly: And a little bit of history - your daughter made an appearance for Manchester United Women. I think you are the only father-daughter combination to have both played for Manchester United. That must make you incredibly proud?Ole: I was really, really proud. It was an FA Cup game and we drove down. It was really good to see her. Her passion is football, she loves football. They love football and they enjoy it. Kelly: Does your wife like football or does she have no choice?Ole: We met on the football pitch, more or less. She was a very talented footballer. We used to have in Kristiansund every Tuesday and Thursday like a talent group that used to train at seven in the morning, seven until eight before school, and she was in that. Who wakes up at six to go football training? You go there to impress or be close to someone that you have a keen eye on. That is the reason I got up in the morning really - to play football with Silje.Kelly: Tell me one thing about yourself that might surprise me?Ole: I surprised you by saying I would have been an accountant, but I used to read and speak backwards, so I was quite good at that - reading backwards.Kelly: How does that come about?Ole: I don't know - it's just that's probably my sense of organising structure, seeing structures. More or less every every car I drive and you look at the licence plates and how can I rearrange those letters, or that number, or something.Kelly: Your brain is always going, isn't it?Ole: My brain is always going, yes, most of the time.Kelly: If you could only achieve one more thing in your career, what would it be?Ole: Not lifting a trophy for Manchester United as a manager - that's something that I would have liked to achieve. Hopefully we can do well in the World Cup with Norway, but then maybe to be the next one, who knows? You always set targets.Kelly: You mean to be the next Norway manager?Ole: Next Norway manager. My friend Stale [Solbakken] is there now. We're playing really well, we're going to the World Cup. I do really, really like managing. It is a great, great job being the manager of ambitious young men who want to achieve something together.",

    "body": "Asylum seekers will be banned from taking taxis for medical appointments8 hours agoNick Eardley,Political CorrespondentandSue Mitchell,Investigations reporterBBCA BBC investigation found asylum seekers in hotels were taking taxi journeys costing hundreds of poundsAsylum seekers will be banned from using taxis for medical appointments from February, the government has announced.It comes after a BBC investigation found some people had travelled long distances by taxi, with one  asylum seeker saying they went on a 250-mile journey to a GP, costing the Home Office £600.In response the government launched an urgent review into the use and cost of taxis to transfer asylum seekers from their hotels to appointments in September.Now, the government has confirmed it has spent an average of around £15.8 million per year on transport for asylum seekers.Earlier this year, BBC Radio 4's File on Four found asylum seekers were being issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week. For other necessary travel, like doctor's appointments, taxis were used, including the case of a 250-mile journey to a GP.And on Friday, one subcontractor told the BBC his firm would do up to 15 drop-offs daily from a hotel in south east London to a doctors surgery around two miles away. These journeys alone would cost the Home Office £1,000 a day, he said.But Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said this was now going to change.She said: \"I am ending the unrestricted use of taxis by asylum seekers for hospital appointments, authorising them only in the most exceptional circumstances.\"I will continue to root out waste as we close every single asylum hotel.\"She said the government had inherited expensive Conservative contracts.Instead of taxis, ministers want asylum seekers to use alternatives like public transport.There will be some exemptions for people with physical disabilities, chronic illnesses and pregnancy related needs. These will have to be signed off by the Home Office under the new rules.There are other circumstances in which taxis can be used - such as moving between accommodation - but ministers are reviewing the wider use of taxis for asylum seekers and want to extend the principle that they are only used in exceptional circumstances with support evidence.Ministers have pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by the next election. They want to increase the use of alternative accommodation, such as large military sites.But figures earlier this week showed 36,273 people were still living in asylum hotels in the UK – an increase compared to June.There has also been criticism of the growing cost of running asylum accommodation – which has gone up significantly since the contracts were signed.When the home secretary was asked if the government was prepared to exercise break clauses in contracts with providers in a BBC interview earlier this year, Mahmood said she would explore all options.But doing so would mean alternative accommodation needs to be found.The government has also announced significant changes to overhaul the asylum system – with refugee status becoming temporary and the ending of guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers.The government has recovered £74m since it came to power – but the chair of the home affairs select committee said that was only a start.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"The issue is that Labour can't get a grip on the illegal immigration crisis.\"As Labour hammer working people with £26 billion in tax rises, they have allowed costs for illegal arrivals to spiral because Labour don't have the backbone to take the tough decisions needed. Namely, deporting all illegal arrivals and leaving the ECHR. Until that happens, the bills will keep mounting.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoTheo Leggett,International business correspondentandYang Tian,BBC NewsThousands of Airbus planes have been grounded after it was discovered that intense solar radiation could interfere with onboard flight control computers, leading to delays around the world.Around 6,000 A320 planes are thought to be affected - half the European firm's global fleet - but it is understood most will be able to fly again after undergoing a quick software update.The UK's aviation regulator said there would be \"some disruption and cancellations to flights\" though the impact at airports appears to be limited.Airbus said it discovered the issue after an investigation into an incident in which a plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude in October.The JetBlue Airways flight made an emergency landing in Florida after at least 15 people were injured.Live updates on this storyAs well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the vulnerability also impacts the A318, A319 and the A321 models.It is understood that on around 5,100 Airbus planes, the issue can be addressed using a relatively simple software update which would typically take about three hours.However, the remaining 900 aircraft, which are older versions, will need to have onboard computers physically replaced, and will not be allowed to carry passengers again until the job has been completed. The length of time that takes will depend on the availability of replacement computers.Airbus said it acknowledged this would lead to \"operational disruption to passengers and customers\" and has apologised.Aviation analyst Sally Gethin told BBC News the situation is \"very much out of the ordinary\", saying the disruption to passengers would depend on the \"different approaches\" airlines take to upgrade their software.In the UK, disruption at airports has been limited so far. London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations. Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems.The extent of the disruption varies between airlines: British Airways is understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue, while Wizz Air and Air India said they were already doing the updates.Publicly available data suggested Air France was impacted more than any other airline, with 50 of its flights to and from its Paris hub that were scheduled for Saturday morning cancelled, travel journalist Simon Calder told the BBC.Meanwhile Easyjet said it was \"expecting this to result in some disruption\" but later added it had started and \"already completed the software update on many aircraft\" and was planning a full service on Saturday.In the US, the software issue emerged on the same weekend as Thanksgiving - one of the busiest travel periods of the year.American Airlines said 340 of its planes were affected and that it expected \"some operational delays\", but added the vast majority of updates would be completed on Friday or Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be \"limited\".In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights after confirming around a third of its fleet was impacted, with disruption expected to continue all weekend despite the majority of aircraft having already undergone the update.Tim Johnson, policy director at the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, said the notice from Airbus \"unfortunately may mean there is some disruption, some delays or cancellations over the coming days\".He added that aviation was still \"one of the safest forms of transport\" due to the rigorous maintenance programs airlines have in place, and described the mass-grounding of flights as a \"a very rare event\".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said \"the impact on UK airlines seems limited\", adding: \"It is heartening this issue has been identified and will be addressed so swiftly, demonstrating the high aviation safety standards globally.\"The problem identified with A320 aircrafts relates to a piece of computing software which calculates a plane's elevation. Airbus discovered that, at high altitudes, its data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. That led to the October incident in which an aircraft suddenly lost altitude - though the manufacturer said this was the only time an incident of its kind had occurred. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive, ordering the problem be addressed before each plane can carry passengers again.They will be allowed to make so-called \"ferry flights\", without passengers, in order to reach a maintenance facility.The A320 family are what is known as \"fly by wire\" planes. This means there is no direct mechanical link between the controls in the cockpit and the parts of the aircraft that actually govern flight, with the pilot's actions processed by a computer.",

    "body": "13 hours agoImogen FoulkesGeneva CorrespondentThe United Nations committee on torture says there is evidence that Israel is operating a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\". The committee regularly reviews the records of all countries which have signed the convention against torture, taking testimony from their governments, and from human rights groups.During Israel's review both Israeli and Palestinian rights groups gave harrowing details about conditions in Israeli detention centres. It is alleged that thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel since the Hamas attacks of October 7th 2023. Under Israel's laws on administrative detention and on Unlawful Combatants – suspects who cannot be classed as prisoner of war - they can be held for long periods without access to a lawyer or family members. Many Palestinian families say they have waited months to even find out that a loved has been detained, amounting, the UN committee said, to \"enforced disappearance\".The committee was particularly critical of Israel's reported use of the Unlawful Combatants law to detain whole groups of Palestinians, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly.But it is the reported conditions in detention which make the grimmest reading in the committee's conclusions, published today. Palestinians, the evidence suggests, are regularly deprived of food and water, and subjected to severe beatings, attacks by dogs, electrocution, water boarding, and sexual violence. Some are allegedly permanently shackled, denied access to a toilet, and forced to wear diapers.The committee concluded that such treatment \"amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity\". It said evidence of a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\" by Israel was one of the acts which constitute the crime of genocide under international law. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.One committee member, Peter Vedel Kessing of Denmark, said he and his colleagues were \"deeply appalled\" by what they heard. Committee members also said they were very concerned at the lack of investigations or prosecutions into allegations of torture. They called on Israel to launch independent investigations, and to ensure those responsible, including senior military officers, are held accountable.Israel, which has long accused the UN of bias against it, did not comment publicly today on the committee's findings, but during the committee hearings its ambassador, Daniel Meron, described the allegations of torture as \"disinformation\". He said that Israel was \"committed to upholding its obligations in line with our moral values and principles, even in the face of the challenges posed by a terrorist organisation\".In its conclusions, the UN committee took care to unequivocally condemn the Hamas attack of October 2023, and acknowledged the security challenges Israel faces. But it also warned that violations of international law by one side did not justify the other side doing the same. Under the convention, to which Israel is a party, the prohibition on torture is absolute: it is not allowed under any circumstances.Israel's domestic law is less clear however, suggesting that the convention only applies to Israeli territory, and not to the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank – an interpretation that many international lawyers dispute.The findings come amid increasing pressure on Israel over its human rights record. On Friday in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Office said the killing by Israeli soldiers of two Palestinians in the West Bank looked like a \"summary execution\". Video of the killing showed the two men with their hands up, apparently surrendering to Israeli forces.And UN aid agencies say conditions for people in the Gaza strip remain dire, despite the ceasefire. Thousands of families are facing the winter cold and rain in tents, they warn, not enough aid supplies are getting in, and Israeli air strikes against what Israel says are Hamas targets continue.",

    "body": "A Russian drone and missile attack on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv has killed at least one person and injured seven others, city officials say.Early on Saturday morning residential buildings in several districts were hit and loud explosions could be heard across the city.Kyiv's mayor Vitaly Klitschko said a 13-year-old child was among the injured and four people had been taken to hospital.Earlier this week a similar attack on Kyiv killed seven people, Ukrainian officials said. The latest bombardment came as Ukrainian negotiators were preparing for talks with US officials this weekend on an amended US peace plan. The head of Kyiv's military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, confirmed Saturday's strike hit \"multiple targets on the capital's outskirts\".\"Enemy drones are over the city, with air defence responding,\" he wrote on Telegram.\"Currently, in Kyiv there is a total of one dead and seven injured, including one child.\"The body of a man was recovered by rescuers in the Sviatoshynskyi district west of the city, Tkachenko confirmed.Two women were among the wounded in the town of Brovary east of Kyiv, with the regional governor saying \"missiles and drones\" targeted residential areas.Klitschko said the strike had started a fire in the lower floors of a high-rise apartment block west of the city centre, while another blaze was brought under control in a central district.Earlier this week, Russia and Ukraine traded deadly strikes overnight, which set fire to apartment buildings and killed seven people in Kyiv, while Russia's Rostov region reported three deaths.Saturday's attack comes amid President Donald Trump's push for the two sides to accept a draft peace plan, which was initially slanted heavily towards Moscow's demands. It was subsequently revised during talks between Ukrainian and US negotiators in Geneva.On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin doubled down on his core demands for ending the war, saying Russia will halt its offensive only if Ukraine's troops withdraw from territory claimed by Moscow.Putin also confirmed a US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected in Moscow in the first half of next week to discuss the draft peace plan at the centre of negotiations.Zelensky said in a video address late on Thursday that Ukrainian and US delegations would meet \"to translate the points we secured in Geneva into a form that puts us on the path to peace and security guarantees\".",

    "body": "When a 14-year-old Ronnie O'Sullivan was asked by a TV reporter in 1990 what he admired about his snooker hero Steve Davis, he replied \"he invents shots … not many players can do that\".It was an early insight into O'Sullivan's approach. His motivation is not just to win, but to set new standards in his sport.Now, 35 years on, he has eclipsed the achievements of the players he looked up to and during this week's UK Championship - a tournament where he holds the record for both the oldest and youngest winner - O'Sullivan will celebrate his 50th birthday.At an elite level, for a sport to have just one player that age would be remarkable enough, but O'Sullivan's half-century will mean three of the top six players in the world rankings will have entered their sixth decade.Mark Williams and John Higgins, who like O'Sullivan became professionals in 1992, also turned 50 this year.But such ultra-longevity is not a given in this sport. Stephen Hendry, who holds the joint record with O'Sullivan of seven world titles, won his last ranking event at the age of 36, while Davis' win at the 1997 Masters, aged 39, came as a major shock.The Class of 92, though, stubbornly refuse to fade. Here BBC Sport examines why three 50-year-old players are still at the top.For Davis, now 68, the difference between his generation and this one is psychological.\"I was always blaming my technique for failing, rather than trying to re-educate my brain,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It felt like it was just the circle of life.\"Ronnie, John and Mark have proven that's not the case. It's all in the mind… you have more longevity than you think.\"O'Sullivan's mentality has been shaped by psychiatrist Professor Steve Peters, with whom he has worked since 2011. In his 2023 Amazon Prime documentary, The Edge of Everything, O'Sullivan asks him: \"So what age can I go to, so I don't have to question myself?\"\"If you keep looking at your age, you go back to these self-fulfilling prophecies,\" Peters says. \"You're going to start saying 'Oh, I'm 46, I won't do as well!' I don't want that. If you want to win, and you want to keep producing the goods, then forget age.\"It is advice O'Sullivan has stuck to, telling BBC Sport this month that he feels \"alright\" about turning 50, adding: \"I try not to put too much pressure on myself … I quite like being at this stage of my life.\"Snooker may not be an athletic or explosive sport, but success still depends on physical attributes that should favour younger players.O'Sullivan keeps himself fit by running, but it is harder to ward off other aspects of ageing, such as deteriorating eyesight, which Williams knows only too well.\"It makes me laugh. I need glasses for everything: reading, middle distance [potting], long distance [potting], everything,\" Williams told BBC Sport in September.The Welshman has been considering having lens replacement surgery but has postponed it three times, most recently in November, mainly because he keeps winning.Williams may be benefitting from what psychologists call the brain's neuroplasticity.Zoe Wimshurst, who helps coach athletes make the best use of their vision, explained that as long as an athlete does not have an eye condition, such as cataracts, the brain has the capability to adapt to reduced vision.\"Everyone, by the time you get to your mid-30s, maybe early 40s, you'll notice that the lens of the eye really stiffens,\" she said.\"[But] our brains will constantly adjust to the challenges we put them under, and this continues throughout our lifespan, even into really old age.\"But, even if it is not your eyesight, it may be other parts of your body that let you down.\"\"Somewhere down the line in a fine muscle control game like snooker, your body betrays your brain,\" Davis said.\"Your arm doesn't do what's required. The first thing I felt was that yes, I hit the ball in a straight line, but I didn't hit it at the right pace.\"The weight of the delivery is the thing that will happen and there's no real way out of that. That's going to happen.\"O'Sullivan's work with Peters has coincided with careful management of his body and he has often stressed the importance of diet to his success. \"He doesn't drink, he eats proper food,\" 1979 UK champion John Virgo said. \"You wouldn't think he was 50, I mean, he still looks 30!\"Williams has also had a recent nutrition-based epiphany, revealing in 2024 he had introduced a pre-match meal, which he says sustains his energy through long evening sessions.And while Higgins lost more than three stone in 2021, something he attributed to regular spin classes, he now says that weight has gone \"back on\" but that he is installing a gym at home to change things and get \"a little bit more motivation\".\"The hardest part as you get older is the practice. That love of the game has got to be in you all the way through,\" Virgo added.Williams, Higgins and O'Sullivan are not immune to those challenges. Higgins, a four-time world champion, said in September he finds it \"difficult to get the cue out the case to practice\".\"But I just think, that's just life,\" Higgins added. \"You get older. Your priorities change.\"Higgins has considered taking a break from certain tournaments but is restricted by the nature of the ranking system, where entry into big events can depend on performance in the smaller ones.\"It's a difficult juggling act,\" he said. \"It can do your mental health no good trying to go to these events.\"O'Sullivan, too, has reined back his schedule in Europe since moving to Dubai. The UK Championship will be the first event he has played in this country this season.But none of the trio seem ready to say goodbye yet. Just like in tennis where the big three rivals of the past two decades – Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic – were all pushed by each other to greater successes, so too are O'Sullivan, Higgins and Williams.\"If one was doing it, it begs the question why isn't the other one doing it?\" Virgo said. \"I think they've motivated one another.\"After his last Triple Crown win at the Masters in 2024, O'Sullivan observed that younger players \"need to get their acts together because I am going blind, have got a dodgy arm and bad knees and they still can't beat me\".While China's Zhao Xintong won this year's World Championship, few players have emerged who have gone on to dominate the calendar. It is exemplified by the results of this season, where 11 different men have won the first 11 events.But it is not that easy when you're chasing O'Sullivan who, according to Virgo, has more \"natural ability\" than any current sportsman and which he remembers witnessing in the then 16-year-old's first appearance on popular gameshow Big Break in 1992. \"The way he falls into the shot, you could see it straight away,\" he said, watching the teenager scuttle round the table and making a rapid clearance that won his contestant a prize haul that included a new fax machine.O'Sullivan, at least in public, maintains that winning tournaments is \"not the be all and end all\".However, he has hinted in the past that long spells without success help sustain his motivation.It is now almost two years since he won a ranking event, but the young O'Sullivan's hero, Davis, says this birthday could change things.\"Who's to say that turning 50 isn't the catalyst that Ronnie needs to go, 'Yeah, I'm going to show everybody how good I am',\" said Davis. \"We all know how good he is, but I think Ronnie really does enjoy making people's jaws drop.\"If he won the UK Championship, if he won the World Championship, our jaws would drop… Yeah, that would be a monumental thing to do.\"",

The discovery was made when staff went to feed the herd of Irish Red Deer,\" Fingal County Council said in a statement.The stag, who was eight years old, was one of two in the herd.The killing of the stag is also under investigation by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.'He was a big favourite with the public'The Mayor of Fingal, councillor Tom O'Leary, condemned the killing.He said: \"I have visited this park area with my granddaughters who really enjoyed meeting the stag and deer.  A wonderful animal to behold close up. \"It's truly shocking that someone would carry out this act,\" he said.\"I am appealing to anybody with information to contact the gardaí or the National Parks and Wildlife Service. It is illegal to kill deer without a licence and I hope that the perpetrators can be brought to justice.\"Ivan Smith, foreman of Works at Newbridge House and Traditional Farm, said the team was \"absolutely shocked\" by the incident.\"He was a lovely stag with a beautiful pair of antlers and was a big favourite with the public who walk through the park.\"'Unnecessary killing'Ireland's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) have expressed \"horror\" at the attack.\"The unnecessary killing of such a majestic creature for, what appears to be, a trophy is appalling,\" Pat Watt of the NSPCA said.\"It is the NSPCA's hopes that the perpetrator/s will be caught and prosecuted with the full force of the legal system relating to this type of crime. Animal abuse is not acceptable in any situations.\"'Disgusted and appalled'Councillor for the area Eoghan Dockrell told BBC News NI that he was \"in shock\".\"The one common response to anyone I've spoken to in the community is they're disgusted and appalled,\" he said.He added that he has \"an awful lot of sympathy for the staff members who would have had to come upon that scene and how distressing that must have been\".\"I have been in touch with council officials to see if they'd review security procedures in the park and while a lot of patrols are being carried out during the day, we're going to see if we can increase patrols at night time,\" he said.Anyone who has any information should report it to National Parks and Wildlife Service, Fingal County Council or their local Garda Station.Gardaí (Irish police) also said they wish to speak with anyone who has footage, including dashcam, from between 00:00 and 02:30 local time on Thursday on the R126 road, Cobbe's Lane and Turvey Avenue, around Newbridge Demense, to make it available.",

    "body": "8 hours agoThe fallout over the Budget continues to dominate the front pages of Saturday's papers. \"Reeves on the brink over tax lies\" says the Daily Telegraph, as it reports Chancellor Rachel Reeves is being accused of misleading the public over the state of the country's public finances. The paper says the chancellor is fighting for her job after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) revealed a forecast of higher wages - which she had not mentioned - would help her meet spending rules.\"'Liar' Reeves must go now\" is the Daily Mail's take. The paper quotes calls from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch for the chancellor to be sacked, saying she had \"lied to the public to justify record tax hikes\". Downing Street has denied the chancellor misled the public about the state of the public finances ahead of the Budget.The Independent follows with \"Reeves 'misled the public' over fake fiscal black hole\", focusing on the OBR telling the chancellor that instead of a deficit, she had a surplus of £4.2bn.The Sun cites the \"fury\" at Reeves over the revelations, dubbing her \"Chancer of the Exchequer\".The i paper shifts its focus to the verdict from voters on the Budget, summing it up as \"nice ideas but we will be poorer\". The paper says its own polling shows Reeves's Budget is \"the least popular since Liz Truss era\" but voters do like some measures, including higher gambling taxes and the minimum wage hike.Daily Express highlights the Budget's impact on pensioners, saying an extra 200,000 are set to lose their winter fuel payments. The paper cites documents published on a government website that reveal 2.2m pensioners are about to be denied the benefit, with experts warning that number \"will only go up\".The hospitality industry is also facing a \"stealth tax\" after the Budget, according to the Times. The paper says a separate government agency revealed a much higher assessment of the value of the buildings used to calculate business rates, which means the levy \"will rise significantly next year\" for the average high street business.The new \"mansion tax\" leads the Financial Times. Wealthy homeowners are rushing to \"sidestep\" Reeves' council tax surcharge by agreeing to asking prices below the thresholds set out in the Budget, the paper says. Elsewhere, the \"crisis in Kyiv\" takes the top picture spot, showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his top aid Andriy Yermark, who resigned yesterday after anti corruption raids.The chancellor is calling on Britain's wealthy to shoulder the burden of paying to fix the country's \"creaky\" public services, reports the Guardian. In an interview with the paper, Reeves says her decision to increase taxes by £26bn aims to help improve schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, and that she made \"fair and necessary choices\".Meanwhile in entertainment news, the Daily Mirror features an interview with TV host Ruth Langsford opening up about her split from fellow broadcaster Eamonn Holmes.Finally, the Daily Star splashes their front page with football star Wayne Rooney's strong opinions about TV clown Mr Tumble. According to the paper, Rooney jokes about his \"hate\" for the character, saying \"after four children, he's why I got the snip\".Many of the papers take aim at the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, over claims she was told by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) there was no black hole in the public finances well before she unveiled her Budget.The Times describes it as a budget \"of smoke and mirrors\" as it focuses on what it calls \"crippling\" tax rises in the hospitality sector.With the headline \"'Liar' Reeves must go\", the Daily Mail tells its readers the chancellor kept the secret in order to hike taxes.\"Chancer of the Exchequer\" is how the Sun frames the story, while the Daily Telegraph suggests she is fighting for her job with the headline: \"Reeves on the brink over tax lies.\"The Financial Times says the chancellor has been accused of \"exaggerating gloom\", but reports that Downing Street has denied she misled the public or MPs.On its front page, the Guardian carries an interview with Rachel Reeves in which she defends her handling of the Budget. She says she made \"fair and necessary choices\".The Times reveals that Prince Edward pays a peppercorn rent for the 120-room Surrey mansion he has leased from the Crown Estate for 25 years. The newspaper forced the disclosure of documents which it says shows the King's brother paid £5m for a 150-year lease but pays a nominal amount to stay there. The Crown Estate and Buckingham Palace declined to comment.Billed as a world exclusive investigation, the Daily Mail carries the story of the man who claims he is the real Mo Farah. The newspaper describes the complicated tale that led up to a \"sliding doors\" moment when the Olympian Sir Mo Farah, whose real name is Hussein Abdi Kahin, was taken to Britain from war-torn Somalia when he was a young child on a visa meant for the real Mohamed Farah who was left behind.The Guardian highlights the dangers of methanol poisoning for young people travelling abroad which it describes as a \"hidden crisis\" which has left a \"trail of trauma\". The newspaper features the account of Bethany Clarke who survived drinking the same contaminated shots which killed her friend Simone White while the pair were staying in Laos last year.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said that he will pardon the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in a US court last year. The US president said Hernández had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly\" in a social media post announcing the move on Friday.Hernández was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and of possessing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.Trump also threw his support behind conservative presidential candidate Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura in the Central American nation's general election, due to be held on Sunday.Hernández, a member of the National Party, who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the US in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to smuggle hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. He was convicted by a New York jury two years later. Polls indicate the Honduran election remains a toss-up between three candidates including Asfura, the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and leader of the conservative National Party.Also in the running is Rixi Moncada, a former defence minister standing for the ruling left-wing Libre Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla on Friday, writing that the latter was \"a boderline Communist\" who was only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura.He characterised Asfura as \"standing up for democracy\" and praised him for campaigning against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, with whom Trump has engaged in a war of words in recent months.Nasralla has pledged to cut ties with Venezuela if he wins.The Trump administration has accused the left-wing Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as illegitimate by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.It used countering drug trafficking as a justification for a military build-up in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on vessels it says have been used for smuggling - though some analysts have described these moves as a means of pressuring Latin American leaders.Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro, who has forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.But Castro has maintained a co-operative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with it. Her country also hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on vessels suspected of being involved in the transport of narcotics since they began in August.US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" was to eliminate \"narcoterrorists\". But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted were carrying drugs.",

    "body": "13 hours agoGetty ImagesThe UK's National Screening Committee has recommended that only a very small group of men at high risk of prostate cancer should be screened for the disease.There is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men.But there has been some energetic campaigning for change by high-profile figures, including Sir Chris Hoy, who has terminal prostate cancer, and Lord David Cameron, who recently revealed he'd been treated for it.The expert advice will now be consulted on for the next three months, before the screening committee gives its final recommendations to governments in the four nations of the UK in March.What is screening?Screening is when people are invited for a test to look for disease despite them having no symptoms.Examples include women being invited for a mammogram to look for breast cancer or the at-home bowel cancer test that is posted to your home every two years over the age of 50.The idea is to catch cancer before someone starts to get ill and when it can still be treated.What was recommended today?Experts say there is no justification for screening the large majority of men for prostate cancer.They looked at all the available evidence and concluded that screening was only suitable for:men with a genetic risk of prostate cancer (with a confirmed BRCA gene variant)The advice says this group should be screened every two years between the ages of 45 and 61.This means no screening is recommended for other high-risk groups of men such as:black menmen with a family history of prostate cancerWhy did they come to that conclusion?The UK National Screening Committee said a mass screening programme for prostate cancer was likely to cause more harm than good.Tests for the disease are unreliable, and can lead to men being treated for a slow-growing cancer that isn't going to cause them any harm. The treatment itself can cause incontinence and impotence, which can significantly affect quality of life.Balanced against that, finding cancers early and treating them can save lives. But it's difficult for doctors to work out which cancers are going to be aggressive and spread, which means men can be treated unnecessarily.The committe said the number of lives saved by screening does not outweigh its harmful effects on healthy men.Why not screen all high-risk men?Many predicted that all men at high risk of the disease were likely to be included in new screening plans.But the committee stopped short of that recommendation.Despite black men having twice the risk of prostate cancer, it said there should be no screening for black men due to \"uncertainties\" around its impact, and a lack of evidence from clinical trials in these men. It also recommended no screening for men with a family history of the disease, for the same reason - too many cancers would be overdiagnosed and overtreated.But men with specific genetic mutations - called BRCA variants - develop faster-growing and aggressive cancers at an earlier age, making screening for them justified.Treating these cancers earlier is more likely to benefit those men and outweigh the potential harm from unnecessary treatment, compared to men in the general population, the experts said.How do you test for BRCA variant?A genetic test is needed which looks for a mutation of the BRCA 1 and 2 genes.These gene variants can affect men and women, increasing the risk of a range of cancers, including prostate, breast and ovarian cancer.Around three in 1,000 men have BRCA variants, but many will be unaware unless they have family members that are known carriers, and then had it confirmed with a test.Experts say more genetic tests will need to be offered to high-risk men in future, in order to work out how many are affected.How many men get prostate cancer?Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men.Some 55,000 men are diagnosed with the disease each year, and 12,000 men die from it in annually in the UK.Is this the final word on screening?No, a three-month consultation on the recommendations starts today.The committee will meet again after that and give its final advice to ministers in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.They will then have to make their own individual decision on prostate screening. Wes Streeting, Health Secretary in England, says he wants screening in place but only if it's \"backed by evidence\". He said he would examine the evidence \"thoroughly\" ahead of his final decision in March.",

    "body": "11 hours agoBBCCameron Barracks is a 140-year-old army recruitment and training baseThe Home Office has delayed plans to house asylum seekers at two military sites in East Sussex and the Scottish Highlands.About 540 men were due to be sent to Crowborough army training camp and another 300 men to Cameron Barracks in Inverness.The UK government originally wanted to move asylum seekers by early December as part of drive to close asylum hotels.The Home Office said it wanted to avoid rushed plans leading to \"unsafe and chaotic situations\". It said it would proceed when facilities were \"fully operational and safe\".Crowborough and Cameron Barracks were both earmarked earlier this year as potential temporary asylum seeker accommodation.In East Sussex, the local authority Wealden District Council passed a motion formally opposing the Crowborough proposal.Highland Council also raised concerns over the scale of the barracks plans and pressures on local services.The 140-year-old base, near Inverness city centre, was previously used to house families fleeing Afghanistan.Charlie Rose/BBCThe Home Office plans to house 540 male asylum seekers at the Crowborough siteThe Home Office said it still planned to \"accelerate\" the movement of people.  But it said it would not do so at the expense of the safety of local communities.A spokesperson added: \"We are furious at the level of illegal migrants and asylum hotels. \"Moving to large military sites is an important part of our reforms to tackle remove the incentives that draw illegal migrants to Britain.\"We are continuing to accelerate plans to move people into Cameron Barracks, when it is fully operational and safe.\"We will continue to work closely with local representatives and authorities throughout this transition.\"PA MediaPeople board a small boat in Gravelines, France.Widespread protests against the housing of asylum seekers in hotels exploded across the UK in the summer.In Scotland, protests were held outside hotels housing asylum seekers in Perth and Aberdeenshire as well as Falkirk during August.A brick was thrown through the window of the Cladhan Hotel in Falkirk in September, months after hundreds of pro and anti-immigration protesters held rival demonstrations outside.The Park Hotel in the town was also targeted after a former resident, Sadeq Nikzad, was sentenced to nine years in jail for the rape of a 15-year-old girl.Highland Council officials recommended writing to the Home Office to seek \"urgent clarity\" on the proposals at the start of November.The local authority previously said that about 60 people per week could arrive at the barracks from the second week of December.They said the plan was to use the site for 12 months, before it reverted back to being an army base.But a report also raised concerns over the scale of the proposal, the potential of protests and the barracks becoming a target for people \"deliberately wishing to incite violence and hatred\".A spokesperson for the council said: \"A multi-agency partnership involving the council, NHS Highland, Police Scotland, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the Scottish government, Cosla, and the Home Office is now meeting weekly to plan for the arrival of asylum seekers and learn from best practice.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterDowning Street has denied Rachel Reeves misled the public about the state of the public finances ahead of this week's Budget.In the run-up to Wednesday's statement, the chancellor repeatedly talked about a downgrade to the UK's predicted economic productivity that would make it hard for her to meet her spending rules.But in a letter to MPs sent on Friday, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) revealed a forecast of higher wages - which she had not mentioned - would help her meet the rules.The Conservatives have accused Reeves of giving an overly pessimistic impression of the public finances as a \"smokescreen\" to raise taxes.Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the letter showed Reeves had \"lied to the public\" and should be sacked.In a letter to the Commons Treasury select committee, OBR chairman Richard Hughes revealed that he told the chancellor on 17 September that the public finances were in better shape than widely thought.The letter also reveals that on the 31 October, the OBR told the Treasury it was on course to meet its main rule of not borrowing for day-to-day spending, albeit by £4.2bn, less than the £9.9bn in \"headroom\" she had left herself last year.On 4 November, Reeves used a rare pre-Budget speech in Downing Street to warn the UK's productivity was weaker \"than previously thought\" and that \"has consequences for the public finances too, in lower tax receipts.\"Then, on 10 November, she told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It would, of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.\"These comments, along with her speech, fuelled speculation she needed to raise significant sums to meet her fiscal rules.However, the Office for Budget Responsibility has now confirmed that although it did indeed downgrade productivity, it also predicted this would be \"offset\" by higher wages increasing the government's tax revenues.That meant she had a surplus to meet both of her fiscal rules.A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \"We are not going to get into the OBR's processes or speculate on how that relates to the internal decision‑making in the build‑up to a Budget, but the Chancellor made her choices to cut the cost of living, cut hospital waiting lists and double headroom to cut the cost of our debt.\"But Reeves continued to indicate that she was likely to increase income tax rates.In her Downing Street press conference, she said: \"It is already clear that the productivity performance…is weaker than previously thought.\"She added: \"What I want people to understand ahead of that Budget, is the circumstances we face.\"In the end, Reeves backed away from hiking income tax rates, although her Budget still contained £26bn of tax rises, including by freezing income tax thresholds for a further three years, dragging more people into higher tax bands over time.In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Reeves said: \"We did look, as everyone knows, at income tax and National Insurance, that was a responsible thing to do, because we didn't know the size of the downgrade, the productivity.\"The chancellor told the newspaper she had made \"fair and necessary\" choices, adding: \"I wasn't willing to cut public services, because people voted for change at the election.\"Conservative shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said that while Reeves had repeatedly talked about the productivity downgrade, she had \"failed to mention\" the offsetting effect of higher wages on the forecast.He added: \"It was all a smokescreen. Labour knew all along that they did not need to raise taxes and break their promises.\"It appears the country was deliberately misled to try to explain away Labour's decision to spend billions more on welfare.\"Asked whether Reeves had misled the public and the financial markets, the PM's spokesperson said: \"I don't accept that.\" He added: \"As she [Reeves] set out in the speech that she gave here (Downing Street), she talked about the challenges the country was facing and she set out her decisions incredibly clearly at the Budget.\"He added the government had increased the headroom for the Treasury to meet the fiscal rules, which would creates \"certainty and stability for business\".",

Warning: This article contains spoilers for Drag Race UK's series seven finale.The four finalists sat down with judges RuPaul and Michelle Visage to reflect on their time on the reality show and served up some dazzling final looks before Silllexa and Catrin were asked to sashay away. Bones and Elle later went head-to-head in a lip-sync battle for the crown, performing to You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) by US disco singer Sylvester.BBC/World of Wonder/Guy LevyBones entered the world of drag seven years ago and is now a popular fixture in Soho's scene in LondonFollowing a lively performance, Bones was declared the winner and secured the £25,000 cash prize. The drag superstar told BBC Newsbeat it might take the full year of her reign before she can come up with a word to describe how she is feeling. \"It's a good type of overwhelming. I think after the season, it feels like the cherry on top. Honestly, I feel very lucky,\" she said. Bones revealed she and fellow finalist Elle, who hails from west Belfast, promised each other that if either of them won they would take the other on a holiday. She said they haven't booked anything yet but a trip to Europe, the Caribbean or possibly a cruise have been suggested. Originally from Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, Bones entered the world of drag seven years ago and is now a popular fixture in London's Soho scene.The prize money will also go towards improving their drag, which is notoriously an expensive art form. \"This money, it's what every drag queen dreams of. It's almost like a bursary to be creative and produce. So absolutely, I will be stepping up everything that you see, \" she said.This is the second year the winner of the UK edition has received a cash prize since it launched in 2019. Bones said now that the UK spin-off is on its seventh series, the art form has become more popular, but also \"more saturated\", meaning that its \"down to the queens to make (things) happen for themselves now\".The 25-year-old, known as Paul Greaves out of drag, picked up three \"RuPeter\"  badges throughout the series, which are awarded to the winner of the maxi-challenge each episode. During her sit-down with RuPaul and Michelle in the finale, Bones was joined by her mother Diane. She said her parents had been \"so supportive\" when she was growing up and she has tried to pass on that love to others within her community who didn't receive the same care.BBC/World of Wonder/Guy LevyBones, known as Paul Greaves out of drag, was joined by their mother Diane during the finalDrag Race fan Benjy Kusi told BBC Newsbeat that he feels Bones is a \"really worthy winner\".\"I thought Bones always devoured the runway, they have such a great presence whenever they hit the stage,\" he said. One of the highlights of the series saw the contestants give makeovers to a line-up of celebrities. Bones transformed classical singer Charlotte Church into her drag sister, named Blood, and the pair donned co-ordinated cream silk and lace outfits as part of a vampire wedding fantasy. Benjy said the makeover was \"one of the best makeovers out of all the seasons of Drag Race\".Abena KusiBenjy Kusi said he feels Bones is a \"really worthy winner\"Drag Race remains popular, but fans have complained that various spin-offs, including versions in Europe, Canada and Australia, have over-saturated the brand.And, after seven years on our screens, there are those who think it could do with a makeover of its own.Benjy said he thinks the UK version would attract \"greater engagement\" if the show reflected the \"amazing, beautiful diversity of the scene\" more. Drag performer and fan Nick agreed the show reflected only a \"tiny slice\" of drag culture in the UK. \"People want to see something new, people go: 'Oh look it's another bunch of early-mid 20's, primarily white queens who are skinny doing the same-old, same-old,\" they added.\"It's very flattened and we don't learn as much.\" Reflecting on this, Bones told Newsbeat: \"I don't think I could ever say it's tired because baby, if it's working, it's working, and it's been working for a long time.\"However, the drag star said they did enjoy how other versions changed up the format and suggested the UK edition could \"mix it up a bit\", but said she \"loved\" her series.

    "body": "Zelensky's top adviser resigns after anti-corruption raid on his home14 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor andJaroslav LukivReutersYermak has for years been Zelensky's closest aide and has played a key role in talks towards ending the warUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home.Yermak, a towering figure with enormous political influence, has been Zelensky's closest adviser throughout Russia's full-scale war, but has come under increasing pressure over an escalating scandal - even though he is not accused of any wrongdoing.Zelensky had recently appointed him to head crucial negotiations, with US President Donald Trump leading a new drive to end the Russia-Ukraine war.In a stark address to the nation outside his presidential office, Zelensky called for unity, warning: \"We risk losing everything: ourselves, Ukraine, our future.\"The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine for weeks, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position with the US at a delicate time.Ukraine, backed by its European allies, has sought to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.Early on Friday Ukraine's two anti-corruption agencies raided Yermak's apartment in Kyiv's government quarters and the chief of staff said on social media that \"from my side there is full co-operation\".\"I'm grateful to Andriy that Ukraine's position on the negotiating track was always presented as required: it was always a patriotic position,\" Ukraine's president said during his video address in Kyiv.Zelensky said he would start consultations on Saturday on who would replace Yermak as his top adviser: \"When all the attention is focused on diplomacy and the defence in a war, inner strength is required.\"\"Russia wants Ukraine to make mistakes – there won't be any mistakes from our side. Our work continues, our fight continues. We have no right... to retreat, to quarrel [among ourselves].\"Yermak's departure from Ukraine's leading circle will come as a major blow for Zelensky, with US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll due to arrive in Kyiv by the end of this week as part of Trump's draft peace plan. US officials are heading to Moscow next week and Russia's Vladimir Putin said on Friday he backed a Hungarian offer to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest.Putin has continued to promote Russia's maximalist demands to bring an end to the war. He claimed on Thursday that Russian forces had the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from the entire eastern Donbas region, including several strategically important cities under Ukrainian control.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Putin said.Hours before the raid on his flat, Yermak continued to explain his government's position as it comes under US pressure to make territorial concessions to Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\"As long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory,\" Yermak told The Atlantic website.Yermak, 54, admitted during his interview he was under \"enormous\" pressure to stand down, adding \"the case is fairly loud, and there needs to be an objective and independent investigation without political influence\".AFP via Getty ImagesEarlier this week, Yermak took part in talks in Geneva with US Secretary of State Marco RubioUkraine's anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sap) did not explain why they searched his flat.In the past few weeks investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.Russian officials involved in Trump's draft peace plan have talked up the corruption claims, which have alarmed European Union allies. Ukraine is a candidate to join the EU and a report earlier this month highlighted doubts over \"commitment to its anti-corruption agenda\".Earlier this year Zelensky sought to curb the powers of the two anti-corruption agencies, but he was forced to backtrack almost immediately after widespread protests and objections from Kyiv's Western allies.Zelensky has already fired Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk and Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and several suspects have been detained in the burgeoning corruption scandal that has outraged public opinion because of allegations that money was diverted from key infrastructure projects vital for safeguarding Ukrainian power supplies.As winter starts in Ukraine, Russian attacks have already badly damaged its energy infrastructure and Ukrainians across the country have had to cope with only a few hours of electricity a day.One of the president's former business associates, Timur Mindich, has left the country in the wake of the corruption allegations.Mindich was co-owner of the TV studio Kvartal 95 where Zelensky's acting career took off before he was elected president.In recent weeks Andriy Yermak's popularity has nose-dived and MPs from all parties, including his own, have been calling for his sacking, initially for what they saw as his inflated power for an unelected official, but more recently, the burgeoning corruption scandal.Recent polling suggested 70% of the public wanted him to resign.Zelensky and his now-former chief of staff became friends about 14 years ago, while the future president was a senior media executive and Yermak worked for him as a lawyer. Yermak was made chief of staff a year after Zelensky was elected president in 2019.On the first night of Russia's invasion, they appeared together with colleagues delivering a defiant video message outside the presidential office on Kyiv's Bankova Street, vowing to stay and fight.\"We are all here,\" Zelensky told Ukrainians. \"Our soldiers are here, the citizens are here and we are all here. We are defending our independence, and that's how it will continue.\"",

I don't think there's that much information out there on how to actually get investment for small businesses,\" she said.The 31-year-old said when one product went viral in 2022, people wrongly assumed she was an overnight success and millionaire.\"I paid myself a small wage just so that we could live and get by but I didn't take any massive chunks of money, especially in those days when we started go viral, because every single penny that was made had to be reinvested to keep up with the demands,\" Zoe said.She said she feels that there's a lot of pressure for female founders to be perfect and to always make perfect decisions – something she tries to challenge online.\"It's really, really important, especially for people that are wanting to become entrepreneurs, to show that it isn't all highlights and not everything is rosy, and you don't just sell out instantly. \"There's a lot of hard work and a lot of downs and negatives that do come with it,\" she said.Lauren Bell says she's moving her entire business to the United States after struggling to find serious investment hereEntrepreneur Lauren Bell said it took four years before she was able to take a salary from her business, Cosi Care.The 33-year-old created a gadget to help her brother cope with eczema, which he has had throughout his life.Lauren said: \"It's so challenging to get the big cheques. People don't support women. People almost don't believe that women can achieve what men can achieve.\"They see me in a pink suit with a nice Welsh accent, and they just don't believe that you can reach those levels.\"The entrepreneur said that while she's really proud of what she's achieved as a woman in a STEM industry, it's a \"shame\" she didn't have more support in the early days.Lauren, a design graduate, has recently won a million-pound investment and will be moving the entire business to the US soon.\"I'm moving all of our employees there. I'm manufacturing in America and moving everything over to America, which is a real shame, because I did really try and do it in the UK, but there just wasn't the same scale of support for female-owned businesses,\" she said.Dr Sarah Marks said many female entrepreneurs faced returning to employment after struggling to make a livingDr Sarah Marks from Swansea University agreed business owners are under pressure to present themselves as successful online.\"For people to really be successful and to really consider themselves as a successful entrepreneur, they actually need to be generating quite a lot of income, and my research suggests that actually the vast majority of women do not generate anywhere near what will be a market equivalent income for themselves,\" she said.The lecturer in the school of management said her research showed entrepreneurship often doesn't provide sustainable living for women, with many giving up.\"Women are actually denied a kind of platform in which to complain about how little money they're earning... they don't want to be seen as greedy; they don't want to be seen as ungrateful and that can be a real pressure for women and a real burden,\" she said.A report published last month by the Women and Equalities committee found that female entrepreneurs face significant disadvantages in accessing finances, investment networks and support systems.The cross-party group of MPs found that while numerous programmes have been established to address the issue, they have had limited effect.A spokesperson for the UK government said it was \"putting women at the heart of its grown agenda to make the UK the best place for women-led businesses by tackling barriers and unlocking opportunities for them\".\"The Invest in Women Taskforce has secured over £500m in funding for women-led businesses over the past 12 months and investment in female entrepreneurs began in August this year,\" they said.The Welsh government said since May 2021, Business Wales had supported 2,301 start-ups led by women which is \"56% of all start-ups supported\".\"The Development Bank for Wales supports female entrepreneurs via many projects, including the Women Angel of Wales syndicate which increases the activity of female angel investors\" they added.More top stories",

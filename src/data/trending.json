The Einstein-Freud LettersAvailable for over a yearIn 1932 the world-famous physicist Albert Einstein wrote a public letter to the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Einstein, a keen advocate of the League of Nations and peace campaigner, asked Freud if he thought war and aggression was forever tied to human psychology and the course of international relations: could we ever secure a lasting world peace? \nEinstein’s letter is deeply prescient, as is Freud’s extraordinary response. The exchange was titled ‘Why War?’. The two thinkers explore the nature of war and peace in politics and in all human life; they think about human nature, the history of warfare and human aggression and the hope represented by the foundation of the League of Nations (precursor to the UN) and its promise of global security and a new architecture of international law. \nAt the time of their exchange, Freud is in the last great phase of his career and has already introduced psychoanalysis into the field of politics and society. Einstein, the younger of the two, is using his huge international profile as a physicist for political and pacifist intervention.\nFor Einstein, future world security means a shared moral understanding across the global order - that humankind rise above the ‘state of nature’ never to devolve into total war again. He wrote to Freud, as 'a citizen of the world…immune to nationalist bias...I greatly admire your passion to ascertain the truth. You have shown how the aggressive and destructive instincts are bound up in the human psyche with those of love and the lust for life. At the same time, you make manifest your devotion to the goal of liberation from the evils of war...’ Is it possible, Einstein asks Freud, to make us 'proof against the psychoses of hate and destructiveness?'. Freud's answer is fascinating and quite unexpected.  \nThe exchange of letters was sponsored by the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, an organisation promoting global security by using prominent thinkers, drawing on multiple fields of knowledge (from science to psychology, politics and law) to achieve a new language for international peace, following the lessons learned from the Great War of 1914-18. \nBut even as Einstein wrote to Freud in the summer of 1932, the Nazi party became the largest political party in the German Reichstag. Both men felt a sense of apprehension about what was coming; both were pacifist, both Jewish, both would be driven into exile (both Einsteinian physics and Freudian psychoanalysis were denounced by the new regime). The letters were finally published in 1933 when Hitler came to power, suppressed in Germany, and as a result never achieved the circulation intended for them. \nFeaturing readings from the Einstein–Freud letters and contributions from historians of warfare and psychoanalysis, war journalism and global security, this feature showcases the little-known exchange between two of the 20th century’s greatest thinkers, ‘Why War?’ – a question just as relevant in today’s world.\nContributors include historian of war and peace Margaret MacMillan, BBC chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet, defence and security expert Mark Galeotti, historian of international relations Patrick O Cohrs, author Lisa Appignanesi, who has written on Freud and the history of psychoanalysis, and Faisal Devji, historian of conflict and political violence in India and the Middle East. \nReadings are by Elliot Levey (Einstein) and Henry Goodman (Freud) \nProduced by Simon Hollis\nA Brook Lapping production for BBC Radio 4Programme Website",

    "body": "6 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterPA MediaReform UK has said it will no longer co-operate with a BBC documentary about the party following a row over how a speech by US President Donald Trump was edited.The BBC had commissioned an outside production company, October Films, to make the programme, which was due to air in January. The company was involved in the Panorama documentary about Trump which has triggered a major row at the broadcaster, though was not responsible for the editing of the speech, which was done by BBC staff.An internal Reform email seen by BBC News said the production firm had \"conducted themselves professionally\" on the project but advised members to decline to participate with filming going forward.October Films has been approached for comment, while the BBC said it does not comment on in-development projects.The documentary was due to be called The Rise of Reform, and was to be presented by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. Its makers had been given \"unprecedented access\" to senior figures in the party, the internal Reform email said.It is unclear whether the documentary will proceed without the party's co-operation.The email referred to the Panorama edit of Trump's speech from 6 January 2021 as  \"disinformation\", and said a decision had been made to \"cease engagement\" with the documentary as a result.It continued: \"We want to be clear that October Films have always conducted themselves professionally, and there is no suggestion from our side that they would maliciously misrepresent Reform UK. \"However, following the Panorama documentary the trust has been lost, and both BBC and the production company will have to do a lot of hard work to regain that trust.\"The email advised party members to \"politely decline to participate\" if approached by the documentary team, and to withdraw consent for footage already filmed to be used.One of the documentary's subjects, Kent County Council leader Linden Kemkaran, said in a social post that she had \"rescinded all permission\" for footage gathered over several weeks to be aired.The BBC has come under intense scrutiny over a Panorama documentary, titled Trump: A Second Chance?, which aired shortly before the 2024 US presidential election.An edit included in the documentary spliced together parts of a speech made by Trump on 6 January 2021 in a way that made it look like he was explicitly urging people to attack the US Capitol.In his speech in Washington DC, Trump said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"However, in the Panorama edit he was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"The two sections of the speech were delivered nearly an hour apart -  with the \"fight like hell\" comment taken from a section where Trump discussed how \"corrupt\" US elections were. In total, he used the words \"fight\" or \"fighting\" 20 times.The documentary aired last year but came to prominence this month when a leaked internal BBC memo which raised concerns about the edit was published by the Telegraph newspaper. The memo was written by Michael Prescott, an external editorial advisor to the BBC's editorial standards committee. It said Panorama had produced a \"distortion of the day's events\" which would leave viewers asking: \"Why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?\"The fallout to the memo's emergence has led to BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigning from their positions.Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn (£760m) unless he receives a full retraction, apology and compensation.On Monday, BBC chair Samir Shah apologised for an \"error of judgement\" over the documentary.",

    "body": "Scientists have unearthed Australia's oldest known crocodile eggshells which may have belonged to \"drop crocs\" - creatures that climbed trees to hunt prey below.The discovery of the 55-million-year-old eggshells was made in a sheep farmer's backyard in Queensland with the findings published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.The egghells belonged to a long-extinct group of crocodiles known as mekosuchines, who lived in inland waters when Australia was part of Antarctica and South America.Co-author Prof Michael Archer said \"drop crocs\" were a \"bizarre idea\" but some were \"perhaps hunting like leopards - dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner\".Prof Archer, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales, said mekosuchine crocodiles - which could grow to about five metres - were plentiful 55 million years ago, long before their modern saltwater and freshwater cousins arrived in Australia about 3.8 million years ago.The \"drop croc\" eggshells were discovered several decades ago but only recently analysed with the help of scientists in Spain.\"It's a bizarre idea,\" Prof Archer said of the \"drop crocs\",  but some were probably \"terrestrial hunters in the forests\".The findings add to earlier discoveries of younger mekosuchine fossils - found in 25-million-year-old deposits in another part of Queensland.\"Some were also apparently at least partly semi-arboreal 'drop crocs',\" Prof Archer said.Since the early 1980s, he has been part of a group of scientists excavating a clay pit in Murgon, a small regional town about 270km (168 miles) north-west of Brisbane.Over the decades, it has become known as one of Australia's oldest fossil sites as it used to be surrounded by a lush forest. \"This forest was also home to the world's oldest-known songbirds, Australia's earliest frogs and snakes, a wide range of small mammals with South American links, as well as one of the world's oldest known bats,\" Dr Michael Stein, a co-author of the report, said.Prof Archer recalls how in 1983, he and another colleague \"drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard\".\"After explaining the prehistoric treasures that might lie under their sheep paddock and that fossil turtle shells had already been found in the area, they grinned and said 'of course!'.\"And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we've already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesA decision to reject compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age will be reconsidered by the government.Campaigners say 3.6 million women born in the 1950s were not properly informed of the rise in state pension age to bring them into line with men. Last year, the government apologised for a 28-month delay in sending letters, but rejected any kind of financial payouts.A document was not shown to Liz Kendall, who was Work and Pensions Secretary at the time of the decision, but had since come to light and needed to be considered, the government has now said.There is no guarantee any payout will be made, but campaigners said the move was a major step forward. Current Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden told the Commons that retaking the decision would not automatically lead to compensation.\"Retaking this decision should not be taken as an indication that government will necessarily decide that it should award financial redress,\" he said.The undisclosed evidence involved was a survey from 2007, and McFadden said that checks would be made to ensure other documents and surveys had not been missed. No timescale has been given for the work to be done.\"I understand that people are impatient for this matter to be resolved,\" he said.\"It is important that we give it full and appropriate consideration.\"Angela Madden, who chairs Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi), said: \"The government now knows it got it wrong and we are pleased they are now trying to do it properly.\"We hope they also try to do it quickly.\"She added that the \"only correct thing to do\" was to compensate those affected immediately.Compensation recommendedEarly last year, a parliamentary ombudsman recommended compensation of between £1,000 and £2,950 for each of those affected.While the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it and the government rejected it.Ministers said there was no evidence of \"direct financial loss\" resulting from the government's decision, and that Labour did not believe that paying a flat rate to all women at a cost of up to £10.5bn would be \"fair or proportionate\" to taxpayers.The Waspi campaign had called for payments of at least £10,000 each.It is pursuing a judicial review of the government's decision not to pay compensation. Campaigners raised money for the legal challenge and a court capped the contribution to the government's legal fees if they were unsuccessful.The case was scheduled to go to the High Court in December. The government has now informed the court of its latest decision.The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women.But for decades, men had received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60.Under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020.But the coalition government of 2010 decided to speed that up. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was brought forward to 2018.The increases have been controversial. Campaigners say women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by the rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected.",

    "body": "UK toy sales up as 'kidults' buy Lego and Pokémon8 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentDaniel Knighton/Getty ImagesThe popularity of brands such as Lego have driven salesToy sales have risen for the first time since the pandemic, analysts say, as brands aim to appeal to children and adults.The value of sales rose by 6% in the year to September compared with the same period last year, according to research company Circana.Film releases such as Stitch, sports like Formula 1 and the popularity of brands such as Lego have driven sales.With so-called \"kidults\" responsible for a third of sales, many manufacturers and sellers are targeting a sweet spot of products that different generations want to play and collect.\"The products that are doing really well at the moment, such as Lego and Pokemon, are the ones that have that cross-generational appeal,\" said Melissa Symonds, UK toys director at Circana, which tracks toy sales.\"It is a really difficult balance to hit, and some won't be able to make it. Some will focus on just the pre-school market, and some on adults - but the real trick is getting the balance between the two age groups.\"Sales of toys and games saw a big lift during Covid as more families spent time at home during lockdowns, but sales had fallen since 2021 until this year.The kidult market - which is toys and games for those aged over 12 - has been growing, particularly as adults buy toys for themselves.Melissa Symonds says toys are offering some light relief to peopleThe Toy Retailers Association, which represents sellers, has launched the latest of its annual DreamToys series, which lists what it anticipates to be some of the big sellers this Christmas.Some of this year's picks clearly target more than one generation.The Hot Wheels F1 racing circuit has a higher-priced set for older collectors, with more accurate livery on the cars.However, nostalgia also plays a part. Emma Bunce, from Pokemon, said that many parents collected the cards when they were children up to 30 years ago.They now wanted to introduce something similar to their own children, she said, while having some lighthearted relief from the world around them.The list includes an interactive dinosaur that breaks out of an egg, selling for £65, dolls from the stage and screen show Wicked, and a game in which players have to feed themselves mini marshmallows with tiny hands.The manufacturers of that game said it was deliberately analogue, with no batteries or internet connectivity required. However, they are encouraging players to post videos of the game on social media - an example of the line the toy industry is navigating between physical and online play.Price is another issue for parents, many of whom are still struggling with the cost of living. Ms Symonds said that the average price of a toy last December was £13.43, with the £10 to £20 price range the most dominant in the sector.Overall, annual sales in the UK toy sector have reached nearly £4bn, she said.",

    "body": "8 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseA US naval strike force centred around the world's largest warship, the USS Gerald R Ford, has arrived in the Caribbean, the US Navy has confirmed. The arrival of the strike group, which was ordered to the region by President Donald Trump last month, comes amid ongoing strikes against alleged drug boats and tensions with Venezuela. The US has so far carried out at least 19 strikes against boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, killing at least 76 people. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials have accused the US of \"fabricating\" a crisis and seeking to topple the country's left-wing socialist government. The aircraft carrier movement also comes amid tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro, whom Trump has characterised as \"a thug and a bad guy\".Petro on Tuesday ordered his country's public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US agencies until the boat attacks in the Caribbean stop.He wrote on X that the fight against drugs \"must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".In a statement, the US Navy said that the strike group entered the area of responsibility of US Southern Command - which oversees Latin America and the Caribbean - on 11 November. The force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which itself includes more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of aircraft. The strike force also includes guided-missile destroyers and various other vessels. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that the force will \"bolster US capacity to detect, monitor and disrupt illicit actors and activities that disrupt the safety and prosperity\" of the US and will help \"disrupt narcotics trafficking\" and criminal groups in the region. The carrier group is joining substantial military forces already deployed in the region, including thousands of troops, a nuclear-powered submarine and military aircraft based in Puerto Rico. Collectively, they form the largest US presence arrayed in and around Latin America in decades. The US has continued to launch strikes on alleged drug boats in the region. The Trump administration says the attacks are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US. Earlier this week, the US announced it had conducted two additional strikes in the Pacific, killing six people. In addition to fueling tensions with the governments of Colombia and Venezuela, the strikes have led to concerns from some observers about violations of human rights and due process. Colombia's Petro has also faced criticism as well as US sanctions over his reluctant response to drug-trafficking groups. On Tuesday, Colombia's military officers revealed that they had launched their own deadly airstrikes against a drug-running guerrilla group in the Amazon region, killing 19, AFP reported.Earlier in November, Trump downplayed suggestions he was planning to topple the Venezuelan government or start a war. In an interview with CBS - the BBC's US news partner - Trump said that \"every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\" ",

    "body": "7 hours agoA wider mix of stories pepper Wednesday's front pages but the Daily Telegraph continues to cover the fallout of the BBC story it broke last week. It leads with a picture of what it calls a \"defiant\" Tim Davie after the outgoing director general defended the broadcaster during his first address to staff following his resignation. The paper reports that Davie called the BBC \"the very best of society\" and blamed \"enemies\" of the corporation for stoking allegations of bias.\"We must fight for our journalism\" is the Independent's headline as it reports on Davie's rallying speech to staff. The BBC director general admitted the broadcaster made \"mistakes that have cost us\", but warned about the \"weaponisation\" of criticisms of organisation, the paper says. Also front and centre is a photo of Catherine leading tributes to fallen heroes on Armistice Day. The Princess of Wales is seen wearing a wide-brimmed hat adored with a black bow and two poppies pinned on her lapel.Catherine's all-black ensemble for Armistice Day also claims the top picture slot in the Guardian. Alongside, the paper shifts its focus to fears of a leadership challenge at No 10. It reports that Downing Street has moved to protect Sir Keir Starmer from possible attempts to oust him after the Budget later this month, based on the party's tanking numbers in the opinion polls. Senior political aides have warned any leadership challenge would be \"reckless\" and \"dangerous\", the Guardian says.\"Starmer vows to defend leadership from 'feral' Labour MPs\" is the Times' take. The paper cites allies of the prime minister who say he will not resign and will contest any leadership race prompted by his MPs. Elsewhere, new figures show the number of people claiming universal credit in Britain who are not required to work has risen by more than a million in a year.That figure means four million people are claiming benefits without having to look for work, the Daily Express says. The paper quotes Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch who accuses the PM of being \"too weak\" to tackle the welfare crisis.In more turmoil for the Labour government, the Daily Mail says \"1,000 jobs a day\" are being lost under Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The paper reports that Reeves is being blamed for triggering a \"jobs bloodbath\" as the overall unemployment rate hit 5% for the first time since the Covid pandemic. The Mail dubs it \"another day in Starmer's socialist paradise\".\"Unemployment increase deals fresh blow to Reeves\" echoes the Financial Times. The rise in jobless rates means payroll employment has fallen by 180,000 since the chancellor announced higher employer national insurance rates in last year's Budget, the paper reports.In other news, the i Paper signals \"fresh hope\" for women affected by changes to the state pension age. The paper says the government is reconsidering a previous decision to reject compensation those caught up in the scheme, with campaigners from Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) hailing the move as a \"major step forward\".Metro splashes on the story of a \"£5bn crypto queen jailed\". A woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, has been sentenced to more than 11 years in jail.A \"shake up\" to the hit ITV show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! provides the lead for the Sun as it gears up for a new season. The paper reports that new rules will see contestants take on only two bushtucker trials in a row before being exempt from the public vote. Its story explains that this move will foil the almost-annual tradition in which viewers \"gang up\" on a particular celebrity and vote for them to do the gruesome challenges night after night.\"Jungle Commando\" headlines the Daily Star's coverage of the new series as it reveals that one of the contestants, YouTube sensation Morgan Burtwistle, better known as Angry Ginge,  has forgotten to pack any underwear for his trip to Australia. That means he will be wearing \"No pants & kecks Down Under\".Finally, the Daily Mirror reports that the mother of murdered teenager Harvey Willgoose says she would like to meet her son's killer. The paper features Harvey's mum Caroline saying: \"At the end of the day, both of them have been let down.\"Fears within Downing Street of a possible coup against the prime minister are highlighted by the Guardian, which says No 10 has launched an \"extraordinary operation\" to protect Sir Keir Starmer. Cabinet ministers are described as interpreting the intervention as a \"stop Wes\" strategy following reports that the health secretary, Wes Streeting, has 50 frontbenchers willing to stand down if the Budget lands badly and the prime minister refuses to resign.The Times says Sir Keir has told ministers that any attempted coup would destabilise Britain's standing on the financial markets and its relationship with foreign governments.Yesterday's economic data is picked over by a number of papers.  The Financial Times suggests the rise in unemployment - to 5% - has dealt a \"fresh blow\" to the chancellor ahead of what it calls a \"crunch\" Budget.The Daily Mail says Rachel Reeves has been blamed for presiding over a \"jobs bloodbath\" after raising employers' National Insurance contributions last year. And the Daily Express says the Conservatives have accused the government of being \"too weak\" to tackle the welfare bill, after figures revealed four million people are claiming benefits without having to look for work.The Daily Telegraph says the BBC's outgoing director general, Tim Davie, has issued a \"full-mouthed defence\" of the corporation, in his first public comments since announcing his resignation.It reports that Davie blamed \"enemies\" of the BBC for stoking allegations of bias and declared the broadcaster \"the very best of society\" in a speech the paper says \"alarmed those demanding root-and-branch changes\" to the corporation.The mother of a 15-year-old boy who was stabbed to death by a former friend at their school in Sheffield has told the Daily Mirror she wants to meet her son's killer.Mohammed Umar Khan has been detained for at least 16 years for murdering Harvey Willgoose in February.  Caroline Willgoose says she hopes Khan's apparent lack of remorse \"is the mask of a teenager going through hell\" and she believes he's \"been let down too\". The Mirror applauds her willingness to consider restorative justice, arguing \"compassion is not a form of weakness\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "39 minutes agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentPA MediaThousands of NHS staff redundancies in England will now go ahead after a deal was reached with the Treasury to allow the health service to overspend this year to cover the cost of pay-offs.The government said earlier this year 18,000 admin and managerial jobs would go with NHS England, the body that runs the NHS, being brought into the Department of Health and Social Care alongside cuts to local health boards.NHS bosses and health ministers had been in talks with the Treasury over how to pay for the £1bn one-off bill with the health service wanting extra money.The Treasury blocked that, but the BBC understands a compromise has been reached with the NHS permitted to overspend this year. 'Pragmatic step'As the job cuts result in savings in future years, the NHS will be expected to recoup the costs further down the line.Overall, government sources said no extra money is going into the NHS beyond what was agreed at the spending review this year – an extra £29bn a year above inflation by 2028-29.In a speech to health managers at the NHS Providers' conference in Manchester on Wednesday, Health Secretary Wes Streeting is expected to say: \"I want to reassure taxpayers that every penny they are being asked to pay will be spent wisely.\"We're now pushing down on the accelerator and slashing unnecessary bureaucracy, to reinvest the savings in front-line care.\"It won't happen overnight, but with our investment and modernisation, we will rebuild our NHS so it is there for you when you need it once again.\"According to the government, the reforms will raise £1bn a year by the end of the parliament to improve services for patients.It said every £1bn saved in bureaucracy costs is enough to fund an extra 116,000 hip and knee operations.NHS England is expected to be brought back into the Department of Health within two years, while the cuts to integrated care boards (ICBs), which plan health services for individual regions, will reduce their headcounts by 50%.NHS Providers' chief executive Daniel Elkeles said: \"This is a pragmatic step that means planned redundancies can now go ahead.\"It reflects the flexibility of a three-year settlement, allowing some funding to be brought forward in order to generate future savings to go into front-line care.\"However, we must recognise the position of staff affected by these changes - people who have offered commitment and service to the NHS - who face a very uncertain future.\"But Patricia Marquis of the Royal College of Nursing warned the redundancies could backfire.\"Front-line services need more investment, but to do this off the backs of making thousands of experts redundant is a false economy. \"Expert registered nurses working across NHS England and ICBs don't just run vital public health programmes and oversee care programmes for the vulnerable – they connect the NHS and social care services with one another. \"To imply these are administrators shows a complete lack of understanding of their roles and how they contribute to patient care.\"NHS England was created as part of the 2012 reforms introduced under former Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley.The idea was to free the health service from political meddling – with ministers instead setting the wider strategy, but stepping back from getting involved on a daily basis.But Lansley's predecessor as health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said recently NHS England had ended up a \"bureaucratic monster\" that stifles innovation with reports some organisations were at times filling out 250 forms a month just to satisfy both NHS England and the health department.And on the front line one of the most common complaints is that NHS England was incredibly controlling, even requesting individual NHS trusts ask for permission for something as mundane as granting media interviews.But make no mistake, this is also about control. Ministers have argued it is only right that a democratically-elected government was in charge of day-to-day running of the health service.But given Labour, in opposition, was critical of the Tories messing around with NHS structures, embarking on its own reorganisation comes with significant risk.Those working in the health service already talk about the disruption and distraction these changes are causing - and given NHS England oversees the day-to-day running out the health service, organises some specialist services and has a role in training and digital innovation, it is not difficult to see why there are some serious concerns about the reforms.",

    "body": "5 hours agoGeorgina Rannard,Climate reporter, Belém, Brazil and Tabby WilsonWatch: Protesters clash with security at COP30 venue in BrazilProtesters carrying signs reading \"our forests are not for sale\" broke through security lines of the COP30 climate talks on Tuesday night in Belém, Brazil.BBC journalists saw United Nations security staff running behind a line of Brazilian soldiers shouting at delegates to immediately leave the venue.The UN told BBC News that the incident caused minor injuries to two security staff, in addition to limited damage to the venue.Social media videos showed protesters that appeared to be from indigenous groups and others waving flags with the logo of a left-wing Brazilian youth movement called Juntos.Protesters, some wearing what appeared to be traditional indigenous dress, stormed the COP30 entrance, chanting and kicking down doors, before tussling with security personnel, videos posted online showed. Demonstrators crossed the first security barriers of the venue and were then prevented from getting further in, the UN told the BBC. A security guard said he was hit in the head by a drum thrown by a protester, according to the Reuters news agency.It is a highly unusual security breach at a conference that has strict protocols.Brazilian and UN authorities are investigating the incident, according to the UN.ReutersDelegates from almost 200 countries are attending COP30 talks, which officially runs from Monday 10 November to Friday 21 November.This year's gathering takes place ten years after the Paris climate agreement, in which countries pledged to try to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C.It is the first time the conference is being held in Brazil, with the talks taking place in Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. The location has proved a controversial decision for a number of reasons, in part due to the Amazon's residents, many of whom are vocal critics of the environmental damage caused to their home by climate change and deforestation.Brazil has also continued to grant new licences for oil and gas which, alongside coal, are fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming.An indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community told Reuters, \"we can't eat money,\" and that they were upset about development in the rainforest.\"We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers,\" he said.The meetings this year have been dubbed \"the Indigenous peoples COP\", with Brazilian organisers promising to put indigenous people at the centre of the talks.  Brazil's Minister of Indigenous Peoples Sonia Guajajara hailed COP30 as \"historic\" event, and estimated that 3,000 Indigenous peoples from around the world would be in attendance.A UN report released earlier this year said that Indigenous people safeguard 80% of the planet's remaining biodiversity – yet receive less than one per cent of international climate funding.Indigenous peoples are disproportionately impacted by climate change due to their dependence on the natural environment and its resources.Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told the opening of the summit that the world must \"defeat\" climate denialism and fight fake news.He said that the decision to hold COP30 in Belém was designed to show that the Amazon is an essential part of the climate solution, adding that \"COP30 will be the COP of truth\" in an era of \"misrepresentation\" and \"rejection of scientific evidence\".According to the president, the \"most diverse biome on Earth\" is home to nearly 50 million people, including 400 Indigenous groups.

    "body": "The Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have ordered female patients, caretakers and staff to wear a burka – a full Islamic veil - to enter public health facilities in the western city of Herat, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) says.MSF said the restrictions came into effect from 5 November.\"These restrictions further impede women's lives and limit women's access to health care,\" Sarah Chateau, the agency's programme manager in Afghanistan, told the BBC. She said even those \"in need of urgent medical care\" had been affected.A spokesman for the Taliban government has denied MSF's account. Reports say restrictions have been partially relaxed since the alarm was raised.MSF, which supports paediatric services at Herat Regional Hospital, said it had observed a 28% drop in admissions of patients whose conditions were urgent during the first few days of the new enforcement.Ms Chateau said Taliban members had been denying entry to women without the burka by standing at the entrance of the health facilities. A burka is a one-piece veil that covers the face and body, often leaving just a mesh screen to see through.A Taliban spokesperson for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry, which enforces strict religious doctrines, dismissed reports that women were being forced to wear the burka.\"This is totally false. The position of the vice and virtue ministry is generally on the wearing of hijab,\" Saif-ul-Islam Khyber said.Hijab means covering up generally but also describes the headscarves worn by Muslim women.  The Taliban official also rejected reports that women were banned from medical centres for not wearing the burka.At the same time, the Taliban official said: \"Hijab is interpreted differently in different parts of the country, most of which are in conflict with Sharia [law].\"Activists have also alleged that Taliban guards have been enforcing the wearing of burkas for women to enter key facilities for the past week.One female activist from Herat province told the BBC that the dress code was applicable for those who want to enter hospitals, schools and government offices.There has also been criticism on social media over the Taliban's reported decision to impose the burka in Herat.An Afghan activist posted a video on X showing some women setting fire to the garments in protest at the Taliban's rule. The BBC has not independently verified the video.The Taliban enforced the burka during their first stint in power in the 1990s.Since seizing power in August 2021, the Taliban government has imposed numerous restrictions, particularly for women, in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.In 2022, the Taliban issued a decree ordering women to wear an all-covering Islamic face veil in public.  Taliban officials then described the face veil edict as \"advice\".\"Even though the veil edit was announced earlier, this is the first time we are seeing the enforcement of the burka in Herat. In the past few days more and more women are coming to the hospital with burkas,\" Ms Chateau said.Since returning to power, the Taliban have barred women from most workplaces and universities and girls from secondary schools. The UN has repeatedly urged the Taliban to end what it describes as \"gender apartheid\".Last week, the UN said it had suspended operations at a key border crossing between Afghanistan and Iran because of restrictions on Afghan women staff working at the border.Islam Qala, in Herat province, has been the main crossing point for hundreds of thousands of Afghans forced to leave Iran in the past year.",

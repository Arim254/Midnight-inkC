    "body": "3 hours agoLaura KuenssbergSunday with Laura KuenssbergBBCIs there a boys' club in politics? I ask a smart, tough, very experienced woman who has worked at the highest level of government.\"Yes,\" comes the answer - without a second's hesitation. \"The end.\"Yes, many more women than ever have taken up perches on the green benches - but that's not the same as having access to the inner sanctum where decisions are made.Yes, there are many more women working at senior levels in Whitehall - and all the main parties have made big efforts to get more women into parliament. But that's not the same as being listened to.And yes, as part of Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to prop up his administration, three senior men have used the exit – the boss of the civil service, his chief of staff, and his head of communications, to be replaced, at least in part, by women.But this week, a serving member of the cabinet, Lisa Nandy, suggested Labour had been operating as a \"boys' club\" and went on to complain \"some of the briefings have absolutely been dripping with misogyny\".Don't just casually ignore one of Labour's most senior politicians suggesting - quite openly - that a clique of men have had too much sway in government, and some of them have used woman-hating as a political tool.But what is the \"boys' club\" and how big a problem is it for Sir Keir?\"Massive,\" says one minister.PA WireDeputy leader Lucy Powell is the second-highest ranking politician in the Labour PartyIt's more than 100 years since the first woman took her seat as an MP - there weren't even women's loos when Nancy Astor arrived. She's said to have nipped down to the Ritz to use the facilities before a ladies' toilet was installed in Parliament's neo-gothic palace.More than 100 years later, Rachel Reeves arrived in the Treasury in 2024 to find a urinal in the chancellor's bathroom - that shows how long it has taken for women to get access to all areas of politics.Loos aside, one former Labour minister tells me the so-called \"boys' club\" is a particular problem for Starmer because, \"You have a prime minister who is not very political, so he has had to rely very heavily on the network that he has - which is the boys' network. He has been unable to see the pitfalls or the issues or problems of it\".There was even, one cabinet minister says, a \"whole network of Matts\". Others have joked before about the \"boys in blue suits\", or the \"ladz\" (yes, with a z), a group whose hero was Morgan McSweeney, the departed chief of staff.But there have been plenty of women at senior levels in and around Starmer's operation – the home secretary Shabana Mahmood, the foreign secretary Yvette Cooper, the general secretary of the Labour Party Hollie Ridley, some of the press team, and, of course, his chancellor.ReutersLabour peer Harriet Harman is urging the prime minister to name a woman as his first secretary of stateOne insider and Starmer ally told me that \"boys' club\" perception is \"totally unfair on all the brilliant women\" who have been involved. Another senior figure said they were \"boiling with rage\" when that accusation had been chucked around.Yet senior sources suggest No 10 has sometimes made it difficult for the very senior female ministers to get \"face time\" with the prime minister – access is one of the most precious commodities in politics.There does, at least for now, seem a determination that things will change with a new interim female chief of staff and a female political director in post.\"It probably doesn't exist anymore – because a lot of the people that gave rise to some of that culture have gone now,\" says a cabinet minister.But they suggest the perception of the \"boys' club\" was also a shorthand for something else. \"It wasn't just a boys' club, it was a factional group as well\".One veteran Labour figure told me: \"Not only is there a boys' club, but the most important thing is that there are all these cliques and all these factions that just don't talk to each other - people get together and talk to people only in their bubble.\"That is what has led to so many mistakes, many of Starmer's internal critics say.ReutersMorgan McSweeney quit as chief of staff after mounting scrutiny over his role in Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK ambassador to the USHe relied on too small a group of advisers, who came from one, more hard-edged wing of the Labour Party, favoured by Morgan McSweeney, and stuck his fingers in his ears to a wider range of views – it was about one faction dominating, not the deliberate exclusion of females.One Whitehall insider who deals with Downing Street said: \"It means you're not getting the best people if you exclude anyone, for any reason. It's not woke, it's just making sure you get the best people when it comes to the government.\"There are promises the prime minister will listen to a wider range of views, more voices from different parts of the party. Some are trying, very obviously, to make sure they get more of a look in from now.At the start of the week, Ed Miliband said the prime minister had to be \"bold\" and he wanted to focus on class. On Thursday Angela Rayner said the government had to do more for the hospitality industry, and Lisa Nandy made her remarks about misogyny and the \"unforgivable\" turmoil in government.One senior Labour politician warns against any attempt to brush off women's concerns by saying it's all about warring factions, telling me: \"It's not good enough to just say it's because people oppose Keir or Morgan's agenda - that gives them an excuse to not do anything and that would be hopeless\".And after the last few weeks, there are specific calls from women in the Labour Party for an inquiry into the behaviour of the late Mohammed Al Fayed, and a woman to be given the cabinet post as first secretary of state.PA WireOthers are sceptical – suggesting plenty of MPs have tried, and been disappointed, for years to get the party leadership to look outside its own narrow group.One told me: \"We would say, 'Why don't you engage with women? Why wouldn't you engage with backbenchers?' They just looked utterly baffled  - he wouldn't engage.\"Let's see. Does Westminster have a wider problem when it comes to how women are treated?There are far too many examples of sleazy or improper behaviour, or harassment. It is still a late-night working culture where the line between what's social and what's professional can be blurred, and power swirls around along with the warm white wine.As an experienced former cabinet minister admits, \"if you are a junior female in Westminster you can still find yourself in uncomfortable situations\" - or, for that matter, a young male staffer too.But the atmosphere, and what is considered acceptable, has completely transformed in recent years.Leaving aside behaviour that is clearly improper, are there features of the way the system works that make it not, perhaps one big giant boys' club, but a place that's easier for men?PA WireLisa Nandy has been culture secretary since 2024Let's spare the blushes of the frontbencher who asked a senior female adviser to get him a cup of coffee during the milling around before cabinet. She told him to get his own. He was mortified minutes later when the prime minister of the day called on her to answer the first question during the meeting.Politics is certainly not the only business where old-fashioned assumptions are still made, women are paid less, or find it harder to progress and are sometimes overlooked.But as one former cabinet minister suggests, perhaps, \"it's not deliberate, but the culture is just so male. There are a lot of what you'd call male characteristics that are deemed to be what you need to get on: saying you have all the answers, briefing against people who aren't doing what you want\", referring specifically to a combative way of doing interviews where \"No 10 comms would be yelling at you for not pushing back, when it's just not the way women operate\".A hugely experienced female party activist suggests politics, fundamentally, is just more attractive to men, some of whom just see \"women are like blobs, the men just hang out together, and they like risk more than women do. It goes back to the days when they went off and killed tigers, and it is in our DNA to be more risk averse\".You might raise your eyebrows, but votes need to be won. That means rivals need to be beaten.One senior Labour figure describes it as \"gang warfare\", saying, \"you rely on people who have been in the trenches with you and been through battles and that means you are exclusive rather than inclusive\".\"Does that mean people you need in the room to make decisions are not there? Does that mean women? Yes, but that is life.\"ReutersAngela Rayner resigned as deputy prime minister and housing secretary after failing to pay enough tax on a flat in HoveThat remark might drive some people round the twist. Perhaps that is about as honest an admission about why things sometimes work the way they do in SW1 as you're going to get.And there is widespread agreement in Westminster that women are so often held to different standards than the men they sit alongside. That's not new.We are a long way since the first female prime minister made time to iron her husband's shirts, and be pictured doing it. But despite record representation of women, parity seems way off. Whether it's how they look, how they act, what they wear, the lens applied to women is different.A senior Labour figure accepts Angela Rayner made mistakes in her tax affairs, but suggests she's always been treated more harshly than a man would have been in her position.\"She does manoeuvre, but she is also uncompromising and lives her life, has never changed her accent. And some of the men can't cope with that.\"Another source points to how Starmer's new pick for cabinet secretary, Dame Antonia Romeo, has been briefed against and written about in acid terms in the last few days. It's like, \"How dare she be glamorous? All the bits they talk about - her ambition, in any man in those would be seen as strengths. But because it's her, it's used against her\". An investigation into one formal complaint against Romeo alleging bullying concluded there was no case to answer.\"The smears being thrown against her are reprehensible and hypocritical,\" Rupert McNeil, former head of HR at the Civil Service said recently.But does the notion of the \"boys' club\" really make a difference? In a narrow way, it does right now, because dismantling the perception of it, and listening to a wider range of his colleagues is one of the tasks Starmer's been set by his own MPs.It matters profoundly that one half of the population, the narrow majority after all, is fairly represented by the politicians we choose to serve us.And it matters too when it comes to having different perspectives in the rooms where decisions are taken.It's a matter of public record, from the second most senior civil servant in the country during the pandemic, that a lack of women in the room affected the decisions taken during an emergency.Helen McNamara, who spoke to us about the Covid inquiry on Newscast, said there'd been a lack of thought about childcare during school closures, how domestic violence victims could be trapped during lockdown, and too much attention paid to how it affected more male pursuits - hunting, shooting and fishing.Another source told me opening up car showrooms and golf courses was considered before thinking about kids' playgrounds.Before you scream, of course issues like childcare, education and domestic violence affect men, and not just women. Of course, neither men nor women all care about the same things. But one activist who has been around for many years relates: \"I'm still a woman in a man's world. I count every meeting - there are 45 men and five women. They never count, or say, 'Hang on, we need some women around to see their point of view.' They don't think about it\".The numbers aren't always so outrageously heavily skewed. There has been enormous progress in the numbers of female politicians, senior civil servants, and in other parts of public life too.But as another Whitehall insider suggests: \"The habits of Westminster were set when nearly all politicians were men, nearly all journalists were men, and nearly all civil servants were men\".And it was the decision to appoint Peter Mandelson that has prompted this bout of soul searching about women's role in government, with some convinced Starmer would simply never have got into this mess if he'd included women in the decision. One senior figure said: \"At the heart of that decision was misogyny – it required you to think that the Epstein victims were neither here nor there\".Men may no longer always be in such a majority, but perhaps old habits formed years ago, really do die hard. If Starmer really wants to change the perception, the pressure is on him to respond.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Alpine skiing: Men's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Switzerland's Marco Odermatt has claimed four successive World Cups in this event and is attempting to do something that not even greats like Marcel Hirscher and Hermann Maier could manage – back-to-back Olympic gold medals in giant slalom. The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian – Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 – so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held. Tabby Stoecker and Freya Tarbit sit fifth and sixth after the opening two runs, but may struggle to force themselves onto the podium.  Alpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.The first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

I have been shown private polling by both Labour and his own people which suggest that he would do well if an election was held now.\"He believes that in a crowded marketplace there is room for another party, on the right, which will pride itself on its independence of mind. \"He had hoped his local creation Great Yarmouth First would make its mark in this year's local elections, but they have been cancelled. This new party will aim to pick up national support.\"More related stories",

    "body": "4 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondent, reporting from MunichReutersThe US Secretary of State said America and Europe's destiny were closely linked during a closely watched address in MunichWorld leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have been gathering in Munich for Europe's biggest security and defence conference. The burning question on everyone's minds: is the US still an ally of Europe?The keynote speech that everyone was waiting for was from Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. Would he repeat the attacks made on Europe last year by the US Vice-President JD Vance? Or would he be conciliatory?The hall was packed to the rafters. Generals and admirals, bemedalled in their uniforms, prime ministers and presidents, diplomats, ambassadors, US Congressmen and women, European politicians and their Spads - all waiting nervously to hear what President Donald Trump's top diplomat had to say.The applause did not come straight away. In fact, for the first few minutes, as Rubio got into his stride, it began to sound very much like a repeat attack on Europe. Free trade, mass migration, green policies on climate change – all came in for sharp criticism. World leaders gather in Munich for high-level security talks - follow liveHe even talked about \"a climate cult\" that was harming America's economy, while he went on to slam the United Nations, saying it had failed to resolve the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. The US secretary of state, impeccably neat and groomed, stood with one hand casually in his trouser pocket, delivering this from a prepared script at a podium.But then he spoke the words everyone in the room wanted to hear: \"Our destiny will always be intertwined with yours (in Europe).\"\"The end of the transatlantic era,\" he went on to say, \"is neither our goal nor our wish... we will always be a child of Europe\".Rubio spoke of \"unshackling creativity\", of shared goals in securing supply chains for critical minerals, and of the European culture he so admired, a continent that had given the world Shakespeare, Mozart and the Rolling Stones (he got a muffled laugh for that). But there was a sting in the tail. What we have together, he said, was unique and \"we in the US have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline\".So what did people make of this? It was broadly positive – about half the audience stood up at the end to applaud him. There was certainly a palpable sense of relief that after all the upsets of the last few months, with tariffs and the threat of a US grab for Greenland, the transatlantic alliance was not dead.\"It was a good speech,\" Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, told me afterwards. \"I think the Europeans sighed with relief because it was saying that Europe is important, that Europe and America are very intertwined and good allies, and have been for so long and will be in the future.\"She did not deny, though, that there remain real differences in policy in some areas between Washington and Europe. And while both sides agree that Europe needs to shoulder much more of the burden for its own defence, I have encountered some quiet exasperation here in Munich at Trump's refusal to put enough pressure on Russia to end the Ukraine war, that is poised to enter its fifth, bloody year.",

    "body": "3 days agoSonia KatariaLeicesterTyler BartlamAdam Ernest Pickard wisecracked his way to the 2026 title on MondayA university student has been crowned UK pun champion after serving up gags about King Henry VIII and takeaway pizza at the Leicester Comedy Festival. Adam Ernest Pickard beat seven other comedians in the jokey battle royale at De Montfort Hall on Monday to claim the 2026 title.The 22-year-old Master's student said the UK Pun Championships show, which was hosted by comedian Jason Byrne and involved comics competing in a boxing ring, was the biggest of his career so far.\"It's just very overwhelming, but very exciting as well,\" he said.Pickard got the audience laughing with his wisecrack: \"The song Greensleeves was composed by Henry VIII. I'd play some of it here, but it's not royalty-free.\"He also quipped: \"I've compiled everyone who works at my local takeaway pizza place into a book. It's my Domino's Who's Who.\"Another gag went: \"Only women can use the herbal dumbbells. Thyme weights for no man.\"'Always loved comedy'Pickard said he thought winning the award was a \"very elaborate prank\". \"I'm very overwhelmed,\" he said. \"It's the biggest gig I've ever done and I'm very pleased that there is a competition for something that I'm good at.\"It's a skill I've always liked, rushing puns. It's something I've always been good at.\"I've always loved comedy. One of the first comedians I really loved was Tim Vine, who of course is the pun master.\"I'd like to be part of the comedy world, and hopefully this is a stepping stone to get there.\"Tyler BartlamThe 22-year-old visited Leicester for the first time for the gigPickard, who lives in Norwich while completing a Master's degree in scriptwriting, said he visited Leicester for the first time for the gig. \"It's a really great place to have a comedy festival. You get a lot of very interesting shows here,\" he said. \"I really wish I could have stayed longer than I did.\"The festival, now in its 33rd year, comprises 700 shows across 76 venues in Leicester and Leicestershire.It features known comedians including actor and writer Sir Stephen Fry and Sue Perkins, and up-and-coming talent.Michael Harris-Wakelam, chief executive of Big Difference Company - the charity behind the festival - said: \"The skill on display this year was outstanding. \"This event is a flagship of our festivals programme and celebrates and champions the art involved in great word play. \"Congratulations to all involved and to our worthy winner.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "22 minutes agoAdam GoldsmithandTom McArthurGetty ImagesRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin, the UK and European allies have said.Two years on from the death of Navalny at a Siberian penal colony, Britain and its allies have blamed the Kremlin following analysis of material samples found on his body.There is no innocent explanation for the toxin, called epibatidine, being found in samples taken from Navalny's body, the UK Foreign Office said.Speaking from the Munich Security Conference, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"Only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin against Alexei Navalny during his imprisonment in Russia.\"While Cooper announced the findings, a joint statement was issued by the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.Cooper met with Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya at the conference this weekend.\"Russia saw Navalny as a threat,\" Cooper said at the event.\"By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition,\" she added.In the statement the allies said: \"Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.\"Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia.\"There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny's body.\"The Foreign Office said the UK has informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of Russia's alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Praising Navalny's \"huge courage\", UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"his determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy\".\"I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin's murderous intent,\" he added.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot also said his country \"pays tribute\" to Navalny, who he suggested was \"killed for his fight in favour of a free and democratic Russia\".Navalny – an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's most vociferous opposition leader - died suddenly in jail on 16 February 2024 at the age of 47.In 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.German Federal Foreign Office via Getty ImagesNavalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently claimed that her husband was poisoned by RussiaBefore Saturday's announcement, Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently argued that her husband was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024.She did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results.Reacting to the announcement, Navalnaya said: \"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof.\"I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,\" she added.The Kremlin has not commented on the allegations.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to the penal colony.According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk at his Siberian penal colony, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.Speaking to BBC Russian, toxicology expert Jill Johnson said epibatidine was \"200 times more potent than morphine\". By acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause \"muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death,\" she said.The extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in one wild frog species in tiny quantities, and only when the frog eats a specific diet, Johnson said, describing it as an \"incredibly rare way to poison a person\".She said: \"Finding the wild frog in the correct location that is eating the specific diet to create the correct alkaloids is almost impossible...almost.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoMadeline HalpertandSakshi VenkatramanGetty ImagesJames Van Der Beek kept working after being diagnosed with cancerActor James Van Der Beek seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s and 2000s. With the title role in coming-of-age teen drama Dawson's Creek, he walked some of the industry's hottest red carpets, and his face plastered magazine covers - one even dubbing him a \"new superstar\".But when tragedy struck later in life, his family needed to rely on the kindness of his friends - and fans - for financial help, shedding light on the precarious situation of not just many actors, no matter how famous, but millions of everyday Americans struggling with medical bills.Van Der Beek - who had six children with his wife - died on Wednesday at the age of 48 after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer three years ago.The cost of his medical treatments were so financially draining, his wife says, that she has now made a public plea for donations so they would not lose their home. They have raised $2.3m (£1.7m) thus far.Getty ImagesJames Van Der Beek auctioned off the shirt he wore in this promotional stillIn the months before his death, Van Der Beek had shared how cash-strapped the cancer treatments had left him and his family. He even publicly auctioned off items he'd saved for decades from the roles that defined his career: a tartan buttoned shirt he wore in the first episode of Dawson's Creek, a necklace he gave to Katie Holmes' character on the teen drama series and sports shoes he wore when he starred in the 1999 film Varsity Blues.\"I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now,\" Van Der Beek told People magazine last November.On top of the costly treatments, Van Der Beek was not making the same cash that he'd seen in the prime of his career decades ago. He had said he was paid \"almost nothing\" for Dawson's Creek and his contract didn't include residuals - payments writers, actors and directors receive when their work is re-aired on television. Actors on other still-popular shows from that same period, like Friends, are said to make about $20m annually from such payments.\"There was no residual money,\" Van Der Beek told Today in 2012. \"I was 20. It was a bad contract. I saw almost nothing from that.\"He continued working after his diagnosis, appearing in two episodes of the television show Overcompensating in 2025, but it's unclear whether that was enough to qualify him for health insurance from the prominent actors' union in Hollywood. Actors can qualify for health insurance through Sag-Aftra only if they work 108 days a year or earn at least $28,090 on union shoots. The BBC has contacted the union.Van Der Beek is not the first high-profile US actor to highlight the issue. Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannen Doherty, who died in 2024, said she did not have insurance when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer.Getty ImagesVan Der Beek and his Dawson's Creek co-stars pictured in 1997Benjamin Byron Davis, 53, an actor who has appeared on television shows as well as in movies like Marvel's Ant-Man, told the BBC that decreased residuals had become a problem for actors across the board.\"Revenue streams that actors have depended upon have disappeared,\" he said, noting that the rise of streaming has affected how production companies compensate performers. He said many actors depend on these payments both for income and to qualify for health insurance through their union Sag-Aftra. \"I work when I'm hired and I survive when I'm not.\"Davis said he lost his health insurance during the 2023 Sag-Aftra strikes. \"There wasn't work,\" he said, adding that he ended up getting it back when the strikes were over and he was able to meet the qualifications again.Davis said that, just 10 years ago, the union's minimum earnings for health insurance was a third of what it is now, at a level today that is out of reach for the vast majority of actors.Those who are covered by the union plan get good health coverage, said Valerie Yaros, an archivist with Sag-Aftra.But it was possible Van Der Beek no longer received the union plan because of his fewer work hours, she added.In 2024, Van Der Beek told People that it had become a \"full-time job\" dealing with cancer treatment appointments and his insurance.A heated debate on health insuranceHis death put a new celebrity face on the debate about rising healthcare costs in the US - an issue that Republicans and Democrats have long recognised needs reform but have disagreed on the best ways to resolve the problem.The US has one of the most expensive health systems in the world, with spending on health care estimated to reach $5.9tn in 2026, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.About 100 million people in the US are estimated to struggle to pay off their medical and dental healthcare debt, according to recent data.The GoFundMe page posted online on Wednesday solicited donations to assist Van Der Beek's widow Kimberley and their six children, whose ages range from four to 15.His wife shared the page, which noted the \"significant financial strain\" the family had seen as they \"did everything possible to support James and provide for his care\".\"In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. The costs of James's medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,\" the page reads. \"They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time.\"Even with health insurance, cancer treatment can prove extremely costly for those in the US. Some studies suggest the average monthly cost of chemotherapy can range from $1,000 to $12,000.This is because in the US private healthcare system, even those with insurance can face high deductibles and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, said Eva Stahl, the vice-president of policy at Undue Medical Debt, a non-profit that has paid off about $25bn of medical debt for almost 15 million people.\"People simply can't afford vital, life-saving treatments without going into debt,\" she said. \"When even someone with James Van Der Beek's resources has no option but to fundraise for treatment, it's clear how fundamentally unfair our healthcare system is.\"Michael Short, a graphic artist in Tennessee who has had his own battles with medical debt, told the BBC that his sister has had to declare bankruptcy because of medical debt for treatments for her endometrial and another cancer, even with insurance coverage.\"It's in the hundreds of thousands if not millions for these cancer treatments,\" he said. \"The prices on these medications and on these treatments are just so high.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "4 hours agoGetty ImagesScottish craft beer giant Brewdog could be sold off after bosses called in financial experts to look for new investors.Consultants AlixPartners have been brought in to oversee the sales process which could lead to the businesses being broken up.Brewdog, which was founded by friends James Watt and Martin Dickie in 2007, has breweries and pubs around the globe, including about 60 in the the UK.The company said it had taken the decision after \"operating in a challenging economic climate\" in order to focus on the \"long-term strength and sustainably\" of the company.A spokesperson for Brewdog said: \"Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business.\"This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the Brewdog brand and its operations.\"The spokesperson added they expect to attract \"substantial interest\" and breweries and bars will continue to operate as normal.AlixPartners refused to comment on the sales process.In an email to staff, which has been seen by BBC Scotland News, Brewdog said: \"AlixPartners are specialists in business performance and transformation, and they will work alongside the leadership team in the coming weeks to evaluate options and make recommendations, including assessing the next phase of investment in the business.\"It is important to stress this is a normal and prudent step, and no decisions have been made. This does not change our day-to-day operations, our roles or our immediate plans. Our bars and breweries continue to operate as normal, and our focus remains on brewing world-class beer, serving our customers brilliantly and supporting our teams.\"Last month, the company halted production of gin and vodka brands at its distillery in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, in order to \"sharpen\" the businesses focus.Earlier in the year it announced the closure of 10 bars across the UK, including its flagship pub in Aberdeen.The company currently employs around 1,400 people and has breweries in Ellon as well as in the US, Australia and Germany.In recent years it has made headlines for its marketing campaigns and workplace culture.In 2024, the firm faced a backlash after revealing it would no longer hire new staff on the real living wage, instead paying the lower legal minimum wage.Watt later stood down as chief executive officer and moved to a newly-created position of \"captain and co-founder\".",

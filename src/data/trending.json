    "body": "4 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterJeff Overs/BBCGreen Party leader Zack Polanski has defended his party's proposals for a wealth tax as \"tackling the deep inequality in our society\".He told the BBC that at a time when people are \"really struggling\" it was right to focus on the \"super wealthy\".In its general election manifesto last year, the Green Party of England and Wales proposed an annual tax of 1% on assets above £10m and 2% on assets above £1bn.Critics of the idea have said such a tax would penalise savings and investment, while arguing it could encourage wealthy individuals to leave the country.In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Polanski suggested a wealth tax could raise between £15bn and £25bn a year.Challenged that other countries which have implemented similar proposals have found they raised much smaller sums, he said: \"Whatever you're going to create from a wealth tax, it's ultimately about reducing inequality. \"This isn't about creating public investment, we can do that anyway, we don't need to tax the wealthy to do that. This is ultimately about tackling the deep inequality in our society.\"However, he admitted the idea was not even \"close to a panacea\" and said capital gains tax - which is charged on profits made from the sale of an asset such as a second home or shares - also needed to brought in line with income tax.\"We need to tax unearned wealth as much as we tax earned income,\" he added.Pressed over whether lower and middle-income earners would also have to contribute more for better public services, Polanski insisted the focus at the moment should be on the wealthiest.But he added: \"Once we start to move to a better footing as a society, where we have better public infrastructure and services, then I think it is legitimate to say paying tax is something that's actually patriotic, we should be proud of contributing to this country, to making sure we have an NHS that works, that we have public transport that works.\"And, yes, everyone will have to pay for that, but ultimately this is about where is the biggest burden, and that should be on the people with the broadest shoulders.\"Polanski was also asked about his position on Nato, after previously suggesting the UK should leave the military alliance.He told the BBC he did not support withdrawing from Nato \"immediately\" as \"the world is in political turmoil, and we need to make sure our country is defended\".However, he added: \"Once we've created an alternative alliance with our European neighbours, we should absolutely be looking at a different way that is focused on peace and diplomacy, rather than on nuclear weapons.\"Polanski was elected as leader of the Green Party of England and Wales last month, beating his opponents, MPs Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, by a huge margin.He campaigned on a platform of \"eco-populism\", arguing the party needed to be bolder and more radical in its approach.The party says its membership has surged by 80% since he took over as leader and now stands at more than 126,000.Polanski said the figures reflected \"growing public frustration with the political status quo and a hunger for genuine alternatives\".The party - which won a record four MPs at last year's general election - claims its membership has now overtaken the Conservatives.The Conservatives do not routinely publish their membership figures. Some 131,680 members were eligible to vote in last year's Tory leadership election but reports suggest the party's membership has fallen to around 123,000 since then.Labour, which is the largest political party in the UK on current publicly available figures, has seen its membership drop to 333,235 at the end of last year.Reform UK did not give a figure for membership in its annual accounts last year, but a ticker on its website says it has more than 260,000 members.Meanwhile, the number of Liberal Democrat members has almost halved in the last five years to 60,000.",

    "body": "6 hours agoRachel HaganEPAThe Taliban has accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks on the Afghan capital KabulPakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government have agreed to an \"immediate ceasefire\" after more than a week of deadly fighting.The foreign ministry of Qatar, which mediated talks alongside Turkey, said both sides had agreed to establish \"mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability\".Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said ending \"hostile actions\" was \"important\", while Pakistan's foreign minister called the agreement the \"first step in the right direction\".Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy casualties during the clashes, the worst fighting since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.Islamabad has long accused the Taliban of harbouring armed groups which carry out attacks in Pakistan, which it denies. Clashes intensified along the 1,600-mile mountainous border the two countries share after the Taliban accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks on the Afghan capital Kabul.Rumours had circulated the blasts in Kabul were a targeted attack on Noor Wali Mehsud, the leader of Pakistan Taliban. In response, the group released an unverified voice note from Mehsud saying he was still alive.In the days that followed, Afghan troops fired on Pakistani border posts, prompting Pakistan to respond with mortar fire and drone strikes.At least three dozen Afghan civilians have been killed and hundreds more wounded, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said on Thursday.A temporary truce was declared on Wednesday night as delegations met in Doha, but cross-border strikes continued.On Friday, the Taliban said Pakistan had carried out an air strike which killed eight, including three local cricket players.Under the new agreement, the Taliban said it would not \"support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan\", while both sides agreed to refrain from targeting each other's security forces, civilians or critical infrastructure.Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said the latest ceasefire meant \"terrorism from Afghanistan on Pakistan's soil will be stopped immediately\", with the two sides set to meet in Istanbul for further talks next week. Pakistan was a major backer of the Taliban after its ouster in 2001 following a US-led invasion. But relations deteriorated after Islamabad accused the group of providing a safe haven to the Pakistan Taliban, which has launched an armed insurgence against government forces.The group has carried out at least 600 attacks on Pakistani forces over the last year, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.",

    "body": "George Santos is done with politics for now - instead, he wants to use his newfound freedom to make prisons more humane, he told The Washington Post. The disgraced Republican US Representative from New York was released from prison on Friday after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. \"There is nothing more that I want to do than to focus and dedicate my entire life to prison reform,\" Santos said in a Saturday interview with the Post. Santos, who was booted from Congress in 2023 after a damning ethics report, told the Post that his experience in federal prison was \"dehumanising\" and \"humbling\".Santos had admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported.He embellished much about his biography in the run-up to his election to Congress in 2022.In the 84 days he served in prison, Santos wrote a handful of columns published on The South Shore Press' website. He has described the prison system as \"broken\" with \"rotting facilities, and administrators who seem incapable or unwilling to correct it\". He said a gaping hole in the ceiling exposed \"thick black mold\" underneath, and that broken air conditioning forced prisoners to endure sweltering heat.  \"The building itself is hardly fit for long-term habitation: sheet metal walls, shoddy construction, the look and feel of a temporary warehouse rather than a permanent facility,\" Santos wrote.Santos told the Post that he spoke with Trump on Saturday and informed the president of his mission to get involved in prison reform and to \"help his administration achieve that in whichever way I can\".It's not clear how exactly Santos intends to work on prison reform, and his lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC.Santos told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday that he's not interested in running for office again just yet, at least for the next decade.\"I'm all politicked out,\" he told Bash. The Bureau of Prisons responded to a request for comment from BBC saying that it could not answer media inquiries due to the ongoing government shutdown. A contact for the prison Santos was held in, FCI Fairton in New Jersey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Santos' allegations of poor conditions and mistreatment. ",

    "body": "World of cricket's farewell to umpire Dickie Bird5 hours agoGrace Wood & Adam LaverYorkshirePA MediaDickie Bird's funeral cortege passes the umpire's statue in BarnsleyCricketing stars from Yorkshire and beyond were among the mourners who gathered to say farewell to legendary umpire Dickie Bird at his funeral earlier.The Barnsley-born son of a miner was 92 when he died \"peacefully at home\" on 22 September, according to Yorkshire County Cricket Club.The service at St Mary's Church in Barnsley was attended by former England cricketers Sir Geoffrey Boycott and Michael Vaughan and was followed by a private family-only cremation and a wake at the town hall.Well-wishers gathered at the statue of Bird on Church Lane where the funeral procession paused for a moment of reflection.Anthony Devlin/PA WireDickie Bird died on 22 September aged 92The invited guests also included Yorkshire chair Colin Graves and former director of cricket Martyn Moxon, the sports commentator John Helm and the ex-sports minister Richard Caborn.Sir Geoffrey and Graves both gave eulogies and a poem by local poet Ian McMillan was read out.Sir Geoffrey made sure the colourful character of his friend of almost 70 years shined through.\"I first met Dickie Bird when I was 15, at the time I was playing cricket for Hemsworth Grammar School,\" Sir Geoffrey said to a packed church.\"He called me Gerald for years.\"He added: \"Surprisingly with all the nerves he had as a batsman, he became a great umpire because he could channel all that nervous energy into good decisions.\"Dickie was refreshingly different. Eccentric but fair. It would be hard to find anyone who didn't like him.\"PA MediaSir Geoffery Boycott paid tribute to his old friend Dickie BirdBird officiated in 66 Tests and 76 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals, between 1973 and 1996.He began as a player, batting for Yorkshire and Leicestershire before an injury cut short his career in 1964.Bird was awarded an MBE in 1986, an OBE in 2012 and the Freedom of Barnsley in 2000.In 2009 he was immortalised by a statue in Barnsley that depicted him raising his index finger to indicate a batsman was out.At Yorkshire's home ground, Headingley, he paid for a balcony outside the dressing room for the players to sit and watch the game. Both the balcony and a clock at the ground bear his name.ReutersDickie Bird retired as an umpire at the age of 65 after a career spanning 30 yearsFormer England and Yorkshire cricketer Ryan Sidebottom said Bird was so committed to Yorkshire cricket that he would be on the pitch even for county matches he wasn't umpiring.He said: \"He'd be out looking at the wicket and wandering around. But it looked like he'd just come in from a night out, like an 1980s John Travolta, because he had the full suit on with a large collar and tie and really fancy suits and flared trousers.\"We used to see him regularly with different suits, some naughty suits, some proper naughty suits.\"Bowler Sidebottom retired in 2017, after taking more than 1,000 career wickets, and he said Bird \"absolutely loved\" the sport.\"Great bloke and a lovely man who would do anything for Yorkshire cricket. He just loved Yorkshire, he was so passionate about the game and Yorkshire in general,\" he said.And it was love for Yorkshire, and its people, that chair of Yorkshire County Cricket Club Colin Graves remembered at his funeral.\"He had a reputation for not being the first at the bar, but he was a very generous man indeed,\" he said, adding that almost 1,000 children had been recipients of grants from him.Among the junior cricketers to have received financial awards from Dickie was Harry Brook - now an England international.Paul Barker/PA WireDickie Bird was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Leeds in 1997Speaking to the BBC when he turned 90 two years ago, Bird said his secret to a long life had been his love of sport and exercise.\"I run, I go out down to the local football ground here in the local park and I lap around the ground. I feel that's done me good.\"I'd like people, elderly people, if they could to just try and do a few exercises, move your arms, run on the spot, it occupies the brain. \"I'll keep my exercises up as long as I can.\"As a young man, he played for Barnsley Cricket Club alongside Boycott and the journalist and broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson.Dickie Bird shares secret to healthy life at 90Related stories",

    "body": "4 hours agoAna Faguy andKathryn ArmstrongPresident Donald Trump said the US will no longer offer subsidies to Colombia, one of the country's closest South American allies.The US president announced the decision in a Truth Social post on Sunday, labelling Colombia's President Gustavo Petro as \"an illegal drug leader\" who has \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia\".His comments come after Petro accused the US of committing \"murder\" when it carried out a military strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September.The move is the latest in a string of escalating tensions between the US and countries in Latin America, as the US military continues to strike ships in the Caribbean Sea it alleges carry drugs.Trump said because the US offers \"large scale payments and subsidies\" and Petro \"does nothing\" to stop the drug production, the US will no longer offer \"payment or subsidies\" to Colombia. According to a government website, the US provided over $740m (£551m) in aid to Colombia in 2023. It is unclear if all of that aid will stop, or when. In September, for the first time since 1996, the US declared that Colombia had failed to uphold its drug trafficking promises, and is ineligible for aid as defined in the Foreign Assistance Act. But the state department included a waiver that allowed Colombia to continue to receive aid. But following Petro's recent accusation of Americans committing \"murder\", Trump has escalated matters and says he will halt aid.Under Petro, cocaine production has reached a record-level and the country has failed to reach its coca eradication goals, the state department said in September. Petro has said the US violated his country's sovereignty killing a Colombian fisherman with its September attack. Posting on social media, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck. He added: \"We await explanations from the US government.\"\"Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing. The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.\"Alejandro Carranza was reportedly killed on 15 September when US forces allegedly fired on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean.Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".The escalation between Trump and Petro comes on the heels of another attack on a ship in the Caribbean sea. That attack, which happened on Thursday, is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.The Thursday attack, on a submarine, is the first time survivors have been reported, though the attack also killed two people.  Trump  said US intelligence confirmed the vessel was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The US president said two people who survived the submarine attack would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.They were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.",

    "body": "7 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesVice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the US Marine Corps at an event that included a live artillery demonstration.That demonstration - which took place at Camp Pendleton in Southern California - drew the ire of the state's governor Gavin Newsom, in part because the exercise closed a section of a popular interstate.\"Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn't just wrong - it's dangerous,\" Newsom, a Democrat who has often disagreed with the Trump administration, said in a statement.During his remarks, Vance recalled his time in the Marines, railed against what he called a Democrat-caused government shutdown and critiqued previous military diversity initiatives.Getty ImagesThe Marines fired live artillery as part of a demonstration commemorating their 250th anniversary The demonstration was the largest in a decade in the continental US, the Marines said, and involved fighter jets, Navy vessels, helicopters and live fire from a towed howitzer.In response to the exercise, Newsom said he closed a section of Interstate 5 in Southern California \"due to extreme life safety risk and distraction to drivers, including sudden unexpected and loud explosions\".But officials in the vice-president's office disputed Newsom's remarks that the demonstration was dangerous and accused the California governor of trying to stoke fears.Watch: Vance views military drills involving jets, helicopters and amphibious landings\"If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,\" William Martin, Vance's communications director, told CNN. \"It would come as no surprise that he would stoop so low considering his pathetic track record of failure as governor.\"Vance, who spoke in front of hundreds of marines, praised his time in the military. \"I would not be here today, I would not be the vice president of the United States, I would not be the man I am today were it not for those four years that I served in the Marine Corps,\" he said.Vance spent four years in the Marines and served a tour in Iraq in 2005.But his remarks largely focused on politics, and in part he attacked \"woke\" aspects of the military. \"It is our common purpose, it is our common mission and it is the fact that every single person here bleeds Marine Corps green,\" the vice president said.Getty ImagesOne of the Trump administration's focuses has been eliminating diversity initiatives, particularly within the Pentagon. Vance also used the stage time to rail against the nearly three-week long government shutdown and put blame on Democrats, particularly Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\"I bring greetings today from our commander in chief, Donald J Trump, and he wanted me to tell each and every single one of you that he's proud of you, that he loves you and that despite the Schumer shutdown, he is going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve,\" he said.While thousands of federal workers are working without pay, the Defence Department is paying troops.

    "body": "5 hours agoBorn Free/PA MediaThe penguins arrived in May 2011 from Edinburgh ZooAnimal welfare campaigners have called for the release of 15 penguins \"trapped in a basement without sunlight or fresh air\" in a demonstration held at the London Aquarium.Organised by Freedom For Animals with support from Born Free and The Express newspaper, between 250 and 300 people protested against the captivity of 15 gentoo penguins at the riverside attraction in Westminster.The aquarium, owned by Merlin Entertainments, opened its first penguin exhibit in May 2011, introducing 10 gentoo penguins from Edinburgh Zoo.A spokesperson for the Sea Life London Aquarium said the penguins' habitat was \"designed with help and advice from specialist vets\".'Idiotic'The penguins \"have now endured 14 years in a basement\" equipped with a pool of only six to seven feet (1.8-2.1m) deep, according to campaigners.Former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey dared the new Merlin Entertainments chief executive Fiona Eastwood to \"swap places with the penguins\".He said: \"In fact, if she's prepared to actually spend a month down there with those penguins, I will donate £1,000 of my money to a charity of her choosing.\"There is no reason that they should be benefiting at all from imprisoning 15 birds in the basement of an old council building.\"\"It's idiotic. It's a nonsense, and it's got to stop,\" Sharkey added.Born Free/PA MediaSea Life aquariums contain more than 30,000 sea creatures across the UKMerlin Entertainments is co-run by Blackstone Group, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Kirkbi, the investment arm of the Lego family.The British theme park giant owns a wide range of attractions across the UK, including Alton Towers, Legoland Windsor, Madame Tussauds, Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures.A spokesperson said the enclosure \"provides an excellent balance of water and land for the penguins which enables them to express their normal behaviours and there is space for them to ensure they have sufficient privacy\".Naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham CBE, who was also at the protest, rejected the venue's claims and called it \"a blight on the reputation of London's attractions\".\"I could get some specialist architects to build you and me a house in an asbestos factory - we wouldn't want to live in it, would we?\" Packham said.Freedom For Animals launched its Free The Fifteen campaign in January 2024, arguing that since gentoo penguins are not classified as an endangered species, there is no justification for breeding and keeping them in captivity.As of this year's stocktake, Sea Life aquariums counted more than 30,000 sea creatures across 11 centres in the UK.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThe Metropolitan Police said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection.\"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made,\" the force said on Sunday.Ms Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year, said she was among the girls and young women sexually exploited by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy circle.Prince Andrew has not commented on the reports, but consistently denies all allegations against him. Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment.Ms Giuffre also claimed that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London, in 2001.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges related to Epstein, her former boyfriend.According to the Mail on Sunday, Prince Andrew asked his police protection officer to investigate her just before the newspaper published a photo of Ms Giuffre's first meeting with the prince in February 2011.The paper alleged that he gave the officer her date of birth and confidential social security number.The Sunday Telegraph also claimed that Prince Andrew \"sought to dig up dirt\" on Ms Giuffre.Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, called it \"deeply concerning\", adding that if true, \"it's absolutely not the way that close protection officers should be used\".On Friday, Prince Andrew announced that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles and giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.He will no longer use his Duke of York title, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.The prince had already ceased to be a \"working royal\" and had lost the use of his HRH title and no longer appeared at official royal events. His role now will be even more diminished.Prince Andrew email to Epstein does not suggest he broke off friendship - Emily MaitlisEmily Maitlis, who conducted the now-infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 with the prince, said the move had been \"a long time coming\", adding: \"Six years has been quite a long time to wait for this.\"In the interview, the prince claimed he had severed all ties with Epstein in 2010 during a visit to his New York home. Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Maitlis said she felt \"quite sick\" when emails emerged that had been sent in February 2011 from the prince to Epstein, suggesting their friendship had not ended.She had questioned Prince Andrew on his decision to \"spend four days - four nights - in a convicted paedophile's home\" to end their friendship, to which he had responded he had a tendency to be \"too honourable\".The February 2011 emails including one from the prince that read: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!\", suggesting he had stayed in touch with him. \"The tenor of it, the idea not just that he was saying we're in this together, but signing off 'let's play some more soon', does not suggest that he had ever finished that friendship, that he had ever broken off with Epstein,\" Maitlis said.\"You're left really questioning, why he said that, whether the conversation ever existed, and how much more there is in that interview that we have to now go back and question,\" the journalist added.Prince Andrew has faced a series of scandals over recent years, including making an out-of-court settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him.A posthumous memoir by Ms Giuffre to be released next week is likely to cast further attention on the prince's involvement with her and Epstein. On Friday evening, Ms Giuffre's brother Sky Roberts told BBC Newsnight his sister would have been \"very proud\" of the latest development regarding Prince Andrew's titles, but that he would like the King to go a step further and remove the title of prince.\"I think anybody that was implicated... should have some sort of responsibility and accountability for these survivors,\" he said.Former BBC royal correspondent Jenny Bond told the BBC she believed \"public clamour for more action against Andrew is going to continue because these headlines are going to continue\". \"We have to remember at the heart of all this is not really the royal family at all - it's the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and Virginia Giuffre being one of them.\"",

    "body": "Why John Bolton case is more serious than those against other Trump critics8 hours agoKayla EpsteinBloomberg via Getty ImagesFormer national security adviser John Bolton arrives at court on Friday.President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to see his critics investigated, pressuring the Justice Department to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" the president wrote last month in a Truth Social post.\"They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!)\" he said, referencing the four criminal cases he faced after leaving the White House in 2021 and James's civil case.Both have since been charged, in cases that many experts have said appear to be politically motivated and difficult to win in court.But the latest charges against a Trump critic, former national security adviser John Bolton, stand apart, legal specialists and former prosecutors say.\"I would say, comparing Bolton's charges to Comey's and James' is like comparing apples to oranges,\" said Mark Lesko, a former acting US attorney for the Eastern District of New York.Bolton has been criminally indicted on federal charges pertaining to the alleged mishandling of classified information. Since leaving the White House in 2019, he has become a vocal Trump critic, going so far as to call him \"stunningly uninformed\" and unfit for office in his memoir.Experts say that while there may be political reasons to go after Bolton, the procedures used to secure an indictment and the evidence compiled against him indicate a potentially stronger case than the Justice Department brought against Comey or James. \"This misconduct that's being alleged is both more serious and appears to have occurred over a significant period of time,\" said Carissa Byrne Hessick, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law.During his time as Trump's national security adviser, and after his 2019 White House departure, prosecutors alleged that Bolton put the country at risk by improperly retaining and transmitting classified information to family members using insecure means, including AOL. Some of the documents were labeled top secret.The indictment alleges that at one point a hacker gained access to Bolton's account where documents were stored and sent an apparent threat to cause \"the biggest scandal since Hillary [Clinton]'s emails were leaked\".Bolton pleaded not guilty during a court appearance on Friday to 18 separate charges of mishandling classified information.Retribution or a strong case?The timing of his indictment - coming on the tails of charges against Comey and James - has renewed questions about political pressure on the justice system.Trump once suggested Bolton belonged in jail, and called him a \"sleazebag\". Bolton, for his part, wrote a book about his time in the Trump administration that was highly critical of the president.\"There's no question that the timing of this indictment, when combined with others, has raised questions about the strength of these charges, and why these charges are being brought now,\" said Jamil Jaffer, founder and executive director of the National Security Institute at the George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School.However, he added, \"if the Justice Department is able to prove the facts alleged and demonstrate the information is properly classified, his conduct may very well have violated the law\".Charging such a high-ranking official for mishandling classified documents is \"rare\" but not unprecedented, said Carrie Cordero, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\"Cases that involve classified information present challenges to prosecute, but they can and are brought against both low-level and high-level officials, from time to time,\" she said.Similarities to investigations into Trump and BidenTrump similarly faced charges of improperly storing classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and obstructing their return, but that case was ultimately dismissed by a federal judge and negated by his re-election as president. A special counsel also found that former President Joe Biden improperly stored classified documents from his time as vice president, but did not criminally charge him.Bolton's case bears similarities to Trump's and Biden's classified documents issues, said Mr Lesko, who also held a top national security role at the Justice Department.Strict procedures govern the handling of classified documents. To win a conviction, the government must prove that Bolton knew the information he was transmitting was classified, and he had to knowingly transfer it to someone not entitled to receive it.\"Because of the classified nature of the material at issue in this case, we don't have a lot of details about why the government believes things like the diary entries and the other information he communicated by email, and why there were classified,\" said Mr Jaffer.A more traditional prosecution The process by which the Justice Department brought this case will be under scrutiny, after Trump publicly posted his desire to see his political opponents prosecuted and some of those indictments came to fruition.But Mr Lesko said in Bolton's case, prosecutors seem to have followed protocol. \"The Bolton prosecution and ultimately the indictment seemed to have followed the regular process including the rules and norms within the Department of Justice,\" he said.Unlike Comey's brief, two-page indictment, Bolton's was a more \"traditional\" document that \"clearly sets forth the details involving the facts and circumstances here,\" Mr Lesko said.\"It seems fairly consistent with a long line of cases... where government officials mishandled and transmitted classified material.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondentJb Reed/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAuthorities say the Empress Eugénie Brooch was among the stolen itemsIt is the most spectacular robbery at the Louvre museum since the Mona Lisa disappeared in 1911.And it poses serious questions about levels of security covering French artworks, at a time when they are increasingly being targeted by criminal gangs.According to France's new interior minister Laurent Nunez, the gang that broke into the Apollo Gallery on Sunday morning was clearly professional.They knew what they wanted, had evidently \"cased the joint\" in advance, had a brazenly simple but effective modus operandi, and needed no more than seven minutes to take their booty and get away.In a truck equipped with an elevating platform of the type used by removal companies, they parked on the street outside, raised themselves up to the first floor, then used a disc-cutter to enter through a window.Inside the richly decorated gallery they made for two display-cases which contain what remains of the French crown jewels.Most of France's royal regalia was lost or sold after the 1789 Revolution, but some items were saved or bought back. Most of what was in the cases, though, dates from the 19th Century and the two imperial families of Napoleon and his nephew Napoleon III.According to the authorities, eight items were taken including diadems, necklaces, ear-rings and brooches.They had belonged to Napoleon's wife the empress Marie-Louise; to his sister-in-law Queen Hortense of Holland; to Queen Marie-Amelie, wife of France's last King Louis-Philippe, who ruled from 1830 to 1848; and to the empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, who ruled from 1852 to 1870.A crown of the empress Eugénie was left at the scene and is being examined to see if it is damaged.In a statement the culture ministry said that the alarms had sounded correctly. Five museum staff who were in the gallery or nearby followed protocol by contacting security forces and protecting visitors.It said the gang had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member.'An embarrassment': BBC's Andrew Harding reports from scene of Louvre robberyThe heist took place in a gallery just a short walk from some of the world's most famous paintings – such as the Mona Lisa.But the criminal groups that order heists like this do not target world-famous paintings that cannot ever be displayed or sold. They prefer items that can be converted into cash – and jewels top the list.However huge their historical and cultural value, crowns and diadems can easily be broken apart and sold in bits. Even large and famous diamonds can be cut. The final sales price might not be what the original artefact was worth, but it will still be considerable.Two recent museum thefts in France had already alerted the authorities to the growing audacity of art gangs, and a security plan drawn up by the culture ministry is gradually being put into effect across France.  \"We are well aware that French museums are vulnerable,\" said Nunez.In September thieves took raw gold – in its mineral state – from the Natural History Museum in Paris. The gold was worth about 600,000 euros (£520,000) and will have been easily disposed of on the black market.In the same month thieves took porcelain worth 6,000,000 euros from a museum in Limoges – a city once famous for its chinaware. The haul could well have been commissioned by a foreign buyer.The Louvre contains thousands of artworks that are famous around the world, and an equal number of more obscure items that are nonetheless culturally significant.But in its 230-year history there have been relatively few thefts – largely thanks to the tight security in place.The most recent disappearance was of a landscape by the 19th Century artist Camille Corot. Le Chemin de Sèvres (The Road to Sèvres) was simply removed from a wall in 1998 when no-one was looking, and has not been seen since.But by far the most famous theft was the one that took place in 1911, when Leonardo da Vinci's La Joconde – better known now as the Mona Lisa – was taken. The culprit back then was able to roll it up and put it inside his jacket.It turned out he was an Italian nationalist who wanted the artwork brought back home. It was found in Italy in 1914 and returned to the Louvre.Unless they have a quick success in catching the thieves, today's investigators are unlikely to be so lucky.  The first aim of the gang will be to disperse the jewels and sell them on. It will not be hard.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterBBCThe government is looking at the possibility of cutting the rate of VAT on energy bills, Ed Miliband has suggested.The energy secretary said he would not speculate ahead of the chancellor's Budget in November. But asked if the government would consider scrapping the 5% rate, he told the BBC the country was facing a \"cost-of-living crisis that we need to address as a government\" and \"we're looking at all of these issues\".The government is under pressure to reduce household energy costs and before the election Labour pledged to lower average bills by £300 a year by 2030.Miliband told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme he stood by that promise but the reason bills were so high was \"because of our dependence on fossil fuels\".He added: \"There is only one route to get bills down, which is to go for clean power, home-grown, clean energy, that we control, so we're not at the behest of the petrol states and the dictators.\"Pressed over whether the government was considering scrapping the 5% VAT rate on energy bills in November's Budget, Miliband said: \"The whole of the government, including the chancellor, understand that we face an affordability crisis in this country.  \"We face a cost-of-living crisis, a longstanding cost-of-living crisis, that we need to address as a government. We also face difficult fiscal circumstances... so obviously we're looking at all of these issues.\"A Treasury spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on speculation.\"Scrapping VAT on domestic energy bills would save the average household £86 per year and cost an estimated £2.5bn per year to implement, according to the charity Nesta.There was a rapid spike in energy prices in 2021, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and although costs have gone down, they have remained high by historical standards.This month bills went up by 2% for millions of households, under the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap.It means a household using a typical amount of energy will pay £1,755 a year, up £35 a year on the previous cap.Earlier this week Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC she was planning \"targeted action to deal with cost-of-living challenges\" in her Budget next month.The BBC understands this could also include reducing some of the regulatory levies currently added to energy bills.Levies known as \"policy costs\" - which are used to fund environmental and social schemes such as subsidies for renewables - made up around 16% of the average electricity bill and 6% of the average gas bill last year.Some energy bosses have argued green levies are partly to blame for rising bills and the government's independent adviser, the Climate Change Committee, has long recommended removing policy costs from electricity bills to help people feel the benefits of net-zero transition.Asked whether these could be funded through taxes rather than coming off energy bills, Miliband said: \"That's always a judgement for the chancellor, but let's be honest we know we've got really difficult fiscal circumstances that we inherited... but absolutely we look at those things.\"He argued the government had to invest in \"aging electricity infrastructure\" but there needed to be a \"balance between public expenditure and levies\".The cost of household energy bills has become a major political battleground, with the Conservatives and Reform UK blaming net-zero policies for higher prices. The Conservatives have said they would scrap the Climate Change Act, which legally requires the UK government to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050, as well as ditch carbon taxes on electricity generation and cut a funding scheme for renewables.Shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho said her party's plans would cut electricity bills for everyone by 20%.\"[The public] care about climate change but what I don't think they are signing up for is much higher bills and jobs being lost to countries abroad,\" she told the BBC.The Liberal Democrats accused the Conservatives and Reform UK of wanting \"to tie the UK to expensive fossil fuels and foreign dictators like Vladimir Putin\".The party's energy spokeswoman Pippa Heylings called for the government to \"break the link between gas prices and electricity costs\".\"People aren't seeing the benefit of cheap renewable power because wholesale electricity prices are still tied to the price of gas,\" she added.In an interview with the same programme, Green Party leader Zack Polanski argued nationalising energy companies would help cut costs for customers.His party has also proposed a new tax on carbon emissions to drive fossil fuels out of the economy and raise money to invest in the green transition.Challenged over whether businesses would simply pass on these costs to customers, Polanski rejected this and said the tax would be \"vital for tackling the climate crisis\". \"What we need to be doing is finding other ways to support particularly small and local businesses... We know the big corporations are destroying our environment, our democracy and our communities,\" he said.\"They can make a profit, sure, but this isn't about squeezing out every single profit they can make.\"",

    "body": "Image source, ReutersImage caption, Lando Norris won the 2025 drivers' championship by two points from Max VerstappenByF1 Correspondent in Abu DhabiThe adrenaline beginning to drain out of him, but the euphoria of winning a first world title still very much present, Lando Norris was in reflective mood as he discussed what achieving his lifetime's ambition meant to him.\"I just won it my way,\" the McLaren driver said. \"I'm happy I could go out and be myself.\"\"I feel like I have just managed to win it the way I wanted to win it, which was not by being someone I'm not. Not trying to be as aggressive as Max [Verstappen] or as forceful as other champions might have been in the past – whatever it may be. My style of just trying to be a good person and a good team member.\"The 26-year-old Briton did a lot of talking after climbing out of his car in Abu Dhabi,  where his third-place finish in the 2025 season finale ensured he beat Verstappen to the championship by just two points. That is the way of things in F1, where drivers have to finish their media commitments before getting down to the business of celebrating their success.Among the thousands of words that came out of Norris' mouth, these were among the most fitting comments at the end of a season that has in many ways reflected his journey to the top.It has not been easy. There have been bumps in the road. Some even feel Red Bull's Verstappen would have been a more worthy champion, given his revival in the final third of the season.While Verstappen mounted one of the all-time great comebacks from the start of September, Norris weathered an early rough patch, and rode his own concurrent wave of momentum all the way to ultimate success in Abu Dhabi, in a race that, while tense, always felt like he had it under control.After he celebrated on the podium, where he was drenched in champagne by race-winner Verstappen and McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, as the three title contenders finished at the front just as they had started the race, you could almost feel Norris coming to terms with his achievement in real time as he discussed how he had got to where he had.There were some very touching comments about how much it meant to him to make so many people who were important to him happy, especially his parents and his colleagues at McLaren.\"I feel proud but not because I'm going to wake up tomorrow and go, 'I beat everyone,'\" he said. \"I'm not proud because I get to just say I'm a world champion. I'm proud because I feel like I made a lot of other people happy.\"And as he talked, he began to open up on who he is, his honesty, his determination to be true to himself and his wish to be open about his feelings, even the difficult ones, a trait for which he has been criticised from time to time.\"Could I have gone out and been more of that person you probably want me to be at times? I could have done,\" he said.\"I would have been less proud about it in some ways. So, that's why I'm very happy with myself. I kept my cool, I kept to myself, I kept the focus on myself, and I got the most out of how I am.\"'The struggles turned into strength'Norris started the season as favourite, after McLaren's strong end to 2024, but after winning the first race, he went through a rough patch and Piastri moved into a comfortable lead.Norris was not at one with the car, was finding it difficult to feel the front axle when he was trying to take it to the limit in qualifying. That led to mistakes - even a big crash in Saudi Arabia - and when you start behind in modern F1, you tend to finish there.But he and McLaren worked at it. The team came up with a tweak to the front suspension aimed at improving feel. It was a small thing. It made a small difference, but a barely perceptible one.From there, he slowly improved, began to build momentum, but it was more about the work he was putting in behind the scenes.He knew what he needed to be better at, and he worked on it, on adapting to the car, on not being alarmed that it felt slightly different from what he wanted.It was a mental approach as much as a change in driving, and slowly it began to make a difference.\"It started after I had that kind of bad run in race two, three, four, five, six, that kind of area,\" he said. \"Or certainly when it was like, 'All right, my way is not working. I've got to understand things differently. I've got to speak to more people. I've got to understand what I'm thinking, why I'm thinking it. Why am I doing this? Why am I getting tense in qualifying? Why am I making the decisions that I'm making?' Whatever it may be.\"Certainly, the bad run of results and lack of performance - not speed, because I think the speed's always there - but lack of putting things together when I had the capability of putting things together, allowed or opened up the doors to go and understand: \"OK, I need to do more than just try again next weekend. I need to try and understand things on a deeper level.'\"That opened up understanding myself more, understanding things more at a championship level. That's the level I've got to be at. \"And yes, certainly the struggles turned into strength. So I would say, if I didn't have those struggles at the beginning and then had the weakness at the end, would I have caught on to those things as quickly? Probably not.\"Media caption, A young Norris shares ambition to be world championHe was 34 points adrift of Piastri after the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August, with only nine races remaining. That was when the run of form that ultimately took him to the title started.But while the outside perception was that this had freed Norris up and allowed him to just go for it, he says it was the opposite.\"No, it didn't allow me to relax,\" he said. \"Thirty-four points against a guy who had the same car, who was doing an incredible job, who I know is incredibly great, it didn't fill me with confidence and (make me) think I have nothing to lose now.\"I just had to step up, what I was doing away from the track, the people I was working with. I had to involve people to that group, I had to work harder, I was on a simulator, I had to change my approaches, I had to change my style of driving, I had to dig deep, to unlock more of my ideas.\"I'm trying to understand more things quicker, in a more advanced way than I ever have before.\"Team principal Andrea Stella said: \"The level of Formula 1 drivers nowadays is so high, to compete at this level, the only way to stay in the quest is to keep evolving continuously.\"If I look at Lando, definitely there was a lot that was taken away from the quest last year, even if it didn't go to the last race. I think Lando elevated his sense of, almost his status, like, 'I can compete with Max.'\"This season there was another important turning point, which is the way Lando, and we talk specifically about him for a moment, responded to the difficulties we had at the start of the season. There was the start of a process which was structured, it was holistic, it was involving the personal development, professional, driving, racecraft.\"It makes me particularly glad that Lando could capitalise on this, because this has been something that not necessarily I've seen many times before, in terms of the amount of work, the people involved, and the rate of development.\"For Stella's boss, McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown, this was a personal achievement as well as a professional one. Brown started backing Norris on a management level when he was 14, supported him through the junior ranks and brought him to McLaren.\"I remember when he was about that big. The management he has around him have done an awesome job bringing him up to be the mature world champion that he now is. And it's a great accomplishment. It's very rewarding.\"'I missed Lando growing up'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris embraces his mother Cisca with his manager Mark Berryman in the backgroundFor his family, there have been sacrifices, as his Belgian mother Cisca told BBC Radio 5 Live after the race.\"It's overwhelming, emotionally draining,\" she said, \"but we backed Lando during all the good and bad times. We always stood on his side, and not just Lando, but it was all the children. It's a dream come true for Lando.\"We didn't push the children; they had chosen what they wanted to do, and we supported them. It does take sacrifices, because the girls and the boys have been growing up almost separate. It was passing ships in the night. They chose what they wanted to do and we supported it.\"It takes its toll because I missed Lando growing up. When he was eight, he started to compete. It took him all over the place, but Adam (Norris' dad) stood on his side, and I missed him badly. I am still missing him. I don't see him often. \"He can do what he wants. He is a grown-up man, and the last six months, he has changed and become stronger in his mind as well.\"As he came to the end of his remarks post-race, Norris was still reflecting on the difficulties, and how they had helped turn adversity into the ultimate success.\"If I look back at it from the first half of the season,\" he said, \"not the most impressive.\"Certainly times I've made some mistakes, I've made some bad judgments, I've made my errors.\"But how I managed to turn all of that, and have the second half of the season that I had, is what makes me very proud, that I've been able to prove myself wrong. That makes me very happy.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris' McLaren team have won the constructors' championship in the past two seasons",

    "body": "It will go down as one of the most explosive interviews in the Premier League era.Liverpool's Mohamed Salah stunned most people on Saturday evening when he claimed his relationship with manager Arne Slot had \"broken down\".The Egyptian, arguably one of the Premier League's greatest players, cranked up the pressure on Slot after spending the third game in a row on the substitutes bench, as Liverpool let a lead slip twice in a 3-3 draw with Leeds.Claims such as he had been 'thrown under the bus' and that 'someone didn't want him at the club' were probably the last thing Slot wanted to hear put into the public, especially after a forgettable run of form that leaves the champions ninth in the Premier League.But what now for Salah at Liverpool? The 33-year-old only signed a new two-year deal in April but admitted on Saturday he was unsure whether he had played his last game for the club.BBC Sport takes a closer look at what happens next to the player who has scored 250 goals in 420 Liverpool appearances.Salah rarely speaks to the media but when he does it is typically because he has something important to say.That approach was taken to a new level with Saturday's explosive comments.When he was approached in the mixed zone at Elland Road, he was clear with reporters that he wanted to speak to them.It's unclear whether this was on the spur of the moment out of frustration or something more calculated.His comments quickly went around the world and put Liverpool head coach Slot under increased pressure and scrutiny.On Sunday, in the aftermath, there was little sign that there was any regret or walking back from what Salah said.Sources with knowledge of the situation told BBC Sport that Salah's relationship with Slot is genuinely broken at present.They said he simply doesn't see a future at Liverpool with Slot as his manager. That is quite the turnaround from a Premier League title won just eight months ago shortly after a lucrative new contract was announced.Sources say that Salah has also been irritated by a feeling that pundits and former players are putting forward a narrative that he is one of the main reasons Liverpool have struggled this season. Salah is said to feel that Slot has been influenced by that media commentary – yet when he has not played the Reds arguably haven't played any better.We were told that Salah feels a different tactical approach this season driven by the club's transfer dealings isn't suiting him.Those sources were at pains to say how much Salah loves Liverpool and also how frustrated he has become at their struggles.BBC Sport was told on Saturday that Liverpool are open-minded about Salah's future amid Saudi interest. Al-Hilal, managed by Simone Inzaghi, are understood to be among the teams interested.It is believed that there have been no concrete talks as yet. At present, it seems Salah is keeping his options open, and it is a busy time for him with Africa Cup of Nations duty beckoning on Monday 15 December.Liverpool fans - and the world of football in general - will be waiting to find out the next instalment with bated breath.And they aren't going to have very long to wait with Monday likely to be a key day.The Reds are due to have an open training session on Monday morning, ahead of Tuesday's important Champions League match at Inter Milan, so all eyes will be on whether Salah is in attendance.We are yet to hear from Liverpool since, but the big question will be will Salah be travelling with the squad to Milan after open training?Slot is then expected to talk to the media for the first time since Salah's interview broke on Monday night, with all focus certain to be on their relationship. Was he surprised by the interview? Is there a way back for Salah?  Is he still in his plans for Tuesday night? All questions Slot will have to field in Milan.A day later, Liverpool will be facing Inter Milan looking for a win to move them back into the top eight of the Champions League - but will Salah be involved?The Reds then face Brighton at Anfield on Saturday, Salah's last match before he was due to meet up with the Egypt on Monday for the Africa Cup of Nations.Whether Salah will even be at Anfield is currently uncertain and, if he is, the reaction of the supporters towards his outburst would be very interesting.Whatever happens, you feel the next seven days will be very telling with regard his Liverpool future.Former England goalkeeper Rob Green, told BBC Radio 5 Live: He only ever speaks when it's going wrong for him or it's not going swimmingly. He's done it a few times after games and you just think maybe someone have a word in your ear. But what this does do is give Arne Slot an open goal now with whatever he wants to do. Now, with the Afcon coming up and with this outburst it's kind of a gift for Slot to say no one is bigger than the club, out you go.Or he can bring him back into the squad, nurse him back into the team but do it under his say so. The pressure is completely off Arne Slot now, really it's an error from Mo Salah because realistically with that draw (at Leeds) and the difficulty they are having this season, just stay quiet because the pressure grows, game by game that you don't play. This is Slot's to decide now. For me, Salah is an all-time great for Liverpool, for everything he's done. You're now saying you're going to leave at some point. It might be now, January might come around and they say it's best for all parties if you go now – it wouldn't surprise me if that happened.Former Newcastle and Man City goalkeeper Shay Given, told BBC Match of the Day: I felt for Mo Salah a little bit. When someone puts a microphone in front of you, it is a frustrating time for a sub not to play, especially a player of his calibre.The surprising thing that jumped off the page for me was why hasn't Arne Slot taken him into his office and had a sit down conversation with Mo Salah? This guy is a phenomenal player.I know Mo is probably angry and in the cold light of day shouldn't have said some of those things, but we have been there, you don't play, you are angry and frustrated and the team hasn't played well. Mo Salah has said himself he feels like the scapegoat.Former Germany and Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger, on BBC Match of the Day:I think it was a little bit calculated but more his emotion. I think what he said was wrong and damage has been done.What they should do is sit down and speak to each other because it is not over yet. They all need to get together and say we can get this right. Damage has been done but I still think there is time to get it right but they have to do it quickly.BBC Radio 5 Live commentator Conor McNamara: At Elland Road it's very close. The press conference room is right near the player tunnel and players are always going out to the team buses, it's old school in that way. In the mixed zone where players walk through and normally they pretend to be on their phone to avoid speaking to the media, that's what usually happens. Mo Salah came out and had things to get off his chest. It ended up being there were more journalists out there than there were in the press conference where Arne Slot was speaking at the same time. This was all happening simultaneously but that immediately became the story that everyone was talking about last night.Ex-England striker Michael Owen, posted on X: Oh Mo Salah. I can imagine how you feel. You've carried this team for a long time and won everything there is to win. But this is a team game and you simply can't publicly say what you've said. You're going to afcon in a week. Surely you bite your lip, enjoy representing your country and see how the land lies when you get back?",

    "body": "Jeremy Bowen: Syria feels lighter without the Assads' crushing weight - but now there are new problems2 hours agoJeremy BowenInternational EditorBBCA year ago, the war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down.A rebel force had broken out of Idlib, a Syrian province on the border with Turkey, and was storming towards Damascus. It was led by a man known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and his militia group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Jolani was a nom-de-guerre, reflecting his family's roots in the Golan Heights, Syria's southern highlands, annexed by Israel after it was occupied in 1967. His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa.One year later, he is interim president, and Bashar al-Assad is in a gilded exile in Russia. Syria is still in ruins. In every city and village I have visited this last 10 days, people were living in skeletal buildings gutted by war. But for all the new Syria's problems, it feels much lighter without the crushing, cruel weight of the Assads.Getty ImagesSyria is still in ruins. In cities and villages, many people are living in skeletal buildings gutted by warSharaa has found the going easier abroad than at home. He has won the argument with Saudi Arabia and the West that he is Syria's best chance of a stable future.In May, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia arranged a brief meeting between Sharaa and US President Donald Trump. Afterwards, Trump called him a \"young attractive tough guy\".At home, Syrians know his weaknesses and the problems Syria faces better than foreigners. Sharaa's writ does not run in the north-east, where the Kurds are in control, or parts of the south where Syrian Druze, another minority sect, want a separate state backed by their Israeli allies. On the coast Alawites – Assad's sect – fear a repeat of the massacres they suffered in March.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump called him a 'young attractive tough guy'A year ago, the new masters of Damascus, like most of the armed rebels in Syria, were Sunni Islamists. Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects. Sunnis are the majority. As well as Kurds and Druze, there are Christians, many of whom find it hard to forget Sharaa's jihadist past.Image of a man who outgrew his jihadist rootsIn the first week of December last year, it was hard to believe that the HTS offensive was moving so fast. It took them three days to capture Aleppo, Syria's northern powerhouse.Compare that with the tortured years between 2012 and 2016, when the regime's army and rebel militias had fought for control of the city: that had ended in victory for Assad after Russia's president Vladimir Putin deployed his air force and artillery to add decisive firepower to the regime's ruthless tactics.When I visited the former rebel strongholds in eastern Aleppo a few weeks after they had fallen to the regime, large areas were devastated by Russian bombing. Some streets were blocked by rubble that went up to first-floor balconies.But by the end of 2024, across the country, government troops had melted away. Both reluctant conscripts and regime loyalists were no longer prepared to fight and die for a corrupt and cruel regime that repaid them with poverty and oppression.AFP via Getty ImagesOne year ago - celebrations marking the dawn of a new era for SyriaA few days after Assad fled with his family to Russia, I interviewed Syria's victorious new leader in the presidential palace.It perches high on a crag overlooking Damascus, designed as an ever-visible reminder for the city's citizens of the all-seeing power of the Assads. By then Jolani had discarded his name, along with his combat fatigues.Sharaa sat down in the chilly halls of the unheated palace wearing a smart jacket, pressed trousers and shiny black shoes. He told me that the country was exhausted by war and was not a threat to its neighbours or to the West, insisting that they would govern for all Syrians. It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.Israel dismissed it, however. And jihadist hardliners branded Sharaa as a traitor, selling out his religion and his own history.Watch: BBC speaks to Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-SharaaI had packed in a hurry to report on a war, never expecting the regime to crumble so fast. My formal attire was back at home in London. After the interview one of his aides complained that I should have worn a suit to interview a national leader.His grumble was about more than my sartorial choices. It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib. The campaign was designed to present him as a man who had outgrown his jihadist roots to become a worthy leader of all Syria, a leader the rest of the world should take seriously and treat with respect.A weakened IS in SyriaSharaa took power amid huge uncertainty about what he might do, and what might be done to him by his enemies. Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.The reality is that IS in Syria is weak. Its attacks this year have been mostly against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east.That has changed in the last few weeks, leading up to the anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime.Getty ImagesThe war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down one year agoAs security forces have raided IS cells, the jihadists have killed three soldiers and two former Assad operatives in cities controlled by the government, according to data collected by Charles Lister, a leading commentator on Syria, and published in a newsletter Syria Weekly. IS social media channels monitored by the BBC continue to tell Syrian Sunnis that Sharaa has betrayed them.Without producing any proof, they have posted claims that he has been an agent of the US and UK, working to undermine the jihadist project.Winning over Trump and the westSharaa's overtures to the west have been remarkably successful.Within two weeks of taking power in Syria, he received a delegation of senior American diplomats. Immediately, the Americans scrapped the $10 million bounty the they had put on his arrest.Since then, sanctions imposed on Assad's Syria have been steadily reduced. The most swingeing, the Caesar Act, has been suspended and could be repealed by the US Congress in the new year.A major milestone came in November when Sharaa became the first Syrian president to visit the White House.APTrump sprayed Sharaa with cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take homeTrump's welcome in the Oval Office was relaxed. He sprayed Sharaa with Trump-branded cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take home for his wife, jokingly asking him how many he has. \"One,\" Sharaa answered, as he blinked away clouds of fragrance.Away from the larking around for the cameras, Saudi Arabia as well as western governments see Sharaa as the best bet – the only one – to stabilise a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East. If Syria slipped back into civil war, there would be zero chance of reducing the violent turbulence in the region.One senior western diplomat told me that the conditions for civil war still exist. That is because of the lasting scars of half a century of dictatorship and 14 years of a war that started as an uprising against the Assads' oppressive rule and turned into an increasingly sectarian fight.AFP via Getty ImagesMany western governments see Sharaa as the best bet to stabilise Syria. His minister for foreign affairs, Assad al-Shaibani is front rightSharaa is a Sunni Muslim, Syria's largest religious group. His government does not control the whole country. In the last year he has not been able to persuade, or force, Kurds in the north-east and Druze in the south to accept the authority of Damascus. On the coast, the Alawite community is nervous and restive.The Alawites are a sect that originated in Shia Islam, with their heartland on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The Assads are Alawites.The founder of the regime, Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad, built his power on the Alawite minority, around 10% of the population. Just the sound of the Alawite accent, especially coming from a man in uniform – or worse, a leather-jacketed operative from one of the regime's intelligence agencies – used to make other Syrians nervous.Syria will not recover if sectarian killing continues. Stopping more serious outbreaks of violence in the next 12 months is the government's most serious challenge.The slow pace of justiceJust before the anniversary of Assad's fall, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressed serious concern about the slow pace of justice. A spokesman said, \"While the interim authorities have taken encouraging steps towards addressing past violations, these steps are only the beginning of what needs to be done.\"Some Syrians have taken matters into their own hands, along, at times, with government forces. The OHCHR said that hundreds have been killed over the past year \"by the security forces and affiliated groups, elements associated with the former government, local armed groups and unidentified armed individuals\".They added: \"Other reported violations and abuses include sexual violence, arbitrary detentions, destruction of homes, forced evictions, and restrictions on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.\"Alawite, Druze, Christian and Bedouin communities were mainly affected by the violence, the OHCHR said, which has been fed by rising hate speech both on- and offline.Anadolu via Getty ImagesA graduation ceremony for general security personnel last monthA big risk for 2026 is a repeat of last March's sectarian violence in Alawite areas.In the security vacuum that followed the fall of the Assad regime, the new government attempted to stamp its authority on the Syrian coast with a series of arrests. An investigation by OCHCR found that \"pro-former government fighters responded by capturing, killing, and injuring hundreds of interim government forces\".Damascus responded harshly and lost control of militant armed factions that carried a systematic series of deadly attacks on Alawites.The UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed in the ensuing massacres. The vast majority were adult men, but victims included approximately 100 women, the elderly and the disabled, as well as children.The Sharaa government cooperated with the UN investigation. Some of its forces managed to rescue Alawites and it has put some of the ringleaders of the massacres on trial. ReutersThe UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed during sectarian violence in Alawite areas in MarchThe UN Syria Commission of Inquiry confirmed it had found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks. But the concern then and for the future was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groups that had supposedly joined its security forces.In July in the southern province of Suweida, serious violence between Druze and Bedouin communities shook the Sharaa administration to its roots. The Druze religion developed out of Islam around a thousand years ago, and its followers, who some Muslims believe are heretics, amount to around 3% of Syria's population.When government forces entered Suweida, supposedly to restore order, they ended up fighting Druze militias. Israel, which has its own Druze community that is fiercely loyal to the Jewish state, intervened. Its airstrikes included the near destruction of the ministry of defence in Damascus. It took a rapid American intervention to force a ceasefire that stopped a spiral down into much worse violence. Tens of thousands of people were driven from their homes and remain displaced.Getty ImagesA UN inquiry found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks in March. But the concern was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groupsThe Israel questionIt is still not clear whether Sharaa and his interim government are strong enough to survive another crisis as serious as that. Israel remains a looming and dangerous presence to Syrians.After the fall of Assad, the Israelis launched a series of major air strikes to destroy what was left of the old regime's military capacity. The IDF advanced out of the occupied Golan Heights to take control of more Syrian territory, which it still holds.The Israelis were taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to weaken a country it saw as hostile, destroying weapons it said might be turned in its direction.More from InDepthAttempts by the US to broker a security agreement between Israel and Syria have stalled in the last two months or so.Syria wants to return to an agreement originally negotiated by Henry Kissinger when he was US Secretary of State in 1974. Netanyahu wants Israel to stay in the land it seized and has demanded that Syria demilitarises a large area south of Damascus.In the last month Israel has intensified its ground incursions into Syria. Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November. The IDF said they were arresting Sunni militants who were planning attacks. Local men fought back, wounding six Israelis as the raiding party was forced into a hurried retreat, abandoning a military vehicle that they later destroyed with an airstrike. The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel. The Damascus government called it a war crime. Calls for retaliation intensified.Dia Images via Getty ImagesThe border village of Beit Jinn was raided by IDF troops on 28 NovemberIn Washington, Trump was clearly worried by the raid. He posted on his Truth Social platform that he was \"very satisfied\" with Sharaa's efforts at stabilising Syria.He warned that it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous state\".In Beit Jinn I met Khalil Abu Daher on his way back from hospital, his arm in plaster after surgery for a bullet wound. He invited me to his home, which is close to where the Israelis were exchanging fire with village men.Khalil told me he was here with his family when the Israelis entered the village at 3:30 am. They tried to find a safe place.\"I was in my house with my children. We went from one room to another. They shot at my two daughters. One was hit, and the other died instantly. When I picked her up, I was shot in the hand.\"The dead girl was 17-year-old Hiba Abu Daher, who was shot in the stomach. They sheltered, Khalil said, alongside Hiba's dead body for two hours before they were rescued and taken to hospital.When I visited, Khalil's nine-year-old daughter was lying on a blanket on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hip.Khalil's nine-year-old daughter lying on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hipThe girls' mother, Umm Mohammad, sat with the women of the family, desperately worried about the future.\"We want peace of mind,\" she told me. \"We want to live in our homes, and we want a clinic and medical staff because we don't have one.\"We also want a doctor because there isn't one in Beit Jinn, nor is there a pharmacy. We want security.\"'We go to sleep and wake up afraid'A year after the end of Assad's rule, Syria's new rulers have scored some important achievements. They are still in power, which was not guaranteed when they took Damascus. President Trump has become Sharaa's most important backer. Sanctions are being lifted. The economy is showing signs of life and business deals are being done, including modernising oil and gas installations and privatising the airports in Damascus and Aleppo.But deals that are in the pipeline have not yet changed the lives of most Syrians. The government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individuals. Sectarian tensions are unresolved and could ignite again. The US-mediated dialogue with Israel has stalled.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individualsBenjamin Netanyahu insists that Damascus might demilitarise a large area of southern Syria and shows no signs of ordering the IDF to pull back. Both points amount to a major violation of Syrian sovereignty. The Beit Jinn raid makes it harder for Damascus to offer concessions.Government in Damascus is centred on Sharaa himself, assisted by the foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani and a few trusted associates. No serious attempt seems to be happening to create an accountable framework of government.Syria without the Assad family is a better place. But Umm Mohammad summed up the feelings of far too many Syrians.\"The future is difficult. We have nothing, not even schools. Our children are living in hell here. There is no safety for them. How will we live?\"We want safety. We go to sleep and wake up afraid.\"Top picture credits: AFP via Getty Images and Anadolu via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesByGyasi B-HibbertBBC NewsUpdated 7 hours agoThe winter holiday period is meant to be joyful, yet for many of us it comes with a heavy mix of responsibilities and social pressure to go to parties and events we don't want to.Agreeing to something we don't want to do is a feeling that we've all experienced. It can manifest in physical responses like a tight stomach, a dry mouth, or even a higher heart rate.Dr Xand and Dr Chris van Tulleken, hosts of the BBC's What's Up Docs wellness podcast, say they've both been affected. \"We both get the wobbly voice.It's so hard to go, 'actually, I don't want to do this thing you're asking me to do. I don't want to go along with the thing we're all expected to go along with,'\" says Dr Xand on What's Up Docs.But getting more comfortable with saying no may be the first step to taking more control over our lives.\"Whether you're eight or 80, saying no, and sticking up for what you believe in is actually quite important for your mental health,\" says Dr Xand.Behavioural scientist Dr Sunita Sah suggests three ways to get better at it. Should you say 'no' more often?The doctors explore the psychology behind our reluctance to turn things down, and how we can become more comfortable protecting our boundaries.1. Realise it's okay to say noSaying no can feel uncomfortable. Many of us were brought up to do as we were told, and as adults we struggle to go against how we've been raised.\"We equate compliance with good and defiance with bad,\" says Dr Sah. \"Children get lots of training in compliance, but they need to receive training in defiance too.\"Reshaping how we view and define saying no is key. Seeing it as a positive act instead of a negative one can be instrumental in taking greater control over decisions.\"To defy is to act in accordance with your true values, especially when there is pressure to do otherwise.\"When deciding whether to say yes or no, the question to ask is whether you're going against your values.These are often expressed as single, powerful words like integrity, compassion, or equality. But we may struggle to enact them in daily life.Establishing your values is the first step towards upholding them. \"If we write them down, research shows we are more likely to act in alignment with them,\" says Dr Sah.2. Ask for more time Image source, Getty ImagesIf you don't need to answer immediately, then ask for more time. Dr Sah emphasises the importance of becoming comfortable with asking for a pause.Phrases such as \"Let me think on this\" or \"That's really interesting, let me get back to you\" can be highly effective in buying time to evaluate whether you truly want to undertake the task.\"We know that with any sales pitch, you want to get either some physical distance or some psychological distance between you and the person asking the question.\"We can get that psychological distance from talking to ourselves and asking, 'Do you really want to do this?'\" she says.Creating some physical space between yourself and the person asking the question can also be instrumental in making an informed decision. Dr Sah has previously spoken about how making the decision in private gives us the space to change our mind.3. Practise on your neighbourIf you find it difficult to say no, then practising in low-stake scenarios can help. We make decisions every day, most of them quite small. Things like an invite to your neighbour's house, lending an item or stopping to speak with a salesperson are all perfect opportunities.\"It's not a glamorous act of defiance. It's not standing up to your sexist or racist boss, but it's still necessary to do the less glamorous but still important self-protected bits of defiance,\" says Dr Xand.\"We can lean into those situations where we found it easier to defy and think about what made it easy for me in that situation and use that in other situations,\" adds Dr Sah.When it comes to the important situations – where agreeing would violate something that matters to you – you can then be more confident saying no.Image caption, Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "A water leak at the Louvre museum in Paris has damaged hundreds of works, just weeks after thieves stole priceless French crown jewels from the museum in broad daylight.The museum's deputy administrator, Francis Steinbock, said between 300-400 works, mostly books, were affected by the leak - and that the count was ongoing. Mr Steinbock told French media the damage occurred in the Egyptian department and that the volumes are \"those consulted by Egyptologists\", but that \"no precious books\" were affected. The problem that caused the leak, which was discovered in late November, had been known for years, and repairs are scheduled for next year, Mr Steinbock added.The volumes will be dried, sent to a bookbinder and restored before being returned to the shelves.Mr Steinbock described the books as \"Egyptology journals\" and \"scientific documentation\" from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \"No heritage artefacts have been affected by this damage,\" Mr Steinbock told the Agence France-Presse news agency.He added: \"At this stage, we have no irreparable and definitive losses in these collections.\"The leak is the third major issue faced by the museum - which is the most visited in the world - in as many months. In November, structural weaknesses prompted the partial closure of one of the galleries hosting Greek vases and offices, and on 19 October, four burglars made off with jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring security gaps. The jewels still haven't been recovered, and the museum has since moved some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France.A report published in October by France's public audit body, known as the Cour des Comptes, criticised the museum's excessive spending on artwork, which it said was \"to the detriment of the maintenance and renovation of buildings.\" ",

    "body": "50 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterUS President Donald Trump has flagged potential concerns over Netflix's planned $72bn (£54bn) deal to buy Warner Brothers Discovery's movie studio and popular HBO streaming networks.At an event in Washington DC on Sunday, he said Netflix has a \"big market share\" and the firms' combined size \"could be a problem\".On Friday, the two companies said they had reached an agreement to bring Warner Brothers' franchises like Harry Potter and Game of Thrones to Netflix, creating a new media giant.The planned deal, which has raised concerns among some in the industry, is yet to be approved by competition authorities. The BBC has contacted Warner Bros, Netflix and the White House for comment.Launched in 1997 as a postal DVD rental business, Netflix has grown to become the world's largest subscription streaming service. The deal, the biggest the film industry has seen in a long time, would cement its number one position.Under the agreement several global entertainment franchises, such as Looney Tunes, The Matrix and Lord of the Rings, would move to Netflix.The deal is expected to be completed after Warner Bros splits its business in the second half of 2026.The US Justice Department's competition division, which oversees major mergers, could contend that the deal violates the law if the combined businesses account for too much of the streaming market.At an event at the John F Kennedy Center in the US capital, Trump said that Netflix has a \"very big market share\" which would \"go up by a lot\" if the deal goes ahead.Trump added he would be personally involved in the decision on whether or not to approve the deal and repeatedly highlighted the size of Netflix's market share.He also said that Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently visited the Oval Office and praised him for his work at the company.\"I have a lot of respect for him. He's a great person,\" said Trump. \"He's done one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"Mr Sarandos earlier acknowledged that the agreement may have surprised investors but said it was a chance to position Netflix for success in the \"decades to come\".Blair Westlake, a media executive and former chair of Universal Studios' television and networks group, told the BBC's Today programme that \"the only two pieces that matter\" when it came to competition concerns were the combination of Netflix and Warner Brothers' HBO streaming business.\"Netflix is not in the studio production business the way Warner Brothers is, and even the library size of films and television programming that Netflix owns pales in comparison to Warner,\" he said.Mr Westlake said he thought the deal would eventually be approved, but \"I think that there will probably be concessions that have to be made\".Bill Kovacic, a former chair of the US competition watchdog the Federal Trade Commission, told the Today programme that Trump's comments meant negotiations over any problems surrounding the deal were \"going to run through the White House\".\"That means that we're going to have probably a deep level, an unprecedented level of presidential control in the resolution of what used to be a technical analysis of a merger,\" he said.Netflix beat several rivals including Comcast and Paramount Skydance to strike an agreement with Warner Bros.Paramount Skydance, which is headed by David Ellison, had previously tried to buy all of Warner Bros, including its cable networks.Warner Bros rejected that approach before putting itself up for sale.David Ellison's multi-billionaire father, Larry Ellison, is a close ally of Trump.The Writers Guild of America's East and West branches called for the merger to be blocked, saying the \"world's largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent.\"\"The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers,\" it said on Friday.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSpoiler alert: Winner of I'm a Celebrity... Get me out of here! revealed in Monday's paper review.The incident at Heathrow on Sunday is leading the Metro's front page. A three-year-old girl was among 21 people treated for injuries after men allegedly used what police believe was pepper spray during a suitcase robbery in a multi-storey car park at the airport. The paper says \"flights were cancelled or delayed as armed police hunted suspected attackers\" inside one of the airport terminals, causing train and Tube lines to suspend services.Top economists tipping an interest rate cut in the US is the Financial Times's lead story. It writes a majority of leading experts at the Chicago Booth Clark Center predict the federal reserve will lower borrowing costs by 25 basis points \"in response to fears that the labour market is slowing and affordability pressures are mounting\".The Independent leads with the probation watchdog saying the government should think \"very, very carefully\" about overhauling the justice system to allow \"more criminals to be electronically tagged and punished in the community\". Probation Services Chief Inspector Martin Jones tells the paper the system is already in \"perpetual crisis\" and could be \"set up to fail\" under the new proposal.\"Bosses will be legally obliged to tell staff about their right to join a union\" under a new \"overhaul of workers' rights\", the Times says in its top story. Shadow Business Secretary Andrew Griffith tells the paper \"it'll be Christmas every day for trade unions if this proposal became law\", while a government source says \"people have a right to join a trade union if they want to in their workplace\".The Sun leads with a Home Office review of its decision to deny the Duke of Sussex \"armed police protection on visits to the UK\". It writes \"the U-turn could pave the way for a reunion between the King\", Prince Harry, and his children Archie and Lilibet.The Daily Mail leads with a new survey showing \"1 in 4 are confident they'd receive good treatment from the health service if diagnosed\". The paper writes \"many Britons are living in fear they could be neglected in a failing hospital or care home.\"Emergency carers hired on a short-term basis do not fall under \"regulatory oversight due to a legal anomaly\", the Express reports. It claims the \"loophole\" means \"children needing urgent protection could be placed directly into the hands of predators\".An NHS watchdog survey has found \"one in seven people\" has their GP referral \"lost, rejected, or delayed\", the Guardian reports. The paper says the \"referrals black hole\" leads to many patients suffering \"harm to their physical or mental health\". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson says the outcomes are \"not acceptable\", while noting \"improvements have been made since the research was done in March\".A campaign for Kevin Sinfield to be knighted leads the Daily Mirror after the rugby league star finished \"seven ultramarathons in seven days\", raising £11.3m for motor neurone disease charities and research. Angry Ginge was crowned king of the jungle, the Daily Star reports, revealing the winner of the reality TV series I'm a Celebrity... Get me out of here!The Daily Telegraph reports on concerns of \"free speech campaigners\" who accuse the government of using \"spurious safeguarding concerns\" to \"silence people with 'patriotic views'\". It reports on some of the cases identified by the Free Speech Union (FSU), where it says \"laws intended to keep children safe from harm from adults are being used to crack down on Right-wing views\".The Daily Telegraph says the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, has been reported to the police because of claims he broke rules on campaign spending. The paper says that Richard Everett, a former Reform councillor, who helped Farage win his seat in Clacton in Essex at the general election, submitted the documents to the police. They are said to show that Reform came close to the limit of just over £20,000. But Everett alleges the figure excludes some costs including leaflets, utility bills and the refurbishment of a bar in the campaign office. He says he believes Farage was \"blissfully unaware\" of the omissions, but the Telegraph says that if the claims are found to be accurate he and his election agent could be found personally liable. In response, Reform UK described Everett as a \"disgruntled former councillor\" and denied any laws had been broken.The decision to strip the Duke of Sussex of the right to 24-hour armed police protection when he is visiting the UK from his home in America is to be reviewed by the Home Office, according to the Sun. The paper says it could mean a reunion for King Charles III with his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet, who he hasn't seen since 2022. Prince Harry has previously said it is not safe for his family to visit Britain without protection, which ceased when he stopped being a working royal in 2020.The Guardian highlights figures from an NHS watchdog suggesting that one in seven patient hospital referrals in England get lost, rejected or delayed. The paper says Healthwatch England's survey also found that the majority of those patients only discovered they weren't on a waiting list after chasing the NHS themselves.According to the Times' lead, every workplace will be required to tell staff about their right to join a union as part of the government's Employment Rights Bill. The paper says an approved statement will be given to workers in an effort to stop \"hostile\" employers from discouraging union membership. The Conservatives warn the plan will lead to a collapse of British productivity.And many of the papers carry triumphant pictures of an emotional Lando Norris, after the British driver won his first Formula 1 Championship. The Telegraph says it proves \"nice guys win too\". The back page headline in the i Paper is \"Lando hope and glory\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Russia has welcomed US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy, calling it \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision. The 33-page document, unveiled by the US administration this week, suggests Europe is facing \"civilisational erasure\" and does not cast Russia as a threat to the US. Combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and rejecting the EU's perceived practice of \"censorship\" are mentioned as other priorities in the report. Several EU officials and analysts had pushed back on the strategy, questioning its focus on freedom of expression and likening it to language used by the Kremlin. \"The adjustments we're seeing... are largely consistent with our vision,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published by Russia's state news agency Tass on Sunday. \"We consider this a positive step,\" he said, adding that Moscow would continue to analyse the document before drawing strong conclusions. The strategy adopts a softer language towards Russia, which EU officials worry could weaken its stance towards Moscow as it pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. In the document, the EU is blamed for blocking US efforts to end the conflict and says that the US must \"re-establish strategic stability to Russia\" which would \"stabilise European economies\".It appears to endorse efforts to influence policy on the continent, noting that US policy should prioritise \"resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".The new report also calls for the restoration of \"Western identity\", and claims that Europe will be \"unrecognisable in 20 years or less\" and its economic issues are \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure\".\"It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,\" the document states.In stark contrast, the document celebrates the influence of \"patriotic European parties\" and says \"America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit\".As the EU engages in ongoing talks with the Trump administration to set out a peace deal in Ukraine, some officials emphasised their lasting relationship with the US, while raising \"questions\" over the document. \"The US will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance. This alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues,\" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Friday. \"I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany.\"In a social media post addressed to his \"American friends\", Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that \"Europe is your closest ally, not your problem\" and noted their \"common enemies\".\"This is the only reasonable strategy of our common security. Unless something has changed.\"Meanwhile, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt wrote that the document \"places itself to the right of the extreme right\".The Trump administration has fostered links with the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been classified as extreme right by German intelligence.Promoting an \"America First\" message, the strategy says the US intends to target alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean, considering possible military action in Venezuela.The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan.Democrats in Congress warned that the document could shatter US foreign relations. Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, who sits on House committees overseeing intelligence and the armed forces, called the strategy \"catastrophic to America's standing in the world\".New York Representative Gregory Meeks said it \"discards decades of value-based, US leadership\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business Correspondent, TokyoBBCScientists at Waseda University in Tokyo are developing caregiving robotsLast year, more than 18,000 older people living with dementia left their homes and went missing in Japan. Almost 500 were later found dead.Police say such cases have doubled since 2012. Elderly people aged 65 and over now make up nearly 30% of Japan's population - the second-highest proportion in the world after Monaco, according to the World Bank. The crisis is further compounded by a shrinking workforce and tight limits on foreign workers coming in to provide care.Japan's government has identified dementia as one of its most urgent policy challenges, with the Health Ministry estimating that dementia-related health and social care costs will reach 14 trillion yen ($90bn; £67bn) by 2030 - up from nine trillion yen in 2025. In its most recent strategy, the government has signalled a stronger pivot toward technology to ease the pressure.Across the country, people are adopting GPS-based systems to keep track of those who go missing.Some regions offer wearable GPS tags that can alert authorities the moment a person leaves a designated area.In some towns, convenience-store workers receive real-time notifications – a kind of community safety net that can locate a missing person within hours.Robot caregivers and AIOther technologies aim to detect dementia earlier.Fujitsu's aiGait uses AI to analyse posture and walking patterns, picking up early signs of dementia – shuffling while walking, slower turns or difficulty standing – generating skeletal outlines clinicians can review during routine check-ups.\"Early detection of age-related diseases is key,\" says Hidenori Fujiwara, a Fujitsu spokesperson. \"If doctors can use motion-capture data, they can intervene earlier and help people remain active for longer.\"Meanwhile, researchers at Waseda University are developing AIREC, a 150kg humanoid robot designed to be a \"future\" caregiver. It can help a person put on socks, scramble eggs and fold laundry. The scientists at Waseda University hope that in the future, AIREC will be able to change adult nappies and prevent bedsores in patients.Toshio Morita (R) works at the Restaurant of Mistaken OrdersSimilar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises.They are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds.Although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, Assistant Professor Tamon Miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans.\"It requires full-body sensing and adaptive understanding - how to adjust for each person and situation,\" he says.Emotional support is also part of the innovation drive.Poketomo, a 12cm tall robot, can be carried around in a bag or can fit into a pocket. It reminds users to take medication, tells you how to prepare in real time for the weather outside and offers conversation for those living alone, which its creators say helps to ease social isolation.\"We're focusing on social issues... and to use new technology to help solve those problems,\" Miho Kagei, development manager from Sharp told the BBC.While devices and robots offer new ways to assist, human connection remains irreplaceable.\"Robots should supplement, not substitute, human caregivers,\" Mr Miyake, the Waseda University scientist said. \"While they may take over some tasks, their main role is to assist both caregivers and patients.\"At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in Sengawa, Tokyo, founded by Akiko Kanna, people stream in to be served by patients suffering from dementia.Inspired by her father's experience with the condition, Ms Kanna wanted a place where people could remain engaged and feel purposeful.Toshio Morita, one of the café's servers, uses flowers to remember which table ordered what.Despite his cognitive decline, Mr Morita enjoys the interaction. For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged.Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential. Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia.\"Honestly? I wanted a little pocket money. I like meeting all sorts of people,\" Mr Morita says. \"Everyone's different - that's what makes it fun.\"Getty ImagesSharp's Poketomo robot has been designed to give companionship to patientsAdditional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar",

    "body": "10 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongGetty ImagesThe government says some 50,000 young people are expected to benefit from a programme to expand apprenticeships as it looks to tackle youth unemployment.The £725 million package, which was earmarked in the Budget and covers the next three years, will be used to create apprenticeships in sectors including AI, hospitality and engineering.Apprenticeships for people under the age of 25 at small and medium-sized businesses will be fully funded as part of the package, removing the 5% that they currently have to pay.The government is aiming to reverse a decline in the number of young people starting apprenticeships, which has fallen by almost 40% in the past decade.The funding also includes £140m for a pilot that the Department for Work and Pensions says will allow local mayors to connect young people with employers and apprenticeship opportunities, although it is unclear exactly how the money will be used.A programme of short courses in areas including AI, engineering and digital skills will also be offered from Spring next year, which the government says will be done in collaboration with the defence sector.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to speak on Monday about the scheme.He has previously said he wants apprenticeships treated with the same respect as degree courses.\"For too long, success has been measured by how many young people go to university,\" the prime minister said. \"That narrow view has held back opportunity and created barriers we need to break.\"The government has expressed concern at the growing number of people being classified as Neets, which refers to 16 to 24-year-olds not in employment, education or training.This has been trending upwards since 2021, with the latest figures showing nearly a million young people are now neither earning or learning.Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said young people had \"not had a good enough deal\" in areas such as housing and employment.He also spoke about the government's plans to get young people off Universal Credit and into jobs, which it is spending a further £820m on.Some 55,000 six-month placements will be rolled out from next April for those who have been on a benefit for 18 months or more.The placements will be rolled out in six parts of the UK with high youth unemployment and will be \"fully subsidised\" for 25 hours a week, paid at the legal minimum wage. The money will also fund training and work support.Employers taking part in the scheme are yet to be announced, but ministers have said new opportunities will be created in sectors including construction, health and social care and hospitality.In total, the government plans to create 350,000 training and work experience placements.McFadden's Conservative counterpart Helen Whately said the scheme showed that Labour had \"no plan for growth, no plan to create real jobs\".",

On Tuesday Democratic Rep Ihan Omar was attacked at a local event in the city and protests are continuing following Saturday’s shooting of US citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents. Video evidence contradicts claims by Trump administration officials immediately after Pretti’s killing that he was a “domestic terrorist”, planning a “massacre” and “brandishing” a weapon. \nIn this episode, Sarah, Anthony and Marianna discuss the president’s controversial response to the attack on Democrat Ihan Omar, and whether Trump can actually de-escalate tensions when thousands of ICE agents remain in Minnesota.\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Kris Jalowiecki and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "20 minutes agoReutersLuigi Mangione will not face the death penalty if convicted of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a federal judge has ruled.US District Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed two of the four federal charges against the 27 year old, including murder through use of a firearm, which carried the potential death sentence.Mangione was arrested days after he allegedly shot Thompson as he was walking into a conference on a busy Manhattan street in December 2024.He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, including the two remaining federal counts of stalking and separate state murder charges. Jury selection in the federal trial is slated to begin on 8 September with opening statements starting on 13 October. But state prosecutors are seeking to try Mangione as soon as 1 July.In her ruling, Judge Garnett said two of the four federal charges did not \"meet the federal statutory definition of a 'crime of violence' as matter of law\". She noted that her decision was \"solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury\" ultimately responsible for determining Mangione's conviction.Garnett also said prosecutors would be allowed to feature evidence from Mangione's seized backpack he was wearing at the time of his arrest.Among the items in the backpack were a ghost gun, fake IDs, and a notebook with writings that detailed Mangione's private health care system grievances. Defence attorneys had sought to dismiss that evidence from trial, arguing that authorities obtained it in an illegal search. Mangione is also facing nine charges in a separate case brought by New York state prosecutors, including second-degree murder.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterBBCAlan Carr was selected to be a traitor on the BBC series, along with Cat Burns (pictured) and Jonathan RossComedian Alan Carr has revealed he accidentally gave away that he had won the Celebrity Traitors, just 12 hours after filming the final episode. The 49-year-old won the first celebrity series after convincing fellow finalists Nick Mohammed and David Olusoga that he was a faithful in a nail-biting final.But, he told BBC Radio 2's Scott Mills, the secret slipped out when he was filming Channel 4 gameshow Secret Genius the following day. Carr explained: \"The cameraman goes 'congratulations', and I go 'how did you know I won?' He said 'I didn't.\"\"So I told them within 12 hours that I had won The Traitors.\"After Carr inadvertently revealed he had won, the camera operator explained he had been \"just joking, just teasing\".The comedian then tried to retract his comment about winning, and said: \"I went, 'haha, got you!' - I had to backtrack, because you can't tell anything.\"But I did well, and I didn't want to spoil it.\"Carr told Radio 2's Scott Mills on Friday that he \"felt so stupid\" after inadvertently revealing he had wonBoth the regular and celebrity series of The Traitors are filmed months before they are broadcast - with the cast and crew required to follow strict confidentiality rules. The celebrity version of the show saw Carr appear alongside Sir Stephen Fry, Kate Garraway and Celia Imrie, as well as his fellow traitors Cat Burns and Jonathan Ross. Speaking about accidentally revealing the ending, Carr told Radio 2: \"I felt so stupid. When I did The Traitors, I looked at my work diary and my agent had actually put in work after the first week, and I said 'oh no, I'm doing The Traitors'.\"He said, 'Alan, you'll be out first week with your motor mouth, you aren't going to last'. Then it kept going on and on.\"He added: \"I thought I would be gone on day two.\"However, the comedian remained largely under the radar during his time on the show, and was eventually crowned the winner.'Who are you going to murder today?'Carr also said that, since appearing on Celebrity Traitors, he has been recognised more in public.The comedian recently went on holiday to Mexico, explaining: \"I'm never spotted over there.\"I was on the way to the pool and I heard this woman from the balcony, 'I see you, traitor. Don't you hide your face from me. Who are you going to murder today?\"'He joked the comments made him look like a real murderer, and said: \"People who don't know I was in The Traitors must think I'm a serial killer.\"Hosted by Claudia Winkleman, The Traitors follows a group of contestants - the majority of whom are known as the faithful - as they try to seek out the murderous traitors among them who kill off players every night in an attempt to win a cash prize.Set in the Scottish Highlands, the contestants complete a number of challenges to win money for the prize pot and must try to root out and banish the traitors at a roundtable discussion each night.The first series of the show's celebrity spin-off was a huge ratings success for the BBC, reaching more than 15 million viewers (including catch-up viewing) when it concluded last November.Carr presents his new series, Secret Genius, alongisde Susie Dent. The show begins on Sunday and Channel 4 says it is intended to \"spotlight the country's undiscovered brainboxes\".",

    "body": "32 minutes agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesFormer CNN host Don Lemon has been arrested after he entered a Minnesota church and filmed anti-immigration enforcement protesters as they disrupted a service.Lemon, now an independent journalist, was taken into custody by federal agents on Thursday night while in Los Angeles covering the Grammy Awards, according to his lawyer Abbe Lowell.\"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" Lowell said. Lemon, 59, is due to appear in federal court in LA on Friday.He went into the Cities Church in St Paul on 18 January with a group of protesters who said one of the pastors was an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official. \"Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,\" Lowell said in a statement posted to his client's Instagram account on Friday.The lawyer added: \"This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand.\"In his own defence, Lemon said in a recent video: \"Once the protest started in the church, we did an act of journalism, which was report on it.\"US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday that federal agents also arrested three others: Trahern Jeen Crews, local independent journalist Georgia Fort and Jamael Lydell Lundy.She accused them and Lemon of participating in a \"coordinated attack\" on the church. The exact charges the government will bring against Lemon is unclear. The BBC has contacted the Department of Justice for comment. President Donald Trump's administration initially sought to charge eight people involved in the Minnesota church protest with conspiring to deprive rights and interfering with someone's religious freedom in a house of worship.But a magistrate judge who reviewed the evidence approved charges for only three of those involved, excluding Lemon.The government challenged that decision, but an appeals court suggested prosecutors take the case to a federal grand jury - a panel of citizens that evaluates if there is enough evidence to charge someone in a case.Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 after 17 years with the company. The morning show host had apologised for on-air comments that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, then 51, was past her prime. In the Minnesota church protest, he live-streamed with anti-ICE protesters on YouTube. The broadcast began with Lemon standing with the group in a car park where he says: \"This is an operation that is secret.\"I can't tell you what is going to happen, but you're going to watch it live unfold here on 'The Don Lemon Show.'\"He followed the group - whom he called \"resistance protesters\" - into the church, initially without his camera operator. His microphone picked up audio of a woman shouting \"excuse me pastor\", as someone from the church appears to be speaking mid-service. Protesters chant \"Justice for Renee Good\", referring to the US citizen who was fatally shot in her vehicle on 7 January during a confrontation with an ICE officer in Minneapolis.Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other. Lemon repeatedly says he is there as a journalist and is unaffiliated with demonstrators.\"We're not part of the activists, but we're here just reporting on them,\" he says.The pastor says: \"This is unacceptable, it's shameful. It's shameful to interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship.\" Harmeet Dhillon, of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, said during an interview with podcaster Megyn Kelly on Friday: \"We're going to pursue this to the ends of the Earth.\"CNN said the arrest of its former employee raised \"profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment\". The network said it would follow Lemon's case closely.This is the second high-profile case of the Trump administration taking action against a journalist this month, raising the alarm of free speech advocates. On 14 January, the FBI showed up unannounced to the home of a Washington Post journalist with a search warrant and seized her devices over the alleged leak of classified information.Protests are continuing in Minnesota, where an operation by federal immigration agents has sparked confrontations that have left two US citizens dead: Renee Good, a mother-of-three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHafsa KhalilReutersMembers of the Kurdish-led SDF queue to settle their status with the Syrian government on 27 January, 2026Syria's government has reached a deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance that would see the gradual intergration of Kurdish forces and institutions into the state.This comes after weeks of clashes which saw Syrian troops reclaim large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under SDF control for more than a decade. US envoy Tom Barrack called it \"a profound and historic milestone in Syria's journey toward national reconciliation, unity, and enduring stability\".Earlier this month - and after its major territorial losses - the SDF agreed to a ceasefire that saw much of its hold brought under government control, but reports of clashes continued.Much like that 14-point agreement, Friday's deal would see SDF withdraw from points of contact, its members join the Syrian army and government, and the integration of its administrative and civil bodies into those of the state.The SDF said the agreement also includes the formation of a military division consisting of three brigades made of its members.The statement on X added that an agreement on the civil and educational rights for Kurdish people was also reached, as well as a guarantee that those displaced would be allowed to return to their homes.Part of the deal saw the transfer of prisons, oil and gas fields - which were under SDF control - to Damascus.Syrian troops seized control of the Omar facility, the country's largest oilfield, after the SDF pulled back. Earlier, the army took the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river.The Kurds previously controlled nearly a third of Syria's territory with the support of the US after it helped defeat the Islamic State (IS) group. Their recent losses mark the biggest change of control in the country since the toppling of former leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, which ended Syria's 13-year civil war.Since leading the rebel offensive that overthrew the Assad regime, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify a divided Syria. After the ceasefire was agreed on 18 January, he said he hoped it would allow the country to \"end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress\". Sharaa also issued a decree recognising Kurdish cultural, linguistic and civil rights by making Kurdish a national language, granting nationality to stateless Kurds, and declaring their new year a national holiday.This is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946.This agreement followed months of stalled negotiations over a March 2025 integration deal, which both sides had accused each other of trying to derail.",

    "body": "6 minutes agoDanielle KayeandNick Edser,Business reportersReutersUS President Donald Trump has picked Kevin Warsh to lead the US Federal Reserve when current chairman Jerome Powell's four-year term ends in May.Warsh is a former Fed governor and was considered for chair during Trump's first term. He has been an outspoken Fed critic and is expected to support lower interest rates in the near term.The appointment comes amid mounting worries about the Fed's independence, following Trump's increasing attacks on Powell in recent months.Powell has angered Trump by not cutting interest rates quickly enough, and federal prosecutors recently opened a criminal investigation over testimony he gave to the Senate about renovations to Fed buildings.The Department of Justice (DoJ) probe prompted a forceful condemnation from Powell and messages of support from former Fed chairs and central bank heads.Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, had re-emerged in recent weeks as a potential choice for the top job as speculation grew over who would replace the under-fire incumbent.Announcing the nomination on Truth Social, Trump said Warsh \"will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best\".Warsh's appointment still needs to be approved by the Senate, meaning it could face lengthy delays.If confirmed for the role, he will take the helm of the Fed at an unusually tense time, as economists and Wall Street investors monitor threats to the central bank's autonomy.Who is Kevin Warsh? Warsh, a 55-year-old economist, is a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and serves on the board of courier UPS. He has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet.Warsh has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job, going as far as calling for \"regime change\".He had a relatively \"hawkish\" reputation as a Fed governor, meaning he tended to favour higher interest rates and took more seriously concerns about inflation.But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned his logic.The Fed this week voted to hold interest rates steady, despite the White House pushing for a cut. Policymakers are continuing to monitor the effect on the economy of last year's trio of interest rate cuts.There are signs the US employment market is stabilising - job creation is sluggish but the unemployment rate has ticked lower. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target.\"Warsh will have to convince his colleagues that rate cuts are appropriate this year, an argument that is unlikely to win unless the labour market shows renewed signs of weakening or inflationary pressures ease materially later this year,\" economists at Deutsche Bank wrote in a research note on Friday.Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. He is married to Jane Lauder, whose family is known for the Estee Lauder cosmetics group. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a long-time Trump donor and ally.Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has said he will oppose Trump's nominees until the potential legal case against Powell is resolved.Trump has also taken aim at Fed governor Lisa Cook, whom he wants to remove. He has accused her of engaging in mortgage fraud, which she has denied. The Supreme Court is now assessing the case.Warsh had been seen of one of four leading candidates for the Fed job. The other frontrunners were White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, Fed governor Christopher Waller and Wall Street bond guru Rick Rieder.When Warsh takes up his role, financial markets will keep a close eye on how independently he acts of President Trump.Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said Warsh \"seems like a relatively safe choice\".\"Warsh's long-running hawkish views should help to counteract concerns that he might morph into a full-blown Trump stooge,\" he added.As news of Warsh's impending nomination started to leak out, the dollar strengthened slightly while the price of gold sank by 6%.Stuart Clark, portfolio manager at wealth management business Quilter, said investors would be \"breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief\" at Warsh's nomination.\"Warsh was in contention for the job back in 2017 and as such comes to the role with a level of authority that is respected across the market,\" he added.\"Concerns around Fed independence and an erosion on this should now be tempered, although Warsh's words and actions will be scrutinised by market participants intensely.\"",

Enquiries are currently ongoing.\"The Sun quoted a source close to the couple who said they had been left devastated by the burglary.On Friday afternoon, Manchester City's assistant manager Pep Ljinders said he hadn't personally spoken to Dias about what happened, but added: \"We try to support  as a club, of course.\"Ljinders, who was speaking during a routine press conference, also added: \"What I can say is he will come back Monday to team training.

I will bring the people of Gorton and Denton together.\"The by-election on 26 February in the Greater Manchester constituency was triggered by the resignation of Andrew Gwynne on health grounds.'Crucial by-election'Spencer, who stood in the 2024 Greater Manchester mayoral election, said: \"I work as a plumber, something I've done since leaving education at 16. I'm training to become a plasterer too. \"I've lived in the constituency and still work here. So, I know the issues and what people want to change.\"She added: \"This is a crucial by-election. The choice is clear – Green v Reform. Hope v hate.\"Her party's leader Zack Polanski said: \"The Houses of Parliament. Leaky roofs, crumbling walls. I think they need a plumber and a plasterer and we've got someone who can do both.\"Earlier this week, the Green Party confirmed Polanski, who was born and grew up in Greater Manchester, would not be standing in the seat. PA MediaMatt Goodwin and Nigel Farage on the campaign trail in Gorton and DentonAt the general election in 2024, the Green Party came third in the constituency, just behind Reform UK. Labour won the seat with a majority of 13,000 but has suffered a decline in popularity nationally since the general election and is expected to face more of a challenge this time around.The party has yet to select its candidate having blocked Andy Burnham from entering the contest. The Greater Manchester mayor had wanted to throw his hat in the ring, but Labour's ruling National Executive Committee prevented him from being considered as a candidate. Defending its decision, the committee said that if Burnham won the seat it would trigger an \"unnecessary election\" for the mayoralty, diverting party resources away from other elections.Had he been elected as an MP, Burnham would have been in a position to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the Labour Party leadership. The NEC's decision triggered anger among some MPs who backed Burnham and believed he was the party's best chance at holding on to the seat. Reform UK have picked GB News presenter and former academic Matt Goodwin to run in the seat. Speaking at his unveiling as a candidate, Goodwin said he was \"not part of the Westminster blob\" and would give local people a voice in Parliament. He said the by-election would be \"a referendum on Keir Starmer\". Labour has drawn attention to the backing Goodwin has received from far-right activist Tommy Robinson.Speaking during a campaigning visit to the constituency, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said Muslim voters did not need to fear his party saying \"there are plenty of members of the Muslim community who will vote for Reform\".More on this storyGreen Party Manchester",

    "body": "15 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesOn paper, the job at a small PR agency looked ideal: a tight team, high-profile clients and the chance to build a fast-moving career.But what Maya (not her real name) had not anticipated was a \"toxic boss\" who set \"impossibly high standards\" and publicly berated staff who didn't meet them. \"She would regularly call people out in front of the whole team flinging insults like 'are you thick?' and 'this work is rubbish',\" she tells the BBC.Maya says her manager's behaviour often strayed way beyond performance management and into personal attacks.When a colleague said she had hired a personal trainer ahead of her wedding her boss left a photograph of a \"fat bride\" on her desk. A few months into the job, Maya realised that \"every single one of my colleagues would cry almost daily\". There was persistent sickness among the team \"due to poor mental health\", she says. Maya eventually left. Toxic or a personality clash?But, not every bad manager is toxic and understanding the difference matters, says Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute.Many leaders fall into what the institute calls the \"accidental manager\" category where people are promoted for technical skill rather than leadership ability. In those cases, poor behaviour is usually driven by inexperience or uncertainty, not intent.A toxic boss, she says, is different as \"they lack both empathy and often self-awareness\". \"They can actively undermine their team, take credit for others' work, or rule by fear and have unrealistic expectations,\" Francke explains. The impact goes beyond personality clashes, creating anxiety that can damage both mental health and performance.\"If you have a knot in your stomach on Monday morning, constantly cowering in corridors to avoid confrontation or if you are scared to speak up in meetings for fear of retribution, that is toxicity, not a personality clash,\" she says.Getty ImagesRachel McAdams stars in Send Help where she is stranded with her toxic bossJosie (not her real name) says she spent years working for a manager who kept her under constant surveillance.\"She would relentlessly call, text and voice-note me all day long, starting from 7am until 10pm at night,\" Josie tells the BBC. \"Even on days she wasn't working she wanted to know where you were at all times.\"She also took projects away from Josie and gave them to other people and excluded members of the team from group lunches.Hannah (not her real name) told the BBC she was regularly humiliated by her boss while working for a major supermarket chain.Once she arrived at a corporate event wearing the same jumper as one of the guests.\"My boss made me take my jumper off and work the event in my vest in November,\" she tells the BBC. \"I felt like such an idiot and it was humiliating.\"The tension between a toxic boss and one of their team members is explored in Send Help, a darkly comic survival thriller in which a manager and employee are forced to confront unresolved workplace tensions after becoming stranded together on a desert island following a plane crash.Speaking at the premiere, Rachel McAdams, who plays the hard done by employee, says she's experienced difficult workplaces and remembers a particularly bad boss at a summer job.“I just quit and my advice would be to quietly quit if you can and if not try and practise some zen.”Getty ImagesRicky Gervais played David Brent - the self-absorbed manager of Slough paper merchants Wernham HoggHow to deal with a toxic bossBut often quitting isn't an option until you can find another role. Francke says there are ways to manage the situation while you decide what comes next. She recommends: Tell someone: Find a mentor outside your reporting line who understands the organisation and can offer honest, independent advice.Challenge the behaviour: Don't ambush your boss but book a meeting and raise concerns calmly and formally with specific examples. If your colleagues are also affected, consider addressing it together to show the wider impact. Your boss might not realise the damage they are causing with their behaviour.Protect yourself: Set boundaries, prioritise wellbeing and create space outside work. It can be tough, but learning how to detach yourself from a situation will help you regain perspective and plan next steps.Use HR carefully: If your organisation has good HR you can certainly confide in them but it's worth checking whether they have a record of tackling bad behaviour rather than ignoring it.Know when to escalate: If behaviour is abusive or poses reputational risk, a formal whistleblowing process may be necessary but this can be harder to do for fear of retribution.

    "body": "Just nowMaia DaviesandImogen Foulkes,Geneva correspondentReutersAntónio Guterres said he could not \"overstate the urgency of the situation\"The United Nations is at risk of \"imminent financial collapse\" due to member states not paying their fees, the body's head has warned.António Guterres said the UN faced a financial crisis which was \"deepening, threatening programme delivery\", and that money could run out by July.He wrote in a letter to all 193 member states that they had to honour their mandatory payments or overhaul the organisation's financial rules to avoid collapse.It comes after the UN's largest contributor, the US, refused to contribute to its regular and peacekeeping budgets, and withdrew from several agencies it called a \"waste of taxpayer dollars\". Several other members are in arrears or are simply refusing to pay.Though the UN General Assembly did approve in late 2025 a partial change to its financial system, the organisation still faces a massive cash crisis. At its headquarters in Geneva, signs warning of the situation have been put up everywhere. In an almost desperate attempt to save cash, the escalators are regularly turned off and the heating turned down.Guterres wrote in his letter that the UN had faced financial crises in the past but that the current situation was \"categorically different\".\"Decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced,\" the secretary general said, without naming specific members.He said the \"integrity of the entire system\" depended on states adhering to their obligation under the UN charter to pay their \"assessed contributions\", adding that 2025 ended with a record amount unpaid - equivalent to 77% of the total owed.Guterres said a rule that the UN must return unspent money on particular programmes to members if it could not implement a budget created a \"double blow\" in which it was \"expected to give back cash that does not exist\".\"I cannot overstate the urgency of the situation we now face. We cannot execute budgets with uncollected funds, nor return funds we never received.\"As a result, the UN is now returning millions of dollars that it never actually received. The letter reads: \"Just this month, as part of the 2026 assessment, we were compelled to return $227m [£165m]  – funds we have not collected.\"\"The bottom line is clear,\" Guterres wrote. \"Either all member states honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or member states must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse.\"UN agencies rarely get all the money they ask for to tackle humanitarian crises, but the past 12 months have been particularly difficult. The US is the UN's largest contributor, but President Donald Trump has said it was not fulfilling its \"great potential\" and has criticised it for failing to support US-led peace efforts.The US did not pay its contribution to the UN's regular budget in 2025 and offered only 30% of its expected funding to UN peacekeeping operations.Other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have also announced significant reductions in foreign aid, which will inevitably impact the UN's work.Guterres had warned earlier that same month that the UN faced its most fragile financial position in years - again citing unpaid fees - having said in October that it faced a \"race to bankruptcy\".Trump has separately been accused by critics of seeking to replace some functions of the UN with his Board of Peace to oversee regeneration efforts in Gaza.The US president has said its work would happen \"in conjunction with the United Nations\" - but when previously asked by a Fox TV journalist whether the board would take the UN's place, he replied: \"Well, it might.\"The US officially left UN's World Health Organization last week. It had refused to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues despite, WHO lawyers say, being legally obliged to do so.Other agencies are also making huge cuts. The UN's human rights office has warned that serious violations will now go undocumented because it lacks the funds to deploy investigators. In the past, their evidence has led to prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity.In Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, UN Women has had to close mother and baby clinics. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme has had to cut rations to refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan.",

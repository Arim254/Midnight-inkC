    "body": "With his first Formula 1 world championship, Lando Norris joins an illustrious sporting club.Only 35 drivers in the 75-year history of the sport have won the F1 title, and 11 of them - by far the largest number from a single country - are, like Norris, from the UK.All of them are different, wrote larger or smaller chapters in the history of the sport. From Lewis Hamilton, the most successful driver of all time, with seven titles and 105 wins, to the one-time winners such as Mike Hawthorn, John Surtees, James Hunt and Damon Hill - who, like Jenson Button, was in Abu Dhabi to watch Norris secure his crown.On Sunday night in Yas Marina, the game everyone who watches and enjoys sport likes to play had already started. Where does this achievement stand in the annals? How good is Norris?In truth, this starts as a soon as a sportsperson arrives on the scene, especially when it's apparent they are heading for the top. And it has always been clear that Norris was. His level of talent and pace have always marked him out as a future world champion.From there, in F1, as in all elite sport, it's about fine margins, not just how fast a driver is, but how consistently they can achieve their best level, how few mistakes they make on the way.And Norris, although already seven seasons into his F1 career, is only just getting going at the very peak of the sport.He has had an absolutely competitive car only for a season and a half, a very good one only for a year more than that. And at 26, he has many more years of running at the front to come. His story, the assessment of his standing, is in its early stages.This year, Norris has gone toe to toe with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, acknowledged widely as the finest driver of his generation, the one who most consistently takes his equipment to the very edge of the possible.Norris has won that battle, by two points over the Dutchman, and 13 over his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, after a season that has ebbed and flowed between the three of them.And Norris knows what's coming now.\"I hate ever having to try and compare myself to other people,\" he said on Sunday night. \"This is all for you guys to decide, whether someone's better than someone else or not.\"All I try and do every weekend is the best of what I can. But then you decide 'he's better than him, or he's got a worse car and he's doing better'. Write what you like, decide what you like.\"I certainly feel like at moments I've driven better than I feel like other people can. And I feel like I drove at a level I don't think other people can match.\"But have I also made my mistakes? Have I made more mistakes than other people at times? Yes. Is there stuff Max could do better at times than me? Yes. Do I believe he's unbeatable? No.\"But you also don't know, do you? It's hard to know.\"Like, they also struggled with the car in the mid part of the season. They've had an incredible second half of the season.\"They took advantage of the fact we had two of us fighting for a world championship. He really made the most of that, and Max drove like he is a four-time world champion. And I'm very happy that I got to race against him and try to prove myself against him.\"There is an endearing, naked honesty to Norris. He's not afraid to face the hard questions in public, nor to express his emotions, or admit his weaknesses.Though he said he does not like comparisons, he has done it himself at times. And on Sunday, he was admonishing himself for it. For some remarks he has made about the way Verstappen drives (he didn't say which, exactly), or when a few years ago he seemed to downplay Lewis Hamilton's achievements by saying his car was so good all he had to do was beat his team-mate.\"I know at times I say some stupid things,\" Norris said, \"and I say some things about Max, or I might have said some things at times in the past that everyone talks about, about Lewis. Some things I regret and I wish I could take back and never have come out my mouth.\"I honestly believe I give more respect to anyone else than anyone else. I give more respect to Oscar. I give more respect to Max. I try and give as much respect as I can to Lewis - he's seven-time world champion.\"He's the best driver - you compare him to (Michael) Schumacher - the best driver that's ever been in Formula 1. I'm not even close to that. I might never be. I dream of those kind of things.\"This year, no one would question the fact that the McLaren has, on balance, been the best car. There have been times when Verstappen has beaten both Norris and Piastri with breathtaking excellence, when he really shouldn't have.The Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka in April was an example, when both McLaren drivers failed to nail their qualifying laps, and Verstappen produced a lap of absolute perfection to steal pole position by just 0.012 seconds. And from there, the race victory.That prompted an admiring remark from Fernando Alonso, a two-time champion and living legend of the sport.\"Only he can do it,\" Alonso said of Verstappen. \"He's an outstanding driver. He's proving it every weekend.\"Hats off for him. I think the lap he did today is only down to him. The car is clearly not at the level to fight for pole or even the top five. But he manages to do that magical laps and magical weekends. At the moment, he's the best, he's the reference for all of us, and we need to keep improving to reach that level.\"On Sunday in Abu Dhabi, though, Alonso was among the many offering congratulations to Norris, of whose ability he is very well aware.The pair raced together in the same car at the Daytona 24 Hours in 2018, where Norris proved every bit as fast as Alonso. And they were team-mates at McLaren that year, where Norris was reserve driver, before graduating to F1 in Alonso's seat the following season after the Spaniard went off to race elsewhere for a couple of years.\"All three of them, they drove amazingly well this year,\" Alonso said on Sunday, \"and even now with the extra pressure in the last race they qualified and finished in the top three.\"All three are world champions. Only one can win. This time it was Lando. So congratulations to him. You dream to be an F1 driver eventually and then to win the championship. That day arrived for him. I hope he enjoys and (it's) well deserved.\"The thing is, while the McLaren was a better car than the Red Bull over the balance of the season, undoubtedly there were times when the Red Bull, at least with Verstappen in it, was better than the McLaren. It could be argued it ended the season consistently that way.As Norris says, one of the complications of F1 is that the cars are different, and different drivers prefer cars to behave in different ways. So trying judge whether Verstappen would do a better job than Norris in a McLaren, or Norris than Verstappen in a Red Bull, is impossible. Any conclusion can only be subjective.Norris says: \"I'm sure if you compare me, if that's what you wanna do, to all the champions: have I been as aggressive as them at times? No. Have I been as daring as them at times? No.\"But did I do just what I needed to do to win the World Championship? Did I perform consistently? Did I perform when I needed to under the most pressure? Post-Zandvoort, did I come back in the way I had to? Did I have three, four weekends of great results? I did.\"And I performed when I needed to perform to win the World Championship this season. And in the end, that's what I needed to do. That's all I needed to do.\"Of course, I'll learn from everything. Moments I wish I could go back on and I feel bad for, like Montreal and things like that, I embarrassed myself. But I wish I could go back and change some things.\"Plenty of moments to learn from. I feel like I'm a better driver now, certainly, than I was at the beginning of the season.\"That Norris would reference his errors, particularly running into the back of Piastri and causing his own retirement at the Canadian Grand Prix, is typical of him.His story has been one of personal development, and his season has been the same.Some would argue that perhaps he has needed more help and support through his career than some of the greats - the likes of Schumacher, Verstappen and Alonso appear iron-clad.But perhaps that's just a perception. Great drivers - great sportspeople - don't become that without an immense amount of hard work behind the scenes. Without analysing their weaknesses, working on them, trying to mitigate or eradicate them.Perhaps the difference with Norris is that he just talks about this more than most.Few people are better qualified to assess Norris and his success than Andrea Stella, the McLaren team principal.Stella, a 54-year-old Italian, has won titles working with Schumacher and Kimi Raikkonen, and agonisingly lost them with Alonso.\"When it comes to the quality of the driver, the quality of the success that Lando achieved this season, the level of F1 drivers nowadays is very, very high,\" he said.\"Probably because the drivers have already, from when they drive go-karts, they have telemetry data, they are so well-supported, and they're just on pace. We see that for some established drivers, it's sometimes difficult to keep up with the new generation.\"So it's a very high-quality achievement. It's also an achievement that beats Max Verstappen, four times world champion in a team that knows the game very well. So it's one that is very, very high-level, very high-quality, very prestigious.\"Jenson Button – 2009A British Williams protege, Button entered F1 aged only 20 in 2000.However, a unenvied ability to seemingly jump into the wrong car in the wrong team at the wrong time seemed to stunt his ability to show the world his ability to full effect.That was until he jumped into the right car at exactly the right time, just as Honda left a whole factory in the lurch, and team boss Ross Brawn steered the independent Brawn GP with few resources to the title before the advancing Red Bulls.Jim Clark – 1963, 1965Often cited as one of the greatest alongside Juan Manuel Fangio, Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton, Lotus driver Clark died at 32 in a crash during a Formula 2 race in 1968.He had achieved more races wins and pole positions than any other driver at the time of his death.Thanks to an upbringing on the Scottish borders rallying and hill climbing, his innate feel of his cars and ability to adapt to changing conditions, such as weather and tyres, saw him considered the ultimate adaptive driver – years before that accolade was so often credited to Fernando Alonso.Lewis Hamilton 2008, 2014-15, 2017-2020Hamilton shares the most titles ever won with Schumacher at seven.His dominance on the track and in the garage, along with a superb racing instinct and scientific ability to sense tyre wear, means he boasts the most race wins in history, along with topping many other significant stats in the sport.Even if the 40-year-old never wins another race in F1, his status is assured.Mike Hawthorn - 1958A bow-tie wearing gent with a shock of blond hair, Hawthorn became Britain's first world champion eight years into Formula 1's existence.He clinched the title at the Moroccan Grand Prix for Ferrari, doing a Lando Norris by driving conservatively, after a season-long battle with fellow Briton Stirling Moss, who actually won more races than Hawthorn.Hawthorn was killed a few months later in a car crash on the A3 near Guilford.Graham Hill – 1962, 1968Hill was another gent from an age when drivers risked everything in cars for which safety features were a virtually non-existent consideration.A famously pencil-moustachioed Hill won his titles for BRM in 1962 and Lotus in 1968, beating fellow Britons Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart respectively.A few years later his entrepreneurial spirit saw him set up his own team, before he was killed in a plane crash in 1975 returning from a testing session in France.But his name and legacy would return to the F1 grid…Damon Hill - 1996The son of Graham, he was propelled to team leader by the 1994 death of legendary three-time champion Ayrton Senna three races into his Williams career.Hill appeared less steely than his contemporaries, such as an emerging Michael Schumacher, and perhaps not as ruthless.But a Adrian Newey-designed rocket ship from Williams saw him overcome a development phase Schumacher at Ferrari and a rough diamond debutant in team-mate Jacques Villeneuve.James Hunt – 1976The antithesis of laser-focused, but loved all the more for it, Hunt lived his whole life flat-out, dying after a heart attack at 45 in 1993, at the time working as a BBC F1 pundit.Rising to prominence with the aristocratic Hesketh Racing, Hunt's ability behind the wheel shone through his personal indulgences just enough for him to win his first and only title with McLaren.Victory was perhaps aided by a horrifying mid-season crash for Ferrari's Niki Lauda, which kept the Austrian out for several races, but Hunt's victory was nevertheless heroically received.Nigel Mansell – 1992A British champion who arguably should have won more than one title, Mansell's gung-ho approach saw him create as many memories, such as from fainting while pushing a car to the finish or watching his title hopes explode into shards of rubber, as did his wins.His 1992 title ushered in a period on dominance for Williams just as cars were beginning to become technical masterpieces over the grunting monsters of the eras before them.The first Silverstone super-hero, who captured the British imagination like no other before him.Jackie Stewart – 1969, 1971, 1973In an era of high technological achievements, such as the moon landing and Concorde, three-time champion Stewart was the blueprint for the modern sportsperson.Laser-focused, and at every marketing function going, wearing the right watch and the right sponsor jacket, Stewart won the title for the Tyrrell team three times, the first time driving a Matra.He campaigned for safety like no other driver and still often graces the paddock today, at the age of 86.John Surtees – 1964There were plenty of British title winners in the sixties in what was a very British sport, but the softly spoken Surtees stood out as an international talent.A multiple world champion on motorbikes as well, Enzo Ferrari recognised his ability, with Surtees winning the Scuderia's fifth F1 drivers' title and as the second Briton to do so after Hawthorn.There hasn't been a British Ferrari title winner since. No pressure, Lewis.",

    "body": "Jeremy Bowen: Syria feels lighter without the Assads' crushing weight - but now there are new problems10 hours agoJeremy BowenInternational EditorBBCA year ago, the war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down.A rebel force had broken out of Idlib, a Syrian province on the border with Turkey, and was storming towards Damascus. It was led by a man known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, and his militia group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Jolani was a nom-de-guerre, reflecting his family's roots in the Golan Heights, Syria's southern highlands, annexed by Israel after it was occupied in 1967. His real name is Ahmed al-Sharaa.One year later, he is interim president, and Bashar al-Assad is in a gilded exile in Russia. Syria is still in ruins. In every city and village I have visited this last 10 days, people were living in skeletal buildings gutted by war. But for all the new Syria's problems, it feels much lighter without the crushing, cruel weight of the Assads.Getty ImagesSyria is still in ruins. In cities and villages, many people are living in skeletal buildings gutted by warSharaa has found the going easier abroad than at home. He has won the argument with Saudi Arabia and the West that he is Syria's best chance of a stable future.In May, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia arranged a brief meeting between Sharaa and US President Donald Trump. Afterwards, Trump called him a \"young attractive tough guy\".At home, Syrians know his weaknesses and the problems Syria faces better than foreigners. Sharaa's writ does not run in the north-east, where the Kurds are in control, or parts of the south where Syrian Druze, another minority sect, want a separate state backed by their Israeli allies. On the coast Alawites – Assad's sect – fear a repeat of the massacres they suffered in March.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump called him a 'young attractive tough guy'A year ago, the new masters of Damascus, like most of the armed rebels in Syria, were Sunni Islamists. Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects. Sunnis are the majority. As well as Kurds and Druze, there are Christians, many of whom find it hard to forget Sharaa's jihadist past.Image of a man who outgrew his jihadist rootsIn the first week of December last year, it was hard to believe that the HTS offensive was moving so fast. It took them three days to capture Aleppo, Syria's northern powerhouse.Compare that with the tortured years between 2012 and 2016, when the regime's army and rebel militias had fought for control of the city: that had ended in victory for Assad after Russia's president Vladimir Putin deployed his air force and artillery to add decisive firepower to the regime's ruthless tactics.When I visited the former rebel strongholds in eastern Aleppo a few weeks after they had fallen to the regime, large areas were devastated by Russian bombing. Some streets were blocked by rubble that went up to first-floor balconies.But by the end of 2024, across the country, government troops had melted away. Both reluctant conscripts and regime loyalists were no longer prepared to fight and die for a corrupt and cruel regime that repaid them with poverty and oppression.AFP via Getty ImagesOne year ago - celebrations marking the dawn of a new era for SyriaA few days after Assad fled with his family to Russia, I interviewed Syria's victorious new leader in the presidential palace.It perches high on a crag overlooking Damascus, designed as an ever-visible reminder for the city's citizens of the all-seeing power of the Assads. By then Jolani had discarded his name, along with his combat fatigues.Sharaa sat down in the chilly halls of the unheated palace wearing a smart jacket, pressed trousers and shiny black shoes. He told me that the country was exhausted by war and was not a threat to its neighbours or to the West, insisting that they would govern for all Syrians. It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.Israel dismissed it, however. And jihadist hardliners branded Sharaa as a traitor, selling out his religion and his own history.Watch: BBC speaks to Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-SharaaI had packed in a hurry to report on a war, never expecting the regime to crumble so fast. My formal attire was back at home in London. After the interview one of his aides complained that I should have worn a suit to interview a national leader.His grumble was about more than my sartorial choices. It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib. The campaign was designed to present him as a man who had outgrown his jihadist roots to become a worthy leader of all Syria, a leader the rest of the world should take seriously and treat with respect.A weakened IS in SyriaSharaa took power amid huge uncertainty about what he might do, and what might be done to him by his enemies. Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.The reality is that IS in Syria is weak. Its attacks this year have been mostly against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east.That has changed in the last few weeks, leading up to the anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime.Getty ImagesThe war that President Bashar al-Assad seemed to have won was turned upside down one year agoAs security forces have raided IS cells, the jihadists have killed three soldiers and two former Assad operatives in cities controlled by the government, according to data collected by Charles Lister, a leading commentator on Syria, and published in a newsletter Syria Weekly. IS social media channels monitored by the BBC continue to tell Syrian Sunnis that Sharaa has betrayed them.Without producing any proof, they have posted claims that he has been an agent of the US and UK, working to undermine the jihadist project.Winning over Trump and the westSharaa's overtures to the west have been remarkably successful.Within two weeks of taking power in Syria, he received a delegation of senior American diplomats. Immediately, the Americans scrapped the $10 million bounty the they had put on his arrest.Since then, sanctions imposed on Assad's Syria have been steadily reduced. The most swingeing, the Caesar Act, has been suspended and could be repealed by the US Congress in the new year.A major milestone came in November when Sharaa became the first Syrian president to visit the White House.APTrump sprayed Sharaa with cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take homeTrump's welcome in the Oval Office was relaxed. He sprayed Sharaa with Trump-branded cologne, before presenting him with his own supply to take home for his wife, jokingly asking him how many he has. \"One,\" Sharaa answered, as he blinked away clouds of fragrance.Away from the larking around for the cameras, Saudi Arabia as well as western governments see Sharaa as the best bet – the only one – to stabilise a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East. If Syria slipped back into civil war, there would be zero chance of reducing the violent turbulence in the region.One senior western diplomat told me that the conditions for civil war still exist. That is because of the lasting scars of half a century of dictatorship and 14 years of a war that started as an uprising against the Assads' oppressive rule and turned into an increasingly sectarian fight.AFP via Getty ImagesMany western governments see Sharaa as the best bet to stabilise Syria. His minister for foreign affairs, Assad al-Shaibani is front rightSharaa is a Sunni Muslim, Syria's largest religious group. His government does not control the whole country. In the last year he has not been able to persuade, or force, Kurds in the north-east and Druze in the south to accept the authority of Damascus. On the coast, the Alawite community is nervous and restive.The Alawites are a sect that originated in Shia Islam, with their heartland on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The Assads are Alawites.The founder of the regime, Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad, built his power on the Alawite minority, around 10% of the population. Just the sound of the Alawite accent, especially coming from a man in uniform – or worse, a leather-jacketed operative from one of the regime's intelligence agencies – used to make other Syrians nervous.Syria will not recover if sectarian killing continues. Stopping more serious outbreaks of violence in the next 12 months is the government's most serious challenge.The slow pace of justiceJust before the anniversary of Assad's fall, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressed serious concern about the slow pace of justice. A spokesman said, \"While the interim authorities have taken encouraging steps towards addressing past violations, these steps are only the beginning of what needs to be done.\"Some Syrians have taken matters into their own hands, along, at times, with government forces. The OHCHR said that hundreds have been killed over the past year \"by the security forces and affiliated groups, elements associated with the former government, local armed groups and unidentified armed individuals\".They added: \"Other reported violations and abuses include sexual violence, arbitrary detentions, destruction of homes, forced evictions, and restrictions on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.\"Alawite, Druze, Christian and Bedouin communities were mainly affected by the violence, the OHCHR said, which has been fed by rising hate speech both on- and offline.Anadolu via Getty ImagesA graduation ceremony for general security personnel last monthA big risk for 2026 is a repeat of last March's sectarian violence in Alawite areas.In the security vacuum that followed the fall of the Assad regime, the new government attempted to stamp its authority on the Syrian coast with a series of arrests. An investigation by OCHCR found that \"pro-former government fighters responded by capturing, killing, and injuring hundreds of interim government forces\".Damascus responded harshly and lost control of militant armed factions that carried a systematic series of deadly attacks on Alawites.The UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed in the ensuing massacres. The vast majority were adult men, but victims included approximately 100 women, the elderly and the disabled, as well as children.The Sharaa government cooperated with the UN investigation. Some of its forces managed to rescue Alawites and it has put some of the ringleaders of the massacres on trial. ReutersThe UN found that some 1,400 people, predominantly civilians, were reported killed during sectarian violence in Alawite areas in MarchThe UN Syria Commission of Inquiry confirmed it had found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks. But the concern then and for the future was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groups that had supposedly joined its security forces.In July in the southern province of Suweida, serious violence between Druze and Bedouin communities shook the Sharaa administration to its roots. The Druze religion developed out of Islam around a thousand years ago, and its followers, who some Muslims believe are heretics, amount to around 3% of Syria's population.When government forces entered Suweida, supposedly to restore order, they ended up fighting Druze militias. Israel, which has its own Druze community that is fiercely loyal to the Jewish state, intervened. Its airstrikes included the near destruction of the ministry of defence in Damascus. It took a rapid American intervention to force a ceasefire that stopped a spiral down into much worse violence. Tens of thousands of people were driven from their homes and remain displaced.Getty ImagesA UN inquiry found no evidence the authorities had ordered the attacks in March. But the concern was that the Damascus government could not control armed Sunni groupsThe Israel questionIt is still not clear whether Sharaa and his interim government are strong enough to survive another crisis as serious as that. Israel remains a looming and dangerous presence to Syrians.After the fall of Assad, the Israelis launched a series of major air strikes to destroy what was left of the old regime's military capacity. The IDF advanced out of the occupied Golan Heights to take control of more Syrian territory, which it still holds.The Israelis were taking advantage of the chaos in Syria to weaken a country it saw as hostile, destroying weapons it said might be turned in its direction.More from InDepthAttempts by the US to broker a security agreement between Israel and Syria have stalled in the last two months or so.Syria wants to return to an agreement originally negotiated by Henry Kissinger when he was US Secretary of State in 1974. Netanyahu wants Israel to stay in the land it seized and has demanded that Syria demilitarises a large area south of Damascus.In the last month Israel has intensified its ground incursions into Syria. Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November. The IDF said they were arresting Sunni militants who were planning attacks. Local men fought back, wounding six Israelis as the raiding party was forced into a hurried retreat, abandoning a military vehicle that they later destroyed with an airstrike. The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel. The Damascus government called it a war crime. Calls for retaliation intensified.Dia Images via Getty ImagesThe border village of Beit Jinn was raided by IDF troops on 28 NovemberIn Washington, Trump was clearly worried by the raid. He posted on his Truth Social platform that he was \"very satisfied\" with Sharaa's efforts at stabilising Syria.He warned that it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous state\".In Beit Jinn I met Khalil Abu Daher on his way back from hospital, his arm in plaster after surgery for a bullet wound. He invited me to his home, which is close to where the Israelis were exchanging fire with village men.Khalil told me he was here with his family when the Israelis entered the village at 3:30 am. They tried to find a safe place.\"I was in my house with my children. We went from one room to another. They shot at my two daughters. One was hit, and the other died instantly. When I picked her up, I was shot in the hand.\"The dead girl was 17-year-old Hiba Abu Daher, who was shot in the stomach. They sheltered, Khalil said, alongside Hiba's dead body for two hours before they were rescued and taken to hospital.When I visited, Khalil's nine-year-old daughter was lying on a blanket on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hip.Khalil's nine-year-old daughter lying on the sofa, recovering from surgery to take a bullet out of her hipThe girls' mother, Umm Mohammad, sat with the women of the family, desperately worried about the future.\"We want peace of mind,\" she told me. \"We want to live in our homes, and we want a clinic and medical staff because we don't have one.\"We also want a doctor because there isn't one in Beit Jinn, nor is there a pharmacy. We want security.\"'We go to sleep and wake up afraid'A year after the end of Assad's rule, Syria's new rulers have scored some important achievements. They are still in power, which was not guaranteed when they took Damascus. President Trump has become Sharaa's most important backer. Sanctions are being lifted. The economy is showing signs of life and business deals are being done, including modernising oil and gas installations and privatising the airports in Damascus and Aleppo.But deals that are in the pipeline have not yet changed the lives of most Syrians. The government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individuals. Sectarian tensions are unresolved and could ignite again. The US-mediated dialogue with Israel has stalled.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe government has no rebuilding fund. Reconstruction is up to individualsBenjamin Netanyahu insists that Damascus might demilitarise a large area of southern Syria and shows no signs of ordering the IDF to pull back. Both points amount to a major violation of Syrian sovereignty. The Beit Jinn raid makes it harder for Damascus to offer concessions.Government in Damascus is centred on Sharaa himself, assisted by the foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani and a few trusted associates. No serious attempt seems to be happening to create an accountable framework of government.Syria without the Assad family is a better place. But Umm Mohammad summed up the feelings of far too many Syrians.\"The future is difficult. We have nothing, not even schools. Our children are living in hell here. There is no safety for them. How will we live?\"We want safety. We go to sleep and wake up afraid.\"Top picture credits: AFP via Getty Images and Anadolu via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporter Essex Police are assessing allegations that Reform UK overspent on Nigel Farage's general election campaign in Clacton last year.The claims have been made by a former Reform councillor, who the party said was expelled several months ago.Richard Everett, a former member of Farage's campaign team, told the Daily Telegraph he believes Reform exceeded the £20,660 spending limit set by electoral law in the Essex constituency and failed to declare some costs, although he said Farage was \"blissfully unaware\" of the omissions.A Reform spokesperson denied the party had broken electoral law, saying the \"inaccurate claims come from a disgruntled former councillor\".In claims first reported by the Telegraph, Mr Everett alleged that Reform failed to declare spending on some leaflets, banners, utility bills and the refurbishment of a bar in the constituency office.He submitted documents to the Metropolitan Police and the case has now been transferred to Essex Police, which confirmed it was assessing the allegations.According to the newspaper, the documents show Reform came within £400 of the legal spending limit for the constituency but Mr Everett claims that figure excludes some costs and he believes the party overspent by around £9,000.In a statement, Essex Police said: \"We are assessing a report relating to alleged misreported expenditure by a political party in connection with the 2024 general election, following a referral to us by the Met Police.\"Farage took over as leader of Reform UK in June 2024, around a month before the general election.He won the seat of Clacton in Essex from the Conservatives with a majority of more than 8,000.Labour Party chairwoman Anna Turley said: \"Our parliamentary democracy relies on people playing by the rules so all candidates have a fair hearing with the public.\"Nigel Farage must come clean and put all the evidence on the table to prove he hasn't undermined our democracy by breaking the rules. Failure to do so will raise even more questions about what he has to hide.\"Conservative chairman Kevin Hollinrake called for a full investigation by the Electoral Commission, which oversees elections and regulates political finance in the UK, as well as the police.\"We all have an obligation to play by the rules to ensure that our elections are free and fair,\" he said.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDaniela Relph,Senior Royal correspondentandNoor Nanji,Culture reporterThe Duke of Sussex's access to security when he visits the UK is under review, sources have told the BBC.In May, Prince Harry lost a legal case to have his police protection reinstated when visiting the UK.In a BBC interview after the ruling, he said it was not safe to bring his family back to the country of his birth because he could not guarantee their safety.It is understood a Home Office review will now look at whether he should automatically receive full police protection on visits to the UK even though he is no longer a working member of the royal family.According to The Sun newspaper, the process for reassessing the duke's threat level is already under way and a decision is expected next month.King Charles has only met the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children once before. He last saw his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet, during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022.Prince Harry's security was downgraded after he stepped back from frontline royal duties in 2020 and moved to the US with the Duchess of Sussex.In his legal challenge earlier this year, he contested the decision-making process used by a committee called the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office.Ravec had concluded that because Prince Harry was going to be an infrequent visitor to the UK, his security needs would be assessed on a case by case basis.But in doing so, the duke's legal team argued that Ravec did not properly re-assess the threats he faced when considering his situation in 2020.His lawyers had argued that he had been \"singled out\" for \"inferior treatment\", but the court ruling upheld that there had been nothing unlawful about how the decision had been reached.A senior judge ruled that Prince Harry's \"sense of grievance\" over how the decision to alter his security was reached did not amount to a basis for a successful appeal.That decision meant the duke's security remained outside the automatic, high level of protection which is provided for senior royals.Speaking to BBC News in California shortly afterwards, Prince Harry said he was \"devastated\" at losing his appeal.He also said any prospect of a return to the UK for him and his family was \"impossible\" in light of the Court of Appeal ruling, adding: \"I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point.\"At the time, Buckingham Palace said: \"All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\"A government spokesperson said: \"The UK Government's protective security system is rigorous and proportionate.\"It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.\"",

    "body": "27 minutes agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterWarner Brothers DiscoveryWarner Brothers Discovery is owner of HBO, known for shows like Sex and the City Paramount Skydance has made another offer to buy Warner Bros Discovery as it seeks to trump a rival plan from Netflix to buy the company's studio and streaming networks. Paramount, which is backed by the billionaire Ellison family, said it was making a direct offer to shareholders of $30 per share to scoop up the whole of Warner Bros, including its traditional television networks.It said its proposal was a \"superior alternative\" to Netflix's, delivering more cash upfront to shareholders and greater prospect of approval by regulators. President Donald Trump has said \"there could be a problem\" with Netflix's purchase, pointing to competition concerns given the size of the companies. The bid from Paramount is the latest twist in a saga that started a few months ago, when Paramount started submitting offers to buy Warner Bros.That eventually prompted Warner Bros, owner of HBO and classics from Looney Tunes to Harry Potter, to formally open a bidding process. Warner Bros declared Netflix the winner of that auction on Friday, announcing a deal that valued its studio and streaming networks, including HBO, at about $83bn, including its debt.It said the sale would proceed after a planned spin-off of other parts of Warner Brothers' business, including CNN, into an independent company.Paramount's offer values the entire company at $108.4bn, which it said was a better deal. In an interview on CNBC, Mr Ellison also talked up the benefits of his plan for the media industry, arguing that Netflix's takeover of Warner Brothers Discovery would give one firm too much power over actors and other players in the industry.\"It's a horrible deal for Hollywood,\" he said. Mr Ellison said he had had \"great conversations\" with Trump about the deal and believed the president cared about competition. Any takeover is expected to face scrutiny from competition regulators in the US and Europe.Paramount had been seen by many on Wall Street as a strong suitor for Warner Bros, in part because the relationship between David and Larry Ellison, who is a Republican megadonor, and Trump was expected to help ease that process. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is among the financial partners Paramount is working with as part of the deal, according to paperwork submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Paramount's plan to buy all of Warner Bros was also seen as a chance to achieve  both scale and potential cost-savings, putting the traditional television networks owned by both companies on a better footing.Mr Ellison said he thought Warner Bros' plan to spin-off its traditional networks into an independent company would set them up to fail and ultimately prove a mistake for shareholders.\"I think [its shares are] going to be worth a lot less than people are claiming,\" he said. Shares in Warner Bros jumped more than 6% in opening trade on Monday, while Paramount shares were also up.Shares in Netflix, however, dropped more than 3%.Netflix is the biggest streaming company in the world, with more than 300 million subscribers. It said on Friday it believed the takeover would help supercharge its business and expressed confidence in winning approval from regulators. Analysts said the move was also defensive, aimed at making sure rivals did not get their hands on the decades of content owned by Warner Bros and turn into more viable competitors.  More than 70% of HBO Max subscribers in the US also have Netflix, according to analysts at Raymond James, who said in a report on Friday that they expected further twists in the takeover story. Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, said he thought the deal made more sense for Paramount than for Netflix, calling it simply a \"nice-to-have\" for the streamer.\"Paramount ultimately needs this deal more than Netflix,\" he said. \"Paramount remains a legacy entertainment provider that lacks the scale required for the modern age.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesX has blocked the European Commission from making adverts on its platform - a move which comes a few days after it fined Elon Musk's site €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges.Nikita Bier, who has a senior role at the social media site, accused the European Union (EU) regulator of trying to \"take advantage\" of \"an exploit\" in its advertising system to promote its post about the fine on Friday.\"It seems you believe that the rules should not apply to your account,\" he said. \"Your ad account has been terminated.\"A European Commission spokesperson told BBC News the Commission \"always uses all social media platforms in good faith\".X's fine, issued on Friday, was the first under the EU's Digital Services Act.The EU regulator said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\".\"This deception exposes users to scams, including impersonation frauds, as well as other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,\" it said.It claimed X was also failing to provide transparency around its adverts, and was not giving researchers access to public data.The social media platform has been given 60 days to respond to the Commission about concerns surrounding its blue checkmarks, or face extra penalties.Following the fine, Elon Musk posted on his platform to say the EU \"should be abolished\", and retweeted a response from another X user comparing it to fascism.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accused the EU regulator of attacking and censoring US firms, adding, \"the days of censoring Americans online are over\".'Never been abused like this'The dispute originated with Mr Bier, who accused the Commission of activating a rarely-used account \"to take advantage of an exploit\".He claimed it had posted a link which itself deceived users - tricking them into thinking it was a video \"to artificially increase its reach\".He said the \"exploit\", which had \"never been abused like this\", had now been removed.Ad accounts on X are used by businesses to create and analyse paid advertising campaigns and run \"promoted\" posts on the site, separate from the users' X profile. In response, a European Commission spokesperson told BBC News that it was \"simply using the tools that platforms themselves are making available to our corporate accounts\".\"⁠We expect these tools to be fully in line with the platforms' own terms and conditions, as well as with our legislative framework,\" it said.And it is not the first time there has been disagreement between X and global regulators.In 2024, Brazil's Supreme Court lifted a ban on X after it agreed to pay 28 million reais ($5.1m; £3.8m), and blocked accounts accused of spreading misinformation. The previous year, Australia's internet safety watchdog fined it A$610,000 ($386,000; £317,360) for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices.",

    "body": "Thieves snatch eight Matisse artworks from library in Brazil2 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterAFP via Getty ImagesThe thieves reportedly walked into the library during normal opening hoursTwo armed men have stolen eight engravings by French artist Matisse and at least another five by Brazilian painter Cândido Portinari from a library in São Paulo.  Brazilian officials say the thieves held up a security guard and an elderly couple who were visiting the library before making off with the artworks on foot.They reportedly entered the library by the main entrance at 10:00 (13:00 GMT) on Sunday, and left by the same route, heading towards the nearest metro station.The heist comes less than two months after the art world was rocked by a brazen break-in at the Louvre museum in Paris, where thieves made off with priceless jewels. The engravings stolen from Biblioteca Mário de Andrade on Sunday formed part of a joint exhibition with the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art.The thieves targeted the exhibition, entitled From Book to Museum, on its final day.Bibilioteca Mário de Andrade is the country's second largest library and officials say that its building in the centre of São Paulo had cameras with facial recognition technology. Police said they had managed to identify one of the two suspects and were working on identifying the second. They also announced that they had located their getaway car. Officials have not yet released a detailed list of the stolen works, but according to Folha de São Paulo newspaper, a collage Matisse made for the limited-edition art book Jazz is among those taken.Matisse is widely considered to be one of the 20th Century's most influential artists and art critics say the value of the stolen works is \"incalculable\".The thieves also took at least five engravings by Portinari, created to illustrate a special edition of the novel Menino de engheno (Plantation Boy) by Brazilian writer José Lins do Rego.Portinari, who often painted rural workers and labourers, is one of the most significant Brazilian Modernist artists.

    "body": "Just nowDouglas FraserScotland business and economy editorGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his \"prince\" title in October The St Andrews golf course named after the former Prince Andrew is to be rebranded. The Duke's Course, which is three miles from the centre of the Fife university town, will become the Craigtoun Course, after a nearby country park. A heathland course unlike the links which dominate the home of golf, the Duke's was opened by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in 1995.He later became captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which is based in St Andrews.Getty ImagesAndrew is a keen golfer and attended the 2018 Open at Carnoustie as a spectatorAndrew has given up his honorary membership, as part of his retreat from public life in the wake of the scandal about his close friendship with the paedophile and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The course and club are also to come under the management of the St Andrews Links Trust on a long-term lease. The club's logo is also being changed, to remove the royal association.An illustration featuring trees will replace a lion rampant holding a saltire flag.The trust already runs seven public courses around the Fife town, including the world famous Old Course, which hosts the Open Championship every five years. Until 5 January, the Duke's will continue to be run by golf resort operator Kohler, alongside its ownership of the Old Course Hotel.From then on it will be know as the Craigtoun Course.Private estateFollowing a growing public outcry about his links to Epstein, Andrew was stripped of titles such as the Duke of York and his status as prince, becoming Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.As part of that announcement in October, Andrew was also to leave Royal Lodge and to move into some other accommodation in Sandringham, the King's private estate in Norfolk.Andrew has also faced calls from Democrat members of the US Congress to give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein's activities.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had not replied to the request by the end of their deadline last month.A press release confirmed the course would take on a \"revitalised identity\" but it did not mention the former prince.Neil Coulson, chief executive of St Andrews Links Trust, said: \"The agreement for The Craigtoun Course will see the first new course added to the Home of Golf's portfolio in 18 years and presents an ideal opportunity to expand the golf experiences we offer.\"We are delighted to have reached agreement with the Old Course Hotel and look forward to taking over what it is already a significant asset for St Andrews and Scotland and building on its reputation.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoPanisa Aemocha,BBC Thai, BangkokandKelly NgWatch: Thousands flee Thailand-Cambodia borderResidents on both sides of Thailand's and Cambodia's border evacuated in droves on Monday as fresh clashes erupted, killing at least five people.Both sides have each accused the other of starting the violence, which is the most serious confrontation between the two countries since they agreed to a ceasefire in July.Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul says his country \"never wanted violence\" but will \"use necessary means to preserve its sovereignty\", while Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen accused Thai \"invaders\" of provoking retaliation.Since May, escalating tensions between the neighbours have led to more than 40 deaths, as well as import bans and travel restrictions.ReutersResidents living at the border evacuated the area as fresh clashes erupted on MondayOn Monday, the Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Ubon Ratchathani Province, including by launching air strikes along the disputed border; while Phnom Penh's defence ministry said it was the Thai forces that attacked first, in Cambodia's Preah Vihear province.At least one Thai soldier and four Cambodian civilians have been killed, and about a dozen wounded as a result of Monday's fighting, according to officials on either side.For Thai teacher Siksaka Pongsuwan, though, there are other, hidden victims of the clashes: the children living near the border, he warns, are \"losing opportunities and... precious time\" compared to their peers living in relatively peaceful cities.Children bearing the bruntNearly 650 schools across five Thai provinces have been ordered to shut for safety reasons, Thailand's education minister said, following the fresh tensions that have simmered since Sunday.Meanwhile, videos on social media show chaotic scenes at schools in Cambodia's border provinces as parents rushed to take their children home.And this is not the first time these children have had their education interrupted in recent months.Siksaka PongsuwanSiksaka Pongsuwan says he and his neighbours on the Thai side of the border are torn about whether to evacuateIn July, in the midst of the children's examinations, five days of intense fighting broke out between the two nations. In the aftermath, Pongsuwan's school switched to online classes, but not all students could access them - some lived in households with no internet, while iPads distributed by the schools did not reach everyone.In Cambodia, former journalist Mech Dara shared several clips of children frantically running out of their schools on his X account.\"How many times [do these] kids have to suffer the shocking environment?\" he wrote. \"The nonsense fighting bring kids [a] horrible nightmare.\" He also shared a picture of a boy, still in his school uniform, having some food in an underground bunker. \"Why does the kid and his family have to eat their meal in the bunker...?\" he wrote.Meanwhile, Pongsuwan told the BBC that he and his neighbours are now torn about whether to evacuate - even as gunfire can be heard every now and then in his village.\"If you ask whether we're scared, yes we are... Should we leave? Will it really be safer? Or should we stay?\" he tells the BBC.A century-old dispute, reignitedThe century-old border dispute between the South East Asian nations dramatically escalated with a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand on the morning of 24 July, followed by Thai air strikes.Days later, Bangkok and Phnom Penh agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. In October, both sides signed a ceasefire agreement during a ceremony with US President Donald Trump in Malaysia. At the time, Trump claimed a historic achievement in ending the border conflict.But just two weeks after that signing, Thailand said it would suspend the implementation of the agreement, after two of its soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion near the Cambodian border.Cambodia, which nominated Trump for a Nobel peace prize for his role in brokering the ceasefire, has repeatedly claimed it is committed to the deal.Thailand and Cambodia have been contesting territorial sovereignty along their 800km land border for more than a century, since the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia.Additional reporting by Jonathan Head and Koh Ewe",

    "body": "16 hours agoSarah Campbell, Claire Ryan and George SandemanWatch: Home videos give a personal glimpse into the lives of Alice, Bebe and ElsieThe families of three girls killed at a dance class in Southport last year say spending time together has helped them through their grief.A small team of journalists from BBC Breakfast have been following the families for the last nine months as part of a documentary to be shown on BBC One on Tuesday. In it, they reveal how they have grieved for their daughters and set up legacy projects in their names.\"We've been together in some of the most difficult conversations,\" says Jenni Stancombe, mum of Elsie. \"But together, between the six of us, we always seem to pull the light out [of the darkness].\"Elsie, aged seven, Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and Bebe King, six, died at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop in July 2024.The Southport families at a primary school where money they raised has built a new playgroundOver nine months the BBC recorded deeply personal interviews with the girls' parents, who have for the first time shared family footage of their daughters.The programme follows how the three families set out to create lasting legacies in their girls' names. It shows how they trained for and competed in the London Marathon as well as the opening of a new playground at the school attended by two of the girls.The families didn't know each other before the tragedy, but Lauren King, mum of Bebe, says meeting up since they died has been \"crucial to our survival\" and a \"blessing\".\"We can talk about our girls, the similarities,\" she says, reflecting on the girls' shared love of dance and performing.\"I feel more close to Alice when I'm with them,\" says Alice's mum Alexandra Aguiar. \"I feel more connected to the girls.\"Mrs Stancombe adds: \"I'll never forget Alex coming to say to me that Alice is a real mother figure and she'll be mothering [Elsie and Bebe], wherever they are. She was like, 'I promise you she'll be looking after them.'\"Family handoutsThe parents of Elsie, Alice and Bebe have realised how similar they were when sharing memories of themThe documentary includes home videos of the girls talking and laughing. In one, Elsie says: \"You don't need to buy a smile, you just bring up your face.\"Using Elsie's attitude to cartwheeling as an example, her dad David Stancombe adds: \"When she was focused on something, she was determined to master it.\"In another clip, while filming herself, Alice says: \"Hello, it's me!\" Describing his daughter, Sergio Aguiar tells us that Alice did not walk anywhere, \"she danced\".One clip of Bebe shows her messing around at home in an oversized hat while wearing a backpack. She lit up every room she entered, her parents say. \"She was totally selfless,\" adds her dad Ben King.The families also describe how much their girls were looking forward to the dance workshop before they died. \"I saw [the class] and booked it as a surprise,\" says Mrs King.\"Alice knew all the songs, she was singing and dancing [to them],\" says Mrs Aguiar.\"That class, to be Taylor Swift-themed, was the reason [Elsie] went,\" Mrs Stancombe adds. \"She only went to dance and make bracelets; and she never came home.\"The families say they have been of great support to each other while grieving for their girlsMr and Mrs Stancombe tell the BBC of the shared pain they felt when meeting the Aguiar and King families for the first time.\"When I first met them, I felt their pain for them. It hurts us [to know],\" Mrs Stancombe says - her voice trailing off - \"what they're going through,\" her husband adds.\"Although we'd have liked not to have met under these circumstances, we are very happy that we have,\" says Mrs King.\"We try to support each other,\" says Mr Aguiar. His wife agrees: \"We are all different but we are very special to each other.\"The legacy projects established for each of the girls include Alice's WonderDance, made by the Aguiars to support young performers with uniforms, classes and transport.The Stancombes have created Elsie's Story, a charitable trust that makes grants to assist young people and support others in the Southport area.One of the projects they have helped fund is Bebe's Hive, a creative centre set up by the Kings that offers support to grieving children.Mr King says: \"I think when we get together, something just takes over - like we're protected.\" His wife adds: \"We've got each other through, we've gained family\".Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "I lost £13k after my second-hand EV turned out to be a clone car10 hours agoAmy Mackrill,BBC WalesandCatherine Earlam,You and YoursBBC\"I'm a victim, I'm paying five years for something I don't own,\" says Sevak MaljianA man who unknowingly bought a stolen car for £13,000, after fraudsters allegedly used a sophisticated type of identity theft to \"clone\" it, is urging others to be vigilant.Sevak Maljian, 35, made what seemed like a well-researched purchase of the Kia EV6 with no idea the car was sold to him with replica identity documents of another vehicle, complete with identification numbers and what appeared to be a genuine DVLA V5C logbook.\"All the details matched... there was no reason to question,\" said the car enthusiast from Cardiff.He was told by police the car had been reported stolen and it has now been seized.The case is being investigated by the Report Fraud service and City of London Police.Car-cloning can be as simple as stealing number plates, but the fraud type has become more sophisticated, leaving buyers of second-hand cars vulnerable. While there are no official figures for car cloning across the whole of the UK, motoring organisation RAC believes \"it's increasingly widespread\".Mr Maljian, a physiotherapist and NHS project support officer, said he first saw the three-year-old electric car advertised on Facebook in September and, after messaging the seller, they agreed on an \"attractive price\" if it was paid for in cash. He travelled to London and met the seller outside Putney station on 5 October before viewing the car outside the address listed in its DVLA V5C vehicle registration certificate (logbook).As a car enthusiast who had bought second hand cars before, Mr Maljian believed he had taken every precaution. \"I did all the checks that were recommended by the DVLA,\" he told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours.\"I started first by checking the MOT, I checked the mileage and then I did the Total Car Check. It showed cleared finance, clear HPI, no accidents. \"All the details matched including the mileage, the colour, the specs of the car.\"The seller also showed him what appeared to be a genuine logbook, complete with watermarks and had matching ID.\"There was no reason to question,\" he said.Cars also carry a Vehicle Identity Number (VIN) which is stamped into the chassis  - the main load-bearing frame of the car - but can also be found on the windscreen, side of the dashboard, or the door jamb. Mr Maljian said: \"I did check the ones that are easily accessible which were on the front windshield and at the door but I did not on the chassis because it's usually not an accessible place.\"While the all-cash payment rang alarm bells \"a little\", he was confident that if he did all the checks he would not have anything to worry about. Mr Maljian said the seller \"gained my confidence on every aspect\" and he drove 200 miles (320km) home to Cardiff without issue.The shock came days later when he took the car to a local Kia dealership to ask about a faulty button on the key fob designed to access the boot. Staff realised the key was a forgery and further inspection revealed the VIN on the chassis did not match the one on the windscreen and door. Police confirmed to Mr Maljian the vehicle had been reported stolen in Kent and seized it. Sevak MaljianSevak Maljian purchased the Kia EV6 for £13,000 in OctoberMr Maljian, who had taken out a personal loan to buy the car, was left with nothing, and is still having to pay £236 a month to repay his debt. \"I was really in shock,\" he said.\"I'm a victim. I lost my money… I'm paying five years for something I don't own.\"He says he feels frustrated that multiple security layers, DVLA documents, VINs and key coding systems could be bypassed. He said he contacted Kia to point out that the car was still under warranty and it should not have been able to bypass the security on such a \"high value item\".A spokesperson for Kia said it was \"saddened\" by what happened and advised Mr Maljian to continue working with police and the DVLA. A DVLA spokesperson said: \"We understand how distressing vehicle crime can be. To help reduce the risk of fraud, we encourage buyers to follow the guidance on GOV.UK such as checking vehicle identification number details and confirming the seller's identity.\"Anyone who believes they may have been a victim of fraud should contact the police through Report Fraud straight away.\"The case is currently being investigated by Report Fraud - formerly known as Action Fraud - and City of London Police, who have been contacted for comment.What are the signs of car cloning?While there are no official figures for car cloning across the whole of the UK, motoring organisation RAC believes \"it's increasingly widespread\". Simon Williams from RAC described Mr Maljian's case as \"truly terrible\". He said: \"Criminals these days go to incredible lengths and they are stealing cars and defeating security systems extremely easily unfortunately.\"He added that Mr Maljian made many of the correct checks and he found the existence of what appeared to be a genuine DVLA logbook particularly troubling.He urged buyers to verify the seller genuinely lived at the address on the V5C logbook, check every VIN including the chassis, and consider buying from reputable dealers instead.More top stories",

    "body": "Racism, rape and death threats: One weekend of social media abuse in footballImage source, BBC SportImage caption, Managers are being targeted by abuse more often than players in the Premier League and Women's Super LeagueByNatalie Pirks, Melissa Sharman, Sarah Dawkins and Daniel AustinBBC Sport Warning: This article contains screenshots of and references to offensive language.More than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend, a BBC investigation has found.The analysis - conducted with data science company Signify - focused on posts made during 10 Premier League and six WSL matches on the weekend of 8 and 9 November, and also found messages including racist slurs, homophobia and threats of violence.Managers were targeted more than players, with 82% of abusive posts made on X, formerly known as Twitter.Premier League bosses Ruben Amorim, Arne Slot and Eddie Howe were the most common targets of abuse in the men's top flight, while Chelsea and their manager Sonia Bompastor faced 50% of all abuse in the WSL.A total of 61% of all abusive messages were sent from accounts in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and the data suggests the overall number is on the rise.Media caption, 'It's not acceptable' - Bompastor on online abuse'People have sense of impunity online'\"Abuse is never a good thing, whether it's about me or other managers,\" Liverpool head coach Slot said.\"We expect to be criticised. That is completely normal. I do not have social media so I don't see it, but I'm not stupid, I know it's there.\"Signify operates an artificial intelligence system called Threat Matrix, which scans posts made on social media for abuse. During the weekend of matches selected for the study, it analysed more than 500,000 posts on X, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, and identified 22,389 potentially abusive messages.But those flags can sometimes include examples which aren't abusive. For example, references to Newcastle defender Dan Burn can be flagged as a threat because of his surname.Therefore, a two-stage analysis by humans is conducted, which found that 2,015 of the posts met the threshold for verified extreme abuse - such as threats to life or hate speech - and broke the rules of the platforms they were posted on.What type of messages are being posted?Below we have included screenshots of some of the posts containing offensive language that were found as part of the investigation.We weighed up carefully whether to include them. In the end, we decided that it was important for you to have the option of seeing what was being posted to help our audiences better understand this story.You can view them on the picture gallery below.Image gallerySkip image galleryImage caption, Select to view screenshots of some of the abuse. Warning: contains offensive languageSlide 1 of 8, BBC Sport gallery of screenshots from our investigation, Select to view screenshots of some of the abuse. Warning: contains offensive languageThirty-nine posts - including monkey emojis on black players' accounts and rape threats - were deemed serious enough to warrant further investigation, which in some cases involves reporting to football clubs for potential identification of fans, and possible referral to law enforcement.One post was reported to police, who decided it did not meet their threshold for further action.Only one of the posts flagged to Meta, which owns and operates Facebook and Instagram, was removed. The others remain under investigation.Some of the 37 posts that were flagged to X were removed, while the others had their reach suppressed but were left online.\"If this happened on the street, this would have criminal consequences, potential financially damaging consequences,\" said Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Maheta Molango.\"So why is it that online people have got this sense of impunity? We need to put an end to this.\"Some in the game are resigned to the inevitability of abuse.\"It comes with the territory now,\" Newcastle manager Howe said.\"My advice is always to try and shelter yourself from it and become psychologically strong enough to not need to read it. But, invariably, people will show it to you even if you don't want to see it.\"Meta has implemented systems for helping block and filter abuse, while X has introduced a tool which displays the country or continent in which an account is based.The BBC contacted both X and Meta with questions about abuse on their platforms. Neither provided a comment.'Really horrible, violent content'In an office in central London, Signify's small team quietly sifts through thousands of posts.With every contentious moment during a game, the number of abusive messages rises.Up pop posts containing monkey emoijs and racist slurs, threats of rape to the family members of managers, and even death threats, sparked purely by actions on a football pitch.Every message the AI system deems abusive is checked twice by humans, who only count the messages which break social media platforms' own guidelines as verified abuse.The most significant surge in abusive posts occurred during Tottenham's dramatic 2-2 draw with Manchester United on 8 November, a match that featured two stoppage-time goals, after which both clubs' managers and several players faced concentrated abuse.In messages seen by the BBC, death threats were sent about Amorim, including one saying 'Kill Amorim - someone get that dirty Portuguese'.The Online Safety Act, which came into force in October 2023, puts a statutory duty of care on social media platforms.That means they are legally obliged to proactively identify and remove illegal content such as threats, harassment or hate speech. Ofcom is now the independent regulator responsible for making sure platforms comply.But the social platforms argue that the right to free speech makes them reluctant to censor or remove content. Signify insists that the problem of serious abuse and threats sent online is worsening.\"We've seen around a 25% year-on-year increase in the levels of abuse we're detecting,\" said its chief executive Jonathan Hirshler.\"We understand the platforms' position on free speech but some of the stuff we're talking about is so egregious.\"Really nasty death threats and really horrible, violent content. If the people who are the free speech absolutists out there read some of those messages, they wouldn't question why some of these are being reported and why action needs to be taken.\"Media caption, '25% year-on-year increase' - Can football clubs stop online abuse?Threats and homophobia in WSLControversy during Chelsea's 1-1 draw at Arsenal on 8 November sparked the vast majority of the 97 verified abusive messages posted about WSL matches.More than half targeted Chelsea boss Bompastor, including a threat of violence and a homophobic slur.\"People think they can say anything they want from behind a screen,\" Bompastor said. \"It's scary - I want to raise my voice against that.\"I have a family, including kids. They don't want to see those comments online. They are so young, and people need to realise the effect it can have on them too.\"Threats are a big problem, because the security in the women's game isn't the same as the men's game.\"Abuse can cause real mental problems for players. It can go really far.\"Ex-Chelsea and current England defender Jess Carter was the subject of prominent racist abuse online during Euro 2025, and Bompastor believes the platforms themselves bear plenty of blame.\"The social media companies are not doing their job, not taking the responsibility or accountability,\" Bompastor said.\"If we have to wait for them to act, I think we will be in this situation for too long.\"I'm hoping now that all clubs in the women's and men's games are proactive and protect people as much as possible.\"How are clubs combatting abuse?As frustration with social media companies grows, more clubs are taking matters into their own hands. Arsenal have worked with Signify for the past three years and have seen a 90% drop in the number of affiliated fans sending abuse to their own players, coach and owners. Signify attributes this to the fact that Arsenal have been actively taking action, including implementing education programmes and banning fans from the Emirates who have been identified as senders of abuse.Chelsea women are now also working with the same company.Tottenham, meanwhile, are conducting investigations into season-ticket holders alleged to have posted abusive content.Premier League director of content protection Tim Cooper said: \"We're constantly monitoring around matches where the abuse can happen and looking for trigger instances such as a goal being scored, missed penalties, or even things like yellow and red cards.\"The platforms can do more by changing their algorithms. That would be a step in the right direction.\"The League has a dedicated team that works hard to identify, compile evidence against, and help prosecute perpetrators of such abuse, with more than 4,000 cases of online discriminatory abuse investigated since 2020.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "Where F1 title may be won and lost in three-way fightImage source, ReutersImage caption, Lando Norris (centre) leads the drivers' championship by 12 points from Red Bull's Max Verstappen (right) and 16 from McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri ByF1 CorrespondentThe Formula 1 drivers' championship will be decided in a three-way showdown that takes place this weekend on Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina circuit.Lando Norris leads Red Bull's Max Verstappen by 12 points and McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri by 16 as they head to a track that has hosted a number of dramatic climaxes in the past.This weekend has all the ingredients to be another.Norris, with his significant points advantage, goes into the weekend as an on-paper favourite.But Verstappen has won five of the eight races before Abu Dhabi and is in a far simpler position than two drivers operating out of the same McLaren garage.Who has the best car?Image source, EPAImage caption, McLaren's drivers have combined for a total score of 800 points in the constructors' championship, allowing them to seal that title with six races of the season to spareThe McLaren has been the fastest car on average over the season. It has a significant advantage on average qualifying pace - 0.274 seconds over the season, and 0.203secs over the past eight races.But wins are split evenly between all three drivers this year - Norris, Verstappen and Piastri all have seven each. The other two grand prix victories have been taken by Mercedes' George Russell.McLaren have dominated the constructors' championship, which they clinched at the Singapore Grand Prix on the first weekend in October, with six races remaining.But that is a reflection of having two competitive drivers in a consistently race-winning car. No other team has had the luxury of those two factors together.Verstappen, by contrast, has scored more than 92% of all his team's points this year - team-mate Yuki Tsunoda has been nowhere near him and of no help whatsoever in the Dutchman's title campaign, and has been dropped by Red Bull for next season as a result.Competitiveness has ebbed and flowed through the season, and each car has specific strengths.Verstappen won the Qatar Grand Prix last weekend only because of McLaren's strategy error. Otherwise, that track's long-duration medium- and high-speed corners were perfect McLaren territory.Abu Dhabi also has some long corners - especially the hairpin on to the first long straight and the long Turn Nine at the end of the second main straight.But the McLaren is not at its best in the sort of short-duration, 90-degree corners that comprise the final sector around the marina and hotel, or when braking into chicanes.And the Red Bull has the best straight-line speed.So, in terms of track characteristics, the fight looks finely balanced.McLaren have taken pole position at the past four races. Over the season, Norris and Verstappen are tied on seven poles each, with Piastri scoring six.Who has the best history on this track?Verstappen has won four times in Abu Dhabi, taking every race victory from 2020-23.But his win in 2021 was extremely controversial - that was the title showdown with Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes, where Verstappen won only after the then-race director made up the rules during a late safety-car period.It's also not a fair comparison between the three drivers.For a start, this is only Piastri's third season in F1. Norris has been in F1 since 2019 and Verstappen since 2015.But Norris did not have an even vaguely competitive car until 2023, whereas Verstappen has been winning races on and off since 2016.And Norris was dominant on his way to victory in Abu Dhabi last year.FormCompetitiveness has fluctuated through the season, between both drivers and teams.In the first half of the season, the Red Bull was competitive with the McLaren only on circuits with a predominance of high-speed corners, such as Japan, Saudi Arabia and Imola.Piastri was the stronger McLaren driver on balance over the first 14 races of the season, while Norris struggled with certain elements of the car's behaviour.But Norris has come on strong since the summer break, overhauling what had been a 34-point lead for Piastri at the end of August.Red Bull had a slump in form through the summer, by the end of which Verstappen was 104 points off the championship lead.But tweaks to their car for the Italian Grand Prix at the beginning of September transformed their season, and Verstappen went on a run of three wins and a second place in four races through September and October.In the past two races, Verstappen was the stronger in Las Vegas and McLaren in Qatar. But Abu Dhabi is a very different track from both of those.Abu Dhabi Grand Prix5-7 DecemberLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sports Extra 2; live text updates on BBC Sport website and appTeam dynamicMcLaren's task is the more complicated. They have two drivers in contention and have pledged to allow them both to compete fairly until one is no longer in contention for the championship.But the team's clear stated goal is for one of their drivers to win the title - and they don't mind which. So don't rule out team tactics of one kind or another at McLaren.For example, if Verstappen is winning and Piastri in the top three with Norris fourth, that would make the Dutchman champion. But if Piastri dropped back to let Norris into the top three, Norris would win the title.In those circumstances, it would be expected for McLaren to ask Piastri to aid Norris - but only at such a point when it's clear the Australian's hopes were over.At Red Bull, Verstappen is on his own. Except, that is, if a McLaren finds itself somehow behind one of the other three Red Bull-owned cars - Tsunoda and the two Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson.If that's the case, expect them to make themselves as hard as possible to pass - as Sergio Perez did to Hamilton in 2021, ultimately playing a decisive role in how the race played out.MentalityImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Can he make it five titles? If he does, Max Verstappen will equal Michael Schumacher's record for consecutive drivers' championships, set between 2000-04The pressure is certainly greater on Norris than anyone else.All year, McLaren have looked like the team who will deliver the drivers' title, and he is the man leading the championship.At the same time, this is his first chance to win the title, and McLaren's first drivers' title chance since Hamilton won in 2008.Yes, Hamilton was in mathematical contention in 2010, but 24 points behind with only 25 available, so not really in the picture.In addition, McLaren have been fundamentally restructured since then, and while team principal Andrea Stella has been involved in title fights previously - working with Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso - most of the team have not.Their relative rawness has shown at times this year, especially in Qatar, when they were the only team not to take the opportunity to pit under a safety car, and lost the win as a result.There will likely have been some soul-searching and in-depth analysis in the past days as a consequence. Some anxiety and nervousness would be understandable.Red Bull and Verstappen, meanwhile, are fully versed in this situation. They have won the past four drivers' titles and are a ruthless, finely honed winning machine.And as a team and driver who have done it before, and in addition did not expect to be in this situation, the pressure is off.Verstappen has repeatedly said \"it won't change my life\" whether he wins or not.After Qatar, he said: \"It shows everything is possible. We have nothing to lose so I just go there and try to maximise the car and hope we can be a little bit more competitive than here but we'll see.\"",

    "body": "40 minutes agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondent, WindsorReutersPresident Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Budenbender land in LondonThe Prince and Princess of Wales have welcomed the German president to the UK for a state visit.President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Budenbender landed at Heathrow airport on Wednesday morning, and were greeted by William and Catherine.The president and first lady will receive an elaborate ceremonial reception from King Charles and Queen Camilla in Windsor, beginning with a carriage ride to the castle. It is the first German state visit in 27 years. Such state visits are about projecting soft power and building relationships, and the three-day visit will see a mix of pageantry, politics and culture.Events for the president will include a state banquet, speaking in Parliament, meeting the PM in Downing Street and visiting German footballers who play in the Premier League.German flags are flying along Windsor High Street and the visitors will be given a formal welcoming ceremony and will view a military parade on the manicured lawns inside Windsor Castle.State visits are planned by the Foreign Office to cultivate diplomatic relations with important partners.And this visit will reinforce the Kensington Treaty, signed between the UK and Germany in July, which emphasised military and business co-operation and closer links between the countries, including plans for a direct rail link.The UK government is also hoping for more help from Germany in stopping illegal migration. The National Crime Agency has previously said equipment used to cross the Channel has been stored in Germany.PA MediaThe Household Cavalry in Windsor ahead of arrival of the German presidentThere will be an exchange of gifts between the King and his German visitors and, in the evening, speeches will be made at the state banquet in St George's Hall, inside Windsor Castle, with guests to include celebrities alongside the royals and politicians.It's likely that some of the King's speech will be delivered in German.When he visited Germany in 2023, King Charles spoke about the need to support Ukraine and there will be attention paid to what he might say about the war, and ongoing negotiations to end it.The previous state visit was US President Trump, who travelled in and out of Windsor by helicopter, increasing his security and avoiding protestors, rather than taking part in a public carriage ride.ReutersGerman and British flags line The Mall in LondonWith Christmas approaching there are also likely to be references to the German roots of some Christmas traditions, including popularising the Christmas tree by Queen Victoria's husband Albert.Although without any snow to try it out, the visitors will be shown a sleigh designed by the German-born Prince Albert in 1845.There will be symbolic signs of reconciliation, including a visit by the German president to the ruins of Coventry Cathedral, bombed during the Second World War.This mirrors a visit to Hamburg during the UK state visit to Germany, when King Charles laid a wreath remembering the civilian casualties of wartime Allied bombing raids.Oxford University will award an honorary degree to President Steinmeier, on a trip where he will be shown medical technology at the university and joint UK and German research projects.Ms Budenbender will visit the Judith Kerr Primary School, in south-east London, to mark the connection to its namesake, Judith Kerr, the German-born author of the children's book The Tiger Who Came to Tea.The German president will go to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to meet German footballers who play in the English Premier League.And at the V&A East Storehouse the visitors will see the David Bowie Centre, which contains items related to the pop star, such as stage outfits and musical instruments.",

The ingested loot - a Fabergé egg locket valued at NZ$33,585 ($19,300; £14,600) - has not yet been recovered, police told local media outlets.Police were called to Partridge Jewellers in central Auckland last Friday afternoon and the 32-year-old man was arrested in store minutes later.  He has undergone a medical assessment and remains in custody, police say. The allegedly stolen Fabergé egg is set with 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires, according to the jeweller's website, and opens to reveal an 18-carat gold miniature octopus.The Octopussy egg, as it is named, was inspired by the 1983 James Bond film of the same name, which centres on an elaborate Fabergé egg heist.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.The suspect is due to appear in court again on 8 December.According to reports, he has also been charged with allegedly stealing an iPad from the same jewellery store on 12 November and making away with cat litter and flea control products worth NZ$100 from a private address a day after.",

    "body": "Thailand has temporarily lifted a decades-old ban on the sale of alcoholic drinks in the afternoons as it seeks to boost tourism.Liquor stores, restaurants and other accredited establishments can now sell beer, wine and spirits from 14:00 to 17:00 as part of a six-month trial. The ban, which came into force in 1972, was primarily introduced to stop government employees from drinking during work hours. But it has long vexed visitors to the predominantly Buddhist country - which is also known for its vibrant party scene. The move comes just days ahead of Christmas and the New Year holiday, both peak seasons for tourist arrivals.Alcohol sales in the country are now allowed from 11:00 to midnight for the next 180 days while a committee studies its impact. Previously, those who flouted the ban faced a fine of up to 10,000 baht (£235; $313). Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who took office in September, has promised to win back tourists as part of efforts to jumpstart the economy that has been held back by years of political turmoil.\"In the past, there were concerns that government employees would sneak out to drink, but it's a different time now,\" Deputy Prime Minister Sophon Saram told reporters last month, according to AFP news agency.Thailand has some of the highest alcohol consumption rates in Asia, according to the World Health Organisation and local brews like Chang and Singha are very popular.",

That's to say the full Moon coincides with it being at its closest point to Earth in its orbit, appearing larger and brighter in the night sky. A full Moon happens when the Sun and Moon are on opposite sides of Earth - in alignment, known as 'syzygy' - so the whole side that is facing us is illuminated.When will the Cold Moon rise?The full Moon will rise in the north-eastern skies on the afternoon of the December 4 at 14:52GMT in London, 14:29 in Edinburgh, 14:52 in Belfast and 15:05 in Cardiff. It will then set again between 08:00 and 09:00 the following morning so there will be plenty of hours of darkness to view it. Check the Sunrise and Sunset times where you are.As the Moon rises it will form a triangle  with the Pleiades star cluster and the bright star Aldebaran.Jupiter will appear in the night sky close to the Moon, as well as the winter constellation of Orion the Hunter.Image source, PA / Danny LawsonImage caption, The  super Cold Moon rises above Whitby Abbey in December 2017Will the skies be clear?A band of cloud and rain is expected to move eastwards across the UK on Thursday and this may linger into the evening across northern and eastern Scotland and eastern England. As it moves away, clear skies are set to develop in many areas overnight, however widespread mist and fog could form, reducing visibility in some locations. It will be a fairly cold night with temperatures dropping close to freezing and a touch of frost in places.Check the full forecast for your local area here.Media caption, See a supermoon and a meteor shower - in one nightWhy is it called a Cold Moon?Each full Moon in a year has a name - a practice that dates back to ancient traditions centuries before the Gregorian calendar existed.Full Moons were historically named as a way of keeping track of the change of seasons and often influenced the timing of activities like hunting, harvesting and planting, where the bright moonlight could come in handy.December's full Moon is known as the Cold Moon and marks the start of winter as it occurs near the solstice. It has also been known as the Long Night Moon and the Moon before Yule.The next full Moon, on Saturday 3 January 2026 is the Wolf Moon and this will be  yet another supermoon.  ",

    "body": "7 minutes agoOttilie MitchellandNick Triggle,Health correspondentHealth Secretary Wes Streeting says the doctors' union, the British Medical Association, are acting like \"moaning minnies\" in opposing the rollout of online GP appointment booking.The union is in formal dispute with the government after it asked all GP practices in England to offer patients the option of making non-urgent appointments online from the start of October.Lastest NHS data shows more than 98% of surgeries are doing that, and Streeting praised GPs for embracing it, telling BBC Breakfast it was \"about time the NHS caught up with the rest of the 21st century\".But the BMA has suggested patients could be put at risk by the move and surgeries overwhelmed by demand.Streeting said: \"GPs have really embraced this. You would think from listening to some of the moaning minnies in the BMA that GPs have been resistant, they're not doing this. \"Actually the overwhelming majority have, and I'm thankful to them,\" he said.According to new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), a higher proportion of people in England are now contacting their GP surgery online than by phone.Data covering three weeks from mid-September suggest just over 43% of people went online to contact their GP - an increase of a percentage point from the previous month - compared with 41% percent on the phone.Streeting has heralded the figures as \"a massive step\" towards meeting the government promise to end the \"8am scramble for appointments\".The government has mandated that online appointment bookings must operate between 08:30 and 18:00, Monday to Friday.Alongside requesting non-urgent consultations, patients are able to ask questions and describe symptoms and request a call back.But the BMA says patients are being put at risk because urgent requests are not being triaged - the most serious ones prioritised and dealt with first - and practices are overwhelmed.\"The government has merely increased the potential for patient safety issues to arise,\" said Dr David Wrigley, the deputy chair of the BMA's General Practice Committee for England.\"The software simply does not filter out routine from urgent requests,\" he added.Patients' group Healthwatch England also raised concerns, saying some people have not been adequately informed about the changes, in particular that online booking is not to be used for emergencies. The group also reported practices restricting online bookings to mornings and said that less digitally literate people find the system hard to navigate.Jess Harvey, a GP in Shropshire and a member of the BMA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that surgeries were already \"saturated and working at full capacity\". She said GPs want to be responsive to patients but that now there is an \"open floodgate for people to contact us\" and \"there is also a reality here that we have to work safely\".She accused the government of having \"created unrealistic expectations for patients\", adding: \"If they want us to do this extra work, it has to be funded for it to be done safely.\"The government said it had provided extra money this year as well as recruiting 2,500 more GPs - although some of them are part-time.",

It was suggested that the village celebrate its fishing heritage with a tree made from creels.\"At the start we had to beg and borrow stuff,\" said Gordon.But lottery funding later allowed the volunteers to buy their own creels - all 340 of them.Jane Barlow/PA MediaThe Ullapool to Stornoway ferry has a role when the tree is  switched onJane Barlow/PA MediaThe tree has been a winter feature in Ullapool for 10 years\"It takes two full days to build with help from volunteers and the harbour provides us with lots of the equipment,\" said Gordon.The tree is constructed on a disc-shaped base, with a timber frame up through the centre and weights to keep everything in place - especially in windy weather.\"We had a storm last week which caused a wee bit of damage,\" said Gordon.The creels are stacked around the frame and then the whole structure is decorated with multi-coloured Christmas tree lights.The finishing touch is the \"star\" - an outline of a crab with white lights.The tree's location near the harbour allows for another neat touch when it comes to officially switching on the lights.CalMac's Ullapool to Stornoway ferry blows its horn three times and the lights are then turned on.\"When the lights are first turned on you think: 'Oh, that's quite smart',\" said Gordon.\"Hundreds of people come down for it - one lady travels 500 miles from the south of England every year to see it.\"Oban in Argyll also builds a creel tree as part of the town's winter festival.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorGetty ImagesPeople who have cosmetic filler injections in their face should be warned of the risk of a dangerous complication involving blocked arteries that can lead to skin loss and even blindness due to damaged blood flow, say experts. Researchers used ultrasound to study 100 cases of filler injections that had gone wrong.Clinics are now being advised to carry out ultrasounds before giving dermal fillers in the face, to avoid harming any nearby arteries.Lead researcher Dr Rosa Sigrist says that, although uncommon, such \"vascular occlusion\" events - where the filler is injected into or too close to blood vessels - can be devastating because they can cause tissue death and facial deformity if not treated.Dermal fillers are injectable substances, commonly used to target wrinkles and smooth or \"rejuvenate\" the skin.Sometimes they are used to contour or shape the nose or lips. Areas around the nose are particularly risky injection sites, says Dr Sigrist, because nasal blood vessels communicate with some very important parts of the head. Damage to these vessels can cause severe complications including skin damage, blindness and stroke, she explains. Dr Sigrist's team, from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, studied filler-related vascular complications in 100 patients across four radiology centers (two in Brazil, one in Colombia and one in Chile), one dermatology centre in the Netherlands and one plastic surgery centre in the US between May 2022 and April 2025. Her work will be presented at a medical conference - the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America - this week. In just under half the cases, ultrasound scans showed absent blood flow to small blood vessels that connect superficial arteries to deep ones in the face.And in a third of cases, blood flow was absent in major blood vessels. Rosa Maria Silveira Sigrist, M.D., and RSNAAn ultrasound scan of a patient's lip shows absent blood flow (black areas located at the top, middle of the picture) in a segment of an artery. Meanwhile, red shows blood flow towards the ultrasound probe, while blue shows flow away from it.To avoid complications in the first place, she advises clinics to use ultrasound to plan where to inject. If complications do arise, ultrasound can guide where to treat. \"If injectors are not guided by ultrasound, they treat based on where the clinical findings are and inject blindly,\" Dr. Sigrist says.\"But if we can see the ultrasound finding, we can target the exact place where the occlusion occurs.\" Rather than flooding the area with a drug called hyaluronidase to dissolve the filler, clinicians can do guided injections that use less hyaluronidase and provide better treatment results, she says. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says that the use of ultrasound is increasing, but is not routine or standard care yet.Ultrasound is non-invasive, does not use ionizing radiation and has no known harmful effects. Nora Nugent, president of BAAPS, said it was proving very useful in many areas of surgery and medical aesthetic procedures. \"Mapping out the location of blood vessels undoubtedly provides valuable information ahead of treatment. \"Risks like these from dermal fillers are one of the many reasons why we have been campaigning for a long time for increased regulation of aesthetic procedures and restricting the provision of medical procedures like injectable treatments to those who have medical training.\"The UK government has said it plans to bring in restrictions for cosmetic procedures. Under the proposals, only \"suitably qualified\" healthcare professionals would be able to deliver high-risk procedures such as Brazilian butt lifts.Clinics administering fillers and Botox would need to meet strict standards to obtain a licence.A public consultation will be published in early 2026, with views on the range of procedures which should be covered in the new restrictions. Parliament will then decide what to introduce. ",

    "body": "11 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThe public inquiry into the Covid pandemic has cost the government more than £100m to respond to so far, the BBC has learnt. This is on top of the £192m spent by the inquiry itself - meaning the cost to the taxpayer is over 50% more than previously thought.The government spending covers legal advice and staffing costs – at last count a team of 248 were working across key departments to produce evidence for the inquiry.Inquiry sources questioned the approach, saying the government has at times been \"hostile and difficult\", blocking the release of information and delivering documents late.But the Cabinet Office said it was committed to the inquiry and learning the lessons for the future.However, the TaxPayers' Alliance has branded it a waste of money and the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said while the work being done was vital, public inquiries generally needed to become more efficient and less adversarial.'Defensive attitude'The scale and cost of the Covid Inquiry have already been questioned by some.It got under way in 2022 and its final report is not expected until 2027. It has already cost £192m – a figure which is expected to rise past £200m by the time it is finished, making it one of the most expensive public inquiries in history.In total there are 10 separate investigations – or modules as they are called. So far only two, looking at pandemic preparedness and government decision-making, have been completed.But analysis of Cabinet Office documents by the BBC has found government departments spent around £101m from April 2023 to June 2025.The bulk of this is thought to have been accrued by five key departments – the Cabinet Office, Home Office, Department of Health and Social Care, Treasury and UK Health Security Agency, which have been repeatedly asked to provide evidence.The costing estimates do not include time officials spend preparing and appearing as witnesses in person.More than half the £101m spend has been on legal fees – including bringing in external lawyers.An inquiry source said that to some extent the spending reflected the defensive attitude of the government towards the inquiry.Inquiry chair Baroness Hallett and the inquiry legal team have criticised government departments for delays providing documents and blocking the release of key information.This most famously came to a head in 2023, when the inquiry and government ended up in the High Court over the government's refusal to release Boris Johnson's WhatsApp messages, diaries and notebooks. The government lost the case.Sources said the government had set up a \"huge operation\" which had at times seemed \"hostile and difficult\" to the inquiry.A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: \"The government is fully committed to supporting the work of the inquiry and to learning lessons from the pandemic to ensure the UK is better prepared for a future pandemic.\"The Cabinet Office argues the court case was brought to gain clarity on a point of principle - the right of an inquiry to request information that the provider considers  irrelevant.'Disgrace'John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance think tank, said: \"It's an absolute disgrace that ministers have burnt through an extra £100m on top of what the inquiry itself has already spent.\"These new figures show the total cost to taxpayers will be far higher than previously feared.\"Ministers must urgently get a grip on the spiralling costs of the Covid Inquiry and commit to delivering answers swiftly and efficiently.\"A spokesman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said the work of the inquiry was \"vital\" and any costs would be recouped many times over in the future if lessons were learned by reducing the economic impact of the next pandemic as well as saving lives.But he added: \"The inquiry process is far from perfect.\"He said the group supported the Hillsborough Law, which is working its way through parliament and strengthens the legal duty on public authorities to assist public inquiries.He said public inquiries like the Covid one needed to become more efficient and less adversarial.\"Only then can we bring down the cost of future inquiries while protecting access to justice.\"A spokesman for the Covid inquiry said: \"The inquiry is unlike any previous public inquiry. It was given a very broad scope because it is investigating multiple aspects of a pandemic that affected everyone in society.\"He said the chair had made clear at the start that it would take time and have significant cost, but it was working faster than any other public inquiry of comparable size, pointing out all the hearings would be finished by spring 2026.He said it would result in recommendations that are intended to better protect the UK when the next pandemic strikes, but would not comment on the nature of the relationship with the government.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRoddy RobertsonA historic former railway bridge has been cordoned off by police after a section of it collapsed into the River Spey in Moray.The Spey Viaduct, an iron girder structure near Garmouth, was completed in 1886 and while no longer used for trains, was popular with cyclists and walkers.Images on social media showed one of its supporting stone piers was leaning at an angle and part of the metalwork had twisted and fallen into the river. Local SNP MSP Richard Lochhead said people in the area would be devastated and questioned whether the structure has been adequately maintained. Drone footage shows bridge collapsed into the River SpeyHe said: \"The local community will be heartbroken by the collapse of the much-loved Spey viaduct, which is not only an iconic structure but also incredibly popular with walkers, cyclists, and tourists.\"I'm now in touch with Moray Council seeking answers around when and by whom the structure was last checked, and what happens next with regards to the future of the bridge.\"Roddy RobertsonOne of the supporting stone piers could be seen at an angle in the riverTrev MooreDrone footage showed how a section of the bridge had twisted and fallen into the riverThe bridge spans 350ft (107m) over the River Spey, regarded as the fastest flowing river in ScotlandThe railway line closed in the 1960s but the bridge, also known as the Garmouth Viaduct, was later paved. The Speyside Way, a long-distance trail which traces the River Spey from the Moray Firth to the Cairngorms National Park, passes the east end of the bridge.It is also part of the National Cycle Network.Moray Council, which manages the trail, said the bridge would remain closed until further notice.Roddy RobertsonThe bridge has been cordoned off and Moray Council says it is closed until further noticeA council statement said: \"Our engineers are aware and will assess the situation before further detail can be provided.\"Members of the public and media are asked to keep their distance from the rest of the bridge structure.\"Do not pass the police cordon in place and do not climb on any part of the bridge - thank you for your co-operation.\"Local councillor Shona Morrison said she was \"incredibly saddened by the news\". \"The viaduct holds such a special place in my family's heart,  it is devastating to see the collapse of such a well-loved and iconic landmark.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoAlex BoydGetty ImagesFive men have been arrested in Germany suspected of being involved in a plot to drive a vehicle into people at a Christmas market.Three Moroccans, an Egyptian and a Syrian were detained on Friday over the plan to target a market in the southern Bavarian state. Authorities said they suspected an \"Islamist motive\".Prosecutors said the Egyptian - a 56-year-old - was alleged to have \"called for a vehicle attack... with the aim of killing or injuring as many people as possible\". The Moroccans allegedly agreed to carry out the attack.Officials in Germany have been on high alert after previous attacks at Christmas markets, including in Magdeburg last December that killed six people.Authorities did not say when the planned attack was supposed to take place or which market was the target, though said they believed it to be one in the Dingolfing-Landau area, north east of Munich.German newspaper Bild reported the Egyptian man was an imam at a mosque in the area.Police said the Moroccan men - aged 30, 28 and 22 - were arrested accused of having agreed to commit murder, while the Syrian man, a 37-year-old, was accused of encouraging the suspects \"in their decision to commit the crime\".The five suspects appeared before a magistrate on Saturday and remain in custody.Joachim Herrmann, Bavaria's state interior minister, told Bild the \"excellent cooperation between our security services\" had helped to prevent \"a potentially Islamist-motivated attack\".Christmas markets are popular festive attractions throughout Germany, frequently attracting large crowds and significant tourism.Security at events has been increased in recent years, since an attack in Berlin in 2016 when a man drove a lorry into a market crowd, killing 12 people.",

    "body": "6 minutes agoEmily AtkinsonWatch: Eyewitness captures moment man tackles and disarms Bondi shooterA \"hero\" bystander who was filmed wrestling a gun from one of the Bondi Beach attackers has been named as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed.Video verified by the BBC showed Mr Ahmed run at the gunman and seize his weapon, before turning the gun round on him, forcing his retreat. Mr Ahmed, a fruit shop owner and father of two, remains in hospital, where he has undergone surgery for bullet wounds to his arm and hand, his family told 7News Australia.Sixteen people died following the shooting on Sunday night, which took place as more than 1,000 people attended an event to celebrate Hanukkah. The attack has since been declared by police as a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.Mr Ahmed's cousin, Mustafa, told 7News Australia: \"Still he is in hospital and we don't know exactly what is going on, the doctor says he is OK.\"We hope he is OK, he is a hero, 100% he is a hero. He has two shots, one in his arm and one in his hand, he has had to have an operation.\"Two gunmen are believed to have carried out the attack, with police investigating whether others were involved. One of the gunmen was killed, with a second in \"critical condition,\" police say.The footage of Mr Ahmed's intervention has been shared widely online.It shows one of the gunmen standing behind a palm tree near a small pedestrian bridge, aiming and shooting his gun towards a target out of shot.Mr Ahmed, who was hiding behind a parked car, is seen leaping out at the attacker, who he tackles.He manages to wrestle the gun from the attacker, pushes him to the ground and points the gun towards him. The attacker retreats.He then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the shooters.Nearby on the bridge, another gunman continues firing. It's unclear who or what he is aiming at.Mr Ahmed managed to wrestle the gun from the attacker in the struggle At a news conference late on Sunday, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns paid tribute to the bravery of Mr Ahmed, who was unnamed at the time.\"That man is a genuine hero, and I've got no doubt there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery.\"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said: \"We have seen Australians today run towards danger in order to help others.\"These Australians are heroes, and their bravery has saved lives.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoMarc Ashdown,Business correspondent andNick Edser,Business reporterA revamp of train timetables has come into effect across the country, involving some of the most significant changes for more than seven years.Rail operators are promising more services across the network and faster journeys on some routes as a result of the changes, with the East Coast Main Line to benefit the most.Passengers are being advised to check the new timetables before travelling.The level of change has not been seen since May 2018 when an update sparked major disruption and cancellations on some routes.Rail timetables are changed every May and December, but rarely to this degree.Network Rail is promising quicker journeys and thousands of extra seats every day, following a £4bn investment over the past decade.The changes promise a cut of 15 minutes to journey times between London King's Cross and Edinburgh, and 10 minutes between Edinburgh and York.Network Rail says the rail line, which is used by several operators, will have improved connectivity between Scotland, North East England, Yorkshire and London.One of the companies using the line, LNER, called the changes \"transformational\" and said it expected to run 10,000 additional services per year.Ellie Burrows, Eastern regional managing director for Network Rail, said: \"The industry has been preparing for many years for the new timetable.\"Our priority now is to continue working together to deliver the long-term benefits of this timetable change, the biggest in over a decade, for our passengers and the communities we serve.\"The changes will also see Northern launch a new hourly fast service between Leeds and Sheffield.Transport for Wales is introducing more services for Chester, Wrexham and Swansea.Another operator, Avanti, says there will be more trains between London and Liverpool.However, there will be cuts to some routes as well. Avanti is cutting the number of services between Blackpool and London from four to two.The changes are the biggest since May 2018 when a timetable update led to weeks of chaos on the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Northern networks.The number of trains cancelled each day by GTR and Northern hit up to 470 and 310 respectively.That led to a full review and eventually the Labour government's decision to create Great British Railways and bring the industry under state control.Travel expert Simon Calder said he was \"pretty confident we won't see the complete collapse of a network, as we did when the Thameslink line had its timetable completely reconfigured in 2018 - that was an absolute shambles\".\"There has been an awful lot of thought and time that has gone into this and the whole idea is to extract the maximum possible capacity from Britain's Victorian rail network without jeopardising reliability.\"Rail industry expert Tony Miles told the BBC's Broadcasting House programme that the changes in May 2018 had been based on \"using every available slot for a train on the network, and that was the mistake\".\"You need to have some wriggle room\" for when things go wrong, he added. However, Monday morning would be the \"real challenge\" for the new system, Mr  Miles said.\"Obviously Sunday morning services aren't quite as stressful for the system as a peak time on a weekday.\"",

    "body": "A person of interest has been detained in connection with a shooting at Brown University in the US which left two people dead, police said.Nine others were injured after a gunman opened fire at the university in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday.Police said the detained suspect was in his 20s, but have not named him. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said seven people who were injured in the incident remained in a stable condition, one of them is in critical condition, and another was discharged.The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.The identities of those killed or injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters on Saturday that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students.In a statement released by the university on Sunday, Paxson said some areas of campus were still restricted as police continued their investigations. Around 2,000 students were relocated to safe locations overnight, she said, adding that she was \"deeply moved\" by students and locals who opened up their homes.Paxson said the families of the two students killed were being supported. \"There are not enough words of comfort for families who lose a child, but we will do all we can,\" she added. In a news conference on Sunday, Smiley said an earlier order for residents to shelter had now been lifted. The mayor said he had met with victims and their families in the hospital and was \"overwhelmed\" by their \"courage, hope, and gratitude\".A vigil will be held on Sunday evening for the community. Police had earlier released CCTV footage of a male suspect walking away from the scene wearing all black clothing. Officers said a firearm was not found in a sweep of the building.In a post on X,  FBI director Kash Patel said the suspect was detained at a hotel in Coventry, in the early hours of Sunday morning based on a lead from Providence Police.Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez confirmed on Sunday that officers were not looking for anyone else and were working with prosecutors to collect evidence.Hundreds of police officers and federal agents were sent to Providence on Saturday to find the suspect. Speaking at the White House, President Trump said he hoped the nine injured students \"get well fast\" and paid respects to the families of the two people who died. The attack on the Ivy League university brings the number of mass shootings to 389 in the US for this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.It defines mass shootings as having four or more victims killed or injured, not including the attacker.",

    "body": "Kemi Badenoch says the Conservatives will scrap the ban on petrol and diesel vehicles due to come into force in the UK if they win the next election.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Conservative Party leader said the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate (ZEV) was a \"well-meaning but ultimately destructive piece of legislation\".From 2030, all new cars will have to be electric or hybrid as part of government efforts to meet a legally binding aim of achieving \"net zero\" by 2050.The Conservative leader's comments come after her meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has lobbied the EU to water down its own plans for a ban.Net zero refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere.Six EU countries, including Italy, have recently called on other member states to rethink plans to phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2035, saying it could hurt industrial competitiveness.Badenoch suggested the EU had signalled it would drop a full ban, adding: \"The reality is that the EU's change of heart on EVs will leave Labour even more isolated, and by pressing ahead alone, we are placing our domestic industry at a disadvantage while giving others the opportunity to dominate global supply chains.\"She said the only \"winners in this economic self-harm are China\".The Conservative leader added that her government would still move towards a \"transition to cleaner transport\" but one driven by \"affordability, practicality and technological progress\" rather than \"unrealistic mandates that weaken domestic manufacturing and empower foreign competitors\".She said scrapping the mandate would give \"space\" to rebuild the UK's car industry.UK car firms were said to have been split over the 2030 deadline, with some calling for more support to be able to meet it.In its latest Budget, the government announced an extra £1.3 billion investment into the UK's Electric Car Grant scheme to encourage drivers to make the switch to EVs.Chancellor Rachel Reeves also announced that drivers of battery electric cars, which includes plug-in hybrids, will be charged 3p per mile for the Electric Vehicle Excise Duty from April 2028, with some arguing the move could make electric cars less appealing.The ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars was originally introduced in 2020 by then Prime Minister, Conservative Boris Johnson - Badenoch, a cabinet member at the time, opposed the plans.It was later pushed back to 2035 by Rishi Sunak, with Labour pledging to bring it forward in its 2024 election manifesto.A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said the government remained \"committed to phasing out all new non-zero emission car and van sales\".They said: \"More drivers than ever are choosing electric\".The next UK general election must be held by 15 August 2029, but the prime minister can opt to call an election at any point before this.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondentandAlex SmithViolence against women and girls is a \"national emergency\", the home secretary has said, as she announced plans to set up specialist rape and sexual offence investigation teams in every police force in England and Wales by 2029.It is part of a long-delayed plan aimed at halving violence against women and girls within a decade.The strategy - which will include funding for undercover units operating online, and a roll out of domestic abuse protection orders - is due to be unveiled on Thursday, after being pushed back three times this year.Shabana Mahmood said that during her time in government she had come to \"the depressing conclusion\" that \"the criminal justice system fails women\". Speaking to the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, she said the way police forces investigate cases was \"too much of a postcode lottery\".The government says the new teams will have officers with specialist investigation skills for working on rape and sexual offence cases.It says staff will have the right training to understand the mindset of abusers and victims.More than 50% of police forces already have these teams in place, but the government says every force will have dedicated officers by 2029.Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley welcomed the move, saying the government will replicate tactics used by the Met in its existing V100 programme.The programme uses data to identify and target men who pose the highest risk to women.Sir Mark said the Met applies the \"same relentless determination we use to combat terrorism to tackle violence against women and girls\", adding: \"We built an entirely new system focused on pursuing and prosecuting men who commit violence and I am pleased the government is now asking all forces to have the same principle.\"Also announced is a roll out of domestic abuse protection orders, which have been trialled over the last year, across England and Wales.They can ban individuals from contacting a victim, visiting their home or posting harmful content online, and can also be used in cases involving coercive or controlling behaviour. Breaching an order is a criminal offence.Mahmood said the early evidence from the pilots on the effectiveness of the orders was \"very, very positive\" with a large number of arrests of people breaching the orders. \"The really different thing that those orders do is they take the onus away from the woman, the victim herself, to chase her abuser all the way around different bits of the legal system in order to enforce the order and actually puts it back on the police,\" she said. There will be almost £2m in investment for special undercover units of police officers operating online - to target those harassing women and girls on the internet.The government is also looking at extending Clare's Law to include offences such as stalking, sexual assault and harassment. The law was established in memory of Clare Wood, who was murdered in 2009 by her-ex-boyfriend who had a history of violent behaviour.It currently allows people to ask for information from the police about their partner, or ex-partner's, history of domestic abuse. A report released earlier this month found that more than a quarter of police forces in England and Wales had not implemented basic policies for investigating sexual offences.It said sexually-motivated crimes against women in public remained widespread, criticised the limited nature of data on them, and called for urgent action to prevent predators from offending.The publishing of the government's strategy has been long delayed. It was initially expected to be announced in the spring.In Labour's general election manifesto last year the party pledged to use \"every government tool available to target perpetrators and address the root causes of abuse and violence\".On Tuesday, the chairs of three Commons select committees raised their concerns over repeated delays in publishing the plans.The BBC has previously been told that changing attitudes among boys and young men will be at the centre of what is proposed.It is understood it will be built around three goals: preventing radicalisation of young men, stopping abusers, and supporting victims.Some domestic abuse survivors have told the BBC the time for talking is over - and these measures must be implemented quickly.Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp called the announcement \"too little, too late\".Speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, he said it was \"disappointing\" it had taken the government a year and a half to produce its strategy and that the funding provided was \"a very small amount\". Asked why the previous Conservative government, of which he was a member, and the current Labour one had struggled to grip the problem, he said both parties took the issue \"seriously\" but added that the criminal justice system was \"quite slow and bureaucratic\".He said changes to the disclosure of evidence, introduced after a prosecution collapsed in 2017, had \"slowed the whole system down\".

    "body": "36 minutes agoJessica RawnsleyandAlex SmithJames Manning/PA WireCrowds have gathered at a London vigil to remember those killed in a mass shooting during an event marking the start of Hanukkah at Australia's Bondi Beach.Police forces in England and Scotland have said they are increasing their visibility among Jewish communities, as events celebrating the religious holiday get under way.At least 16 people were killed during the Bondi attack, officials have said, adding that it was targeted at members of the Jewish community. It is unclear if the death toll includes one of the gunmen who was killed at the scene.Among those killed was London-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, his family has confirmed.The 41-year-old father of five was described as a \"caring, vivacious, energetic, outgoing guy who loved people\" by his cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis.He told the BBC people should \"spread light\" by doing charitable acts in Rabbi Schlanger's name: \"I know how he would have been reacting and it was something he said recently.\"Every human being on earth has a positive way to contribute to making the world a better place, and we just have to keep spreading light.\"The world is a positive place and we need to show that and I know Eli would be saying that.\"Follow live updates hereWhat we know so far about Bondi Beach shootingA crowd of around 100 people gathered outside the Australian High Commission in central London on Sunday evening, for a vigil following the Bondi attack.People could be seen waving British and Israeli flags, while some held signs reading: \"Stop the Hate\".Speaking at the vigil, the rabbi for Marleybone, Yisroel Lew, lit a menorah and said: \"After hearing what happened this morning, the first thought was: how can we bring more light?\"Don't be afraid and celebrate Hanukkah.\"Just down the road in Trafalgar Square, a large menorah was lit up to mark the first day of Hanukkah.James Manning/PA WireJames Manning/PA WireAlso on Sunday evening, Sir Keir Starmer and his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer, lit a menorah in the window of Number 10.Lady Starmer is Jewish, and Sir Keir has previously said they often mark the beginning of Shabbat on Friday nights.In a post on social media, the prime minister said: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with those murdered in the terrorist attack on Bondi beach today, their loved ones and the whole Jewish community.\"Light will always win over darkness.\"@keir_starmerEarlier, the UK's Jewish Leadership Council (JLC) called on the police and government to protect events celebrating Hanukkah - which begins on Sunday evening and lasts for eight days - saying: \"We must not let hatred extinguish the festival of light.\"In a statement, the JLC said it is \"devastated and angered that in Sydney, Jews appear to have been targeted once again for being Jewish\".\"We know that such hatred also exists in this country, as we are still reeling from the attack on a synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur.\"Two people were killed in that attack at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar.Starmer described the Bondi attack as \"sickening\" and said the government was working with Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish security organisation, on the policing of Hanukkah events in the UK.Police Scotland said it was carrying out additional patrols around synagogues and other Jewish venues and was \"actively communicating with faith leaders\".Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the Metropolitan Police would increase its visibility in Jewish communities ahead of Hanukkah events.The police force confirmed this, adding: \"At a time when London's Jewish communities are coming together to begin the celebration of Hanukkah, we know this attack will be the cause of not just terrible upset but also significant heightened concern about safety.\"It added that \"there is no information to suggest any link between the attack in Sydney and the threat level in London\".King Charles said he was \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack\" at the Bondi Hanukah celebrations, and that his - and Queen Camilla's \"hearts go out to everyone who has been affected so dreadfully\".He added that the light of the Jewish festival \"will always triumph over the darkness of such evil\".The Prince and Princess of Wales also issued a statement, saying their \"thoughts are with every Australian today\", and they \"stand with the Jewish community in grief\".Meanwhile, the UK's chief rabbi said the Jewish community will \"rebuild with tenacity\".\"As we kindle our first Chanukah lights this evening, we hold the victims of the unspeakable atrocity in Sydney in our hearts and in our prayers,\" Sir Ephraim Mirvis  said in a statement on X.Green Party leader Zack Polanski said he was on his way to a Hanukkah event which \"should be a celebration but instead our community is once again mourning\".\"I will be thinking of everyone in Australia and those around the world in the Jewish community who know this fear and loss. We stand with you.\"The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had offered its support to its Australian partners and was in touch with the government to discuss the UK response.\"The scourges of terrorism and antisemitism are shared, international challenges and need concerted and determined action to defeat them,\" it added.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has advised any British people caught up in the shooting to contact the Sydney consulate for support.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, Vilnius, Lithuania'It's like coming up from the depth of the ocean', Ales Bialiatski tells BBCRumours of a major prisoner release from Belarus had been swirling for a couple of days.But no one would reveal the names on the list, or the exact number, until everyone was safely out, finally free.In total,123 political prisoners have been released, including some of the best-known names among Belarusian opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists.Maria Kolesnikova, the protest leader with a famous red-lipsticked smile, was on the release list.A video of her jumping for joy and hugging other former prisoners, overjoyed to be reunited, was soon flying around social media. Then came another, on a bus out of Belarus, where she thanked everyone who'd helped bring this moment about.\"It's a feeling of incredible happiness to see those who are dear to me, to hug them and realise we are all free,\" Masha, as she's best known, told the camera, her lips already painted red again.The first sunset of her freedom was a thing of great beauty, she said.\"But I also think of those who are not yet free and I await the moment when we can all embrace, when all are free.\"ReutersMaria Kolesnikova (centre) was among more than 100 prisoners handed over to UkraineOut too is Viktor Babaryka, a banker who tried to run for president in 2020 but was locked up before the elections even began.The Nobel Peace prize winner Ales Bialiatski has also been released from a 10-year sentence.All were imprisoned for their opposition to the authoritarian rule of Alexander Lukashenko, whose security forces crushed the mass protests of 2020 with brutal force. They were the biggest challenge to his rule that he has ever faced. The prisoners' release now is the result of long and complex negotiations led by the US that culminated in a two-day visit to Minsk this week by Donald Trump's new special envoy, John Coale.For Lukashenko, that engagement itself is a win: after years as a political pariah in the West he is clearly happy to be back on talking terms with the US.But he also got US sanctions dropped on a key export for his country, potash, as a further, more tangible reward. EU penalties - and tougher policies - are still in place.It's not entirely clear what Trump has to gain from this. But Belarus is a close ally of Russia, including in its war on Ukraine, and the move comes as the US has been re-engaging with Moscow too, seeking a peace deal.Watch: BBC captures celebrations as Belarus frees political prisonersThe dozens of prisoners Lukashenko agreed to let go were always expected to come here to Vilnius, Lithuania, where a crowd of friends, relatives and fellow activists gathered outside the US embassy in the freezing cold to greet them.Some came wrapped in the red and white opposition flag of Belarus.Tatsiana Khomich, Masha Kolesnikova's sister who had campaigned for over five years for her release, couldn't stop smiling. \"I've just spoken to Masha,\" she told me after a video call.A professional flautist before the disputed 2020 elections, Kolesnikova spent much of her sentence in solitary confinement, denied even letters and phone calls to her family.\"She's fine, she's good. I just want to hug her. I still can't quite believe it,\" her sister said.Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd: a police car, blue lights flashing, was heading towards the US embassy gates, leading a small convoy of other vehicles.But there was no way all 123 ex-prisoners were inside. Instead, we learned, just seven foreign nationals had been brought to Lithuania and only Ales Bialiatski of the Belarusians.'Optimism and activism'The others, including Kolesnikova, had been taken out of Belarus to Ukraine: from prison, into a war zone.Staying in their own country is not usually an option on offer.\"Lukashenko's idea, who else?\" was how one of opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's team interpreted the surprise diversion to Ukraine. It seems he'd decided to play one final power game, so the family reunions, so long awaited, would be delayed.But what of the price paid for that moment? Tikhanovskaya is a friend and political ally of Masha Kolesnikova, but she always calls for maximum pressure on Lukashenko by the West.So has the US gone too far, I wondered.\"This is a process of negotiation. Of course, it would be good for us if nothing is given to Lukashenko, because all those people are hostages of his regime. They are innocent.\"But this is how negotiation goes,\" she replied, before noting that sanctions can always be reapplied if necessary.\"President Trump now uses carrots. He also can use sticks.\"A few steps away, a man waving a giant flag worried that Lukashenko would just take more prisoners. This is not a sign of sudden humanity, he said.After a short time inside the US embassy, Ales Bialiatski emerged onto the street to ecstatic cheers from the crowd.Gaunt, head shaven and still in his padded blue prison jacket, he admitted his head was spinning from all the sensations after four years in jail.\"I was driven across Belarus in a blindfold, from east to west, so I still can't get my head round it. This is so emotional,\" he shared, describing being woken at 04:00 and told by his prison guard to pack.When I asked what he wanted now most of all he didn't hesitate: \"I want to see my wife!\"She's on her way, I was told.Bialiatski's own organisation, Viasna, monitors political detentions in Belarus and the activist reminded everyone that many hundreds of people like him - only less well known - have been left behind bars.\"It is very important for everyone to continue to work for those political prisoners who are still in Belarusian prisons, to strive for the complete release of all of them.\"Then, lifting the red and white flag from his shoulders, he had a message for Belarusians everywhere.\"Optimism and activism,\" Ales Bialiatski told them, with a sudden smile. \"Never give up!\"",

    "body": "What we know so far about the Brown University shooting2 hours agoTom McArthurWatch: Police release CCTV of Brown University shooting suspectPolice have detained a person of interest in connection with a US shooting at Brown University that left two people dead and nine others injured. An earlier order for people on the Brown campus and surrounding areas to shelter in place has also been lifted.The attack on the campus brings the number of mass shootings in the US to 389 for this year, according to the independent analysis website Gun Violence Archive.It defines mass shootings as having four or more victims killed or injured, not including the attacker.Here's what we know:What happened?The gunman opened fire in a classroom at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Barus and Holley engineering building at the eastern end of Brown's campus, according to officials.Final exams were taking place in the building at the time of the shooting, the school said.The engineering building is a seven-storey block that includes 117 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and three lecture halls.An economics professor told local public media outlet Ocean State Radio that the shooting had taken place during a review session for her course, which was led by her teaching assistant.\"He said that the shooter came in the doors, yelled something - he couldn't remember what he yelled - and started shooting,\" Rachel Friedberg said.\"Students started to scramble to try to get away from the shooter, trying to get lower down in the stadium seating, and people got shot,\" she added.On Saturday, investigators said they were not immediately sure how the shooter got inside the first-floor classroom. Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Mayor of Providence Brett Smiley said.Two students, who were studying in the nearby Rockefeller library when the active gunman alert came through, told the BBC they \"stayed away from the windows\" as they awaited a police escort.Officers searched the floor, made them drop their bags and raise their hands before before being led out of the library, the pair said.Brown University, one of the oldest higher education institutions in the US, is part of the Ivy League, a group of elite universities in the northeast of the country.The university, which has more than 11,000 students, is in Providence, Rhode Island's capital city, which is located about 50 miles (80km) from Boston and 180 miles (290km) from New York City.Anadolu via Getty ImagesWho are the victims?Two students were killed in the incident and nine others were injured. Smiley told reporters on Sunday that one person is in a critical condition and seven others are in a stable condition in hospital. One person with less severe injuries was discharged, he added. The identities of those killed or injured have not yet been released, but Brown University President Christina Paxson told reporters in a press briefing that all the victims, including those killed and wounded, were students.\"This is a day that we hoped never would come to our community. It is deeply devastating for all of us,\" she said in a statement.In a statement on Sunday, the university said that the families of the two students killed were being supported.\"There are not enough words of comfort for families who lose a child, but we will do all we can,\" Ms Paxson said.According to police, a ninth victim did not suffer a gunshot wound, but had non-life threatening injuries from fragments from a shooting \"that had occurred near them\".Who is the gunman?A person of interest was taken into custody in connection with the shooting, officials said on Sunday.Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said limited details would be released on the detained suspect, but said he was in his 20s. In a post on X, FBI director Kash Patel said the suspect was detained at a hotel in Coventry in the early hours of Sunday morning based on a lead from Providence Police.A law enforcement source told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the person of interest is not currently enrolled as a student at Brown University.Officials confirmed on Sunday that officers were not looking for anyone else.On Saturday police released CCTV footage of a male suspect, walking away from the scene of the shooting wearing all black clothing.There is no weapon visible in the video, and his face is covered. Officials also say a firearm was not found in a sweep of the building on Saturday.Some witnesses reportedly told officers he may have been wearing a camouflage grey mask.One person was arrested before police determined they were not involved in the shooting and released them.What is the latest?In a statement released by the university on Sunday, Ms Paxson said some areas of campus are still restricted as police continue their investigations.She said around 2,000 students were relocated to safe locations overnight, adding that she was \"deeply moved\" by students and locals who opened up their homes. Brown University said all remaining exams, papers and projects would not take place as scheduled. US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters as he returned to the White House from attending the annual Army and Navy football game, described the shooting as \"a terrible thing\".\"All we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt,\" he said.Additional reporting by Pratiksha Ghildial",

    "body": "22 hours agoJoe TidyCyber correspondent, BBC World ServiceBBCThéodore remembers the AI slop that tipped him over the edge.The image was of two emaciated, impoverished South Asian children. For some reason, despite their boyish features they have thick beards. One of them had no hands and only one foot. The other was holding a sign saying it's his birthday and asking for likes.Inexplicably they are sitting in the middle of a busy road in the pouring rain with a birthday cake. The image is full of tell-tale signs that it was made with AI. But on Facebook it went viral with nearly one million likes and heart emojis.Something snapped in Théodore.\"It boggled my mind. The absurd AI made images were all over Facebook and getting [a] huge amount of traction without any scrutiny at all - it was insane to me,\" says the 20-year-old student from Paris.So Théodore started an account on X, formerly known as Twitter, called \"Insane AI Slop\" and started calling out and poking fun at the content he came across that was fooling people. Others took notice and his inbox soon became flooded with people sending submissions for popular so-called AI slop.Left: Théodore. Right: “Baby Bubbles and Babbles” Facebook page.Théodore (left) started an online campaign to poke fun at AI 'slop' on social media, including a fake image (right) that received nearly one million likesCommon themes started becoming apparent - religion, military or poor children doing heartwarming things.\"Kids in the third world doing impressive stuff is always popular - like a poor kid in Africa making an insane statue out of trash. I think people find it wholesome so the creators think, 'Great, let's make more of this stuff up,'\" Théodore says.Théodore's account soon swelled to over 133,000 followers.The onslaught of AI slop - which he defines as fake, unconvincing videos and pictures, made  quickly - is now unstoppable. Tech companies have embraced AI. Some of the firms say they are starting to crack down on some forms of AI 'slop' - though many social media feeds still appear to be full of the content.Over just a couple of years, the experience of using social media has changed profoundly. How did it happen, and what effect will it have on society?And, perhaps most pressingly of all, how much do the billions of social media users actually care?Social media's 'third phase'In October, during another jubilant earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg happily declared that social media had entered a third phase, which is now centred around AI.\"First was when all content was from friends, family, and accounts that you followed directly.\"The second was when we added all of the creator content. Now as AI makes it easier to create and remix content, we're going to add yet another huge corpus of content,\" he told shareholders.Meta, which runs social media sites Facebook, Instagram and Threads, is not only allowing people to post AI generated content - it's launched products to enable more of it to be made. Image and video generators and increasingly powerful filters are now being offered across the board.When approached for comment, Meta pointed the BBC to January's earnings call. In that call, the billionaire said the firm was leaning even more into AI, and made no mention of any clampdown on slop.\"Soon we'll see an explosion of new media formats that are more immersive and interactive, and only possible because of advances in AI,\" Zuckerberg said.YouTube's CEO, Neal Mohan, wrote in his 2026 look-ahead blog that in December alone more than one million YouTube channels used the platform's AI tools to make content.\"Just as the synthesizer, Photoshop and CGI revolutionized sound and visuals, AI will be a boon to the creatives who are ready to lean in,\" he wrote.The CEO also acknowledged that there are growing concerns about \"low-quality content, aka AI slop\". He said his team is working on ways to improve systems to find and remove \"low quality, repetitive content\".ReutersMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors that AI \"makes it easier to create and remix content\"But he also ruled out making any judgements on what should and shouldn't be allowed to flourish. He pointed out that once-niche content like ASMR (soothing sounds designed to make your scalp tingle) and live video game-playing is now mainstream.According to research from AI company Kapwing, 20% of content shown to a freshly opened YouTube account is now \"low-quality AI video\".Short-form video in particular was a hotspot, with Kapwing finding it featured in 104 of the first 500 YouTube Shorts clips shown to a new account created by the researchers.The creator economy seems to be a big driver as people and channels can earn money from engagement and views. Judging by the views on some AI channels and videos, people are indeed drawn to the content - or the algorithms that dictate what we see are, anyway.According to Kapwing, the AI slop channel with the most views is India's Bandar Apna Dost, which has 2.07 billion views, netting the creators an estimated annual earnings of $4m (£2.9 million).But there is something of a backlash taking place too.Under many viral AI videos, it's now common to see a furious flurry of comments decrying the content.Giant monsters and deadly belly parasitesThéodore, the student from Paris, helped to drive this backlash.Using his newfound influence on X he complained to YouTube moderators about the flood of weird AI cartoons that got huge numbers of views. In his view they were disturbing and harmful, and in some cases appeared to him to be aimed at children.The videos were called things like \"Mum cat saves kitten from deadly belly parasites\", and showed gory scenes.Another short clip showed a woman in a night dress who eats a parasite and then turns into a giant angry monster that is eventually healed by Jesus.'Sprung Nexus' YouTube accountThéodore thought some of the AI cartoons he saw on YouTube were disturbing. YouTube says they removed the videos flagged to them for violating their community guidelinesYouTube removed the channels, telling us they did so because they violated their community guidelines. They said they are \"focused on connecting our users with high-quality content, regardless of how it was made\", and said they are working to \"reduce the spread of low quality AI content\".But that experience, plus many others like it, have ground Théodore down.UnknownSome of the AI 'slop' on social media is downright strange, Théodore saysEven seemingly cosy lifestyle sites like Pinterest - the forum for recipes and interior design ideas -  have been affected.Users have become so frustrated by the deluge of AI slop that the company introduced a new opt-out system for AI-generated content - but this relies on users admitting that their perfect-house imagery is AI made.Fury in the comments sectionOn my feed (and I'm aware that everyone's feed is different - including the comments) - the backlash to AI slop has become incessant.Whether it's TikTok, Threads, Instagram or X - there seems to be a people-power movement against this content.Sometimes the number of likes for the AI backlash comments far exceed the original post. Such is the case with a recent video showing a snowboarder rescuing a wolf from a bear. The video itself had 932 likes - versus 2,400 likes for a commenter who wrote, \"Raise your hand if you're tired of this AI s**t\".But of course it all feeds the beast.All engagement is good engagement for social media platforms where keeping us scrolling is key.So does it actually matter if the amazing, heartwarming or shocking video on your social feed is real or not?The 'brain rot' effectEmily Thorson, associate professor at Syracuse University in the US, who specialises in politics, misinformation and misperceptions, says it depends on what people are doing on the social media platform.\"If a person is on a short-video platform solely for entertainment, then their standard for whether something is worthwhile is simply 'is it entertaining?',\" she says. \"But if someone is on the platform to learn about a topic or to connect with community members, then they might perceive AI-generated content as more problematic.\"How people feel about AI slop also depends on how it is communicated.If something is made clearly as a joke, it seems to be taken as such. But when AI slop has been created specifically to deceive, it can anger people.One AI-generated video I saw recently is emblematic: an incredibly realistic, natural-history-style video of an astonishing leopard hunt. In the comments, some viewers were fooled; others were unsure.\"What documentary is it from?,\" one commenter asked. \"Please - it is the only way to [prove] no AI.\"UnknownA backlash has grown against AI 'slop', with lots of comments under videos and photos now pointing out if something is AI-generatedAlessandro Galeazzi, from the University of Padova in Italy, researches social media behaviour and echo chambers.He says that verifying whether or not a video is AI takes mental effort, and over the long run, he fears people will simply stop checking.\"My feeling is that the flood of nonsense, low-quality content generated using AI might further reduce people's attention span,\" he says.He distinguishes content that is intended to deceive with the more comical and obviously-fake AI slop, like fish with shoes, or gorillas lifting weights at the gym.But even that more whimsical content might also have a damaging impact. He talks of the risk of \"brain rot\" - the idea that our constant exposure to social media is harming our intellectual abilities.\"I would say AI slop increases the brain rot effect, making people quickly consume content that they know is not only unlikely to be real, but probably not meaningful or interesting,\" he says.Cuts to moderation teamsBeyond the slop, some AI-made content can have far worse implications.Elon Musk's companies xAI and social platform X were recently forced to change their rules after the chatbot Grok was being used to digitally undress women and children on X.And in the aftermath of the US attack on Venezuela, fake videos were spread of people crying in the streets and thanking the US. Content like this can shape public opinion and give the impression that the US raid was more popular that it might have really been.This is especially concerning as so many people use social media as their only source of news, analysts say.Dr Manny Ahmed, CEO of OpenOrigins, a company that distinguishes between AI and real  images, says we need a new way for real content posters to be able to prove their clips and pictures are genuine.More from InDepth\"We are already at the point where you cannot confidently tell what is real by inspection alone,\" he says. \"Instead of trying to detect what is fake, we need infrastructure that allows real content to publicly prove its origin.\"You might think this is something that social media companies could take on. But many, including Meta and X, have cut their moderation teams down and embraced a more collective approach. They now lean towards relying on users to label things as fake or misleading.Slop-free social media?So if the existing tech giants are broadly happy to let the slop flow, could a new social media platform rise up, promising a slop-free alternative, and eventually challenge the incumbents?It seems unlikely because detection of AI is becoming harder and harder. Machines are no longer able to accurately detect if a video or image is definitively fake, and machines would struggle even more on the subjective judgement of whether or not content counts as 'slop'.However, if a new social media does come along and people vote with their feet (or eyeballs and thumbs, more accurately), it just might move the dial. I'm reminded of the rise of social media challenger BeReal, a French app that gained popularity during the pandemic, which encourages users to show their authentic selves via non-filtered selfies at random times.BeReal hasn't yet reached the same heights as the Facebooks and Snapchats of the world, and probably never will. But it did make the other platforms sit up and in some cases, they copied the idea.Perhaps that could happen again if an anti AI slop challenger makes a move.As for Théodore, he feels that the battle is lost and that AI slop is here to stay.In spite of the submissions still coming into his mailbox from his now 130,000 followers, he doesn't post as much anymore and has largely resigned himself to the new normal of life online.\"Unlike a lot of my followers, I'm not dogmatically against AI,\" he says. \"I'm against the pollution online of AI slop that's made for quick entertainment and views.\"Top image credit: BBC; AI image generated with Adobe Firefly.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "21 hours agoMark Savage,Music correspondent,Paul Glynn,Entertainment ReporterandChristal Hayes,Entertainment ReporterWatch: the must-see moments from the 2026 Grammy AwardsThe 68th Grammys ceremony provided its usual mix of endless awards, powerful speeches and perplexing performances.We stayed up all night to watch it, so you didn't have to.Here are some of the best and worst moments from \"music's biggest night\".Cher's comical cameoReutersCher saw the funny side of her gaffeCher made a surprise appearance at the Grammys - her first in 18 years - to receive a lifetime achievement award, and then to present record of the year.And while it was great to see the singer, her link was messier than a night out with Charli XCX.She gave a heartfelt acceptance speech about the importance of following your dreams before walking off without having revealed the next nominees.When she did, she announced - confusingly - that Luther Vandross had won, seemingly from beyond the grave.Easy mistake, though, and it soon became apparent that she had meant to say Luther... by Kendrick Lamar and SZA - a track that does indeed sample the late soul singer.If only she could turn back time.\"I love live television,\" laughed host Trevor Noah afterwards.An APT start to Trevor's last GrammysEPA/ShutterstockRosé and Bruno Mars performing togetherThe show got under way with a rocking version of APT by Bruno Mars and Rosé, which was up for several awards (but ultimately didn't win any).Comedian Noah - in his sixth and final outing as host - explained afterwards that the track was inspired by popular South Korean drinking game Apartment.He then noted how, in light of recent events, the American public now had their own new national drinking game.\"Every time you turn on the news, you drink,\" he quipped.Pharrell Williams cringes at his careerGetty ImagesPharrell Williams was honoured with a lifetime achievement prizePharrell Williams - the architect of hits like Kelis's Milkshake, Justin Timberlake's Rock Your Body, ODB's Got Your Money and his own feelgood hit Happy - was rightfully given the Grammys global impact award.Looking dapper in a pink tux, the star dedicated his prize to \"everyone in this room who believes in the power of black music\".But he squirmed his way through a celebratory montage of his biggest songs.\"I don't know how y'all feel but, for me, it's like listening to your voicemail over like a loudspeaker,\" he observed.Yungblud's good luck charm from Ozzy OsbourneReutersBritish star Yungblud won best rock performance for his live rendition of Black Sabbath's Changes - recorded during Ozzy Osbourne's farewell concert in Birmingham last year.Speaking to reporters on the red carpet, the Doncaster singer said the prize felt a bit \"bittersweet\", after Osbourne's death last summer.He also revealed that his hotel had hung a picture of the late rock star \"above the fireplace\" of his room, \"as a little good luck charm\".It was a \"pretty epic\" touch, he added of the gesture.Before the show, Osbourne's widow Sharon told BBC News the family were delighted that some of rock's biggest names had got together to \"show their love and respect\" with a tribute performance during the ceremony.Walking the red carpet, his son Jack said it felt like his dad was with them - except that he had actually \"hated awards shows\".\"He wouldn't want to be with us,\" he added with a laugh.All aboard Sabrina AirlinesEmma McIntyre / Getty ImagesSabrina Carpenter lit up the stage during an aviation themed performanceSabrina Carpenter gave one of last year's most memorable performances, with a blooper-filled rendition of Espresso.And she was cleared for take-off again in 2026, thanks to a seatbelt-fastening take on her number one hit Manchild.The star appeared as an airline pilot, twirling her way through baggage reclaim while shrugging off a bevy of useless men – a surgeon, a priest, a magician, an astronaut.It made absolutely no sense, but she delivered it with such panache that it barely mattered – even when she ended the performance by pulling a dove out of a top hat.In other words, she wasn't winging it. She's got an altitude for this sort of thing. The performance landed. Stop me when you've had enough.Leon Thomas's mum picked up his first awardEPA/ShutterstockLeon Thomas won one of the early awards for best traditional R&B performance for his song Vibes Don't Lie, but he wasn't there to pick it up. Luckily his mum, Jayon Anthony, was on hand to accept the award for him and even brought a note to explain his absence.\"Right now he's on stage rehearsing,\" she explained, ahead of her son's performance in the best new artist medley.However, Thomas made it to the stage in time to pick up his second award - best R&B album, for Mutt.K-Pop shows its teethEPA/Shutterstock(left to right) Audrey Nuna, Ejae, and Rei Ami from the fictional bandGolden, the breakout hit from Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, was named best song for visual media - earning the K-pop genre its first ever Grammy Award.Marking that historic occasion, South Korean-American singer-songwriter EJAE (Eun-jae Kim) thanked her... er, dentist.On the red carpet, she explained that the song had come to her on the drive to get a routine check-up and polish.She recorded the melody as a voice memo, before getting into the dreaded dental chair.\"Thank you dentist,\" she smiled on the red carpet, showing off those pearly whites.Heidi Klum and Chappell Roan reveal (almost) allGetty ImagesSupermodel Heidi Klum got tongues wagging on the red carpet while taking comically short steps in a nude latex dress.She could barely walk, but soldiered on with a smile for the photographers.The German catwalk star later reappeared, having slipped into something more comfortable.Elsewhere on the night, Chappell Roan went totally topless but for two nipple rings, threaded with the spaghetti straps that were holding up the bottom of her dress. Speaking of which...Bieber in his boxersReutersJustin Bieber made his Grammys return with a performance of Yukon, from his 2025 album Swag 2. And the Canadian pop star performed wearing nothing but his silk boxers, a pair of socks and a purple guitar.His wife Hailey wore a smile, looking on in the audience.\"One more move and we would've had to put the show on OnlyFans,\" joked Noah afterwards. \"That was brave.\"Eight-year-old Grammy winner Aura V is living her best lifeReutersAura V and her father Fyutch won best children's music album for HarmonyAnd she is not lacking in confidence either.The Grammys' youngest ever winner won best children's album for her collaboration with her father, Fyütch.Speaking on stage, she said it was \"an honour to be here\", adding: \"I was not expecting us to go this far.\"She also gave a shout-out to Icelandic star Laufey - winner of best traditional pop vocal album.\"I just saw her on the red carpet, and I got to talk to her for a little bit, and I know that she won a Grammy too so congratulations to her.\" Speaking to reporters afterwards, she explained her purple outfit was inspired by her love of lavenders and the calmness they bring.She also confirmed her bedtime had been extended until 1am for the night, while her dad said the fizzy apple juice would be flowing in celebration.Lady Gaga's understated* performanceEPA/ShutterstockLady Gaga on stage wearing an eyelash lampshade hat, of courseAt last year's Grammys, Lady Gaga booked out an entire ad break to premiere the music video for Abracadabra, her fantastically maximalist return to pop theatrics.This time round, she brought the song to life with a small rock ensemble that featured her producer Andrew Watt on guitar and Gaga herself on a vintage Roland keyboard.It was reliably, delightfully over the top. Gaga's head was trapped in Satan's wicker basket, as she performed her \"monster claw\" dance and writhed around on the floor.The painstaking pop production that earned the song a record of the year nomination was jettisoned, with Gaga screaming the hook against a blinding array of floodlights.It was disco. It was punk. It was The Phantom of the Popera. Well done.*NB: Sarcasm.Steven Spielberg is an EGOTGetty ImagesThat's not an insult, by the way. It stands for Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony (awards).In other words, an artist who won all of the above.The famous film director joined the esteemed EGOT club on Sunday with a win in the music film category for his production work on Music for John Williams, a documentary about the US composer.Spielberg's Grammy gong will sit nicely alongside his Oscar ornaments won for Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, his Emmys for ER and Animaniacs, as well as his Tony trophy for A Strange Loop.He's gonna need a bigger cabinet.Other card-carrying members of the now 22-strong EGOT club include Sir Elton John, Viola Davis and Whoopi Goldberg.A tale of two TikTokersGetty ImagesAlex Warren and Addison Rae both hit the charts after making their names as influencersAddison Rae and Alex Warren both rose to fame on TikTok. In fact, they were both members of the Hype House, whose members became celebrities during the Covid lockdowns.Over the last couple of years, however, they've both launched pop careers.Warren had the UK's biggest-selling single of 2025 with Ordinary, an ode to his wife Kouvr, who left home to be with him when he was living rough on the streets of LA.Rae took inspiration from Charli XCX and Britney Spears, turning in one of last year's most innovative and addictive debut albums.Both earned nominations for best new artist – which meant both got to perform at the Grammy ceremony. Sadly for Warren, earpiece issues left him singing flat and out of sync during his segment. A more seasoned performer might have pulled through, but his inexperience was telling.Rae was another matter – her background as a dancer helping her pull off a tight and punchy performance of Fame Is A Gun, filmed backstage as a trolley laden with Grammy trophies was driving past.In the end, both lost out to Olivia Dean – whose joyous version of Man I Need had the entire audience singing along.Country shake-up honours the past and futureGetty ImagesZach Top won the best traditional country albumThis year's awards saw the best country album honour divided in two, with new categories for best traditional and best contemporary country album.The move came after Beyoncé's win for the disruptive Cowboy Carter last year, and some saw the change as a dig at the star's attempt to cross genres.But the Recording Academy said the change had been under discussion for years, as forward-thinking artists begin to incorporate pop, rap, hip-hop and even EDM to the Nashville sound.In the end, the newly minted best traditional prize went to Zach Top, who proved his credentials by accepting the trophy in a cowboy hat.Rapper-turned-country star Jelly Roll won the new honour for best contemporary country album.Backstage, he talked about why the category changes were necessary.\"The Grammys is always showing how hip they are, with what's actually going on with music,\" he said, noting there'd been an \"undeniable tsunami\" in the genre over the last five years.Trevor Noah tries to get Bad Bunny cancelledGetty ImagesBad Bunny stole the headlines with his historic album of the year win, but there was one thing he couldn't do: Play his music.Just like Kendrick Lamar last year, he's about to headline the Super Bowl half-time show, which means that, contractually, he's not allowed to perform anywhere else.That didn't stop Noah trying to persuade him. \"Don't you get jealous seeing everyone else [perform]?\" he asked the musician.Smiling, Bad Bunny responded: \"Maybe a little bit\", then tried to turn the tables by asking Noah about his decision to step down as Grammys host.\"I should have taken more photos. I should have given more hugs and more kisses whenever I could,\" Noah replied, quoting Bunny's lyrics in the song DtMF.\"Is that my song in English?\" asked the singer, before transitioning into the actual lyrics: \"Y si hoy me emborracho, pues, que me ayuden.\"All of a sudden, a brass band appeared, goading the star into a few bars of his song.\"Oh man, if they sue you, that wasn't me,\" laughed Noah.Context is (Carole) KingEPA/ShutterstockCarole King (left) alongside Lady GagaThe legendary singer-songwriter provided some much needed context ahead of the ceremony, stressing that, while awards are nice, they are not the most important thing in the music world.The real award, as the Grammy winner said on the red carpet, is the work itself.\"The win is doing it, getting to do it, getting to have people hear the music,\" explained King - who has won multiple Grammys awards including best album in 1972 for the timeless Tapestry.\"And that was just like the extra win, but that the important part was doing it.\"And I kind of want to tell all the nominees who don't get the award, they've already won.\"Devil Wears Prada 2 trailer drops during ad break20th Century StudiosMeryl Streep and Anne Hathaway made an unexpected appearance during the Grammys... kind ofOK, this technically isn't about the music - but a new trailer for the long-awaited Devil Wears Prada sequel casually dropped during a break in the Grammys action.In the preview for the movie, which is out in cinemas on 1 May, it seems that Anne Hathaway's character, Andy Sachs, is no longer the scared assistant to Meryl Streep's menacing fashion editor, Miranda Priestly.But does her old boss recognise the new Andy? Not that she's letting on.\"Sorry, who is this?\" Priestly is heard asking her colleague Nigel Kipling, played by Stanley Tucci.\"Do you know her? Do I know her?\"And just to ram home the fact that Streep's character is based on feared fashion editor Anna Wintour, the soundtrack to the trailer was Madonna's Vogue.",

    "body": "10 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentPA MediaLord Mandelson has faced more questions over his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein\"I am a fighter not a quitter\", Peter Mandelson famously declared when he retained his Hartlepool seat in the 2001 election.Mandelson had his front-rank political career resurrected three times subsequently:  as an EU commissioner; as business secretary and de facto deputy prime minister to Gordon Brown in 2009, and as ambassador to Washington in 2025.That third resignation - or, more accurately, sacking - is almost certainly going to be his last.While the previous tranche of the Epstein files focussed on whether it was politically and personally unwise for Lord Mandelson to continue to associate with a convicted paedophile, the latest revelations raise questions about his conduct in office in 2009 and 2010.Even if Epstein had committed no crimes, it would still be a hugely serious matter for the then business secretary apparently to pass a foreign financier sensitive and potentially advantageous government information.The SNP, the Lib Dems, Reform UK - and some prominent Labour politicians - believe this is worthy of criminal investigation.But it may well be his one time political ally and occasional political foe becomes his nemesis.In his statement on Monday,  former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has declared his shock at the latest revelations and has called for a wide-ranging, intensive  Whitehall inquiry into the disclosure of government documents  - and for its findings to be made public.Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment.ReutersLord Mandelson, then in his role as Britain's ambassador to the United States, speaks to Sir Keir Starmer during a welcome reception at the ambassador's residence on February 26, 2025But Brown's statement isn't entirely helpful for the current prime minister.Sir Keir Starmer has been under pressure from opposition politicians to order an inquiry in to how Lord Mandelson was appointed as US ambassador in the first place.In an attempt to get on the front foot today, the prime minister said there would be an urgent investigation into Lord Mandelson's links with Epstein while he was a minister in the last Labour government.But it now transpires that Gordon Brown had asked the cabinet secretary to undertake a similar exercise as long ago as last September - although it unearthed nothing.And that may solidify further the  criticism from the opposition - and from some inside the Labour Party - that Sir Keir has been too slow to act.When Lord Mandelson was turfed out of Washington last September, Downing Street said that was because the \"extent and depth\" of his relationship with Epstein hadn't been previously known. While new depths now appear to have been plumbed, the question of why some more wasn't known or discovered before his appointment will not go away.Without approving that appointment, any historical revelations about Lord Mandelson would have been unlikely to have risked political damage to the prime minister directly.In retrospect, Sir Keir must be wishing the self-declared political fighter had become a quitter many years ago.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPeter HoskinsBloomberg via Getty ImagesHidden handles are widespread in China's new energy vehicle marketChina has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.It comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.Under the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media. The new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle. Inside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.  Cars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.Hidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.They feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.Although the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.Tesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.In November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.The NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.In four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.",

    "body": "5 hours agoShola LeeBBC NewsBBC/Eleven/J RedzaDavid McKenna (left) stars as Piggy and Lox Pratt (right) as Jack in the new adaptation of William Golding's 1954 classic Lord of the FliesJack Thorne first read Lord of the Flies as a child. He didn't study it in school but received a copy from his mum who was a substitute English teacher.The novel was stamped on the inside: Portway English Department.\"I quite like the fact that my Lord of the Flies copy was a stolen copy,\" he notes with a touch of laughter.The story by William Golding, about young boys stranded on an island who descend into bloody chaos, left a \"profound scar\" on Thorne and, years later, he's adapting it into a four-part BBC series.While Thorne notes that the title of the book has become a shorthand for the \"evilness of boys,\" the story and its characters are far more complex, he says.The screenwriter explains that, for him, the story is \"a remarkably tender portrait\" of young boys. He adds that it is about the moments where we lose ourselves and become stuck in a situation we can't control.Thorne has become known for penning complex portrayals of masculinity and violence, having won an Emmy and Golden Globe for his series Adolescence, with the series being made available to show in schools across the UK to help open discussions around toxic masculinity and online radicalisation.Dave Benett/Getty ImagesLord of the Flies marks Thorne (centre) and director Marc Munden's fourth time collaboratingAnd with his new series, Thorne hopes to develop our understanding of the boys' behaviour in Lord of the Flies, showing their cruelty as well as their fragility.Director Marc Munden says he hopes those watching the new series get an understanding of how things can \"go badly wrong\" and how fallible people can be.\"The world's still full of those confused little boys creating chaos in the world in the guise of men and hopefully this is a little microcosm of that which helps us understand that,\" he adds.'Epitome of evil'Nobel Prize winner William Golding's Lord of the Flies follows a group of school boys being evacuated from an unnamed war, whose plane crashes on an island with no adults. After an attempt at creating a makeshift civil society, the boys turn on and hunt each other.Thorne says the story made sense to him in a \"completely different\" way as an adult as he started to better understand the boys' behaviour. When Thorne first read the book, lead character Jack, instigator of hunts on the island, was the \"epitome of evil\".\"He was everything I hated about the boys around me,\" he explains.But as an adult, Thorne sees him as a complicated boy, \"he is as loving as he is hateful\".BBC/Eleven/J RedzaMunden says Thorne's script gives so much insight into the \"bad behaviour\" of the characters like Jack (played by Lox Pratt, centre) and notes that Golding, who was a school teacher, really understood and unpacked this in the bookThorne hopes to communicate this complexity in the new series, with each episode named after and offering insight into a different character's perspective as chaos progresses on the island.Thorne describes this as a \"relay race\" between the leads, starting with Piggy (David McKenna), the intellectual voice of reason in the group, then to Jack (Lox Pratt), the leader of the choir boys, to Simon (Ike Talbut), a sensitive, independent boy, and finally Ralph (Winston Sawyers) the group's elected leader.He notes that Jack's episode in particular is incredibly important to our understanding of the story - and that conveying his complexity \"allows the story to flower in a completely different way because you are literally looking into the eyes of someone that is fighting themselves\".Munden notes that while the insights into these characters given in each episode doesn't \"excuse\" their behaviour, it does help our understanding.He hopes that with this new adaptation, anyone that once saw the story as \"brutal and pessimistic\" can see that there is a \"lot of love\" in the way Golding and Thorne write the characters.BBC/Eleven/J RedzaWhile Munden (Centre) says it was \"chaos\" filming on location in Malaysia with a large cast of children, he says the young actors took it \"very seriously\" and the four leads were \"remarkable\"'Empathy box'Thorne hopes that the new series encourages kids to talk to their parents about what they're going through.The screenwriter says that to him, a TV is like an \"empathy box\" that sits in the corner of a room and encourages people to speak about their problems.\"I grew up watching EastEnders with my mum - and sitting on the sofa with her afterwards and talking about it are some of the clearest memories of my childhood,\" Thorne says, explaining that he would often use plot lines from the show to talk to his mum about what he was \"going through\" in a way that felt safe.He hopes that Lord of the Flies offers the same experience and helps young people watching navigate their way through \"the most difficult period of life\".BBC/Eleven/J RedzaGolding's story has been translated into multiple languages with millions of copies soldThorne adds that it is \"crucial\" to revisit and understand Golding's story as we navigate uncertain times and try to \"stop our own cruelty from emerging\".Munden says there is a \"tragic truth\" in the way the society in the story can tip over into chaos.The director adds that he tried to create a \"sense of unease\" in the series and feels the context of a war going on in the background of the novel is \"a metaphor for what we're all experiencing, which is somewhere not that distant from us, the potential for conflict is just on the edge\". You can watch Lord of the Flies at 21:00 GMT on BBC One on Sunday 8 February or on iPlayer the same day.More on this story",

    "body": "13 hours agoDavid McKennaEast Yorkshire and LincolnshireHumberside Police / ReutersVladimir Motin was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter The captain of a cargo ship that collided with a tanker in the North Sea has been found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter.Vladimir Motin was the only person on watch duty on the Solong when it hit US tanker Stena Immaculate off the East Yorkshire coast on 10 March 2025, leaving Mark Angelo Pernia, 38, a crew member on the Solong, missing presumed dead.A trial at the Old Bailey in London heard Motin did not keep a proper lookout and did not use all available means to determine the risk of a collision, or leave enough time to take evasive action. Motin, 59, from St Petersburg, Russia, is due to be sentenced on Thursday.Watch: Moment cargo ship crashes into oil tanker in North SeaAfter deliberating for more than eight hours, the jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict.Motin appeared emotionless as it was read out and was remanded back into custody.Prosecutor Tom Little KC told jurors Pernia's wife had been about seven months pregnant at the time of his death.He said she lived in a remote area in the Philippines and would need to make arrangements to travel somewhere with good internet access so that she could watch sentencing proceedings.EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe Solong cargo ship pictured in the North Sea in the aftermath of the collisionGuidance: Contains language which some may find offensiveThe Stena Immaculate, with a crew of 23, was transporting more than 220,000 barrels of aviation fuel from Greece to the UK.The Solong, with a 14-strong crew, was carrying mainly alcoholic spirits and some hazardous substances, including empty but unclean sodium cyanide containers.With both ships laden with flammable cargo, the danger in the event of a collision was obvious, the court was told.Prosecutors said Motin was responsible for multiple failures in the lead-up to the tragedy and then lied about what took place on the bridge.The court heard the tanker was visible on the Solong's radar display for 36 minutes before impact, yet Motin failed to steer away from the collision course, sound the alarm, summon help or initiate a crash stop.CCTV footage capturing the moment of impact was also shown in court.The crew on the Stena Immaculate reacted, saying: \"Holy shit... what just hit us... a container ship... this is no drill, this is no drill, fire fire fire, we have had a collision.\"In contrast, the court heard there had been a lengthy silence from the bridge of the Solong before Motin was heard to react.Motin and the remaining Solong crew abandoned ship and were brought ashore in Grimsby where the defendant messaged his wife, saying he would be \"guilty\".PA MediaThe Stena Immaculate suffered substantial damage when it was hit by the SolongDefence barristers previously told the trial there was \"no doubt\" Motin was at fault for the collision, but claimed his actions did not amount to gross negligence manslaughter.Faure-Walker told jurors Motin had a \"lax attitude\" and \"thought he knew better than anyone else\".\"Whether in isolation or combination, the defendant's failures were so exceptionally bad they amount to gross negligence,\" she added.Faure-Walker said it was also \"inconceivable\" an experienced mariner such as Motin was \"unable to press a button\" to switch from autopilot to manual steering, adding there were no mechanical or electronic difficulties on the Solong.\"The only thing that was not working on 10th March 2025 was the man in the dock,\" she added.PA MediaMark Angelo Pernia was a father-of-two and was from the PhilippinesFollowing the conclusion of the case, Det Ch Supt Craig Nicholson, of Humberside Police, described the incident as a \"senseless tragedy\".\"It's a miracle that there weren't more fatalities or serious injuries,\" he said.\"This could have been a huge environmental catastrophe.\"Michael Gregory, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the \"entirely avoidable\" death of a member of Motin's crew was caused by \"truly, exceptionally bad negligence\".\"Mark Pernia was just going about his day-to-day work. It is with great sadness for his family that his body has never been found,\" he added.Gregory described Motin as an experienced vessel master, but said his actions on this occasion \"fell gravely below the standards expected\".More on this story",

    "body": "6 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesFederal immigration agents deployed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, will soon receive body cameras, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says.The announcement comes as the government faces a backlash over the deaths last month of two US citizens - Alex Pretti and Renee Good - following a surge of federal immigration officers into the Minneapolis area as part of an immigration crackdown.\"Effective immediately we are deploying body cameras to every officer in the field in Minneapolis,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X on Monday. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner has ruled Pretti's 24 January death a homicide. Homicide refers to the killing of a person by another person. It does not necessarily signify that a crime has occurred.Monday's report by the medical examiner said Pretti had suffered \"multiple gunshot wounds\" fired by one or more law enforcement officers.It added that he died in the emergency room at the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. No further details were noted.According to US Customs and Border Protection, the two agents involved in Pretti's death wore body cameras. They have been placed on leave, the agency said.The US Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into Pretti's death.Noem said once funding is available, the body camera programme will be expanded nationwide. The US is currently on day three of a partial government shutdown as Democrats continue to demand immigration reforms, including body cameras, as part of any funding deal to reopen the government.Immigration and Customs Enforcement is currently the highest funded US law enforcement agency, after Congress authorised $80bn (£59bn) for the agency last year.Asked about Noem's announcement, President Donald Trump said that body cameras \"generally tend to be good for law enforcement because people can't lie about what's happening\". \"Generally speaking, I think it's 80% good for law enforcement,\" he said. In the wake of Pretti's shooting, the Trump administration removed Gregory Bovino, the US border patrol chief, from Minneapolis and replaced him with border tsar Tom Homan. Last week Homan met local leaders, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Michael Frey, to discuss calming tensions in the wake of Pretti and Good's deaths. Walz and Frey have called for a withdrawal of federal agents entirely from the state's capital region.After his arrival, Homan said that authorities were working on a plan to \"draw down\" federal agents in Minneapolis, but that changes in the operation would depend on how much state and local officials co-operate with federal authorities. The administration has criticised Minneapolis for having a \"sanctuary city policy\" that bars city employees from enforcing immigration laws.Frey told the New York Times that he wants Minneapolis police officers \"doing the important work of keeping Minneapolis residents safe\". But he has said the city will work with federal authorities in certain situations.More than 3,000 federal immigration officers have been in the state of Minnesota for weeks as part of a federal immigration surge ordered by Trump, who campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration.",

    "body": "January rainfall in parts of UK breaks more than century-long recordImage source, Jordan LangridgeImage caption, A drone captures severe flooding in Axminster, Devon following Storm Chandra in January 2026ByChris Fawkes Lead Weather PresenterOfficial statistics for January have been released by the Met Office and confirm what many will already suspect - it has been very wet for many areas.Northern Ireland, south-west and southern England, and the east of Scotland all had one of their wettest Januarys on record.With 70% more rain than average Northern Ireland experienced the wettest January for 149 years. Culdrose in Cornwall recorded two and a quarter times its average, while Aboyne in Aberdeenshire had nearly four times its January average of 68.9mm. The month also bought us an average amount of sunshine and a below average overall temperature, something that's increasingly rare as our world warms due to climate change. Image source, Met Office/BBCImage caption, A map of January 2026 rainfall totals. In the background, extensive flooding around Fordgate and Moorland in SomersetConversely, rainfall across north-west England and west Scotland was below average. You can see in the map above the areas coloured brown had less rain than normally expected in January. That includes north-west England and western Scotland. Altnaharra, in Highland, has seen 66mm of rain, which is less than half its January average. Aviemore has also had below the average as it has been very sheltered from the prevailing south-east winds by the Cairngorm mountains.Image caption, An airmass chart showing an area of high pressure sitting over Scandinavia which has stopped the areas of low pressure moving away from the UKThe reason it has been so wet for many is because of a blocking area of high pressure over Scandinavia.As rain-bearing areas of low pressure have come in off the Atlantic, they've been prevented from moving through. This has often resulted in a pattern of south-westerly winds in the south of the UK, and south-easterly winds in east Scotland. Areas exposed to those prevailing winds have had the wettest weather.Is more flooding on the way?The Met Office has issued a yellow rain warning for south-west England, valid between 18:00 Monday and 21:00 Tuesday with 10-20mm falling widely and up to 50mm over Dartmoor. The ground remains saturated and more than sixty flood warnings are in force even before this next batch of wet weather arrives, so further flooding is expected.There are also yellow warnings for snow in north-east Scotland for Tuesday and Wednesday with 10-20cm forecast above 200m elevation and several centimetres at lower elevations, bringing the threat of some localised disruption.Beyond the next few days of weather, the same blocking area of high pressure remains over Scandinavia for another two weeks. So it is likely that weather patterns will stay stuck in a rut with nothing changing substantially until mid-February. That means the threat of more heavy rain with localised flooding in southern England and eastern Scotland where hill snow is also likely at times. We'll probably see more of a change in our weather patterns during the second half of February.The great irony about all this rain is that technically a hosepipe ban remains in force for parts of southern England - that means you shouldn't go out watering your grass or plants, not that they'll be needing any extra water right now.

    "body": "13 hours agoChloe HarcombeWest of EnglandGetty ImagesMP Dan Norris said he \"vigorously and entirely\" denied the \"untrue\" allegationsAn independent MP has been arrested for a second time on suspicion of a string of sexual offences.Former Labour MP Dan Norris, 66, remains under investigation over the alleged rape of a woman and has been further arrested on suspicion of raping a second woman, sexually assaulting a third woman, voyeurism, and upskirting women.The former West of England Mayor was first arrested in April 2025 on suspicion of sexual offences against a girl, child abduction, and the rape of a woman. Police are no longer investigating the alleged child sexual offences or abduction. Norris said in a statement that he \"vigorously and entirely\" denied all of the allegations made against him.Norris, who is also being investigated over alleged misconduct in a public office, remains on condition bail.All the offences are alleged to have occurred between the 2000s and 2020s.In a statement, Norris said: \"I vigorously and entirely deny the serious allegations made against me. They are untrue. \"I am challenging them through my legal representatives.\"More from BristolNorris was elected as a Labour MP for North East Somerset and Hanham in July 2024, defeating Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg.The Labour Party said it immediately suspended Norris when it was made aware of his arrest in April. He is now sitting as an independent but has not attended the House of Commons since his arrest. He is still able to vote by proxy.A petition claiming Norris cannot fully support his constituency and demanding his resignation has reached more than 2,000 signatures.Norris previously said in a statement that he continued to represent his constituents, stayed across local and national developments, handled casework, policy queries and parliamentary questions.He would only lose his position as an MP if he was charged, convicted and jailed.Norris' term as the West of England mayor came to an end in May 2025, when he was replaced by Helen Godwin.In a statement, Godwin said she was unable to comment on the ongoing police investigation.\"My thoughts are with everyone affected by today's deeply upsetting further news,\" she added.'Complex' investigationAvon and Somerset Police said its investigation began in December 2024.\"Investigations into sexual offences are sensitive and complex and as a result it can take a significant amount of time for enquiries to be completed,\" a spokesperson for the force said.\"We're keeping victims updated on any developments and we'll continue to give access to any support they may need.\"We'd respectfully ask people not to speculate on the circumstances so our enquiries can continue unhindered.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "Police review misconduct claims after files suggest Mandelson sent government information to Epstein7 hours agoBecky Morton,Political reporterandJack Fenwick,Political correspondentPA MediaLord Mandelson was inducted into the House of Lords in 2008, while serving as a Labour ministerPolice are reviewing reports of alleged misconduct in a public office after Lord Mandelson was accused of passing on sensitive government information to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.It comes after the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Reform UK said they had reported the peer to police, while the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and some Labour MPs have also called for the police to investigate.Email exchanges released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) appear to show Lord Mandelson forwarded on information to the disgraced financier when he was business secretary under Gordon Brown in 2009.Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment about the allegations.Metropolitan Police commander Ella Marriott said: \"We are aware of the further release of millions of court documents in relation to Jeffrey Epstein by the United States Department of Justice.\"Following this release and subsequent media reporting, the Met has received a number of reports relating to alleged misconduct in a public office. The reports will all be reviewed to determine if they meet the criminal threshold for investigation.\"As with any matter, if new and relevant information is brought to our attention we will assess it, and investigate as appropriate.\"A government spokesperson said: \"It is rightly for the police to determine whether to investigate and the government stands ready to provide whatever support and assistance the police need.\"Earlier, Downing Street said Sir Keir Starmer believes Lord Mandelson should not be a member of the House of Lords or use his title.However, the prime minister's official spokesman said he did not have the power to directly remove the peer's title.Under current arrangements, a new law would be required to remove a peerage. The government has launched an urgent investigation into Lord Mandelson's contact with Epstein while he was a government minister.The peer has been on a leave of absence from the House of Lords since taking up the role of US ambassador in December 2024.He was sacked from the position last September when further details about his relationship with the disgraced financier were made public.On Sunday, Lord Mandelson also resigned his Labour membership after four decades as a key figure in the party.It followed the release of more documents by the US DoJ on Friday, which detailed the extent of his contact with Epstein.Other emails in the tranche of documents appear to suggest: Lord Mandelson advised Epstein in 2009 that the boss of the JP Morgan bank should \"mildly threaten\" the UK chancellor over a planned tax on bankers' bonusesHe gave advance notice to Epstein of a €500bn bailout from the EU to save the EuroEpstein made $75,000 (£55,000) in payments to Lord Mandelson in three separate $25,000 transactions in 2003 and 2004Epstein sent £10,000 to Lord Mandelson's partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva in 2009.The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the revelations were \"shocking\" and must be fully investigated by the UK government and all appropriate authorities.In a statement, Brown said he had asked the cabinet secretary to investigate the disclosure of confidential and market sensitive information from the business department during the financial crisis. The former prime minister said he had already asked the cabinet secretary to investigate information in the Epstein files about communications between Lord Mandelson and Epstein on asset sales in September last year.Brown said no record could be found of such communications and he was now asking for \"a wider and more extensive enquiry\" on the disclosure of government papers.Giving a statement to MPs in the House of Commons earlier, Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister Darren Jones said: \"The undeclared exchange of funds, the passing on of government information, let alone the facts that those exchanges were to a convicted paedophile, are wholly unconscionable.\"He said the government would work with the House of Lords to modernise disciplinary procedures to allow for the removal of peers who had brought the chamber into disrepute.Jones argued it was better to update procedures so they applied to all peers, rather than introducing complex pieces of legislation for each individual.Conservative shadow Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart said the government \"cannot hide from its responsibility in having made Mandelson its ambassador in the first place\", when his relationship with Epstein was known.A handful of Labour MPs have criticised the government's handling of the row, according to private messages seen by BBC News.Outlining the government's position in a WhatsApp group for Labour MPs, a Number 10 official said: \"It's right that Peter Mandelson has resigned from the Labour party and had he not done so, the party was actively looking at what action could be taken.\"One Labour MP replied: \"That line on Peter Mandelson is no way strong enough.\"Another said: \"Agree. Surely had he not resigned the party would have suspended him pending expulsion given the seriousness of conduct.\"Emails released in the files indicate that Lord Mandelson - who was then business secretary - discussed the government's plans for a one-off tax on bankers' bonuses with Epstein.In an email eight days after the plans were announced by then-chancellor Alistair Darling in December 2009, Epstein asked Lord Mandelson whether Jamie Dimon, the boss of JP Morgan, should call Darling.Lord Mandelson appears to reply and say \"Yes and mildly threaten\", before Epstein then asks if it \"make more sense to offer more for the small business fund in exchange for a reduction in tax\".Other emails suggest that Lord Mandelson forwarded internal government information to Jeffrey Epstein when he was Brown's business secretary and de facto deputy prime minister.In June 2009, Brown's policy adviser Nick Butler wrote an email to the prime minister about the UK's struggling economy, in which he advocated \"releasing value from the very substantial asset base which the government holds\" and suggested the government came up with an \"asset sales plan\".Butler copied in several people, including Peter Mandelson, and newly released emails indicate that Mandelson then forwarded that email on to Epstein, with the message: \"Interesting note that's gone to the PM\".Epstein then replied asking: \"what salable [sic] assets?\"Butler told the BBC he was \"shocked\" by the revelations and Lord Mandelson \"should be ashamed of what he's done\".He called for a full investigation, adding that in the period after the financial crisis there was a lot of information \"that people like Epstein could have traded on\".A further internal government email, which Mandelson was copied into, was also forwarded to Epstein in August 2009, but it is not clear who forwarded that email to the disgraced financier.In the August 2009 email, then-government Business Minister Shriti Vadera discussed how to improve financial markets in the wake of the crash and suggested providing funds to struggling companies in exchange for a share of ownership.In a statement announcing that he was resigning his Labour membership on Sunday, Lord Mandelson said he believed allegations that Epstein made financial payments to him 20 years ago were false.He has also reiterated his regret that he continued his association with Epstein after his conviction, apologising \"unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesSarah Ferguson's charity, Sarah's Trust, has announced it will close \"for the foreseeable future\" just days after new details emerged about the former Duchess of York's friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.A spokesman for the foundation said the decision comes after \"some months\" of discussion. Among the more than three million documents released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) last week emails were emails appearing to show Ferguson was in contact with Epstein while he was in prison for soliciting sex from a minor.The BBC has contacted Ferguson for comment on the latest release. Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.The charity Sarah's Trust was established in 2020 and is \"dedicated to supporting frontline, grassroots work to address the humanitarian and environmental crisis, the hunger crisis and issues perpetuating cycles of extreme poverty\", according to its website.\"Our chair Sarah Ferguson and the board of trustees have agreed that with regret the charity will shortly close for the foreseeable future,\" a spokesman said on Monday evening.\"This has been under discussion and in train for some months,\" he added.The foundation did not provide further details behind its decision to close.Previous revelations surrounding the former duchess' ties to Epstein led to her being dropped as a patron or ambassador from a series of charities last year.Julia's House, a children's hospice, was the first to remove her, saying it was \"inappropriate\" for her to continue in the role.The Teenage Cancer Trust, Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, Children's Literacy Charity, National Foundation for Retired Service Animals and Prevent Breast Cancer also announced they had dropped Ferguson as patron.The British Heart Foundation said she would no longer be its ambassador.Mountbatten-Windsor has always consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment.In another email, Ferguson appears to congratulate Epstein on the arrival of a \"baby boy\".Epstein was released from prison on 22 July 2009 after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence. An email dated 14 June 2009 from a \"Sarah\" says: \"I need to ask you how I start The Mothers Army company so it can be commercial, how do I do that? Can you help me?\"Then on the 26 June 2009, \"Sarah\" writes to Epstein saying: \"I am alive... yes I did go to the first lady and she loved the Mothers Army. I am going to call you later Love you\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesResident doctors in England have voted in favour of more strike action in their long-running dispute with the government over pay and training posts.British Medical Association (BMA) members backed more walkouts, which means the union now has another six-month mandate to take strike action, although it has not yet announced any new dates.The doctors' dispute started in spring 2023 and has led to 14 separate strikes.It comes after a month of talks between the union and the government following the last walkout just before Christmas.Some 93% of BMA members voted in favour of continuing with the dispute, with the turnout at 53%.BMA resident doctor leader Dr Jack Fletcher said ministers \"cannot be shocked\" by the fact that doctors have voted to strike \"after being recommended a pay cut this year by the same health secretary who promised a journey to fair pay\".The government has proposed a 2.5% pay increase from April.Dr Fletcher added: \"And without thousands more training posts, the bottlenecks in medical training are going to continue to rob brilliant young doctors of their careers. Doctors have today clearly said that is not acceptable.\"He said strikes were not inevitable, adding that the government had shown \"an improved approach in tone\" in recent weeks.\"A deal is there to be done: a new jobs package and an offer raising pay fairly over several years can be worked out through good will on both sides, in the interests of patients, staff and the whole NHS,\" Dr Fletcher said.Resident doctors have received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years, but the BMA argues that still leaves their pay a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.The union has also argued there is a jobs shortage at a crucial part of their medical training.Resident doctors - who used to be called junior doctors and make up about nearly half of all doctors in the NHS - move into speciality training places after year two. Last year there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs at this stage, although some will have been doctors from abroad.A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The government has been in intensive and constructive discussions with the BMA since the start of the new year to try and bring an end to the damaging cycle of strikes and avoid further unnecessary disruption for patients and NHS staff.\"We hope that these talks result in an agreement that works for everyone, so that there is not any more strike action by resident doctors in 2026.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentLondon News PicturesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor seen in Windsor at the weekendAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor should give evidence about what he knows about Jeffrey Epstein, says a prominent lawyer representing some of the US sex offender's victims.\"It's not too late and he does have information he could share,\" Gloria Allred told the BBC.But the latest emails released by the US Department of Justice show there were already multiple approaches from US authorities for Andrew to help with their Epstein inquiries, including a formal request to the Home Office in 2020.There was also a call from royal sources: \"Anyone who has information should consider helping any investigation, but that is ultimately a matter for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and his conscience.\"\"Why was he willing to speak to the BBC in a one-hour catastrophic television interview, but is not willing to speak to law enforcement?,\" Allred said, referring to Andrew's now-infamous Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis in 2019.\"He's not the one who should decide whether he knows anything that could help in the investigation,\" Allred told the BBC.This followed comments from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer: \"In terms of testifying, I have always said anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information.\"You can't be victim-centred if you're not prepared to do that,\" he said.According to royal sources, the lack of official comment so far from Buckingham Palace should not be seen as complacency, but royal aides are said to fully understand the sense of public upset.It's understood that the Palace does not get any advance notice of the released files and has been monitoring what has emerged.The official position from Buckingham Palace remains that the King and Queen's \"thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse\".So far Andrew has shown no signs of giving evidence. He has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.Last autumn, Democrats in the US Congress set a November deadline for the former prince to testify about what he knew about Epstein, but he gave no response.The latest batch of emails have revealed the previous extent of US attempts to get Andrew to give evidence.In the early months of 2020 there were multiple email exchanges between the US Department of Justice and Andrew's legal team, in which the US authorities tried to pin down a time and place for him to give evidence.This testimony could have been given in the UK or in the US, but the frosty exchanges between the lawyers made little progress, despite both sides pointing to Andrew's public commitment to helping with investigating authorities.ReutersAndrew was seen riding a horse through Windsor Great Park on MondayIn apparent frustration, the US Department for Justice said there was no point \"rehashing our previous conversations\" and reiterated the question \"as to whether Prince Andrew will agree to be interviewed and if so when such interview will take place\".Another email reveals that the US authorities had concluded that \"efforts to obtain a truly voluntary interview have been exhausted\".Obtaining a testimony from Andrew then meant the US legal authorities needed to formally ask their UK counterparts for help - in what's known as mutual legal assistance - whereby one country can ask for another's co-operation to compel overseas witnesses to testify.The emails show this process did begin, with a request delivered to the Home Office in April 2020. An email from a US legal representative noted their surprise at the timing and that it had arrived when the \"pandemic in London is expected to peak in the next week or two\".Later, the US ambassador in the UK seemed to be showing concern about what was happening - and there were further questions in August 2021 about the implications of a case being brought in the US against Andrew by Virginia Giuffre, who accused him and Epstein of sexual assault.That would make Andrew the defendant rather than a witness, complicating the status of a request for a statement from him, while the case was in progress.There were also comments from the US side about their UK counterparts \"wringing their hands\" about information over Andrew.The civil case brought by Giuffre was ultimately settled out of court in 2022, with Andrew rejecting any claims of wrongdoing and not having to deliver any testimony.

    "body": "4 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesFamilies of children diagnosed with cancer will have the cost of travelling for treatment covered under a new scheme to be rolled out in England by 2027.The government is setting aside £10 million a year to pay for children and young people's travel costs up to the age of 24, which can run into thousands of pounds during the course of treatment.Long and expensive journeys for treatment are common with child cancer patients normally referred to one of 13 specialist centres across England.Research suggests families pay £250 a month on average to fund hospital journeys, and charities report some go into debt to fund treatment.'Really expensive'Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"When a child is diagnosed with cancer, their family's focus should be on helping them recover and getting them well, not on whether they can afford the petrol or bus fare to get to their next appointment.\"This small change will make the world of difference to parents,\" he added.One family who have experienced how difficult it is to balance the finances is the Wildings. Their baby boy, Theo, was diagnosed with an aggressive infant blood cancer when he was four months old.His mother, Emma, stayed at the hospital with Theo, who spent seven weeks receiving treatment, while her husband made the 90-minute return journey back and forth to Alder Hey Hospital from their home on a regular basis.\"It's really expensive,\" she says. \"Finances is the last thing you want to think about when you are going through a tough time.\"Emma believes the new policy will mean a lot to families going through the same thing, adding it will be like \"having an arm around you\".FamilyEmma Wilding and her son, Theo, who was diagnosed with cancer at four months oldThe funding announcement is being included in the government's cancer strategy which is being published on Wednesday.The strategy will set out a range of measures being taken to reduce waiting times, improve early diagnosis rates and prevent cancers.Ministers will say it is a once in a generation opportunity to improve cancer care in this country with survival rates lagging behind a number of wealthy countries.The travel support fund has been called for by charities for some time, who have argued that families have run up debts and had to cut back on essentials like food because of the cost of travel. It is further compounded by parents having to give up work or reduce their hours to care for their sick children.Up until now, financial support has been heavily means-tested in England - and has only been made available to those on certain benefits. The same is true in Wales and Northern Ireland, while Scotland has a more generous - although not universal - scheme.Rachel Kirby-Rider, of Young Lives vs Cancer, says her charity has been campaigning for almost a decade for this measure and called it \"a huge step forward\".Alongside the travel support fund, the government is also promising to improve play facilities in hospitals and provide more psychological support.Jules Worrall, of the Teenage Cancer Trust, said she hoped the plans would lead to \"real and lasting change for young people with cancer\".",

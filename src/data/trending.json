    "body": "Image caption, Why is the UK so cold now?Call it a cold snap or just typical British weather. One thing is certain, the weather outside is frightful, freezing, and just really cold.BBC Bitesize spoke to Dr Sylvia Knight, Head of Education at the Royal Meteorologist Society to answer all your cold weather questions.How cold does it have to be for snow?Image caption, The cold never bothered him anywayTo get snow, there has to be enough water vapour in the air to make clouds, and it must be cold enough (0°C) that snowflakes will form and not melt as they fall through the atmosphere to the ground.In the UK, we commonly get snow when the wind is blowing from the north or north east (for example, from the Arctic or Siberia). This air is then warmed from below as it approaches the UK, and rises further when it hits the coasts, hills and mountains.Once the air gets high enough, it cools again until it reaches the point where there is more condensation happening than evaporation - this makes clouds.As the UK is surrounded by sea, there is always plenty of moisture in the air for cloud to form.“It’s never too cold to snow in the UK,” says Dr Sylvia Knight, Head of Education at the Royal Meteorologist Society, “but it can be elsewhere in the world.”“It can be too cold for snow in the centre of large land masses, such as Eurasia, Antarctica or North America, where the wind has not encountered enough water that can easily evaporate.”Water vapour might be picked up over the oceans, such as the North Atlantic or Arctic ocean.“The rate of evaporation from lakes and rivers, which may be frozen, is far slower than from oceans,” Dr Sylvia says. “The oceans change temperature far more slowly than the land does, and so are a source of water vapour all year round compared to places where there is a lot of frozen water.”So, it's not too cold to snow in other places - it’s just too dry!How to tell between a common cold and the flu?Image caption, Should you starve a fever, feed a cold?While their symptoms are similar and they are both communicable viruses, colds and flu are quite different.Flu is characterised by a sudden fever, aches, pains and nausea, and avoiding rest can worsen symptoms and slow down recovery.Colds may make you feel lousy, but don’t always stop you from your day-to-day tasks and the symptoms should start to go away in the second week.What you shouldn’t do is take antibiotics for either, as antibiotics fight against bacterial infections, they don’t treat viruses. It’s best to keep your fluids up for either, avoid sneezing on your hands, and eat if you can stomach it!Why don't gloves work on touch screens?Image caption, Woolly gloves are the enemyYou’re out playing in the snow and you need to check the Bitesize website - but oh no! Your woolly gloves act like a barrier between you and your phone screen. You can always get touch screen gloves - but how do they work?A capacitor is a device that has the ability to store electric charge.  Most phones and tablets have capacitive touchscreens - screens that have an insulator that is coated in a conductive material.Capacitors work by detecting anything that can store an electric charge. This includes you (think about when you rub your feet on the carpet and then get a static shock).When your finger comes into contact with a touchscreen, you create an electrical circuit between your body’s electrical field and the conductors in the screen. This ‘tells’ the conductors exactly where you’re touching.Touch screen gloves have conductive wire woven into the fingertips (usually copper yarn), which completes the circuit and allows the touch screen to detect your electrical field. Now you can stay warm and revise!Is it okay to wear a coat inside?Image caption, Staying warm this winterSome people say you must take your coat off indoors, or you won’t feel the benefit when you go back outside. But is this true?When you wear a coat, you insulate yourself. This makes it harder for infrared radiation (heat) to escape from your body and be lost to the atmosphere. However, that coat also insulates you from heat coming in.“If you put a coat on when you’ve been inside for a while, you may get a bit warm, but you’ll be fine when you go outside and start slowly losing some of that extra warmth to the atmosphere,” says Dr Sylvia.However, she says you should take your coat off indoors for another reason. If you’ve been outside for a long time with your coat on, and are chilly when you come in, then the coat is also cold and will need to warm up. You’ll warm up far quicker without it on.How to stay safe while driving in icy conditions in the UK?Image caption, This icy barrier is no match for methanolUsing a de-icer is an important way to safe of the road. But how does it work?There are many different solutions of windscreen fluid, but the key ingredient to typical de-icer is methanol. This can be in bottle form so you can de-ice a windscreen manually, or in the washer system of the car itself.Methanol is a type of alcohol and is incredibly toxic to humans. It is diluted with water before it goes into the washer system, but it should definitely stay on the outside of the car and never be ingested.Methanol freezes way below sub-zero temperatures, and, when mixed with water, creates a solution which lowers the freezing point of moisture already on the windscreen. Using only water to de-ice the windscreen is counterproductive as there will just be more moisture on the screen to freeze again.Some cars have a washer system that heats the fluid before squirting it out. The methanol stops the warm water from freezing again on the windscreen. However, pouring boiling water over the windscreen can shatter the glass in cold conditions.Some people use vinegar or rubbing alcohol as an alternative to methanol solution, as they both have lower freezing point than water and are effective glass cleaners.The de-icer will always be more effective if you give the driver a hand in scraping their windows and windscreen first!Image caption, This gritter is the real winter soldierGrit saves the day, you might complain about getting stuck behind the winter service vehicles, but the school run would be an even bigger nightmare without them.While it’s called grit, most gritters actually use halite, also known as rock salt. But halite doesn’t actually melt snow the way heat does.Grit lowers the freezing point of moisture on the road surface, preventing snow from sticking in the first place.The moisture on the road mixes with the salt and creates a saline solution preventing snow or ice from building up.Technically you could use table salt to clear your driveway, but you’d have to get the timing and conditions right before too much ice builds up. Salting your drive before it’s too icy can help prevent slips and falls, but throwing salt at a pile of snow won’t work so well.Table salt is not exactly the same as halite - it’s refined for eating, so is treated to remove any impurities. Rock salt is already mined whole and does not undergo this process.This article was published in December 2019 and updated in November 2025",

Washbourne was arrested in Bristol city centre at 13:30. Both were detained on suspicion of escaping lawful custody.Armstrong was also arrested on suspicion of robbery, after an incident in a village near Leyhill the night before he is accused of absconding.A man had forced his way into a home on 31 December at about 18:45 GMT and threatened the occupants before stealing a mobile phone and a quantity of cash, Avon and Somerset Police said.Following the incident, officers interviewed the victims and neighbours, which led to Armstrong being arrested in relation to the offence.A third man accused of absconding from HMP Leyhill at the same time was arrested in Bristol on 3 January. He will next appear at Bristol Crown Court in February.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaulin KolaReutersEmotions are still raw outside the barFamilies of the victims of a fire at a Swiss bar on New Year's Eve have expressed shock after officials admitted the venue had not undergone safety checks for five years.Romain Jordan, who represents some of the families, said the \"staggering number of breaches and shortcomings in the inspections raises the question of whether the municipality should be investigated with even greater urgency\".Other lawyers also urged officials to take responsibility for the disaster at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana in which 40 people died and 116 were injured. Prosecutors believe the fire started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached set light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling. The two bar managers have been placed under criminal investigation, but not in custody. French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.In their first statement since the fire, they said they were \"devastated\" and pledged \"full co-operation\" with the investigation.Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but the mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, said on Tuesday he could not explain why it hadn't been checked in so long. \"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues.ReutersRicardo Minghetti, whose funeral was held on Wednesday, was one of eight victims under the age of 16More on this storyMost of the victims of the fire were young - eight under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns and are being treated in Switzerland and other European countries.The funerals of some of those who died have been taking place.Watch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor saysUnder Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities.

The other 16, that included adults and children, were discharged at the scene. A Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service (RBFRS) spokesperson said it was initially called to a vehicle fire on the slip road and that it found the crash and the bus's engine on fire on arrival. Firefighters left at about 10:45. Reading-based Horseman Coaches confirmed that one of its vehicles was involved. \"Initial indications suggest that adverse road conditions, including ice, were a contributing factor,\" its general manager David Elliott said.\"A full investigation is under way and we are cooperating fully with the relevant authorities and all parties involved.\"The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and staff is our highest priority. We are supporting those affected and will ensure that any learning identified through the investigation is acted upon.\"A Reading Buses spokesperson added: \"We are supporting our driver after this incident and, of course, assisting the police with their investigation.\" Another two-car collision on the same slip road on Wednesday morning resulted in no injuries, SCAS added.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporter Sir Keir Starmer has pledged that MPs would get a vote on the deployment of British soldiers to police any agreement to end the conflict in Ukraine.The prime minister said the move would be consistent with \"recent practice\" on approving military action in Parliament.It comes after the UK and France reiterated their commitment to deploy troops to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again if a deal to end the conflict is struck.Sir Keir has not specified how many British troops could be committed, telling MPs it would be \"in accordance with our military plans\".During Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir told MPs that in the event of a peace agreement, British personnel would conduct \"deterrence operations\" and protect  new military \"hubs\" allies are planning in Ukraine.The prime minister did not specify whether a vote would take place before troops are sent, but his press secretary later told reporters that Parliament would have a say ahead of any \"long-term deployment\" of UK forces.However, the press secretary would not comment on whether the Commons vote would tie the government's hands should MPs reject the government's proposals.Parliament does not have a legal role in approving military action, which is formally authorised by the prime minister on behalf of the monarch.In recent decades a convention has developed that MPs should have the chance to debate deployments, although the principle has been applied inconsistently.In 2013, MPs voted against possible UK military action against Syria to deter the use of chemical weapons, with David Cameron becoming the first British leader to lose a vote on military action since the late 18th Century.They were also given a say on action against the Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq in 2014, and in Syria the following year.However, Theresa May took action in Syria in 2018 without consulting MPs, whilst more recently Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir have authorised RAF air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen without doing so. On Tuesday, the UK and France signed a \"declaration of intent\" on deploying troops in Ukraine in the air, on land and at sea after a summit in Paris.The statement added that Ukraine would authorise the UK, France and other allies to use \"necessary means, including the use of force\" within its territory.Allies also largely agreed security guarantees for Ukraine and proposed that the US would take the lead in monitoring a truce. It comes after nine months of planning talks by a group of countries, dubbed the Coalition of the Willing, over security guarantees to be offered to Ukraine in the event of a deal, alongside separate talks over ending the war itself.Sir Keir said a deal to end the war \"will not happen\" without such guarantees in place, \"backed by the United States\". Moscow has repeatedly warned that any foreign troops in Ukraine would be a \"legitimate target\".Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAmy WoodwardLocal Democracy Reporting ServiceBeach hut owners say they are looking into the legal basis of plans to reclassify their huts as second homes for the purposes of council tax.More than 300 owners will have to pay full council tax from April on huts at Mudeford Spit in Dorset, if plans by Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council (BCP) are agreed.Mudeford Sandbanks Beach Hut Association (MSBHA) said the second home rule was being applied to \"a wooden shed with no mains connections or individual toilet facilities\".BCP finance councillor Mike Cox said the council was \"looking at every nook and cranny\" as it attempted to tackle a £9m budget shortfall.The 344 huts on the sandbank near Christchurch can only be used overnight for part of the year but can sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds.The 2026/27 council tax is expected to be set in February but, based on the 2025/26 charge for band A properties, bills for the huts would increase from £618 to £1,236 a year.MSBHA chair Darren Pridwell said owners had already seen their annual fees \"almost treble to over £5,200\" as the council sought to harmonise charges along the coast.He said: \"Mudeford hut owners may have a degree of sympathy for these increased costs if the level of services were at an acceptable level, but there has been next to no investment in facilities in the recent past and these are now desperately needed. \"It feels like this is all take and no give.\"BCP hopes the change will raise about £211,000.Cox said: \"It is a small amount, but we have to pull every lever we've got and this is just one of them.\"The proposal will be discussed by cabinet on 14 January.",

    "body": "UK viewers warm up for steamy ice hockey hit Heated Rivalry38 minutes agoIan YoungsCulture reporterSabrina Lantos/HBO MaxConnor Storrie and Hudson Williams in one of the show's many steamy scenesTV's latest word-of-mouth hit Heated Rivalry arrives in the UK this weekend, after setting pulses racing across the Atlantic and catapulting its cast to stardom in recent weeks.Based on Rachel Reid's books, the series centres on the illicit relationship between two ice hockey players - one Canadian and the other Russian - who are rivals on the ice but lovers off it.The show has grabbed attention for its sex scenes, but has won praise for its heartfelt depiction of LGBT relationships, and sparked discussions about representation on TV and in sport.It was made by Canadian streaming service Crave and was swiftly picked up by HBO Max in the US, where it was released in late November.Who's in the cast?Getty ImagesConnor Storrie and Hudson Williams will present a Golden Globe trophy together this weekendCanadian actor Hudson Williams plays Shane Hollander, while Connor Storrie, from Texas, plays Ilya Rozanov.They are the first major roles for both actors, and the show has swiftly made them among the hottest properties in the industry.They have been signed by one of Hollywood's biggest talent agencies, CAA, have been booked to appear on US TV chat shows, and will present an award together at this weekend's Golden Globes.The cast also includes François Arnaud, known for The Borgias and Midnight, Texas; and Christina Chang from shows like Nashville and CSI: Miami.What's the reaction been so far?Sabrina Lantos/HBO MaxHeated Rivalry became \"a word-of-mouth sensation\" (according to Rolling Stone), \"the year's biggest TV surprise\" (Variety) and \"the unexpected TV conversation of the moment\" (Newsweek).It is \"hard to fathom just how quickly Heated Rivalry took the world by storm\", Radio Times said last month.The sex is \"almost constant\" and it's \"no exaggeration to say that far more of the show takes place between the sheets than on the ice\", David Opie wrote.But he added: \"As naughty as the show can be, it's also rather moving at points... Heated Rivalry is as authentic in its feelings as it is in its approach to gay sex, something which mainstream productions rarely nail.\"That view was echoed elsewhere. The show \"resonates because it embodies our lives\", Jim Downs wrote in the New York Times.\"If you want to understand why this show has become our community's equivalent of a cultural earthquake, the answer is that watching a gay couple be mildly boring and in love is still radical,\" he said.Commentators have noted that both the show and the books have attracted a large female audience (the \"wine moms\", as writer-director Jacob Tierney has dubbed them).\"But so much attention to female fandom... risks overshadowing what a bountiful gift Heated Rivalry is to the gays,\" wrote David Rooney in the Hollywood Reporter. \"That becomes increasingly apparent as each successive episode taps into richer veins of queer experience concerning the fight between desire and self-denial.\"He added: \"The combination of sex-positivity and swoony romantic wish-fulfillment makes Heated Rivalry hugely satisfying, taking it far beyond the notion of 'Canadian gay hockey smut,' as it's been reductively called.\"Sabrina Lantos/HBO MaxConnor Storrie's character Ilya Rozanov plays for the fictional Boston RaidersNot everyone agreed that it was telling LGBT stories in a new way.Its \"understanding of gay life is frozen in the past\", said Slate.\"I actually love the series, as do so many viewers, for its heat, its pacing, and its emotional pull,\" wrote Jim Downs.\"But enjoyment does not preclude critique. And what the show reveals is that gay storytelling today is limited not so much by social acceptance as by the narrow stories it keeps repeating.\"Meanwhile, Bloomeberg said the show was reigniting a \"troubling debate\" about \"what counts as 'authentic' storytelling\" - noting speculation about the lead actors' real-life sexualities (they haven't commented) and that the books were written by a woman, although showrunner Tierney is a gay man.Asked about the issue, Reid has said: \"Queer joy is important to me, combating homophobia in hockey is important to me, the theme of being brave enough to live how you want and love who you want is important to me. I am not a gay or bisexual man, but I try to write thoughtfully and sensitively about these fictional characters.\"As for the homophobia point, some have suggested the show could trigger a change in attitudes in the sport, with the Athletic pointing out there have never been any openly gay players in the NHL and asking whether Heated Rivalry could \"change hockey culture\".What are the original books?Getty ImagesRachel Reid published her first instalment of her six-book Game Changers series in 2018The show is based on the Game Changers series of novels by Reid, who's a Canadian author.It's specifically adapted from the second book in the series, titled Heated Rivalry, published in 2019, about ice hockey stars Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov.There are six books in total, published between 2018 and 2022. In 2023, Tierney approached her about turning the books into a TV show.\"What stood out to me in retrospect is that [Heated Rivalry] accomplishes a different task than these books usually do,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"This is not about somebody coming out, it's about two people figuring out they are allowed to be in love. And that zig where the other books zag really stuck with me.\"Reid said she was most proud of helping to bring \"a sweet, sexy, romantic, and, most importantly, happy queer love story to television\".It is, she said, \"a story where the sexual tension and romance isn't subtext, or a tease, or something that ends in tragedy\", adding: \"I want a million more shows like this one.\"When is Heated Rivalry released and where can you watch?The series  will be available in the UK on Sky from Saturday, 10 January, starting with a double bill on Sky Atlantic from 21:00 GMT.All six episodes will be available on streaming service Now from the same date.",

    "body": "I would have been selfish not to share twins' muscle disease diagnosis, Jesy Nelson says3 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterKen McKay/ITV/ShutterstockSinger Jesy Nelson has pledged to \"shout from the rooftops\" to campaign for all babies to get tested for a rare muscle disease at birth.The former Little Mix star recently discovered her seven-month-old daughters have Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and will \"probably never walk\", but the condition isn't included in screening for newborn babies.\"That's what's frustrating,\" she told ITV's This Morning on Wednesday. \"If this was the card I was always going to get dealt and there was nothing I could do about it, then it's almost easier for me to accept.\"But when you know that there is something that can be done about it, and it is life changing to your child, that's the part that I cannot accept.\"The singer became emotional as she told presenters Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard her life had \"completely changed\" since the diagnosis.Nelson, 34, has called for SMA to be part of an NHS blood test that is normally carried out at five days old, and currently tests for 10 other conditions.Speaking days after she posted a video on social media announcing her twins' condition, Nelson said: \"I have this platform, and I almost feel like I've got a duty of care to raise awareness about it.\"And a little part of me feels, and I don't know if this is even crazy to say this, I feel selfish to keep this to myself and not potentially save a child's life.\"Nelson added she has had to rapidly learn how to look after her daughters Ocean Jade and Story Monroe Nelson-Foster.\"It's just so much to deal with whilst you're also trying to deal with this horrendous thing that's just happened.\"The singer said doing that while also simply trying to be their mum was \"the part that I'm still struggling with\", and was comforted by Deeley as she became emotional. \"I won't lie. The part that really gets me, is I just want to be their mum, I don't want to be a nurse.\"So it's hard, but, yeah, I just want to reiterate that if this is caught [diagnosed] from birth, it's just life changing.\"'They are still smiling'She added that it \"makes me so sad\" to watch back videos of her girls and now be able to spot the signs that their legs were gradually moving less during their first weeks.\"That's how quick it is. And that is why it is so important and vital to get treatment from birth, and it is detected from birth,\" she said.The girls have now had treatment in the form of a one-off infusion, she explained.\"It essentially puts the gene back in their body that they don't have. It stops any of the muscles that are still working from dying.\"But any that have gone, you can't regain them. That's why if you catch it early [it's better]. Now it will just be down to a case of constant physio.\"She continued: \"We've been told that they will probably never walk. They'll probably never regain their neck strength. They are going to be in wheelchairs.\"But there have been so many stories where parents have been told this, and their children have gone on to do incredible things. So I believe that you've just got to manifest this into existence.\"They are still smiling. They're still happy. They have each other, and that's the main thing that I'm like so grateful for, because they could be doing this by themselves, but they're twins and they're going through this together, and I think it's beautiful.\"So all I can do is just try my best to be there for them, give them positive energy, keep doing physio.\"On Tuesday, Health Secretary Wes Streeting told ITV News that Nelson was \"right to challenge and criticise how long it takes to get a diagnosis\".He said he was \"determined to look not just at screening for SMA, but to make much better use of genomic medicine\".In 2021, a life-changing gene therapy drug called Zolgensma was approved by the NHS to treat babies with the disease.According to the charity SMA UK, the drug delivers a healthy copy of the affected gene to the body, but timing is critical because irreversible damage may have already occurred in the nervous system.Scotland will start routinely screening babies for SMA from the spring, and the National Screening Committee is currently reviewing whether to introduce it across the UK.Nelson added her voice to a campiagn by SMA UK to introduce routine screening to the NHS newborn blood spot test, which currently looks for conditions including cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease and a range of inherited metabolic diseases, but not SMA.An NHS spokesperson said three new treatments for SMA had been rolled out since 2019, helping hundreds of children.\"The UK National Screening Committee is looking at whether the NHS should introduce routine screening to identify the condition in early life via a heel prick blood test – and the NHS is supporting further evaluation to inform the Committee's decision.\"The Generation Study is also evaluating whether genomic sequencing could be adopted more widely as part of standard newborn screening in the NHS, including testing for SMA.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterActress Jessie Buckley has said she was \"brutalised\" on the 2008 TV talent show that catapulted her to fame.The 36-year-old was the runner-up on the BBC's I'd Do Anything, about the search for an actress to play Nancy in a West End production of Oliver!In an interview with Vogue, Buckley said she experienced \"unfair objectification\" at a time when she was still growing and \"trying to move into a space for myself\".The Irish actress has since become a Hollywood star and is tipped to win a string of best actress prizes in the current film awards season for her performance in Hamnet.Reflecting on her time on I'd Do Anything, Buckley said: \"I look back at it and I feel like, 'God, you're so brave.' I don't know if I'd have that courage now. And I don't know if that was kind of innocence or ignorance.\"She added that she was \"not fully well\" and \"depressed\" at the time she took part.Buckley said she experienced her treatment on the show as \"a lot of body shaming and bringing me to femininity school\".\"And I was growing into my body,\" she continued. \"I was 17. I was in a moment of discovery. As women, it's such unfair objectification.\"Vogue noted that some judges and other stars on the show commented on her appearance, with one choreographer encouraging her to be \"more ladylike\" and learn how to dance in six-inch heels.\"Back then, I was just trying to move into a space of myself,\" Buckley said. \"I really hope that a 15, 17, whatever-age woman never has to be brutalised quite like what happened on that show. \"But I didn't recognise it fully at the time. I just felt it, which was difficult.\"In response, the BBC pointed to its policies to ensure a duty of care for all who work with the corporation, which it said had been strengthened over decades.Anybody putting complaints or concerns to the corporation are treated with the utmost care and seriousness, the BBC added.Buckley also revealed that, after appearing on the talent series, she turned down an offer to be the understudy for winner Jodie Prenger. Instead, Buckley pursued her own trajectory in London's theatre landscape, taking a job in Stephen Sondheim's A Little Night Music at the Menier Chocolate Factory theatre.But she struggled in the early part of her career, telling Vogue: \"I was just lost. When you're told, culturally, in different ways, that you have to kind of mould yourself into a shape that doesn't naturally fit you, in some ways you incubate that messaging and then it becomes self-destructive.\"Once I realised that, my life goal has been to unravel myself from the sort of miseducation, from stories that don't actually serve me, and just find life.\"Buckley is now widely predicted to win best actress for Hamnet at events such as the Golden Globes, Baftas and Oscars in the coming weeks. She stars opposite Paul Mescal in the film, which is directed by Chloé Zhao and adapted from the novel by Maggie O'Farrell. It follows the death of the 11-year-old son of William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes (also known as Anne Hathaway), which some believe led the Bard to write his play Hamlet.",

    "body": "30 minutes agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlineFederico PARRA / AFP via Getty ImagesDelcy Rodríguez decreed that the head of the presidential honour guard be replacedThe general in command of Venezuela's presidential honour guard, Javier Marcano Tábata, has been sacked days after Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro was seized by US forces in a raid in Caracas and taken to New York to stand trial on narco-terrorism charges. The presidential honour guard is the military force which provides the bodyguards tasked with protecting the head of state.While the Venezuelan government has not yet provided a detailed breakdown of casualties, members of the guard are thought to be among the dozens of people killed in the US operation to seize Maduro. The order to replace Gen Marcano Tábata was issued by the new interim president, Delcy Rodríguez. Rodríguez was sworn in by the National Assembly, which is dominated by government loyalists, on Monday. She served as Maduro's vice-president and is considered to be a close ally of the jailed leader. US President Donald Trump said in the news conference following Maduro's seizure that the United States would \"run\" Venezuela and that the US was talking to Rodríguez.He also threatened that Rodríguez would face a \"fate worse than Maduro's\" if she did not comply with US demands, including those for oil, of which Venezuela has the world's largest proven reserves. On Tuesday, the US president said that Venezuela would be \"turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil to the US, but Venezuela's interim government has yet to comment on that statement.Rodríguez's tone has been alternating between defiant and conciliatory since she was designated interim president by Venezuela's Supreme Court. She denounced the seizure of Maduro as an \"illegal kidnapping\" but has also said that her government had \"invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation\".Her actions are being watched closely both inside and outside of Venezuela to gauge what course she may steer now that she is in charge of the country and for signs of any potential rifts in her government.The sacking of Gen Marcano Tábata is one of the first changes to senior officials in her inner circle.As well as being in charge of the presidential guard, Gen Marcano Tábata also led Venezuela's military counterintelligence unit DGCIM. The DGCIM has played a key role in the repression of people critical of the Maduro government, according to the United Nations. A UN Independent Fact-Finding Mission found that the counterintelligence unit had committed myriad human rights violations since 2013. It documented scores of cases in which those detained were subjected to \"torture, sexual violence and/or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment\" in the DGCIM headquarters and a network of covert detention centres across the countryHowever, his sacking does not appear to be related to the repression carried out by the DGCIM under his helm as the man she has appointed to succeed him headed an intelligence service which faces similar accusations.Gustavo González López was in charge of Venezuela's national intelligence service, Sebin for many years.The Sebin controls the notorious Helicoide prison in Caracas, where the UN documented abuses being carried out against \"opposition politicians, journalists, protesters, and human rights defenders\".Venezuelan analysts think that Gen Marcano Tábata's dismissal is more likely to be related to the failure of the presidential honour guard to prevent the seizure of Maduro.Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela which has long provided security and intelligence services to Maduro, said that 32 of its nationals had been killed in the US raid.Many of them are thought to have been embedded in the presidential honour guard.Watch: What's at the heart of Cuba and Venezuela's relationship?Venezuela's military has said that 23 of its members, including five generals, were killed in the US strikes.Some supporters of the government have said they felt \"humiliated\" by the way the US forces overpowered Venezuela's defence systems and Maduro's personal guard to seize the Venezuelan leader, who was later paraded before the cameras with his hands tied and in prison garb.Replacing Marcano Tábata could be an attempt by the interim president to surround herself with people she trusts at a time when the threat of another US strike hangs over her.  President Trump said on Saturday that US forces had prepared a second wave of strikes but deemed it not necessary at the time.However, he has repeatedly said that non-compliance would mean Rodríguez would \"pay a very big price\".She is not the only one in the interim government who could be targeted in a second strike.Reuters news agency reports quoting unnamed sources said to be familiar with the matter that Venezuela's hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, had been told by the Trump administration to fall into line.The US has long accused Cabello of participating in a \"narco-conspiracy\", allegedly helping left-wing rebels ship cocaine to the US.In January, the US state department increased its reward for information leading to his capture to $25m (£21m).",

    "body": "1 hour agoChloe Aslett & Victoria ScheerYorkshireSuppliedPolice initially told Trevor Wynn's family he had died in a car crash before confirming he was being treated in hospitalA police force has admitted mixing up the identities of an 18-year-old killed in a car crash with another teenager who survived the collision.South Yorkshire Police believed Trevor \"TJ\" Wynn, 17, had died in the crash near Rotherham on 13 December and told his family.But on Sunday it emerged he had survived and it was Joshua Johnson who had been killed alongside a 17-year-old girl, who was driving the vehicle.Assistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) since identifying the error, adding that he was aware of \"the additional trauma this may cause\".Police were called to Todwick Road between Dinnington and Todwick in the early hours of 13 December after a silver Toyota Corolla crashed off the road.At the time the force said a 17-year-old girl, who was driving, and a 17-year-old boy had been pronounced dead at the scene, while an 18-year-old male had been taken to hospital with serious injuries.Trevor's family were subsequently told he had died while it was believed that Johnson was the male in hospital receiving treatment.The 17-year-old girl has not been formally named by police, but she was identified as Summer Louise Scott at the opening of an inquest at Doncaster Coroner's Court.In a statement issued on Tuesday, South Yorkshire Police said \"concerns\" had been raised about the identities of those killed.A spokesperson said \"information came to light\" on Sunday which prompted \"further formal identification processes, including forensics, to be undertaken\" and resulted in the mistake being identified.The incident occurred on the road between Dinnington and TodwickMcFarlane said he had since offered to meet with both sets of parents to discuss the matter.He said: \"This has obviously come as a huge shock to everyone and we recognise the additional trauma this may cause. \"We are supporting Trevor and all the families through this and have engaged specialist agencies to help provide that support. \"I have also offered to meet with both sets of parents as I am sure they will have many questions, most of which we are not able to answer yet but we are absolutely committed to understanding how this happened so it cannot happen again.\"He said South Yorkshire Police would fully cooperate with any subsequent investigation by the police watchdog.The IOPC said it was assessing the referral to determine whether an investigation was required.An 18-year-old who was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and a 19-year-old arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in connection with the crash both remain on bail pending further inquiries.South Yorkshire PoliceAssistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the IOPCTrevor was not named publicly by police at the time of the crash, but was widely identified on social media and in local news outlets as having died in the collision.A fundraiser set up in his name by family friend Jonathan Stoner last month has raised more than £1,000.In an update on Tuesday, Stoner said following the news that Trevor was alive, the money raised would go \"directly toward helping TJ move forward in life and supporting his family through this recovery process\".\"The police initially made a mistake and identified the wrong person, and we were informed incorrectly at the time,\" the update read. \"This has since been clarified, and we want to be completely transparent with everyone who has supported us.\"Stoner said the focus would now be on helping the teenager, who had been through \"a serious, life-changing situation\", recover.\"We understand this news may come as a shock, and we appreciate everyone's patience, kindness, and continued support,\" the update said. \"Every single share, donation, and message has come from a place of love - and that love is still needed now more than ever.\"PA MediaSouth Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard says his \"heart goes out\" to all of those affected by the errorSouth Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard said he welcomed the force's decision to refer the matter to the IOPC.\"My heart goes out to Trevor Wynn, his family and the families of Joshua Johnson and the young woman so tragically killed in the road traffic collision late last year,\" he said.\"I don't know that any of us can imagine what their families and friends have been going through over these past few weeks.\"As the police have rightfully acknowledged, an incident of this nature demands a full investigation and changes to any processes that have allowed families to be put in this position.\"Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, said she was \"deeply troubled that an error of this magnitude has occurred\". \"My heart goes out to the families involved; I will be holding the police to account to make sure this cannot happen again, the pain they have caused is unimaginable,\" she said.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 days agoPA MediaMany parts of the UK have experienced cold and snowy weather this winter.  Like people, pets can need extra help to stay warm and safe during very cold conditions. How do I keep my pet warm indoors?Like humans, animals can be at risk of hypothermia if they become too cold.The RSPCA says pets can shiver when they are exposed to low temperatures for too long. This is more noticeable in smaller and short-haired breeds.The PDSA veterinary charity advises giving dogs and cats extra blankets for their beds over the winter months and adding a few more spaces where they can curl up around the home.Raising their beds off the ground can keep older dogs away from draughts, while cats may like playing or resting in high-up dens or on climbing posts. Experts recommend extra playtime to make sure pets keep active if they are spending less time outside. Indoor toys can help.Your pet may want to eat more to help keep their body temperature up. At the same time, they may also want to drink less, but make sure they have constant access to fresh drinking water to avoid the risk of dehydration.RSPCA: Keeping pets safe in cold weatherPDSA: Pet care advice for winterShould I still walk my dog during cold weather?PA MediaDogs still need walks during cold weather. Usually, their fur will keep them warm. But some dogs - particularly those with shorter fur - may need extra help staying warm while outside.\"For most dogs, their own lovely fur coat is insulation enough, but those with thin fur, or who are unwell, very old or young, may benefit from a good winter coat,\" according to PDSA's Gemma Renwick. \"Look for something well-fitting, waterproof but with a comfy lining.\"Walk your dog during the day if you can, or if you have to go out in the dark, consider using LED collars or hi-vis leads to ensure they can be seen. Be cautious when letting dogs off the lead in the snow, and supervise them closely as hazards may be hidden. Similarly, keep pets away from frozen water as the ice on ponds and lakes can be thin and may not support their weight. As the temperatures drop, plan for shorter, more frequent walks rather than one long-distance daily hike and if your dog gets wet, make sure you dry them off with a towel as soon as you get home.Any build-up of salt, grit, dirt or snow can be painful, so owners should check and rinse their pet's paws.What about rabbits and guinea pigs during cold weather?Smaller pets such as rabbits, guinea pigs and ferrets can also feel the cold.The PDSA says a sudden drop in temperatures can be a shock to the system for the animals, and recommends moving them inside if they live in outdoor hutches.A shed or car-free garage can offer a good amount of protection from draughts, rain or snow. If you have to bring your animals inside, try and put them in a room which you can keep a bit cooler than the rest of your home. Turn down the radiators if you can. If there is no inside option, the charity advises placing a thick blanket or piece of carpet over their outside living quarters to help keep them warm. Should I keep my cat inside?Angela/BBC Weather WatchersMany cats spend a lot of their time exploring the outdoors. During the day, experts say cats who are used to going outside should continue to do so.But the PDSA advises making sure can easily get back inside through a cat flap whenever they want, or have a warm outside shelter where they can go.Ideally cats should stay inside overnight during periods of very cold weather.The charity also recommends providing litter trays inside, even if your cat usually goes outside so they have a warm toileting option. How should I care for chickens in the winter months?Chickens and hens are incredibly resilient and should typically cope well with a bit of cold weather, the British Hen Welfare Trust says. However, during extreme conditions, the charity recommends:making sure your birds have a robust shelter, and that any hen houses are insulatedfor larger hen houses, putting a cardboard box on its side for your hens to sleep inchecking their water supply regularly to ensure it hasn't frozen checking boundaries regularly to ensure they are safe from predators. Fence posts may become loose in wet weather, giving foxes or badgers easy access to the animals",

    "body": "3 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterThe boss of cinema chain Everyman has stepped down less than three weeks after the company warned trading had been weaker than expected.Everyman Media Group said on Monday that Alex Scrimgeour was leaving with immediate effect and would be replaced on an interim basis by non-executive director Farah Golant.His sudden departure comes after the firm issued a trading update on 10 December where it cut its forecasts for revenue and earnings, sending its shares down 20%.The cinema chain runs 49 venues across the UK and is known for its luxury seating and food menus.Mr Scrimgeour became chief executive of Everyman Media Group in January 2021 after heading French restaurant chain Cote Brasserie since 2015.In its trading update earlier this month, the firm said trading at the end of the year had been \"weaker than anticipated\". As a result, it expected revenues of £114.5m for 2025 and underlying earnings of at least £16.8m, down from previous forecasts of £121.5m and £19.9m respectively.Chairman Philip Jacobson said Mr Scrimgeour had \"played a pivotal role in the team that successfully led the business through its recovery from Covid, more than doubling revenue\".Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said the outgoing boss had to \"deal with a succession of crises from day one\" including the cost-of-living, as well as the the pandemic.However, he added: \"The share price fell by 76% during his tenure and time had run out.\"While the cinema industry did manage to regain some of its sparkle post-pandemic, Everyman lost its edge in the market.\"Mr Coatsworth said the upmarket chain had once offered \"a unique proposition\", but had since been copied by rivals, including Vue and Odeon, which have installed reclining seats and \"also rolled out bars inside their cinemas\".He added that it would be interesting to see if Blue Coast Private Equity, which owns a 29% stake in Everyman, would buy the chain, \"opting to remove it from the public spotlight to enact a turnaround programme\".",

    "body": "A rising number of end-of-life patients in hospitals could affect the level of treatment carried out this winter, a group of regional NHS leaders have been told. A consultant in palliative care highlighted the impending \"crisis\" during an online internal meeting of health leaders in Sussex, a recording of which has been heard by the BBC.The consultant at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust described dilemmas facing hospital managers when some patients are having to be given end-of-life care in A&E corridors.The bleak assessment is likely to be echoed in other NHS regions as building winter pressures increase the challenge of trying to find hospital beds for sick patients needing care.University Hospitals Sussex Trust includes Worthing Hospital, Royal Sussex County Hospital, St Richard's Hospital in Chichester and Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath.  Doctors and officials from East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which includes Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital, also took part in the meeting along with community health representatives. The consultant made a slide presentation entitled \"Palliative and End of Life Care in Sussex\" at the meeting, which took place on 4 November.She told the audience that local hospices were struggling and it was difficult to find places for patients who need end-of-life care, while it was sometimes not clear how much support there might be in the local community when people are sent home.She said: \"I am really worried that patients who have treatable conditions are not going to be able to get into hospital and be treated because there are so many end-of-life patients in hospital beds.\"She went on to say \"we are no longer putting patients on the waiting list for transfer who are just straightforward dying\", focusing only on those with complex needs.On giving enhanced palliative care in A&E, the consultant said it was a \"really difficult choice - do you admit them for corridor care or do you turn them round, put them in the back of the ambulance where they may die on the way home\".She argued there were \"lots of patients in hospital who don't need to be there, lots of patients with complex needs who don't have their needs met\".She concluded: \"We've all known this crisis is coming - it is getting worse and worse\".A spokesperson for the NHS in Sussex said it was committed to ensuring that patients have access to the \"best possible, high-quality palliative and end-of-life care\". They said: \"This includes providing a range of places for compassionate, person-centred care - and importantly, where possible, in settings out of hospital, such as community settings, and our hospices.  \"Emergency care services across Sussex remain under significant pressure but staff continue to work incredibly hard to make sure patients can receive the care they need at our hospitals, and across all our health and care services.\"There is robust partnership work in place over the winter period to support individual care plans, and to ensure that people are in the right NHS service for their needs.\"But the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said delayed discharges were a huge challenge across the NHS, and a lack of social or community care could mean some patients needing end-of-life care and support could not leave hospitals.  Its president, Dr Ian Higginson, said the college was \"worried about the number of patients who need end-of-life care who end up in emergency departments, and then hospitals, because the dedicated services they need are not available\". He said: \"Patients who would prefer to be at home may end up in our corridors, which are not the right places for anyone, let alone those who are at the end of their lives.\"One NHS clinician, who wished to remain anonymous, contacted the BBC, saying problems had built up for some time: \"End-of-life care delivered in emergency departments, corridors, ambulances, or via unsupported discharges home has become increasingly routine across multiple regions. What is particularly striking is the recurring pattern: hospital beds occupied by dying patients who should never be there and limited or delayed access to hospice or community care.\"The NHS Confederation, which represents NHS leaders, said hospitals can be the \"default option\" when community and social care provision is under pressure or unavailable.\"The solution is not about asking hospitals alone to absorb more pressure - it is about investing across the whole system,\" said Rory Deighton, director of the Confederation's acute network.Meanwhile, community services are also stretched and hospices are warning of a funding crisis.Toby Porter, chief executive of Hospice UK said: \"While hospital can be the right place for some, a busy ward just isn't the right place for most people who die.\"Hospices across the country want to provide more care in the community but this year we've seen it cut back because of funding pressures. And that is having a knock-on effect in hospitals.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoYvette TanGetty ImagesThe Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian sideThailand's army has accused Cambodia of breaching a newly signed ceasefire deal reached after weeks of deadly clashes that forced nearly one million people from their homes. In a statement, the Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian side on Sunday night.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Both sides agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible.It had been seen as a breakthrough, which came after days of talks between both countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US. In a statement on Monday, the Royal Thai Army said Cambodia's actions \"constitute provocation and a violation of measures aimed at reducing tensions\", adding that they were \"inconsistent\" with the terms of the ceasefire.It also said it \"may need to reconsider\" the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers held in Thailand since July. Thailand would be \"obliged to act in accordance... [if] violations of agreements and national sovereignty continue\", it added.Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn described the incident as \"a small issue related to flying drones seen by both sides along the border line,\" according to AFP news agency. It comes just hours after China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi praised the \"hard-won\" ceasefire, and US President Donald Trump praised the \"rapid and fair conclusion\".The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is not new, dating back more than a century.The latest tensions ramped up earlier this year, after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May. This plunged relations between the countries to their lowest point in more than a decade.There were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.A fragile ceasefire deal was agreed in July and signed in October. It then collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.",

    "body": "9 hours agoTom OakleyEast MidlandsSuppliedJamie Hargreaves had said he wanted to follow in his dad's footsteps by cycling across the worldA cyclist who set out to recreate his father's epic round-the-world bike journey made it home just days before Christmas.Jamie Hargreaves completed his challenge of riding from Derby in England to Australia, retracing the route his dad, Phil, completed at the same age in 1984.The 23-year-old took about seven months to complete the 25,000km (15,534 miles) journey that started in May and ended on 13 December.Mr Hargreaves, from Poynton in Cheshire, followed his father's path as closely as possible, while adapting where modern geopolitics made it necessary.He had been documenting his journey on social media, recreating the photos his 63-year-old father Phil once took.He was also able to reconnect with some of the same people along the way.Jamie HargreavesJamie (left) followed his dad's journey (right) as closely as possibly. Here they cycle along the coast in Kalkan, Turkey\"I'm doing alright - I thought I'd be knackered from the jetlag but it's not been too bad,\" Mr Hargreaves told BBC Breakfast.\"My legs are holding up, and I've had a bit of time to rest now.\"After setting off from Derby, where his parents grew up, Mr Hargreaves said the route had been the same as the one his dad took in 1984, but from Turkey onward, the journey began to diverge.While his dad travelled through Iran in 1984, Mr Hargreaves was unable to do so and instead headed north through Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, before re-joining his father's original route in Pakistan.From there, Mr Hargreaves followed the original route through to Nepal, where he reached Everest Base Camp - and went one better than his dad.\"I had to beat my old man,\" he said. \"So I did Annapurna Base Camp too.\"After Nepal, Mr Hargreaves flew to Bangkok, before getting back on the bike to ride through south-east Asia, taking in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, before eventually finishing the journey in Australia.Jamie HargreavesJamie and his dad both visited Mount Everest in Nepal during their tripsMr Hargreaves' initial plan was to end the challenge in Derby, Australia, but when he realised that would be in the \"middle of nowhere\", he decided to end the trip in Derby Street in Sydney.Throughout the trip, Mr Hargreaves rode the same model and year of bike his father used.He said covering thousands of kilometres was helped by years of outdoor adventure, as well as the hospitality of people along the way.\"I'm used to roughing it from going away with the lads climbing,\" he said. \"We live dirt bag style in the woods, so sleeping in bus stations or wherever isn't new to me.\"After that, I was being invited into people's homes, given meals or water. That was really special.\"Jamie HargreavesJamie noted changes to the landscapes of countries he cycled through since his dad made the same journey - like here in Dikili in TurkeyFor Phil, watching his son complete the journey brought back memories of a very different era of travel.He said: \"I was already into cycling and had been around Europe, but after finishing my apprenticeship I wanted to do something else.\"There was no sat-nav - everything was done on paper maps, a compass, and asking for directions.\"We took photos on film - I used 60 rolls in two years. I spoke to my parents three times in three years. \"Jamie and I were speaking every week. It's just so different now.\"Mr Hargreaves said he had already planned his next challenge with his friend, to ride a tandem bike with wheelie bins attached, from Land's End in Cornwall to John O'Groats in Scotland. He said they would be litter picking as they go.More on this story",

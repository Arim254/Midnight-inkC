    "body": "Celtic replace 'divisive' Rodgers with former boss O'NeillImage source, SNSImage caption, Brendan Rodgers' last match as Celtic manager was a 3-1 loss to Hearts on SundayByColin Moffat & Richard WintonBBC Sport ScotlandBrendan Rodgers has resigned as Celtic manager - amid accusations from major shareholder Dermot Desmond of \"divisive, misleading, and self-serving\" behaviour - and will be replaced in the interim by former boss Martin O'Neill.The Scottish Premiership champions slipped eight points behind early pacesetters Hearts after losing meekly at Tynecastle on Sunday, having endured a hugely underwhelming European campaign and angst-ridden transfer window.Yet for all that discontent has been in the air around Celtic Park, the news that emerged in a club statement at 21:44 GMT was stunning.The 134-word missive announced that Rodgers had quit, thanked him for his contribution across his two spells as manager, and said the process to appoint a replacement was underway. In a remarkable twist, it also noted that O'Neill - 73 years old and 20 years after his first stint ended - would take interim charge, assisted by former Celtic player Shaun Maloney, who was sacked as Wigan Athletic manager in March.While Celtic fans were digesting that, the club published another similar staggering statement 15 minutes later - this time signed by the usually reticent Desmond.In an astonishing letter to fans, he challenged Rodgers' assertion that he was formally offered a contract extension, denied that signings were imposed upon the manager, and criticised his \"desire for self-preservation at the expense of others\".'Rodgers had final say over all football matters' - what Desmond saidRodgers, 52, began a second spell at Celtic Park in 2023, winning successive titles  to go with his league triumphs from 2017 and 2018.The former Liverpool and Leicester City boss departs with the champions trailing Hearts by eight points after nine Scottish Premiership games.The Northern Irishman agreed a three-year deal on his return and repeatedly stressed that he would honour the contract since his departure in February 2019 for Leicester had caused so much rancour.When quizzed about extending that agreement in August, Rodgers insisted there had been no formal offer.But Desmond has now given his side of events, saying the club were keen to keep him beyond the end of this campaign to \"reaffirm the club's full backing and long-term commitment to him\".The Irish businessman went on to say that Rodgers' assertion that no offer had been made was \"simply untrue\".Media caption, Watch highlights of Rodgers final game as Celtic managerThis season has played out against a backdrop of anti-board protests at Celtic Park and Desmond went on to suggest Rodgers had contributed to a \"toxic atmosphere\".Another feature in the opening months of this term was Rodgers' apparent dismay over transfer business, with several references to underwhelming recruitment.Speaking after the 2-0 loss at Dundee on 19 October, the manager said: \"There's no way you'll go into a race and be given the keys to a Honda Civic and say 'I want you to drive it like a Ferrari'. It's not going to happen.\"But Desmond has responded by saying: \"Every player signed and every player sold during his tenure was done so with Brendan's full knowledge, approval, and endorsement. Any insinuation otherwise is absolutely false.\"His later public statements about transfers and club operations came entirely out of the blue. At no point prior to those remarks had he raised any such concerns.\"In reality, he was given final say over all football matters and was consistently backed in the recruitment process, including record investment in players he personally identified and approved.\"Regrettably, his words and actions since then have been divisive, misleading, and self-serving. They have contributed to a toxic atmosphere around the club and fuelled hostility towards members of the executive team and the board.\"What has failed recently was not due to our structure or model, but to one individual's desire for self-preservation at the expense of others.\"O'Neill returns... on day he tips Hearts for titleImage source, SNSO'Neill managed Celtic from 2000-05, winning three Scottish Premier League titles, three Scottish Cups, and a League Cup. He also took the club to a Uefa Cup final.However, he has not managed a club since he being sacked by Nottingham Forest in June 2019 - more than six years ago.Coincidentally, the former Republic of Ireland manager was on TalkSport earlier on Monday taking about the Scottish title race - and his belief that Hearts could become the first non-Old Firm side to win it since 1985. \"Hearts have shown a great determination. Their record is great, at this minute,\" O'Neill said. \"With Celtic not being as strong, as physically as strong, as maybe you would want them to be. It is possible.\"Celtic can actually lose games now, whereas before, they looked invincible in matches. Rangers are no threat whatsoever. They are so far adrift it's untrue. \"But this is the moment, this is the time for Hearts. They have gone eight points clear. That is a decent enough lead, really. Their confidence has grown, and it will grow from that victory.\"O'Neill will be joined by Maloney, who had two spells as a player with Celtic and was part of Belgium's coaching staff for a stint after retiring.The Scotland international took on his first job with Hibs in 2021 but lasted just four months. Then he took charge of Wigan Athletic in January 2023 but was dismissed in March of this year, having won 42 of his 115 games in charge.Get in touchSend us your views on Celtic",

China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with self-governing Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force.  \nOn Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US wouldn’t abandon the island in exchange for a favourable deal with China.

    "body": "3 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorThe government confronts a cluster of catastrophes on the very topic that is arguably the most visible state failure they are trying to deal with: small boat crossings.The numbers of migrants arriving on small boats is big and the knock-on consequences of those arrivals are bigger: the costs, the hotels, the public anguish.The accidental release of one of the most high profile prisoners jailed this year left jaws on the floor at Westminster just as it did around the country.Hadush Kebatu was sentenced last month for sexually assaulting a 14 year old girl and a woman in July in Epping in Essex, where he had been living in an asylum hotel since arriving in the UK on a small boat.His arrest led to a series of protests in the area, which spread to other hotels around the country housing asylum seekers.In other words, he personified the scale of the issue and the depth and breadth of the anger provoked by it – and yet he was let out of prison by accident.How on earth did that possibly happen? Have a listen to the conversation I had with His Majesty's Inspector of Prisons, Charlie Taylor, in which I asked him exactly this, on BBC Newscast.And, on top of this, a report by MPs has concluded the Home Office has \"squandered\" billions of pounds of taxpayers' money on asylum accommodation.There is a recurring theme here. I have reported from Westminster for more than 20 years. Not long after I first arrived, the then Home Secretary, Labour's John Reid, repeated a line he had heard from one of his then department's senior officials – that parts of the Home Office were \"not fit for purpose.\"One of the solutions back then was to take some of the Home Office's responsibilities away and set up a new department – the Ministry of Justice.The thing is, of the two issues we are talking about here, one lands at the Home Office's door (asylum accommodation arrangements) and the other is down to the Ministry of Justice (letting prisoners out by accident).And the criticisms of the Home Office have continued.A report compiled under the last government by a now serving Conservative MP, Nick Timothy, who used to work as a special adviser at the Home Office, paints a deeply unflattering picture.To be fair, the nature and responsibilities of the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice are among the thorniest domestic policy issues.But I am struck when I speak to political figures inside the Home Office that they privately acknowledge that not only was Timothy onto something, but many of his observations from a few years ago are still visible to them today.They hope new leadership – a new Permanent Secretary, Dame Antonia Romeo and a new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, can help change that.But there have been plenty of new lead civil servants and new home secretaries in that department over the last two decades.Why all this matters acutely right now is all this represents an overlap of failings on that most prominent of issues – small boats.Little wonder we had the Health Secretary Wes Streeting over the weekend publicly fretting that there is a \"deep disillusionment… and a growing sense of despair about whether anyone is capable of turning this country around\".And that is an analysis coming from one of those who is responsible for doing so.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterHouse of CommonsMatt Collins and Tom Little KC gave evidence at the National Security Strategy Committee, made up of MPs and members of the House of Lords Key figures involved in the failed criminal case against two men accused of spying for China have given conflicting accounts to a parliamentary committee about why the case collapsed. In September, prosecutors dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who had been charged under the Official Secrets Act. Both men deny wrongdoing.The director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, had said the case could not progress because the government's deputy national security adviser, Matt Collins, was unwilling to classify China as an active threat to national security.However, Mr Collins told the committee he had been given legal advice that his evidence would be \"enough\".He said he always knew the case would be \"a challenge\" but that he had been \"trying to ensure that we could support a successful prosecution\". Mr Collins - who was set to be the government's witness in the trial - added: \"And so I was somewhat surprised when I was told on 3 September that the intention was to drop the case.\"In contrast Tom Little KC - who would have been the lead prosecuting barrister in the case - said he would be \"surprised\" if Mr Collins had not realised the prosecution would collapse unless he offered further evidence. Earlier in the session, Mr Little had said Mr Collins had been clear he would not say that \"China posed an active threat to national security at the material time\".\"That was in answer to what I regard as the million dollar question in the case, and once he had said that the current prosecution for those charges was effectively unsustainable,\" he added.He said the case was brought to \"a crashing halt\" when Mr Collins outlined the limits of what he would be wiling to say in court.Asked by the National Security Strategy Committee about the evidence he provided to prosecutors, Mr Collins said: \"What I was able to say is that China poses a range of threats to our national security. \"I was able to say that these include espionage threats, cyber threats, threats to our democratic institutions, threats to our economic security.\"I would be able to say that these threats are very real and persistent.\"He added he believed the CPS was asking him to \"use the generic term that China is a threat, or China is an active threat, which is not in line with government policy at the time\".Members of the committee pressed Mr Parkinson and Mr Little on why they felt Mr Collins had not provided enough evidence that China could be considered a threat.Labour peer Lord Paul Boateng noted that, in his evidence Mr Collins had said \"China's espionage operations threaten the UK's economic prosperity and resilience, and the integrity of our democratic institutions\".He argued the phrase would be enough to indicate \"we are dealing with an enemy\".Lord Mark Sedwill, a former national security adviser, suggested that if Mr Collins was only able to reflect the government view, the prosecution could have sought other witnesses who could have characterised China as a \"threat to national security\". However, Mr Little said the limits of Mr Collins' evidence would have derailed the case, regardless of what others said. Labour MP, and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Dame Emily Thornberry asked why prosecutors could not have trusted a jury to conclude China could be deemed a threat. Mr Parkinson argued that, without the key evidence from Mr Collins, a judge would not have let the case go to trial. Mr Collins submitted his first witness statement in December 2023, after which prosecutors decided they had enough evidence to charge Mr Cash and Mr Berry under the Official Secrets Act 1911. However, Mr Parkinson said a ruling in a separate court case in 2024 changed the requirements of what evidence would be needed and so prosecutors asked Mr Collins to provide further witness statements, in the hope he would label China a \"threat to national security\". In two further statements, Mr Collins detailed threats posed by China in cyberspace and to the UK's democratic institutions but avoided labelling the country \"a threat to national security\". The collapse of the case triggered a political row over who was to blame. The Conservatives have accused the Labour government of allowing the case to fail because it wanted to foster better relations with Beijing.However, the government said ministers had no role in providing evidence for the case and Mr Collins was giving evidence based on what Conservative government policy had been at the time.Mr Collins had a meeting with the top civil servant, Sir Chris Wormald, and National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell on 1 September, shortly before the case collapsed.Sir Chris told the committee that the meeting had been held to discuss how to handle \"different scenarios\" of the UK-China relationship.Mr Collins added that there had been \"at least four lawyers in the room who ensured that there was no discussion about the evidence\" in the case.The Conservatives will hold a vote in Parliament on Tuesday demanding the government releases various documents, including minutes of meetings where the case was discussed by civil servants or ministers.On Wednesday, the committee will hear evidence from Attorney General Lord Hermer and senior minister Darren Jones.

    "body": "1 hour agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoOpenAI has released new estimates of the number of ChatGPT users who exhibit possible signs of mental health emergencies, including mania, psychosis or suicidal thoughts.The company said that around 0.07% of ChatGPT users active in a given week exhibited such signs, adding that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recognizes and responds to these sensitive conversations.While OpenAI maintains these cases are \"extremely rare,\" critics said even a small percentage may amount to hundreds of thousands of people, as ChatGPT recently reached 800 million weekly active users, per boss Sam Altman.As scrutiny mounts, the company said it built a network of experts around the world to advise it.Those experts include more than 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in 60 countries, the company said.They have devised a series of responses in ChatGPT to encourage users to seek help in the real world, according to OpenAI.But the glimpse at the company's data raised eyebrows among some mental health professionals.\"Even though 0.07% sounds like a small percentage, at a population level with hundreds of millions of users, that actually can be quite a few people,\" said Dr. Jason Nagata, a professor who studies technology use among young adults at the University of California, San Francisco.\"AI can broaden access to mental health support, and in some ways support mental health, but we have to be aware of the limitations,\" Dr. Nagata added.The company also estimates 0.15% of ChatGPT users have conversations that include \"explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.\"OpenAI said recent updates to its chatbot are designed to \"respond safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\" and note \"indirect signals of potential self-harm or suicide risk.\"ChatGPT has also been trained to reroute sensitive conversations \"originating from other models to safer models\" by opening in a new window.In response to questions by the BBC on criticism about the numbers of people potentially affected, OpenAI said that this small percentage of users amounts to a meaningful amount of people and noted they are taking changes seriously. The changes come as OpenAI faces mounting legal scrutiny over the way ChatGPT interacts with users.In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple sued the company over the death of their teenage son alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life in April.The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.In a separate case, the suspect in a murder-suicide that took place in August in Greenwich, Connecticut posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fuelled the alleged perpetrator's delusions.More users struggle with AI psychosis as \"chatbots create the illusion of reality,\" said Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law & Innovation Institute at the University of California Law. \"It is a powerful illusion.\"She said OpenAI deserved credit for \"sharing statistics and for efforts to improve the problem\" but added: \"the company can put all kinds of warnings on the screen but a person who is mentally at risk may not be able to heed those warnings.\" ",

    "body": "An independent investigation has been launched after a migrant sex offender was mistakenly released from prison in what appears be \"human error\", Justice Secretary David Lammy has said.In a statement to the House of Commons, Lammy said the inquiry will seek to \"fully establish the facts\" of the release of Hadush Kebatu and whether the staff involved had \"sufficient experience, training and technology\".Kebatu, who was set to be deported, was freed in error from HMP Chelmsford on Friday, prompting a 48-hour manhunt that ended with him being re-arrested in north London on Sunday.Responding to Lammy's statement, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick described the release of Kebatu as a \"national embarrassment.\"Lammy said Kebatu would be deported back to Ethiopia \"as quickly as possible\".Earlier on Monday, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer suggested the deportation would happen within a few days.Kebatu was sentenced last month for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in July in Epping, Essex, where he had been living in an asylum hotel since arriving in the UK on a small boat. His arrest triggered a series of protests in the area, which spread to hotels housing asylum seekers across the country.Kebatu was due to be taken to an immigration detention centre to be deported under an early removals scheme (ERS) for foreign national offenders but was instead released in \"what appears to have been in human error\", Lammy told MPs.\"I've been clear from the outset that a mistake of this nature is unacceptable,\" he told MPs.\"We must get to the bottom of what happened and take immediate action to try and prevent similar releases in error to protect the public from harm.\"Lammy said the independent investigation will be chaired by former Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Dame Lynne Owens. Dame Lynne will also talk to the victims of Kebatu to \"understand the effect this incident had on them,\" Lammy said. \"Her report will highlight points of failure and make recommendations to help prevent further releases in error, which have been rising year-on-year since 2021 - going from nine per month on average in 2023 to 17 per month in the period spanning January to June 2024,\" he added. \"And I'm clear that a single release in error is one too many, which is why we have launched this independent investigation.\"A prison officer has been suspended while the probe takes place.The government has ordered prison governors to carry out new procedures to avoid a repeat of Kebatu's mistaken release.Lammy said he had ordered an \"urgent review\" into the checks that take place when someone is released from prison. New safeguards have been added that amount to the \"strongest release checks that have ever been in place,\" he told MPs.Foreign criminals facing deportation will only be able to be released from prison when a duty governor is physically present, Lammy, who is also deputy prime minister, said.The Prison Governors' Association said the additional checks were \"undoubtedly\" the result of the need to do something after an apparent failure of procedures, but whether they will address the issues \"we will not know until the issues have been identified\".No removals from HMP Chelmsford under the ERS will take place this week.The number of prisoners who have been released mistakenly has risen sharply, with 262 let out in error between April 2024 and March 2025, up from 115 over the same period a year earlier.Lammy suggested the mistaken release of Kebatu was a \"symptom\" of the prison system Labour inherited from the previous Conservative government.There had been a 30% cut in prison staffing, and more than half of frontline prison officers now have less than five years' experience, Lammy said. \"It's little wonder when the system has been brought to its knees that errors like this happen,\" he added.In response, Jenrick said the mistaken release was \"a national embarrassment and today the justice secretary feigns anger at what happened.\"He called on Lammy to give his \"cast iron assurance\" that Kebatu will be deported from the country by the end of the week.",

    "body": "52 minutes agoJames BartlettGetty ImagesEver since her death in 1986, it was taken as common knowledge that Elsa Lanchester - who became a horror movie icon by playing the title character in the Bride of Frankenstein - had been cremated and her ashes sprinkled in the ocean.But then Scott Michaels, the founder of Dearly Departed Tours, discovered that her cremated remains were interred in a rose garden under her married name, Elsa Lanchester Laughton.\"For almost 40 years no one had made the connection – until now,\" he says.Mr Michaels, 63, is a historian who specialises in the dark side of Hollywood. A go-to for programmes about dead Hollywood celebrities and murder, he has consulted for Quentin Tarantino's Manson murder film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Mr Michaels' museum of memorabilia and oddities was also a local must-see, before it closed during the pandemic, for its eclectic collection, which included the Buick Electra that Jayne Mansfield died in in 1967.Deeply passionate about unsung Hollywood, he has also made it a habit to organise fundraisers and events for marginalised, forgotten or cult actors, like Schlitzie (\"Pinhead\" in Freaks) and Ken Weatherwax (\"Pugsley\" from the television Addams Family).It was this interest that led Mr Michaels to delve further into what happened to the remains of Lanchester.Getty ImagesThe 1935 film turned Lanchester into a Universal Horror starBorn on October 28, 1902 in Lewisham, London, Lanchester was a child actor in theatre and cabaret, and even made records of ancient Victorian songs and ballads.At 25 she met and married fellow actor Charles Laughton, and starred alongside him as Anne of Cleeves in 1933's The Private Life of Henry VIII, for which Laughton won the Best Actor Oscar.He played the title role in The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1939, and the couple worked on twelve films together, most notably Witness for the Prosecution in 1957, for which they were both Oscar-nominated.Lanchester had been nominated before, in 1949's Come to the Stable, and after Laughton's death she continued to work steadily, including on a number of Disney films including Mary Poppins and That Darn Cat!.Actor Bruce Davison played Willard alongside Lanchester as his controlling mother Henreitta. He speaks fondly of that time, and especially of her sense of humour.\"She told me: 'You know when a director is giving you a load of codswallop? What you do is say 'Oooh, that's very interesting, let me do that.' And then just do whatever the hell you want!\" he laughs.Davison also recalled something that would tantalise horror fans today.\"I used to take a Super 8 camera to set, and one time I filmed her at the top of the stairs when she did The Bride for me, staring down and giving me that sneer! She was glad for the Bride role,\" he added, \"she understood what it had done for her.\"Getty ImagesLanchester's iconic look as the Bride has become a beloved Halloween costume and an instantly recognisable lookAlthough the Bride of Frankenstein – in which Lanchester's own long hair stretched up over a wire beehive contraption to startling effect - did indeed earn her a place in film history, the issue of what exactly happened to her remains after her death was less well recorded.In her autobiography, Lanchester wrote that she did not like the location of her husband's burial plot in Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills cemetery – Laughton died in 1962. She wrote she would prefer to be cremated with no funeral service, which is partly why everyone assumed for decades she had her ashes scattered.An interest in death began early for Mr Michaels, who was born and grew up in Detroit. He recalls seeing the tented graveside set-up at a family funeral and asking his mom \"are we going to the circus?\" He was three years old.More than that, the family home was on one of the most dangerous intersections in the city. A young Mr Michaels heard – and saw – so many car accidents that it almost became business as usual, and the springboard for an unusual career celebrating those who have died, he says.When he learned of Lanchester's interment, during the course of his regular research into historic death certificates, he decided she would be his next memorial project.Her seven-minute, dialogue-free appearance alongside Boris Karloff as the Bride was legendary – she deserved to have her legacy remembered.She was, after all, basically the only female star of the Universal Horror cast, he says.\"Many people also forget that she played Mary Shelley, who tells her frightening tale of man trying to play God to poets Shelley and Byron, at the beginning of the film,\" Mr Michaels says.Interest in Lanchester had been sparked earlier in the year when Universal Studios released merchandise and special editions of Bride of Frankenstein to celebrate the film's 90th anniversary. In July, a blue plaque was unveiled at Lanchester's childhood home in Battersea, London, that also noted her mother Edith, who was a socialist, feminist, and suffragette.It was a surprise when Mr Michaels discovered that Lanchester's agent, Herschel Green, had interred her at Valhalla Memorial Park, in North Hollywood - and that her ashes had not been scattered as had been widely believed.\"Maybe she didn't really care much about what happened after she was gone,\" he suggests.In less than 36 hours, Mr Michaels had crowdfunded enough for a formal wall marker to recognise this horror legend. The unveiling ceremony will be held on 28 October – her birthday.\"I wanted to celebrate on her 123rd birthday,\" Michaels says, \"and honestly I forgot that it was just a few days before Halloween.\"James Bartlett is a culture/travel journalist and true crime author living in Los Angeles'The paradox of horror': How scary films can soothe your anxiety",

    "body": "The man accused of killing right-wing activist Charlie Kirk will be allowed to wear civilian clothes during pre-trial hearings to avoid prejudicing potential jurors, a Utah judge has said.Judge Tony Graf said Tyler Robinson will be required to wear restraints during hearings, but photo or video of him in restraints will be barred.Robinson, 22, was arrested on aggravated murder charges on 12 September, more than a day after Kirk was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University. During a Monday court hearing, Judge Graf acknowledged massive interest in the case and urged that Robinson's \"presumption of innocence remains\".\"Balancing these factors, the court finds that Mr Robinson's right to the presumption of innocence outweighs the minimal inconvenience of permitting civilian attire,\" Judge Graf said, according to a local Fox News affiliate. Judge Graf said that given the severity of the charges, Robinson will remain in restraints, but that it must be the \"least restrictive\" option.He said although Robinson has no prior criminal history, the charges against him are extremely serious and present courtroom safety concerns.\"The safety of Mr Robinson, the attorneys, court staff, and the public must remain the court's highest priority,\" Judge Graf said.\"The emotional nature of these proceedings also raise the risk of disruption,\" he added. \"Given these factors, the defendant's request to appear without restraints is denied.\"Robinson was not physically present in court for the virtual hearing on Monday. His next in-person court appearance is scheduled for 16 January.Robinson is accused of seven charges, including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and felony discharge of a firearm. Utah County prosecutors have said they are seeking the death penalty in his case.",

    "body": "8 minutes agoNick Eardley,Political correspondent and Jessica RawnsleyHundreds of asylum seekers could be housed in military barracks as the government seeks to end the use of hotels.Discussions are underway over the use of two sites - one in Scotland, the other in the south of England - for accommodation for 900 men, as first reported in the Times.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has instructed Home Office and Ministry of Defence officials to accelerate work to locate appropriate military sites, the BBC understands.The government has pledged to end the use of asylum hotels, which have cost billions of pounds and become a focal point for anti-migrant protests, by the next election.Migrants could be housed in the Cameron Barracks in Inverness and Crowborough army training camp in East Sussex by the end of next month, under plans being drawn up by ministers.Industrial sites, temporary accommodation and otherwise disused accommodation are also being considered.Government sources told the BBC that all sites would comply with health and safety standards.A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We are furious at the level of illegal migrants and asylum hotels.\"This government will close every asylum hotel. Work is well underway, with more suitable sites being brought forward to ease pressure on communities and cut asylum costs.\"Around 32,000 asylum seekers are currently being accommodated in hotels, a drop from a peak of more than 56,000 in 2023 but 2,500 more than last year.A report on Monday found billions of taxpayers' money had been \"squandered\" on asylum accommodation.The Home Affairs Committee said \"flawed contracts\" and \"incompetent delivery\" had resulted in the Home Office relying on hotels as \"go-to solutions\" rather than temporary stop-gaps, with expected costs tripling to more than £15bn.Commenting on the report's findings, Sir Keir said he was \"determined\" to close all asylum hotels, adding: \"I can't tell you how frustrated and angry I am that we've been left with a mess as big as this by the last government.\"Two former military sites - MDP Wethersfield, a former RAF base in Essex, and Napier Barracks, a former military base in Kent - are already being used to house asylum seekers after being opened under the previous Tory government.",

    "body": "1 hour agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorThe chancellor is facing a larger-than-expected gap in initial Budget numbers as a result of long-running poor productivity in the UK economy.The downgrade to productivity performance from the government's official forecaster could lead to a £20bn gap in the public finances on its own, the BBC understands.The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will deliver its final draft forecast, showing the output of the economy per hour worked, to the Treasury on Friday.The Treasury declined to comment on \"speculation\" ahead of the OBR's final forecast, which will be published on 26 November.It comes as speculation is growing over what choices Chancellor Rachel Reeves will take for tax and spending in the run up to her Autumn Budget. The OBR previously assumed a partial bounce back in productivity growth, but it has never materialised.This productivity assumption is essential to long-term growth prospects and so, under the current system, even a fraction of a percentage point change can alter  how much money a Budget needs to raise by several billion pounds.The OBR is understood to have downgraded this by 0.3 percentage points - a figure first reported by the Financial Times - bringing its assumption closer to that of the Bank of England.The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank has calculated that for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, public sector net borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add £21bn to the Budget hole.The changes open up an initial gap of some £20bn, rather than the £10-£14bn widely anticipated.Such a hole could be plugged by hiking taxes, reducing public spending or increasing government borrowing.Reeves admitted on Monday to business leaders in Saudi Arabia that the OBR was \"likely to downgrade productivity\" which has been \"very poor since the financial crisis and Brexit\". The OBR is expected to explain the decision in detail, but some ministers have privately pointed out that if it had done this earlier, different choices could have been made at this summer's Spending Review.There are many other moving parts in the Budget which may lean in the other direction, such as the decline in the interest rates paid on government debt.However, with other pressures such as the U-turns on welfare spending and a desire to rebuild a bigger buffer in the public finances, speculation is pointing towards significant tax rises including some possible breaches of manifesto commitments, points towards significant tax rises, including possible breaches of manifesto commitments like income tax.The Treasury will inform the OBR of its first draft Budget measures next week.",

    "body": "39 minutes agoKaty Austin,Transport correspondent  and Lucy Hooker,Business ReporterEPAGrowing concern among drivers, who say they struggle to drive at night due to the dazzle from oncoming lights, is prompting the government to take a closer look at the design of cars and headlamps on UK roads, the BBC understands.Research into the issue on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT), conducted last winter, has still not been published.However, the government now plans to launch a new assessment of the causes and remedies, the BBC has learned.New measures will be included in the government's upcoming Road Safety Strategy, reflecting what is becoming an increasingly fraught issue for road users.Both Ruth Goldsworthy and Sally Burt say bright headlamps makes it harder for them to get to their weekly SO Sound choir meetings in Totton, in Hampshire.\"Some of the lights are so bright you are blinded by them, for seconds,\" says Ruth.Drivers say it is LED headlamps, increasingly common in new vehicles, that are causing them problems. The beam is whiter, more focused and brighter than the more diffuse light from halogen lamps fitted in older cars.\"I'm not sure where to look, I look into the gutter,\" says Sally. They are both relieved if someone else offers to drive.Evening driving becomes a bigger problem as the winter evenings draw in, and especially after the clocks change, which means more people are driving home after dark.The problem is worse for older people, whose eyes take around nine seconds to recover from glare, compared to one second for a 16-year-old, according to road safety consultant, Rob Heard.\"In severe cases, we might need to stop until our sight can recuperate,\" he said.A new survey from the motoring organisation, the RAC, has found that more than a third of drivers are nervous about getting behind the wheel as the evenings get darker. Three quarters of respondents said driving was getting more difficult due to brighter lights.Ruth Goldsworthy (L) and Sally Burt (R) both say they are put off night-driving by the glare from brighter headlampsThe RAC's senior policy officer, Rod Dennis, said so far little progress has been made on tackling glare, with regulations governing headlights dating back to 1989.A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"We know headlight glare is frustrating for many drivers, especially as the evenings get darker.\"What to do in the face of brighter headlamps:Ensure your windscreen is cleanWear glasses and keep them glassesAvoid looking straight ahead, instead focus on the edge of the roadDo not wear night sunglasses sold for night-driving, as they reduce overall light and won't reduce glare.Source: College of OptometristsNew researchThe results of last winter's government commissioned research into the \"causes and impact of glare\" have been delayed since the summer but are now expected in the next few weeks, the DfT said.They will inform the upcoming Road Safety Strategy, which is also expected to tighten rules on drink-driving and eye-sight tests for older drivers.In addition the BBC understands the government is commissioning new research into the role of vehicle design in causing glare, and possible solutions, which will feed into international discussion of the issue.Getty ImagesLED lamps give off a blue-white lightOne already well-understood source of glare is drivers retrofitting their vehicles, replacing old halogen bulbs with LEDs.The housing for halogen bulbs is not compatible with LED bulbs, and a retrofitted car will not pass its annual MOT check-up.As part of the government's new approach the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has \"stepped up surveillance\" to stop the sale of illegal retrofit headlamp bulbs, the DfT said. Seeing betterCars sold with LED lights can improve road safety, Thomas Broberg, senior advisor for safety at Volvo told the BBC.\"Headlights have become brighter over the years to help drivers see better,\" he said.\"You want to have a lot of light in front of you to understand where the road is going.\"However avoiding dazzle was \"equally important\", he said.\"I would say poor aiming of the headlights and also the road shape are the major factors for glare,\" he told the BBC.For larger vehicles, such as SUVs, where lamps are higher off the ground, there is a requirement for the beam to point more sharply downwards, to protect oncoming drivers. But the angle can be affected by how many passengers it is carrying.Some new cars with \"adaptive features\" adjust the lamps automatically if there is a change in load, but cars without that will need manual adjusting, Mr Broberg said.Some new cars also have automatic headlamp dipping, which lowers the lights when an oncoming vehicle is detected.Getty Images/Stephen Robinson PicturesThree quarters of drivers surveyed by the RAC said bright lights were making night driving harder.However, Daniel Harriman-McCartney, clinical advisor at the College of Optometrists, said automatic dimming features can be \"slow to kick in\".\"If it only works when the car is closer than it needs to be, or doesn't work for cyclists, that can be a problem,\" he said.He is seeing an increasing number of patients concerned about headlamp glare, he added.Dazzling headlights are cited as a factor in around 250 accidents a year, but there is no evidence that brighter lights are causing more collisions than previously, the RAC concedes.Instead, worried drivers may simply be \"taking the risk off the road\" by not driving at night, with a big social impact, the RAC's Mr Dennis warned.He would like to see action that \"strikes a balance\".\"We don't want to go back to worse headlights. It is about what is bright enough.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoIan AikmanPA MediaAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is understood to have voluntarily surrendered his gun licence after a visit from the Metropolitan Police.Officers attended the former prince's Royal Lodge residence in Windsor last month, ahead of his expected house move in the new year.A Met Police spokesperson said: \"On Wednesday, 19 November, Metropolitan Police firearms licensing officers attended an address in Windsor to request that a man in his 60s voluntarily surrender his firearms and shotgun certificate.\" The force said the certificate was surrendered but did not comment further.It is not clear why the former prince - a known hunting enthusiast - gave up his licence, but the decision means he can only use or transport his guns if supervised.Surrendering a certificate does not mean the individual will not have access to their firearms.Andrew is expected to move to Norfolk in the new year, after he was stripped of his titles over his links to the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The former prince will move to an undisclosed property on the Sandringham estate, which is privately owned by his brother, King Charles III.In October, Buckingham Palace said the move would take place \"as soon as possible and practicable\".Andrew's connection to Epstein came under scrutiny again last week after a photo of him lying on the laps of women was released by the US government as part of the Epstein files.The King's brother was one of many well-known figures to be pictured in the files, and appearing in them is not evidence of a crime. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.",

    "body": "3 hours agoIan AikmanandIain Watson,Political correspondentPolice leaders are set to recommend scrapping non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs) in a review to be published next month.College of Policing chair Lord Herbert told the BBC a \"sensible\" new approach, focused only on the most serious incidents, would \"re-balance the system\" for the social media age.NCHIs are alleged acts motivated by hostility or prejudice towards people with certain characteristics, such as race or gender, but which do not meet the bar for a criminal offence.Current Home Office guidance says they are recorded to collect data on \"hate incidents that could escalate into more serious harm\", but critics say they divert police resources and restrict freedom of speech.Though they are not crimes, NCHIs stay on police records and can come up in background checks.Police guidance on the recording of NCHIs was first published in 2005, following recommendations by an inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence - the London teenager who was stabbed to death in a racist attack in 1993.But Lord Herbert said \"an explosion of social media\" in the years since they were introduced has meant police had been drawn into monitoring \"mere disputes\" online.Officers do not want to be \"policing tweets\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.He added that recent headlines about NCHIs were \"awkward and very damaging\" for the police.\"It was quite clear that the whole regime needed looking at, that there was a perception that the police were being drawn into matters that they shouldn't have been,\" he added.The home secretary will have the final decision on whether to adopt the recommendations outlined by the College of Policy and National Police Chiefs' Council in their review next month.The Home Office told the BBC \"a consistent, common-sense approach\" that protected the \"fundamental right to free speech\" was needed, but added it would not pre-empt the findings of the review.The vice-chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Rachel Swann, said: \"It is not for policing to referee online debates on cultural issues. Protecting free speech and ensuring officers focus on real-world threat and risk is an important part of our considerations.\"But equally important is ensuring policing can continue to keep our communities safe, such as by spotting risks to vulnerable people, monitoring community tensions or identifying potential precursors to violence and other criminal behaviour.\"She added it will be for ministers to decide on future policy. Details of the new proposals were first reported by the Telegraph. Lord Herbert told the newspaper that \"only the most serious category of what will be treated as anti-social behaviour will be recorded\". Last year, the paper reported that 43 police forces in England and Wales had recorded more than 133,000 NCHIs since 2014.In October, the Metropolitan Police said it would no longer investigate NCHIs to allow officers to \"focus on matters that meet the threshold for criminal investigations\".It came after the policing watchdog said forces should stop recording them.In April, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called for NCHIs to be scrapped in most cases, arguing they \"wasted police time chasing ideology and grievance instead of justice\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterPA MediaDenise Coates, the founder and chief executive of Bet365, received a pay package of at least £280m in 2025, marking another year as one of Britain's highest-paid bosses.Her total earnings jumped by more than two thirds from almost £158m a year earlier, despite profits at the gambling firm tumbling.Ms Coates was awarded £104m in salary in the year to March 2025, Companies House filings show.In addition, as a majority shareholder in Bet365, she was entitled to at least half of the £354m dividend payment declared by the firm for the year.The £280m package means she has earned more than £2bn from Bet365 over the past decade.Campaign group the High Pay Centre condemned Ms Coates's pay as too high.Director Andrew Speke said: \"Denise Coates is well-liked in Stoke for being self-made and giving back to her community.\"But the eye-watering sums she earns go far beyond what anyone needs for a life of luxury - and her fortune comes from an industry that has caused real harm to too many people.\"Bet365 has been approached for comment.Her latest pay deal came as Bet365's pre-tax profit fell to £339m for the year, from £596m previously. Overall revenue rose by 9%, from £3.7bn a year earlier to £4bn.Ms Coates founded Bet365 in a portable building in a Stoke-on-Trent car park more than 20 years ago. It is now the biggest private sector employer in the city and offers sports betting, poker, casino games and bingo online to millions of customers worldwide.She is one of Britain's richest women and among the world's highest-paid executives.After training as an accountant, Ms Coates helped build Bet365 into one of the biggest online gambling companies from her father's bookmaking business. Her brother, John Coates, is a co-chief executive of the company.As well as being one of the UK's best-paid bosses, Ms Coates is reportedly among the country's biggest taxpayers. Her £104m salary would see her pay tens of millions in income tax and national insurance.Bet365 also said the company paid £482m of tax in the year to March, up from £364m a year earlier, including tax on dividend payments.During the year, Bet365 donated £130m to the Denise Coates Foundation, which donates to charities covering education, arts and culture and health.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterPA MediaFarmers protested against the changes again at last month's Budget Government proposals to tax inherited farmland have been watered down, with the planned threshold increasing from £1m to £2.5m.The climbdown follows months of protests by farmers and concern from some Labour backbenchers.At last year's Budget, ministers said they would start imposing a 20% tax on inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m from April 2026, ending the 100% tax relief that had been in place since the 1980s. In an announcement put out after MPs had left Parliament for the Christmas recess, Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said: \"We have listened closely to farmers across the country and we are making changes today to protect more ordinary family farms.\"\"It's only right that larger estates contribute more, while we back the farms and trading businesses that are the backbone of Britain's rural communities, \" she said. Head of the National Farmers' Union Tom Bradshaw welcomed the change, telling BBC Radio 5 Live it \"takes out many family farms from the eye of a pernicious storm\".Gavin Lane, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said: \"The government deserves credit for recognising the flaws in the original policy and changing course.\"However, this announcement only limits the damage - it doesn't eradicate it entirely. \"Many family businesses will own enough expensive machinery and land to be valued above the threshold, yet still operate on such narrow profit margins that this tax burden remains unaffordable.\"Ben Ardern, a farmer from Derbyshire, told the BBC said it was \"a step in the right direction\".He said the government should \"drop it [the tax] for family farms... and just tax the people who have got the money to tax.\"The big corporations who have just buried money into land - they're not farmers, they have just done it to avoid tax. Farmers haven't bought land to avoid tax, we've bought land to farm it and grow food.\"In the 14 months since the initial proposal was announced, there have been regular protests by farmers outside Parliament. Some Labour MPs in rural areas have also expressed concern. At a recent parliamentary vote on the plan, a dozen backbenchers abstained and one, Markus Campbell-Savours, voted against.Campbell-Savours was subsequently suspended for voting against the government, meaning he now sits as an independent MP.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said in a post on social media: \"This fight isn't finished. \"Other family businesses are still affected by Labour's tax raid, and we will keep pushing until the tax is lifted from them too.\"Liberal Democrat spokesperson Tim Farron MP said: \"It is utterly inexcusable that family farmers have been put through over a year of uncertainty and anguish since the government first announced these changes.\"We demand that the government scraps this unfair tax in full and if they refuse to, Liberal Democrats will submit amendments in the new year to bring it down.\"Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice said: \"This cynical climbdown - whilst better than nothing - does little to address the year of anxiety that farmers have faced in planning to protect their livelihoods... with British agriculture hanging by a thread, the government must go further and abolish this callous farms tax.\"In her first Budget in 2024, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced she would be reversing the 100% inheritance tax relief on agricultural assets that had been in place since the 1980s.The move would have seen inherited agricultural assets worth over £1m taxed at 20%, half the standard inheritance tax rate, raising an estimated £520m annually by 2029.The government had argued that the change would protect smaller farms while stopping wealthy investors from buying farmland as a tax loophole. However, it has now stepped back from the original proposal raising the threshold level to £2.5m.Coupled with an exemption which allows farmers to pass on assets to their spouses tax-free, this new government concession means a couple could pass on up to £5m in qualifying assets, without paying tax. Above the threshold, a 50% relief will be applied to the remaining assets. According to the government, the number of estates in the UK expected to pay more inheritance tax in 2026/27 will be reduced from around 2,000 under the original plans to 1,100 under the new proposal. The climbdown is the latest in a series of U-turns the government has made since being elected in July 2024. Earlier this year the government eased cuts to winter fuel payments and backtracked on plans to make £5bn of cuts to the welfare bill. ",

    "body": "20 minutes agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe US economy picked up speed over the three months to September, as consumer spending jumped and exports increased. The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.3%, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter. That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years.The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending.But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts.\"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America.Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\".\"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added.The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%.It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services.Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply,  bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints. Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the economy was well positioned as it headed into 2026, as it starts to feel the boost from tax cuts and the US central bank's recent moves to drop interest rates. \"Underlying measures are consistent with a solid expansion,\" he said. However, some analysts warned that rising prices faced by some households could  make it difficult to sustain the unusually strong pace of growth seen in the most recent quarter. Over the three months to September, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, ticked up 2.8%, compared with 2.1% in the previous quarter, according to the report. Analysts have warned that those price increases are weighing on lower and middle income households, even as higher income households continue to spend freely. Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that some more recent surveys and credit card data suggest that households are reining in their spending. \"The weak labour market, stagnant real incomes, and exhaustion of pandemic-era excess savings all seem finally to be catching up with households,\" he said.

    "body": "'A miracle': Officer shot in head during Bondi attack home from hospital10 hours agoYang TianSydneyPA MediaJack Hibbert had been working as a police officer for just months before he was shotA young police officer who was shot in the head during the Bondi Beach attack has been released from hospital.Probationary Constable Jack Hibbert - who is just four months into the job - was patrolling a Hanukkah event when two gunmen opened fire, injuring over 40 people and killing 15.The 22-year-old, who was also hit in the shoulder, has lost vision in one of his eyes but is now recovering at home, his family confirmed in a statement.\"As a family, we couldn't ask for anything more - having our Jack home, especially for Christmas, truly feels like a miracle.\"They thanked the public for their \"overwhelming support\" and praised medical staff for their \"exceptional\" care and dedication.\"While he is home, he is still recovering and will need space, support, and continued positive thoughts during this time,\" the statement added.Even after he was shot during the attack, Constable Hibbert continued to help festival attendees until he physically could no longer do so, his family previously said.\"Many of his colleagues who were present on the night of the incident have visited in hospital and given testaments to Jack's bravery during the incident... They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger,\" they said.He was one of two police officers injured in the shooting, with the second officer Constable Scott Dyson, 25, still recovering from his injuries in hospital, according to the last police update.Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon visited Constable Hibbert in hospital, praising him as a \"positive young man\".Lanyon added that the force would rally around Constable Hibbert and find \"appropriate duties for him\" after his recovery.Police have alleged the suspected gunmen were inspired by Islamic State ideology and targeted the Jewish festival in what has been declared a terror attack.Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of terror. A second gunman - his father, Sajid Akram - was shot dead by police at the scene.On Monday, new court documents alleged the pair \"meticulously\" planned the attack for months, and two days prior to the shooting, visited Bondi for reconnaissance.",

    "body": "Can rugby star's stolen caps be found after 40 years?10 hours agoLions RugbyKen Goodall, from Londonderry, won 19 international caps for IrelandThe family of a former Irish rugby star whose international caps were stolen during a break-in almost forty years ago have appealed for their return.Ken Goodall, who died in 2006, first played for Ireland against Australia in 1967 and won the last of his 19 international caps against Wales in 1970.His Irish international caps were the only items taken during the break-in at his family home in Londonderry in 1987.\"I would love the family to get these caps back... that would be the end of it as far as I am concerned,\" Goodall's brother Alan said.Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle's 20 Minutes with Mark Patterson programme, Alan said nothing else was taken when the home was targeted back in 1987.\"It was only the caps that went,\" he said,  adding Ken and his wife Wilma were not the type of people \"who would have had expensive jewellery and stuff like that\".He has over the years started to think the caps were \"stolen to order\".Alan said he knows it is a \"tall order\" to expect the caps to be returned after all this timeGetting the caps back now, Alan said, is \"a tall order\" but he hoped whoever had them might return them.\"If the person who done this is about… and maybe thinking: 'Oh, them caps, they're lying up in my loft.' \"I do not want to see you prosecuted.\"I'd say: 'Thanks very much for doing that.'\"Derry, Ulster, Ireland and the LionsKen Goodall, a number eight from City of Derry RFC, rose quickly through the competitive ranks of rugby, making his Ireland debut at the age of 19.Over the course of his rugby union career he played for Ulster, Newcastle University, Ireland and the Barbarians.In 1968, at the age of 21, he played on the British Lions tour of South Africa.However, Goodall's Lions career did not last long after he broke a bone in his hand during his first game against Eastern Transvaal and had to return home.The last of his 19 Ireland caps was won in a victory over Wales, and Goodall then joined rugby league side Workington.When his time in sport came to an end, Goodall returned to teach in Derry, retiring as vice-principal of Faughan Valley High School.The family's appeal comes after they were reunited with Goodall's cap won for representing the British Lion on that 1968 tourThe family's appeal for the return of the stolen Irish caps comes just months after they were reunited with Goodall's cap won for representing the British Lion on that 1968 tour.In 2017 the Lions Trust launched an initiative to reunite former players with their international caps.The cap had been, unbeknown to the family, in an office in Dublin until July, when it was reunited with the Goodall family.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJames W KellyLondonPA MediaThe protest was in support of Palestine Action prisoners on hunger strikeGreta Thunberg has been arrested at a demonstration in support of the Palestine Action protesters who are on hunger strike in prison, according to the Prisoners for Palestine protest group.The 22-year-old activist was detained in the City of London after attending the scene of the early-morning demonstration on Fenchurch Street.In a video shared by the group, she could be seen holding a sign reading \"I support the Palestine Action prisoners\" and \"I oppose genocide\".City of London Police said a 22-year-old woman was arrested for displaying a placard in support of a proscribed organisation, in this case Palestine Action, contrary to Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.The force said officers were called to the area at about 07:00 GMT after hammers and red paint were used to damage a building.A man and a woman were also arrested on suspicion of criminal damage after they \"glued themselves nearby\", police said. Specialist officers worked to release them before taking them into custody.PA MediaMs Thunberg has been a prominent voice in Europe's pro-Palestinian movementThe Prisoners for Palestine protest group said it staged the demonstration outside the offices of Aspen Insurance, which it claimed provides services to Israeli-linked defence firm Elbit Systems.Palestine Action was proscribed under UK terrorism legislation earlier this year, making it a criminal offence to support or express support for the group.Police said inquiries were continuing.Ms Thunberg, who first came to prominence as a child climate activist, has been involved in several demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause.She described the activists on hunger strike as \"political prisoners\" in a video posted on her Instagram on Monday, adding the UK government should meet their demands to be released from custody and for charges to be dropped.PA MediaProtesters targeted an office in the City with red paintThe protest comes after several imprisoned Palestine Action activists, including one who has refused to eat for 52 days, have been taken to hospital in recent days.Since the hunger strike began on 2 November, a total of seven prisoners have been taken to hospital.Kamran Ahmed, 28, who was being held at Pentonville Prison in north London, and Amu Gib, 30, who was being held at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey, have both been admitted to hospital in the past week.Prisoners for Palestine previously said Mr Gib's health had \"deteriorated rapidly\" since joining the hunger strike on 2 November, and the activist now needed to use a wheelchair.A legal firm representing the hunger strikers has said it submitted a pre-action letter on Monday against the Justice Secretary David Lammy.The letter outlines the group's intention to initiate legal action.

    "body": "1 hour agoAngela FergusonBBC WalesBeach Academy CICThe hobnailed boots were found during a clean up of rock pools on Ogmore beachMystery surrounds the appearance of hundreds of Victorian hobnailed shoes which have washed ashore on a beach.The black leather boots, thought to date back to the 19th Century, were discovered by volunteers cleaning up rock pools on Ogmore By Sea Beach in the Vale of Glamorgan, south Wales.Emma Lamport from the Beach Academy social enterprise which found the shoes said there was speculation locally that they could be from a shipwrecked Italian cargo vessel said to have struck nearby Tusker Rock about 150 years ago.Author and mudlarker Lara Maiklem said the boots were \"definitely Victorian\" and likely to have come from a shipwreck due to the quantity found.It is thought the shipwreck could have occurred at nearby Tusker Rock, which is about 3km (2m) west of Ogmore beach and only visible at low tide. Ms Lamport said this week alone they had discovered 200 shoes in one small area during a rockpool restoration on Ogmore beach.She explained they had been doing a restoration project since September in a bid to clean up marine litter which can become embedded in the rockpools, but certainly did not expect to find hundreds of Victorian shoes.Beach Academy CICThe shoes washed up on the beach while volunteers were cleaning up marine litter from a rock poolMs Lamport shared photos of some of the washed up boots on social media in a bid to solve the mystery of where they came from.She said one theory was that the Italian ship sank with a cargo of leather shoes and these were washed up the River Ogmore and ended up embedded in the river banks \"and every now and again they are released\".Shoes like these have been known to wash up on the beach at Ogmore and Llantwit over the years, Emma Lamport said\"Some of the boots are in pretty good condition and with some you can very clearly see they are a men's boot,\" added Ms Lamport, who lives in Ogmore.She said she thought some of the boots found were children's as they were so small, but Ms Maiklem said these could be women's shoes \"as people had much smaller feet in those days\".Ms Maiklem has written four books about mudlarking, which was historically a trade of poor Victorians and is now a popular hobby involving unearthing historical artefacts from the silt on river banks.Emma Lamport said more than 400 of the boots had been found on the beachPhotographer Peter Britton, from Porthcawl, has produced artwork Ghost Ships and Tides, based on Tusker Rock and in tribute to those lost at sea.He said it was \"absolutely fascinating\" how these boots had suddenly appeared as \"little reminders of history\".Academic Dr Michael Roberts, from Bangor University's School of Ocean Sciences, is in the process of studying shipwrecks around the coast of Wales.He said that while he was not aware of the particular shipwreck which was the subject of speculation in Ogmore, it was possible that shipwrecks from the Victorian era could now be starting to degrade and fall apart.Peter BrittonPeter Britton has photographed Tusker Rock and studied some of the shipwrecks there, including French steamer the SS Liban which ran aground in 1882 with the loss of three livesPrevious social media posts shared in the Ogmore community have flagged up similar experiences of shoes washing ashore. One such post from three years ago shared photos of similar footwear, with one person commenting that they had also found \"tiny leather hobnail boots\" on the beach.More top stories",

    "body": "5 hours agoJoe LangstaffeBBC WalesBBCThe Archbishop of Wales Cherry Vann says she has received backlash since her appointment but wants \"unity\" in the churchThe Archbishop of Wales has said that some parishioners have chosen to leave the Church in Wales in protest over her sexuality and gender.The Most Reverend Cherry Vann, who is also Bishop of Monmouth, became both the UK's first female Archbishop as well as the first openly gay Archbishop in the world, in July.Speaking ahead of delivering her first Christmas message as Archbishop, she said she had been hurt by attacks over her sexuality, but added those with different opinions should not be forbidden from expressing their views.It follows the Global Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (Gafcon) describing her appointment as \"another painful nail in the coffin of Anglican orthodoxy\".Speaking to BBC Wales, the Archbishop said: \"There are still patches all over the place where people continue to struggle with women in leadership and I have to respect that.\"The Church in Wales is working hard to welcome LGBT+ people, but also I respect that there are people in the Church in Wales who find that really difficult.\"Some, sadly, have felt the need to leave and I take that very seriously\".Archbishop Vann was elected by her fellow bishops with a two-thirds majority, following the retirement of her predecessor, Andrew John, in the summer.He retired after issues with safeguarding, excessive drinking and church members overstepping sexual boundaries came to light at Bangor Cathedral.Archbishop Vann said the vast majority of people had been supportive about her election, but added others had been \"quite hostile\".\"It can be very hurtful\", she said.\"It's hard to hear some of the things that people say, but I think it's important that there is the space for them to say that.\"I don't want people to feel shut down or silenced just because I hold a different view.\"But it does nevertheless hurt because it feels like an attack on who I am and who God has made me to be.\"We have to find a way as a Church to respect one another's views and find a commonality in our faith in Christ, despite our differences\".Archbishop Vann said that despite the widespread interest in her election because of her sex and gender, they were not the most important things to her.\"Other people find it fascinating\", she said.\"I had a lot of people contact me rejoicing at my election and saying how much hope and strength they get from the fact that there is now a woman in the role – and a civilly partnered woman at that.\"I've had the opposite as well. That's just life\".In her Christmas message, the Archbishop said she had chosen a passage from the Gospel of John about finding light in the darkness, a popular choice at carol services.\"It's really about how the coming of Jesus into the world is the light in the darkness – and there's plenty of darkness around in the world at the moment\", she said.\"Our message as Christians is that Jesus comes into all that difficulty and despair and brings the light of hope and love and joy, because of who he is\".Cherry Vann, as her election as Archbishop of Wales was announced in Chepstow last JulyAfter a turbulent year for the Church in Wales, Archbishop Vann said she was very conscious of her responsibility to fix the issues that led to her predecessor's departure.Asked whether her time as Archbishop should be judged against her ability to change the culture within the Church, she said it presented a significant challenge.\"I think there is a big cultural issue in the Church\", she said.\"Anybody who has tried to change the culture in an organisation will tell you it takes a long time.\"This is a big thing and I guess that there will still be work to do when I retire.\"(We need) to take a greater care for those who have been damaged by the Church, of which sadly there are many.\"But I am hopeful that we are already making changes.\"There are many people who are determined to make a difference and ensure that the Church is a place where, when things go wrong, they are dealt with properly\".More top stories",

    "body": "32 minutes agoAlex SmithandMohamed Madi,KyivWatch: BBC correspondent at the scene of Kyiv drone attackRussia carried out a \"massive\" overnight attack on several Ukrainian cities,  President Volodymyr Zelensky has said, a day after he warned of strikes over the Christmas period.At least three people were killed, according to Ukrainian officials, including a four-year-old child, while energy infrastructure was also targeted, leaving several regions without power.Russia launched 635 drones and 38 missiles, Ukraine's air force said, adding that 621 of them were downed.Zelensky said \"people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe\" in the run-up to Christmas, and said the strikes sent \"an extremely clear signal about Russia's priorities\" despite ongoing peace talks.He added that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"still cannot accept that he must stop killing. And that means that the world is not putting enough pressure on Russia\".Zelensky had previously warned it was in the Kremlin's \"nature\" to \"carry out massive attacks\" during the festive period.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.Local authorities in the central Zhytomyr region confirmed a child's death.Regional head Vitaly Bunechko said the child \"was taken to hospital, doctors fought for (the child's) life but could not save (the child) in the end\". Five others were injured in the strike, he added.Meanwhile, a 76-year-old woman was killed and three people injured when a house in the Kyiv region was struck, according to Ukraine's state emergencies service.An attack in Khmelnytskyy, western Ukraine, killed a 72-year-old, regional administration head Serhiy Tyurin said.Polish fighter jets were scrambled in response to missiles and drones targeting west Ukraine.The Russian defence ministry said it had targeted Ukrainian \"military-industrial complex plants and supporting energy facilities\". It added that all the designated targets had been hit.Meanwhile, Ukraine reportedly struck a petrochemical plant in Stravropol, southern Russia.Videos shared by Russian media channels online showed large flames rising from the direction of the plant.The region's governor, Vladimir Vladimirov, said a Ukrainian drone hit the plant and sparked a fire. No casualties were reported and residential buildings were left undamaged.Oleksandr Chyrvonyi, who lives in the city of Zaporizhzhia close to the front line,  told the BBC Monday night was \"an extremely unpleasant experience\".\"I had four or five hours' sleep - there were constant notifications waking me up that drones and cruise missiles were coming,\" he said, adding that most went past his city to western and central regions. Power cuts are the new normal. Zaporizhzhia has around 10 hours of electricity out of 24, he said.There is a \"general feeling of the lack of civilisation\", he continued, but said he tries to have \"an illusion of a normal life\".ReutersEmergency responders work at the site of a Russian drone strike on an apartment building in the Ukrainian capitalWith temperatures expected to fall to as low as -7C on Wednesday, Ukraine's energy operator warned of emergency power shutdowns \"in all regions\" and urged people to use energy \"sparingly\". Acting energy minister Artem Nekrasov said it was the ninth large attack on Ukraine's energy system this year, and that supply in the Rivne, Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions has been \"almost completely\" lost.Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Merezhko told the BBC World Service that some areas could be without power \"for days\".The main focus of Russian attacks in recent days has been the southern port city of Odesa, which comes after Vladimir Putin threatened to sever Ukraine's access to the Black Sea.The Russian president made the threat in retaliation for Ukrainian drone attacks on tankers belonging to Russia's \"shadow fleet\", vessels used to move goods including oil which are under Western sanctions. In the Ukrainian capital, many suspect the overnight attack is linked to Monday's killing of a top Russian general after a car bomb exploded in Moscow.Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov - the head of the armed forces' operational training department - died in the blast, which Russia has blamed on Ukraine. Kyiv has not commented.It also comes after the latest round of US-led diplomatic talks in Miami, where envoys from Washington and Kyiv have been drafting detailed proposals to end the war.According to Zelensky, the US had proposed a Christmas truce but Russia rejected the idea.Zelensky said he received a progress report on the talks on Tuesday morning, and that \"several draft documents have now been prepared\", including a basic framework to end the war, future security guarantees for Ukraine, and on the country's post-war recovery.Putin was also due to be briefed by his envoy Kirill Dmitriev on Tuesday on the latest discussions with Washington.

    "body": "9 hours agoZoe ConwayNews CorrespondentThe Wadleys tell the BBC of the ongoing impact of problems with the insulationTony and Becs Wadley say they can't spend Christmas at home after insulation installed under a government scheme has caused black mould in several rooms, and their asthmatic son can't be inside the property.Mr Wadley says the situation is tearing the family apart: ''It's awful. Elliott can't come into our house, it's as if he's been ostracised from his own home.''The couple are among more than 300 people who have contacted the BBC in recent weeks to tell us about insulation that has gone wrong in their homes. The Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it was taking action to ensure consumers are no longer let down by poor installations. Becs WadleyBlack mould in one of the Wadleys' bedrooms earlier this year. It spread under internal wall insulation which was installed in 2024.Mr and Mrs Wadley got a government grant to have energy efficiency measures fitted in their Gower Peninsula house because they hoped a warmer home would help Elliott's asthma. The grant covered the cost of insulating his bedroom walls.But months after the work was completed, the Wadleys discovered black mould was growing behind the insulation boards. It was removed by the installer and replaced with a new insulation system. But this also had to be removed along with all the plaster after it became damp. Elliott, 19, hasn't entered the house since April, instead staying with his grandmother during university breaks.''I miss him like you wouldn't believe',\" says Mrs Wadley.The family are going to stay with Mr Wadley's sister for Christmas so they can all be together.Billions of pounds of public money has been spent on insulating homes over the last 15 years. The Wadleys' home was insulated under a government scheme known as ECO4.  In October, the National Audit Office (NAO) spending watchdog found that 98% of homes fitted with external wall insulation under ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme since 2022 had major issues that needed to be repaired. It added that 29% of homes that had internal wall insulation fitted under the schemes had major issues.The report also said there had been \"weak\" government oversight and regulatory ''failure''.DESNZ said it had \"inherited a flawed system of oversight and regulation\". A spokesman for the department said it was \"committed to introducing comprehensive reforms through the Warm Homes Plan to ensure that consumers get the quality installations they deserve and failures like these are not repeated\".The spokesman added: \"People should not be expected to navigate a complex web of organisations when they want to improve their homes – and with this government, they won't.\"Becs WadleyBecs and Tony Wadley with their three sons Felix, Freddie and Elliott.In the downstairs rooms of the Wadleys' home the insulation has also failed and has had to be removed. There is black mould on the walls while electric sockets hang loose with the wires exposed. The family says it has been in this condition for months. The installer, Stellar Energy, says it has ''no record of any immediate safety hazards being flagged.'' It says the descriptions of the exposed wires and sockets was \"highly inconsistent\" with their standard operating procedures, which required all such  work to be made safe.Building surveyor, David Walter, says the insulation wasn't fitted correctly and says the installer ''didn't understand what they were doing and what they were doing to the building which is why we've got these problems.''Stellar Energy told the BBC the design was ''technically correct for a stone house and was installed...in strict accordance with the mandatory technical specifications of ECO4.''Mr Wadley says he wouldn't have signed up for the grant if he'd known what would happen. ''You wouldn't put your family through this. Nobody would. Somebody needs to take responsibility.''Stellar Energy says it ''sincerely regrets any distress this situation has caused the family'' and says its priority is ''providing a final resolution to ensure the home meets the high standards'' it strives for.Scott Proudman had external wall insulation fitted to his family's home in 2021 under a government scheme. He is facing a £20,000 bill to get it replaced.Scott Proudman contacted the BBC about the botched external wall insulation fitted to his Bristol home in 2021.His family had been eligible for a government grant because of his eight-year-old daughter's disabilities. Born 24 weeks premature, she has cerebral palsy, a partial visual impairment and was recently diagnosed with autism. ''I feel like a failure every time I come home because this was meant to be something to look after my family, to make life easier, and it hasn't,\" he says.When the work was done, insulation boards were fixed to the outside of the house and render was applied to make it waterproof.  But the render has been falling off for years.Scott ProudmanRender is falling off Scott Proudman's home. As a result, the insulation underneath it is no longer waterproof and damp and mould could grow inside the house.Building surveyor Mr Walter, says poor design and poor workmanship has caused the render to disintegrate. He says rainwater will very likely get under the cracked render and behind the insulation and will likely cause dampness inside.  ''It's like a timebomb. It's going to get worse and worse, affecting the inside of the property,\" he says.Mr Walter says all of the render and insulation will have to come off and will cost tens of thousands of pounds to put right.Right now the family is stuck with the repair bill because the installer, SPMS Wales, is being liquidated and Mr Proudman says they weren't given the required guarantee for the work. Trustmark, the organisation responsible for overseeing quality, told Mr Proudman it couldn't help because the company is no longer accredited.Mr Proudman says he chose the company ''because it was on a government website and was Trustmark registered. I can't believe how few rights consumers have.''Brett Langdon, a director at SPMS Wales says he is ''very sorry the Proudmans have ended up in this situation'' and says all works ''were done to the manufactures specification.'' He says he gave a guarantee to the Proudmans but has told the BBC he can't remember who the guarantee is with. He says the delamination of the render was \"due to a failure of the system\".In a statement TrustMark said it was ''very sorry to hear about what's happened to Mr and Mrs Proudman and Mr and Mrs Wadley and the conditions both families' homes have been left in. It is totally unacceptable and we are in discussions with the relevant Scheme Providers and guarantee providers to help resolve these situations.'' And it said it underlined ''the need for reform to the current system''.",

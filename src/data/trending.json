The Trump administration has been defending its seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast.  In a dramatic video shared by the US Attorney General, armed camouflaged soldiers are shown swinging down ropes from low flying helicopters, and running along the vessel’s decks. \nThe US claims the tanker is used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\".  The Venezuela government in response has called the seizure blatant theft, claiming Trump is after the country’s rich oil and energy resources. \nIn this episode, Sarah and Justin unpack how far Donald Trump is willing to go in his ongoing campaign against the Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.   In recent months, the US president has accused Maduro of “forcing” criminals into the US and facilitating drug smuggling, which Maduro denies.  And this week, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the killing of over 80 people in US military strikes on alleged drug boats as the “Al Qaeda of our hemisphere”.  \nThe Americast team also look at how this fits in with other South American countries, with Trump recently offering Honduran ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández a ‘full and complete pardon’.   \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Festive forecast: Will we see a white Christmas this year?Image source, Getty ImagesBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter As the mild December continues, are our hopes of a white Christmas melting away?It's still a little too early to confirm the details of the forecast for Christmas 2025, but there are some signs we may see the weather turning a little cooler and calmer.Since the turn of the century, more than half of all Christmas Days in the UK have seen snow falling somewhere.But at this early stage what do we actually know about the chances of this Christmas being \"white\"?What is in the Christmas forecast?Forecasters look at data produced by several different weather supercomputers generated over different timescales.Not all computer models are in agreement about how the finer details of the Christmas forecast will look, but there are some themes now emerging.The first half of December has been mild and wet, dominated by rain-bearing Atlantic low pressure systems. This general set-up is expected to continue for the next week or so, but there is a chance of higher pressure building into late December, which would bring a drier spell compared to recent conditions. Whilst temperatures are likely to drop a little, returning to more typical for the time of year, there is no especially cold weather expected at this stage. Overnight frost and fog could well become more of an issue over the Christmas period. Wintry showers cannot be ruled out, especially over high ground in the north, but there are currently no indications of widespread snow.Forecasting snow in the UK is notoriously difficult, and it is still too early to know for certain whether we will see a white Christmas in 2025. The festive forecast will become much clearer about five days before Christmas, so keep an eye on the BBC Weather app or website for the latest updates. Image caption, Lying snow looks beautifully festive but a Christmas is only officially 'white' if snow is recorded falling from the skyWhat makes a Christmas officially 'white'?Christmas cards often depict snow that is \"deep and crisp and even\", but often a \"white Christmas\" will be much less wintry in reality.In fact, just a single snowflake has to be recorded falling at any point during the 24 hours of 25 December at any of the Met Office's network of around 300 observing stations. Snow already lying on the ground on Christmas Day may make things look merry and bright, but it does not count under the official definition.Will it be a White Christmas?Join BBC Weather’s Carol Kirkwood, Matt Taylor and Barra Best, along with famous faces Jeremy Vine and Lucy Porter, to explore where our fascination with a white Christmas comes from.What are the 'white Christmas' odds?Since 2020, every year except 2024 has officially been a white Christmas. However, in each of these years very few places reported any snow actually settling on the ground.The last time the UK saw a widespread white Christmas was back in 2010, when snow fell at 19% of weather stations and, very unusually, 83% of stations reported snow lying on the ground.Whilst snow is more common between January to March than in December, odds are still pretty high that somewhere in the UK will see snow on 25 December. However, as our climate warms, winters in the UK are becoming milder and wetter. Whilst the Met Office says, \"This generally reduces the chances of a white Christmas,\" it also recognises that, \"The natural variability of the weather will not stop cold, snowy winters happening in the future\".

    "body": "8 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterGetty ImagesBest-selling author Joanna Trollope has died aged 82, her family has announced.The writer was known as the \"queen of the Aga saga\" because her novels often focused on romance and intrigue in middle England, although she rejected the tag as \"patronising\".In a statement, her daughters Louise and Antonia said their \"beloved and inspirational mother\" had died \"peacefully at her Oxfordshire home\" on Thursday.Trollope's novels include The Rector's Wife, Marrying The Mistress, Second Honeymoon and Daughters in Law.Trollope's literary agent James Gill said in a statement: It is with great sadness that we learn of the passing of Joanna Trollope, one of our most cherished, acclaimed and widely enjoyed novelists. \"Joanna will be mourned by her children, grandchildren, family, her countless friends and - of course - her readers.\"Trollope's books have been translated into more than 25 languages, and several have been adapted for television.Joanna Prior, CEO of publisher Pan Macmillan, described Trollope as a \"treasured author\" who was \"much admired for her astute judgement, sharp wit, fun company and steely determination\".Getty ImagesTrollope was made a CBE in 2019 for services to literatureTrollope was a writer for more than five decades, and one of the best known novelists in the UK.She authored more than 20 contemporary novels including 2013's Sense & Sensibility, the lead title in HarperCollins's Austen Project.The author also wrote 10 historical novels, which were published under the pseudonym Caroline Harvey. Trollope occasionally wrote short stories and pieces for magazines, chaired book prizes, authored a 2006 study of women in the British Empire called Britannia's Daughters, and edited a 1993 anthology of rural life called The Country Habit.She received an OBE in 1996 for services to charity, and was made a CBE in 2019 for services to literature. Trollope was born in Gloucestershire, a fifth-generation niece of the English novelist Anthony Trollope.\"I'm not a direct descendant of his, although I'm from the same family, but another branch of it,\" she once told the Independent. \"I admire him hugely, and take several things he said about writing very much to heart.\"She read English at Oxford University and worked in the Foreign Office and as a teacher before becoming a full-time author in 1980.Her early novels were all written under her pseudonym until the release of her first contemporary novel, the Choir, in 1987. Several of her later novels were adapted for the screen, including A Village Affair, The Choir, Other People's Children and The Rector's Wife. She told the Writers Write website that she preferred to use pen and paper to write her novels. \"I love the silence and intimacy and simplicity. I can also, when it's going really well, write like the wind - 1,000 words an hour,\" she said.But the process of writing was \"extremely hard\".\"But then, I think anything worthwhile is inevitably going to be hard,\" she added. \"The most exciting moment for me is the penultimate chapter - the end is in sight, and clear, but the activity of the race isn't quite yet over.\"PA MediaTrollope pictured meeting Queen Elizabeth II in 2001The description of her books as \"Aga sagas\" caught on, despite only two of Trollope's novels actually featuring an Aga.She later admitted she was \"fairly tired of such an inaccurate and patronising tag\", describing it as a \"very unfortunate phrase\" that had \"done me a lot of damage\".The \"Aga saga\" tag is thought to have come from novelist Terence Blacker, but Trollope said: \"People who are rude about them don't take into account the amount of research I do, which is swotty and immense.\"The name itself indicates a provincial cosiness, and is patronising of the readers. A lot of what I write into the books is bleak and challenging but I will be the Queen of the Aga saga to my dying day. It's jolly annoying, but it is better than being the Queen of Hearts.\"Trollope's work tackled a range of topics from affairs, blended families and adoption, to parenting and marital breakdown.She also often wrote about remarriage, parenthood and the strains on the so-called \"sandwich generation\", caring for both their children and their parents.In The Soldier's Wife, she portrayed families struggling to cope with the aftermath of a harrowing Afghanistan tour.Fellow novelist Fay Weldon once said Trollope had \"a gift for putting her finger on the problem of the times\".Trollope said it was \"a great honour and an even bigger challenge\" to rework Austen's Sense & Sensibility in 2013.But she had previously said that comparisons of her own work with Austen's \"make me fidget\".\"There is a huge gulf between being great and being good. I know exactly which category I fall into and which she falls into,\" she told the Independent.\"On a good day, I might be good. I think of my writing as contemporary accessible fiction and it really isn't for me to add the qualifying adjectives.\"In a 1994 episode of Desert Island Discs, she again addressed criticisms that her books were trivial, responding: \"It is a grave mistake to think there is more significance in great things than in little things.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterEPAReform UK claims it is now the largest political party in Britain, following reports Labour has lost more members.According to the Times newspaper, internal figures show Labour's membership has fallen below 250,000.Reform said it had more than 268,000 paid-up members, which would mean it has overtaken Labour to become the biggest party by membership in the UK.Labour refused to comment on the accuracy of the membership figures in the Times, with a spokesperson saying they would be published in the party's annual report.There is no legal obligation for political parties to publish their membership figures, which are not verified by outside bodies.Reform tracks its membership figures using a live online counter, which the party said only included people who had paid an annual fee of £25 or £10 for under-25s.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"As we have suspected for some time, Reform has overtaken Labour to become the largest political party in British politics - a huge milestone on our journey to win the next election. \"The age of two-party politics is dead.\"The party has consistently been leading in national opinion polls since the spring.Labour's membership has been steadily falling since Sir Keir Starmer became leader in April 2020, according to the latest publicly available figures.The party's annual accounts published in August put the party's membership at 333,235 at the end of last year, down from a peak of more than 530,000 under Jeremy Corbyn.Despite the party's landslide election victory, it shed 37,000 members over the course of 2024 and reports suggest this trend has continued.In February, the LabourList website reported the party's membership had fallen to around 309,000 and the Times says the figure has now dropped below 250,000.A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Our membership figures are published in our annual report. We do not give a running a commentary on them throughout the year.\"The party's standard membership fee is £70.50 a year, with reduced rates of £35.50 or £12 available for certain groups.The Mainstream network, a new Labour campaign group which includes supporters of Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, said: \"To transform Britain and defeat the far-right, Labour needs a grassroots movement in every community.\"Our plummeting membership figures prove the top-down model has failed. The answer is to democratise, open up, and empower members.\"Meanwhile, the Green Party says it has seen a surge in membership since Zack Polanski took over as the party's new leader in September, rising from around 70,000 to more than 180,000.The Conservatives do not routinely publish their membership figures.Some 131,680 members were eligible to vote in last year's Tory leadership election but reports suggest the party's membership has fallen to around 123,000 since then.The number of Liberal Democrat members has also dropped, almost having over the last five years to around 60,000.Your Party - the new left-wing outfit founded by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana - says it has 55,000 paid-up members.",

    "description": "A nonprofit organisation tasked by the US Congress with helping preserve historic sites has sued the White House to stop construction on President Don",
    "body": "A nonprofit organisation tasked by the US Congress with helping preserve historic sites has sued the White House to stop construction on President Donald Trump's new ballroom.The National Trust for Historic Preservation filed the suit on Friday, arguing that the White House failed to seek necessary reviews before demolishing the historic East Wing in October.\"No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Joe Biden, and not anyone else,\" the lawsuit says.The White House has called the project a \"much needed and exquisite addition\".The lawsuit represents the first major legal challenge to the ballroom project. The organisation is asking a federal court in Washington DC to halt construction on the addition until the White House \"complies with the law by going through the legally mandated review processes\", including a public comment public period, according to a statement.\"The White House is arguably the most evocative building in our country and a globally recognized symbol of our powerful American ideals,\" said Carol Quillen, President of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit organisation  created in 1949 with a congressional charter.The group said it was \"compelled\" to go to court after the White House ignored  concerns it raised in October.In the lawsuit, the group argues that the White House broke the law by beginning construction without filing plans with the National Capital Planning Commission, by not seeking an environmental assessment of the project, and by declining to seek authorisation from Congress.It also alleges Trump is violating the US Constitution, \"which reserves to Congress the right to dispose of and make all rules regarding property belonging to the United States\".The White House said in a statement responding to the lawsuit on Friday that \"President Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House - just like all of his predecessors did.\"The East Wing was demolished in October to make way for Trump's multi-million dollar ballroom, which he says is being paid for by private donors. Since then, the proposed blueprint has expanded from a ballroom with a capacity of 500 people to a space that can fit 1,350 guests.The White House had pledged previously that its construction plan would be assessed by the National Capital Planning Commission before building began, but the lawsuit claims that the site is already undergoing extensive construction.The lawsuit describes the White House grounds as \"a bustling construction site, with dozens of workers driving piles, stockpiling materials, and amassing heavy machinery. \"Just last week, a towering construction crane was erected on the White House grounds, and President Trump recounted that work on the Ballroom Project was audible all night.\"Last week, the White House replaced the architect overseeing the project. The previous lead architect had reportedly clashed with Trump officials over the size and scope of the addition.On Thursday night, Trump, a former real estate developer, promised that the ballroom would be built before he leaves office in 2028.\"You know, for 150 years, they've been trying to do a ballroom,\" Trump said at the Congressional Ball.  \"They never got it up, but we got it off. In a very short period of time, like about a year and a half, you're going to have the best ballroom anywhere in the country.\"",

The move is legitimate under the national Retire and Rehire Scheme and will prevent her pension pot reducing. It matures after 30 years' service but reduces for each consecutive year of additional service. By enforcing a break, it will be frozen at its maximum amount.Figures from the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner North Wales show she was paid £169,598 for the 2023-2024 financial year.During the one-day break, Deputy Chief Constable Nigel Harrison will step into her role, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. According to the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner North Wales, there will be no disruption to the police force's day-to-day operations.Last year, the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, Craig Guildford, retired for a month using the same scheme to protect his pension.Police and Crime Commissioner Andy Dunbobbin has approved Ms Blakeman's request, subject to the approval of the Police and Crime Panel.\"I have agreed to put forward Chief Constable Blakeman's request to enter into the national Retire and Rehire Scheme,\" he said.\"The widely-used scheme is in accordance with updated guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council, the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, and the College of Policing.\"It is important to emphasise that this will come at no cost to the taxpayer and there will be no break in leadership at the head of North Wales Police.\"He added: \"Chief Constable Blakeman and I, alongside all the chief officers of North Wales Police, remain as committed as ever to ensuring that our region is the safest and most secure place in the United Kingdom.\"",

    "body": "Britain's Kate Waugh came through a three-way battle to win the T100 Triathlon World Championship final in Qatar.It sealed a first ever world title in the sport for the 26-year-old.Waugh had been top of the standings heading into event and finished clear of rivals Julie Derron of Switzerland and fellow Briton Lucy Charles-Barclay, who came third and fifth respectively.Derron had started the day just six points behind Waugh, with Charles-Barclay a further three points back, but neither could match Waugh's pace in the closing stages as she pulled in front.However, the Gateshead-born triathlete was exhausted towards the end of the run and had to walk the final stretch before she collapsed to her knees.\"I've always been a bit of a drama queen, so perhaps that was the best way to win it I guess,\" said Waugh, whose final points tally of 183 was 20 more than Derron with Charles-Barclay on 152.\"I'm completely overwhelmed with emotion right now. I do not want to see those finish line photos. That was the most dramatic way to win the world title.\"Waugh finished in three hours 31.30 seconds after the swim, cycle and run - 20 seconds clear of fellow Briton, Georgia Taylor-Brown, who came second in Friday's race and seventh in the overall standings.She added: \"Going on to the last lap I felt the floor starting to tilt a bit and I was like, 'Oh, I'm in trouble now'. \"I just held it together and then Georgia was putting me under pressure and I luckily just got across the line.\"Success capped a remarkable debut season at the 100-kilometre distance for Waugh, who won her first T100 race in Singapore and finished on the podium in all six of her appearances.She had moved up to the longer distance - the T100 is almost twice the Olympic triathlon distance of 51.5 km - for a fresh start after her disappointing 15th-placed finish at Paris 2024. T100 races consist of a 2km swim, 80km bike ride and 18km run, with the tour including eight global stops. An athlete's best four results, plus their finish in the final, determined the overall standings.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAndré Rhoden-PaulAFP via Getty ImagesIranian security forces have \"violently arrested\" Nobel Peace Prize winner and women's rights activist Narges Mohammadi, her foundation has said. The Narges Foundation said Ms Mohammadi, 53, was detained in the eastern city of Mashhad, along with other activists. The Nobel Committee said it was \"deeply concerned by today's brutal arrest of Narges Mohammadi\" and called on the authorities \"to immediately clarify Mohammadi's whereabouts, ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions\". Iran does not appear to have commented.  Ms Mohammadi was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights. In December 2024, she was given a temporary release from jail for three weeks on medical grounds, after being held in Tehran's notorious Evin prison since 2021. She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences. Her latest arrest reportedly came as she attended a memorial ceremony for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer found dead in his office last week. Norway-based group Iran Human Rights had called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances around his death were \"suspicious\". Several other activists were detained at the ceremony, where it's reported they shouted slogans, including \"death to the dictator\" and \"long live Iran\". Taghi Rahmani, Ms Mohammadi's husband, told BBC Persian: \"They arrested Narges violently. The brother of the lawyer witnessed her arrest at the memorial.\"This act is against human rights laws, and amounts to some kind of revenge. \"This happened in Mashhad today and is concerning because the establishment's crackdown has intensified recently.\"Ms Mohammadi had recently accused the Iranian authorities of intensifying repression since the June ceasefire with Israel. Last week she wrote an article for Time magazine about the Iranian state controlling all aspects of personal or public life. \"Their peace is disrupted by surveillance, censorship, arbitrary arrest, torture, and the constant threat of violence,\" she said. She had also told the Nobel Committee she had received warnings from \"agents of the regime\" through indirect channels and her lawyers. \"The threats conveyed to Ms Mohammadi make it clear that her security is at stake, unless she commits to end all public engagement within Iran, as well as any international advocacy or media appearances in support of democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression,\" the Nobel committee's statement added.Over the past year, she has continued to remain defiant, refusing to wear the mandatory headscarf and meeting fellow activists across the country.Across her lifetime, Mohammadi has been arrested 13 times and been sentenced to more 36 years imprisonment and 154 lashes, according to her foundation.

    "body": "53 minutes agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondent Angry French farmers are calling for more protests over the government-backed slaughter of cattle herds affected by so-called Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD).On Thursday there were clashes between riot police and demonstrators in the southern Ariège department, after vets were called in to destroy potentially contaminated cattle at a farm.Elsewhere in the south, farmers have dumped manure outside government buildings and blocked roads. The offices of several environmentalist groups were ransacked in the Charente-Maritime department.LSD is a highly contagious bovine disease which is transmitted mainly by fly-bites.  The symptoms are fever, mucal discharge and nodules on the skin.Though mainly non-fatal, it can badly affect milk-production and the cows are unsaleable. The disease arrived in Europe from Africa about ten years ago. France's first outbreak was in the Alps in June, when an infected herd forced the Tour de France cycle race to cut short one of its stages.The government's policy of slaughtering entire herds where a single animal has been infected has run up against bitter opposition from two of the three main farmers' unions.Conféderation Rurale and Conféderation Paysanne say the policy is being brutally applied, and is in any case unnecessary because a combination of selective culling and vaccination would suffice.But most vets disagree. \"Right now we are unable to tell the difference between a healthy animal and a symptomless animal carrying the virus. That is the only reason we have to carry out these whole-herd slaughters,\" said Stephanie Philizot who heads the SNGTV vets' union.Since June there have been around 110 outbreaks of LSD in France, originally in the east but now increasingly in the south-west. Ministry officials blame the illegal movement of cattle from affected zones. Around 3,000 animals have been slaughtered.The French government is worried the protests could snowball into a wider movement among a farming population that feels itself under growing threat from the imposition of EU norms and competition from abroad.A big protest is planned in Brussels next week during the summit of EU leaders.  Several French farming sectors are in deep crisis, from wine-growers hit by falling consumption to poultry farmers hit by avian flu.There is also widespread opposition to the impending signature of an EU free-trade agreement with South American countries, which farmers fear will open France to more cheap food imports, much of it produced under looser environmental and sanitary constraints.",

    "body": "6 hours agoMatt MurphyBBC Verify    BBCA Sudanese paramilitary commander, whose role in the el-Fasher massacre was revealed by BBC Verify, has been sanctioned by the UK government.Brig Gen Al-Fateh Abdullah Idris, also known as Abu Lulu, was filmed shooting dead at least 10 unarmed captives after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the city in late October.Thousands of people are believed to have been killed by the RSF after the army withdrew from el-Fasher. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the atrocities taking place in Sudan were \"a scar on the conscience of the world\" which \"cannot, and will not, go unpunished.\"The UK has also sanctioned three other RSF commanders, including deputy head Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo.Dagalo, who was also placed under EU sanctions in November, was shown in verified footage touring an army base in the city in the hours after el-Fasher fell. He is the brother of RSF chief Mohamed \"Hemedti\" Dagalo.Sudan's civil war - sparked after the RSF and the military's fragile ruling coalition collapsed - has now raged for more than two years, killing hundreds of thousands of people and displacing millions more.El-Fasher was the army's last major foothold in Darfur, the traditional stronghold of the RSF paramilitary.An investigation by BBC Verify revealed the brutal tactics used by the RSF during the protracted siege, which included detaining and torturing people trying to smuggle supplies into the city and building a massive sand barrier around it to prevent civilians and army troops from escaping.In its statement announcing the sanctions, the UK foreign office said it believed that Abu Lulu was \"responsible for violence against individuals based on ethnicity and religion, and the deliberate targeting of civilians\".Footage confirmed by BBC Verify in October showed Abu Lulu executing several unarmed captives with an AK-style rifle in a sandy, dusty area north-west of the city. RSF troops who witnessed the incidents were later seen celebrating their commander's actions.UK officials accused Abu Lulu, Dagalo, Gedo Hamdan Ahmed and Tijani Ibrahim Moussa Mohamed of carrying out \"heinous\" acts of violence, including mass killings, systematic sexual violence and deliberate attacks on civilians. The men have been placed under travel bans and any assets they hold will be frozen.\"Today's sanctions against RSF commanders strike directly at those with blood on their hands, while our strengthened aid package will deliver lifesaving support to those suffering,\" Cooper said.Citing satellite images - previously published by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab - the foreign office said piles of bodies and mass graves could be seen in el-Fasher after the massacre.Cooper also pledged an additional £21m to provide food, shelter and health services for civilians impacted by fighting in remote areas.In the days that followed the el-Fasher massacre, RSF leader Gen Mohamed \"Hemedti\" Dagalo admitted that his troops had committed \"violations\" and said the incidents would be investigated.Among those arrested was Abu Lulu. In a carefully choreographed and edited video posted on the RSF's official Telegram account he is shown being led into a cell at a prison, which was geolocated by BBC Verify to the outskirts of el-Fasher.The commander, who previously featured heavily in propaganda videos posted online, has not been seen since his arrest. A TikTok account that documented his activities was removed by the company in October after BBC Verify approached the tech giant for comment.The UK's move comes just two days after the US announced its own set of sanctions against a network of companies and individuals it accused of recruiting former Colombian soldiers and training individuals to fight in Sudan's civil war.The US Treasury Department said that hundreds of Colombian mercenaries have travelled to Sudan since 2024, including to serve as infantry and drone pilots for the RSF.Last month, US President Donald Trump pledged to \"start working on Sudan\" alongside Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, posting on social media that \"tremendous atrocities\" were taking place.",

    "body": "3 hours agoCachella SmithandDaniel Sandford,UK correspondentEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockNet migration to the UK fell by two-thirds in the year ending June 2025 compared with the previous 12 months, provisional figures indicate.The difference between the number of people arriving in the country and those leaving was 204,000, down from 649,000, with the fall mainly driven by fewer arrivals for work and study reasons, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.It comes as Home Office figures show the number of people who claimed asylum in the year to September 2025 reached a record high of 110,051.The figures also show the number of asylum seekers in hotels as of September rose by 2% compared with the same time last year.The statistics form part of two separate releases published on Thursday - the ONS release on net migration to the year ending June 2025, and Home Office figures on the immigration system for the year ending September 2025.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told GB News that the fall in net migration is a \"step in the right direction\".This is the first set of ONS statistics on migration that covers nearly all of Labour's first year in government.The Home Office numbers show initial decisions on asylum claims have increased to 133,502 people receiving an initial decision across the year - almost half of which (45%) were granted.\"Decision making has reached a historically high level and the numbers of cases awaiting an initial decision fell 36% between September 2024 and September 2025, despite a record high number of asylum claims in this period,\" the release said.The backlog of those waiting for a first decision has been declining steadily across the year, but there has been a growing backlog of appeals.The government has committed to end the use of asylum hotels by the end of this parliament.More than 36,000 people were being temporarily housed in hotels in September, Thursday's figures show.This is up 13% on the last three months, but due to fluctuation over the last year represents a smaller increase - of 2% -  from September 2024.It is lower than the peak of 56,018 people in hotels at the end of September 2023.It follows legal battles over the use of hotels with Epping Forest District Council saying earlier this week they would appeal against a High Court decision that rejected its case to close Epping's Bell Hotel to asylum seekers.Responding to Thursday's statistics, a Home Office spokesperson said there were fewer than 200 hotels in use as they vowed \"to close every single one\".\"We are furious at the levels of illegal migrants and asylum hotels.\"Work is well under way to move illegal migrants into military bases to ease pressure on communities across the country.\"Small boat arrivals saw an increase of 53% compared with the previous year, with 45,659 arriving via this route in the 12 months to September 2025. The Home Office release sets out that this figure is close to the 2022 peak which was 45,774.\"The increase in arrivals in 2025 has coincided with an increase in the average number of people arriving per small boat,\" it added.Some 5,151 children (under 18s) crossed the Channel in small boats and claimed asylum in this time period - 2,700 of whom were accompanied.The prime minister's spokesperson said the government \"accepts that the number of small boat crossings is too high\".Separately, 153 migrants have been removed from the UK to France under the pilot \"one in one out\" scheme.A return flight today included the individual who was removed on 16 October and returned to the UK via small boat on 8 November (he has not been counted twice).A total of 134 people have been brought to the UK through this scheme.The figures released by the ONS, on net migration, take into account those who are claiming asylum in the UK after having entered via both regular and irregular routes - as well as other forms of immigration. They relate to people who have changed their place of residence for a period of 12 months or more.The overall figure saw a dramatic fall to June 2025, and comes alongside a drop of approximately 70% in arrivals of non-EU+ nationals on work and study dependent  visas. (EU+ refers to people from EU countries plus Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.)Responding to the net migration figures, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the government would be \"going further\" as she referenced the pressure of migration on local communities.\"Net migration is at its lowest level in half a decade and has fallen by more than two-thirds under this government,\" she said in a statement.\"Last week, I announced reforms to our migration system to ensure that those who come here must contribute and put in more than they take out.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp, reacting to the figures, said the fall had been driven by Conservative reforms \"but we need to go much further\".Meanwhile, Reform UK's head of policy Zia Yusuf said there is \"no better example of Labour's warped priorities than today's migration figures\".Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson, Max Wilkinson, said the figures show the government needs to \"get a grip on small boat arrivals and the use of asylum hotels\".Earlier this month, Mahmood set out proposals to reform the legal migration system including changes to how long it could take some migrants to achieve settled status. It followed a variety of measures to tackle illegal migration such as changing how the right to family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is applied in migration court cases.Migration experts have indicated the net migration numbers - which cover the year ending June 2025 - could reflect measures brought in by the Conservatives such as the increase in salary threshold which was introduced in June 2024.Senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, Peter Walsh, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"For the most complete and accurate picture, it takes at least a year for policy changes to show up in the statistics.\"That's the definition of a long-term international migrant (someone who changes their usual country of residence for at least one year).\"Additional reporting by Robert Cuffe, head of statistics",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liverpool have lost three successive games by a margin of three goals for the first time since December 1953ByEmily SalleyBBC Sport journalistIt would have seemed unthinkable six months ago, but Arne Slot's position as Liverpool manager is starting to come under question.A humiliating 4-1 defeat by PSV Eindhoven at Anfield on Wednesday was the Reds' ninth loss in 12 games - their worst run in 71 years.The Dutchman guided Liverpool to their 20th league title in May and spent almost £450m on new talent in the summer, including a British record £125m for Alexander Isak.However, as December approaches the Reds are 12th in the Premier League and 13th in the 36-team league phase of the Champions League.Liverpool are \"not a sacking club\", according to former defender Jamie Carragher - but how much time will Slot be given to turn things around?'I would be gutted if they sack him' The 3-0 defeat by Nottingham Forest at home on Saturday was bad but the loss against PSV was arguably the low point of Liverpool's season. \"Liverpool seem to keep finding ways to hit new lows under Arne Slot, and of course, that is leading to questions around the manager's future,\" Josh Sexton of Liverpool fan group the Anfield Wrap told BBC Sport.\"He will accept that as part of the pressure that comes with such a reputable job, but now the biggest question has become 'is he the right man to actually rescue a team from such a slump?'\"Slot faced the unenviable task of replacing Jurgen Klopp in 2024 but defied expectations by winning the title at a canter last term.That has earned the Dutchman significant credit among Liverpool's fanbase. There is also sympathy for Slot after a tumultuous summer that saw the exits of key players including Trent Alexander-Arnold and Luis Diaz, an influx of new signings and the death of Portugal attacker Diogo Jota.  \"I do not mind giving him the chance to have a go [at fixing this],\" Sexton said.\"I just think, given what he achieved in such a short space of time and how that had this team so far ahead of their timeline, his bosses should keep the faith that he can get back on that road - back to where we belong.\"Liverpool cruised to the league title in Slot's first season in charge, finishing 10 points clear of second-placed Arsenal.\"If they were to sack him, I would be gutted that the man who brought me such brilliant days watching my team lift the league title last season could not work it out, but I would equally understand and try to trust the decision that had been taken,\" Sexton added.\"I would hold reservations about the people sacking him being the same ones involved in the decision-making that led to such an imbalanced squad as it is at present. \"But if I did not trust the process, there would be no point in any of this, really, would there?\"'I am feeling safe'Speaking after the PSV defeat, Slot said his job was not under threat but he did understand why there was growing noise about his position. \"I am feeling safe, I am OK, I have got a lot of support from above,\" he said. \"It would be nice to turn it around and get a victory of course but if you are working as a coach and not doing well then it is normal that questions are asked. \"I am OK with my position. It is not the first time I've been in a difficult position but it is about time that we turned it around.\"Liverpool's next three fixtures offer Slot a promising opportunity to right the ship, starting with a trip to 17th-placed West Ham on Sunday before matches against promoted sides Sunderland and Leeds.Asked about his conversations with the Liverpool hierarchy, Slot added: \"We talk a lot. They are helpful to the team and to me and we have those conversations but they don't call me every single minute of the day to say they trust me. \"In the normal conversations we have I feel the trust. But I haven't spoken to them after this game yet so let's see.\"'It gets to a stage where it's untenable'Media caption, Liverpool 'lack of intensity' exposed by PSVFormer Reds defender Carragher, who made 736 appearances for the club, said he was frustrated with Liverpool's players.\"I have always been in the camp that you stick with the manager... I'm angry with the players, if I'm totally honest,\" Carragher said on CBS Sports.In the past, Liverpool have tended to show patience with their managers rather than sacking them at the first sign of trouble.\"Liverpool's not a sacking club,\" Carragher added. \"Liverpool are different from almost every club in European football - the manager is the king, the manager gets time.\"But it does get to a stage for any manager at a club where it's untenable. It can't go on any longer.\"I'm not quite there yet, but I know others are.\"'Slot looks out of his depth' - Liverpool fan viewsSean: Arne Slot won the league with Jurgen Klopp's side. He ripped it apart in the summer and look where we are now. They look clueless. He has to go, I'm afraid.Mark: Getting silly now. I have no idea where this ends. Slot's got to have until Christmas, but if things don't improve soon then I can't see him being in a job in 2026. The players' confidence has just evaporated.Graham: Stunned to be honest. Another early goal and Liverpool seem to just give up. I have never seen a team make so little effort in a match bar a couple of players. If Liverpool aren't careful, we could be headed for relegation this season. Absolutely shocked.Jan: Woeful. Disorganised. No plan. How much more time will be given to a manager who is lacking any idea on what to do? The players should hang their heads in shame - Dominik Szoboszlai and Hugo Ekitike are honourable exceptions. A dreadful game once more.Paul: No fight and players out of position. The buck stops with Slot and his coaching staff. Same mistakes week in week out. Don't like to see managers get sacked but he looks out of his depth. Need to change it now!Chris: A decade of solid development destroyed in 12 games. Motivation has gone and it is not down to the new players as it's almost every aspect of the team. Dominik Szoboszlai is the standout player and he is out of position. What is going on? Where are the leaders? Where is the effort? Where is the soul? We are very much walking alone.Colin: We only looked good playing fast and direct. Slot's plodding possession game doesn't work for us, especially with our poor defence.",

    "body": "Track UK's latest migration numbers - including asylum, visas and small boats6 hours agoBBCNet migration to the UK - the number of people arriving, minus those leaving - has fallen close to pre-Covid levels, according to official figures published on Thursday.How does that sit alongside other key migration measures, including overall immigration, small boat arrivals and visas granted? Scroll down to find out more about the latest key figures, and get answers to key questions on a range of topics.Produced by: Rob England, Libby Rogers, Jess Carr, John Walton, Becky Dale, Allison Shultes, Chris Kay, Steven Connor and Scott Jarvis. Graphics by: Jez Frazer and Zoe BartholomewAbout the data*The figure for net migration will not sum exactly to the total of immigration minus emigration, because it is published as a rounded figure by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Figures from government or other official sources used in this report can be revised retrospectively between publications. This page only displays data as it is presented in the latest release.ONS figures for immigration and emigration are update twice per year.Small boats figures from the Home Office are updated daily. Asylum, returns and visa figures from the Home Office are updated every three months. The number of people appealing against a refused asylum decision is updated every three months by the Ministry of Justice at a different time to other government figures on asylum. Immigration, emigration and net migrationFigures for net migration come from the ONS and use the internationally recognised definition of a long-term migrant: \"a person who moves to a country other than that of their usual residence for at least a year.\"Visas for legal migrationData for total entries via visas only includes those granted. It does not include people coming to the UK on a visitor visa or those on a transit visa - whose final destination is not the UK.Visa figures do not show if or when an individual arrived in the UK, but marks the point at which they were granted permission to do so.If someone was granted more than one visa within the year shown, each one is counted separately.The work category refers to new individuals linked to visas and permits, or the extension of an existing permission. This includes sub-categories such as seasonal, health and care, domestic and youth mobility visas.Study visas include all sponsored individuals by approved education providers in the UK, and those on short-term study visas.Family visas lets someone come to the UK or stay longer so they can live with close family members who are already here. It includes joining a spouse, partner, child or parent, or coming to care for a relative.The Other category refers to miscellaneous visas outside the categories of work, family and study. It includes humanitarian routes such as the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme and the British National Overseas route.It also includes family permits for people from countries in the European Union or European Economic Area.Asylum applications and hotelsFigures for asylum seekers in hotels are published by the Home Office under the \"contingency accommodation - hotel\" category.The number of people in all other forms of accommodation includes those in non-hotel contingency accommodation, plus initial, dispersal and \"other\" accommodation.A scale is used to determine how close a local authority is from the average share of the population for an area in the UK. It compares the share in that area to the share across all areas in the UK that use that form of accommodation.Less than half = more than 50% below the average share of the populationLower than = between 25% to 50% below the average share of the population About the same as = within 25% of the average share of the populationHigher than = between 25% to 100% above the average share of the populationMore than double = more than 100% above the average share of the populationFigures on the backlog of people waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application include both applicants and dependants.The number of open appeals against refused asylum applications refers to individuals.Small boat crossings and other illegal arrivalsThe figures for small boat crossings and the average number of people per boat are derived from the UK Home Office's daily timeseries.Entering the UK without permission is an offence under immigration law, but asylum seekers are generally not prosecuted for doing so if they claim asylum on arrival. In some cases, people have been prosecuted for entering the UK without permission alongside other offences, such as people smuggling or re-entering after deportation.The International Organization for Migration (IOM) collects figures for people who died or went missing while crossing from mainland Europe to the UK.These reports are based on  French and UK officials (such as police or coastguard) or media sources, and are considered an undercount by the IOM due to a lack of official statistics.The figures can include people who died in the Channel while crossing, but also those who died at any point while en route to a crossing point.Data for modern slavery only includes final decisions. Modern slavery includes any form of human trafficking, slavery, servitude or forced labour.Figures for other entries without permission are the sum of all irregular arrivals that were not by small boat, including inadequately documented air arrivals, recorded detections at UK ports and other recorded detections in the UK.Returns and deportations from the UKFigures on people who come to the UK but are denied entry at that point and then leave the country are not included in the number of returns in this page.People being returned after being convicted of a criminal offence includes people who are not British citizens who have been convicted in the UK of any criminal offence, or convicted abroad for a serious criminal offence.Returns involving the government include the Home Office categories of enforced returns (also known as deportations) as well as assisted and controlled voluntary returns.Independent returns are referred to by the government as other verified returns.UK migration compared with other countriesSea arrivals figures are taken from the UNHCR European sea arrivals dashboard and combined with UK Home Office figures for small boat arrivals.Asylum applications, immigration and emigration figures for European countries is the latest available data from Eurostat for the following countries:Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Norway, Switzerland and Croatia.Population figures for the UK are from ONS, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency 2024 mid-year estimates, and for Europe from Eurostat data as of 1 January 2024.In order to account for smaller populations and make European data comparable with the UK, when calculating figures for net migration and asylum applications, European countries with a population of less than one million have been excluded.Additionally, when calculating net migration, only countries which include asylum seekers or refugees in their immigration figures are included, these are:Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoJamie Taylor hurled three molotov cocktails outside Livingston police stationA former solider has admitted endangering a police officer's life in a petrol bomb attack at a police station.Jamie Taylor, 34, hurled three molotov cocktails at police vans parked outside the building in Livingston, West Lothian, on 30 May 2025.The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Taylor, from Bo'ness, had told his mother \"he was going to blow up Livingston Police station\".CCTV footage showed the bombs burst on the ground, with one narrowly missing PC Kirsty Forsyth who ran outside to tackle the flames with a fire extinguisher.The court heard that Taylor had eight previous convictions and was staying temporarily with his mother at the time of the incident.Prosecutor Wojciech Jajdelski said that on the day of the attack, Taylor had phoned her to say he had a \"bag full of vodka bottles filled with petrol\".Police ScotlandJamie Taylor claimed he was going to \"blow up\" the police stationCCTV cameras near the police station captured the moment a hooded Taylor started throwing the petrol bombs.The court saw footage of PC Forsyth come out of the station with a fire extinguisher. Taylor's third petrol bomb burst at her feet before she ran from the scene.PC Forsyth's colleagues chased Taylor who was caught a short while later nearby.The court heard he was found lying on the ground next to a bush smelling strongly of fuel.Defence solicitor advocate Iain McSporran KC said his client had serious mental health issues which were partly associated with his former army career.Mr McSporran also praised PC Forsyth's actions.He added: \"She seemed to remain extremely cool in the circumstances.\"'Clearly dangerous'Taylor pleaded guilty to breaching the 1883 Explosives Act and of \"culpably and recklessly\" throwing a petrol bomb at PC Kirsty Forsyth.Judge Lady Ross said: \"This was clearly a dangerous thing to do.\"Police Scotland inspector Lindsey McIntyre said it was a \"totally reckless act\" that endangered the lives of all officers and staff in the station.She said: \"Thankfully, no one was injured, but the outcome of the incident could have been far worse.\"Every officer has the fundamental right to come home from each shift unharmed, and no one should be targeted in this way.\"Taylor will be sentenced at the High Court in Stirling in January.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal correspondentIrish author Sally Rooney has told the High Court it is \"almost certain\" she cannot publish new novels in the UK and may have to withdraw her current books because of the banning of Palestine Action under terrorism laws.Rooney says UK legislation may mean she cannot be paid royalties by her British publisher or the BBC because it could leave both at risk of being accused of funding terrorism.In August she said she intended to use royalties \"to go on supporting Palestine Action.\"The group was banned in July after the home secretary accused it of causing serious damage to property. Its co-founder is challenging that ban in the High Court, arguing it interferes with the right to protest.The author of Normal People, which was adapted into one of the most watched BBC dramas of recent years, has supported the campaign to reverse the ban.In two witness statements provided to the High Court, Rooney said she believed that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza - and Palestine Action's activity in the UK was from a \"long and proud tradition of civil disobedience - the deliberate breaking of laws as an act of protest.\"She goes on: \"I myself have publicly advocated the use of direct action, including property sabotage, in the cause of climate justice. It stands to reason that I should support the same range of tactics in the effort to prevent genocide.\"Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence.Rooney said the ban on Palestine Action under terrorism laws also had far reaching consequences for her as an author and her right to free expression.She explained she periodically receives royalties from the BBC's adaptions.In August she declared in an Irish Times article that she intended to use those royalties \"to go on supporting Palestine Action.\"Following that statement, she said she had been advised that any such payment to her for those televised dramatisations could be a breach of terrorism laws.That warning had come from the independent producer of the two BBC dramatisations of her novels. It told her agent that it had received \"unambiguous legal advice\" that if it knew or suspected that Rooney was using royalties from the TV dramas to fund Palestine Action, then sending her the money would be a terrorism offence.\"It is therefore unclear whether any UK company can continue to make payments to me, even when it had agreed to do so,\" said Rooney.Rooney told the court that this legal uncertainty affected her rights as an artist - and her publisher's too.\"If ... Faber & Faber Limited are legally prohibited from paying me the royalties I am owed, my existing works may have to be withdrawn from sale,\" she said.\"My novels have been influential and popular in Britain, where I am among the best-selling literary authors of the last decade.\"The disappearance of my work from bookshops would mark a truly extreme incursion by the state into the realm of artistic expression.\"It is also almost certain that I can no longer publish or produce any new work within the UK while this proscription remains in effect.\"Rooney publicly revealed in September that she did not believe she could travel to the UK anymore because of her stance.\"I am and will continue to be a committed supporter of Palestine Action. If that support is criminalised, I will effectively be prevented from speaking at any future public events in the UK.\"Is it likely that I could ever again collaborate with British public institutions like the BBC as I have done in the past?\"The hearing continues through Thursday with a final day of submissions next week.",

    "body": "A woman has died and a man has been seriously injured after they were attacked by a shark while swimming at a remote beach in the Australian state of New South Wales.Police said the woman, believed to be aged in her 20s, died at the scene, while the man, also believed to be in his 20s, was airlifted to a hospital in Newcastle in critical condition. Paramedics had been called to Kylies Beach, in Crowdy Bay National Park about 300km north of Sydney, early on Thursday morning local time, police said. Authorities praised a bystander who put a makeshift tourniquet on the man's leg before the paramedics arrived, which \"potentially saved his life\".\"The courage from some bystanders is amazing in this situation,\" NSW Ambulance Superintendent Josh Smyth told reporters.\"To put yourself out there is heroic and obviously it did give us time to get to that male patient.\"The shark involved was likely a \"large bull shark\", the Department of Primary Industries said. Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are \"one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people\", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.The beach has now been closed and \"smart\" drumlines - which lure sharks with baited hooks so they can be tagged and re-released - were being deployed.Surf Life Saving NSW said surrounding beaches would also be closed for 24 hours while drones surveilled the area.\"This is a terrible tragedy and our deepest condolences go to the families of the woman and man involved,\" Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steve Pearce said.\"For now, please remain clear of the water at beaches in the vicinity and follow the direction of lifeguards.\"This is the fifth fatal shark attack in Australia this year. The most recent was less than three months ago, when a man was killed in a rare shark attack in Sydney's northern beaches.",

    "body": "2 hours agoEd Thomas,UK editor,Patrick ClahaneandRebecca WearnWatch: BBC joins officers on criminal network raidsThree men have been arrested in dawn raids following a BBC News investigation into organised crime gangs operating on the High Street.Two Iranian men aged 32 and 28 were arrested after immigration officers targeted multiple addresses in Birmingham and the West Midlands. The Home Office said the third man was a naturalised British citizen aged 43.They are being held on suspicion of facilitating illegal entry to the UK and facilitating illegal working.Earlier this month, the BBC found more than 100 mini-marts, car washes and barber shops operating from Dundee to south Devon, were linked to a crime network.Andy Radcliffe, Assistant Director from Immigration Enforcement, is leading an investigation into the BBC's allegations involving HMRC, the National Crime Agency, Companies House, police forces and Trading Standards.An investigation was \"immediately launched\" after the BBC's report, he said, with teams building \"an intelligence picture in the matter of a few weeks\".Mr Radcliffe added this was just the start of the investigation \"to try and tackle the widespread abuse\".\"We're taking this very seriously...people could go to prison for this, we could take assets off them, so we're taking it very seriously,\" he said.Earlier this month, the BBC revealed evidence of criminal networks organising and profiting from undocumented working in barber shops, mini-marts and carwashes across the UK.The Home Office launched an \"urgent investigation\" involving police forces across the country after the BBC uncovered more than 100 businesses linked to a suspected Kurdish crime network enabling migrants to work illegally and sell counterfeit cigarettes in High Street mini-marts.The BBC investigation found an asylum seeker, who says his claim was rejected, trying to sell a mini-mart for £18,000 cash.Undercover reporters also exposed a man at the centre of an immigration crime group who said he had \"customers in every city\" and could wipe illegal working fines worth up to £60,000.Loose regulation of Britain's labour market is acting as a pull factor for those entering the UK illegally, the government has acknowledged.The Home Office launched an \"urgent investigation\" involving police forces across the country after the BBC reportHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood said these kinds of criminal networks \"create an incentive for people to come here illegally\".Questioned by the BBC, last week, on whether the government has lost control of High Streets to Kurdish organised crime gangs, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"What your reporters were able to scrutinise and show is absolutely evidence of why our system is broken.\"It's why this government has been cracking down on illegal working.\"In the Budget, the chancellor announced funding for 45 new Trading Standards officers.Rachel Reeves said the government would be undertaking \"additional enforcement activity on High Streets, focusing on illicit tobacco and vaping products\", which would involve deploying 350 newly-recruited criminal investigators part of the fraud investigation team.Minister for Migration and Citizenship Mike Tapp praised the BBC investigation and its reporting saying \"really it shows the value of the BBC\".On a government level, he said: \"We said we take it seriously and we have and we are.\"I hate what these, you know, hairdressers, nail bars and dodgy vape shops are doing to, so many of our high streets, not just for the look and feel of them, but also for those genuine businesses that are being undercut. So it's really important that we continue to work hard to combat this.\"Additional reporting by Phill Edwards",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has doubled down on his core demands for ending the war in Ukraine, stating that Russia will lay down arms only if Kyiv's troops withdraw from territory claimed by Moscow.Putin has long pushed for legal recognition of the Ukrainian territories Russia has seized by force.They include the Crimean peninsula, which it illegally annexed in 2014, and the Donbas, made up of Luhansk and Donetsk, which Moscow now occupies for the most part.For Kyiv, which has ruled out relinquishing the parts of the Donbas it still holds, rewarding Russia for its aggression is a non-starter.Speaking to reporters during a trip to Kyrgyzstan, Putin accused Kyiv of wanting to fight \"to the last Ukrainian\" - which he said Russia was \"in principle\" also ready to do. He repeated his view that Russia has the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from the embattled territories.\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" he said.Yet Russia's slow gains in eastern Ukraine have come at significant cost of manpower. According to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, at this rate it would take Moscow almost two more years to seize the rest of the Donetsk region. Thursday's remarks were the first time that Putin addressed the hectic diplomatic moves of the last week, which saw the US and Ukraine hold intense discussions over a peace plan reportedly drafted in October by American and Russian officials.The plan, which was heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, was subsequently revised. However, it is thought it does not address the issue of the occupied territories which - alongside security guarantees for Ukraine - is the biggest sticking point between Moscow and Kyiv.Putin said that new draft plan has now been shown to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.However, he added it was \"absolutely necessary\" to discuss \"certain specific points that need to be put in diplomatic language\".Asked about the possibility of Crimea and the Donbas being recognised as under Russian de facto control but not legally, Putin said: \"This is the point of our discussion with our American counterparts\".A US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week, he confirmed. US President Donald Trump told reporters that Witkoff may be joined in Moscow by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.Meanwhile, Ukraine's top presidential aide Andriy Yermak said that US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is due to visit Kyiv later in the week.On Wednesday Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement\" between Russia and Ukraine – indicating that any meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss these points was contingent on a peace deal being agreed upon.During his comments to reporters Putin again expressed his contempt for the Ukrainian leadership, which he said he considered illegitimate. There was therefore \"no use\" signing any documents with them, he added.Ukraine has been under martial law since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and has therefore been unable to hold scheduled elections. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament voted unanimously to affirm the legitimacy of President Zelensky, whose term in office ended in the spring. Putin also dismissed warnings by European leaders that Russia could attack the European continent within the next decades.\"That sounds laughable to us, really,\" he said.The White House and Donald Trump have sounded optimistic about the recent diplomatic push for peace talks, but Europeans have repeatedly expressed their scepticism over whether Putin truly intended to end the war. On Wednesday European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Russia of upholding a post-World War Two mindset and of seeing the European continent as a \"sphere of influence\" in which sovereign nations could be \"carved up\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editorGetty ImagesNot a single measure in the government's policy-packed Budget will change the growth forecast for the next five years - that was the damning assessment of the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Reponsibility (OBR).For a government that has declared economic growth as its top priority it is surely a disappointment.Worse than that, although the OBR upgraded its growth forecast for this year – it downgraded them every year thereafter till 2030.Although businesses were relieved they didn't get clobbered the way they did at the last Budget - at which they were handed a £25bn employer national insurance hike – genuinely significant pro-business measures were thin on the ground.Little wonder many business leaders are asking: \"Where is the growth?\"Even the sectors that did get a mention as receiving special help – such as High Street retailers and hospitality – insist their costs of doing business are going to rise significantly through higher business rates and labour costs.Business rates are a tax on non-domestic properties such as shops, pubs and offices.The government said it would calculate business rates for 750,000 High Street retail and hospitality firms using a lower percentage of the rateable value of premises, but this lower tax rate wasn't as generous as expected.At the same time, many firms have seen their rateable value increase and face the phasing out of a Covid-era 40% discount from April. The net result is that, despite some transitional relief, lots of them will see significant increases in their business rates bill.An 8.5% pay rise for 18-20 year olds on the national living wage is good news for young people in work and an incentive for those who aren't to find a job, but on top of 16.3% rise for the same group last year, it may put employers off taking on new people.As one FTSE 100 boss told the BBC: \"They are hurting the very people they are trying to help and it will mean fewer jobs, fewer hours, fewer premises, lower growth.\"The cap on salary sacrifice arrangement will hit both workers and businesses, who may reduce future pension contributions, pay rises or investment in growing their business.Budget 2025One measure that got little attention but could prove important is expanding schemes that give tax breaks for investors in young companies – the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trusts – and allow them to invest in companies that have grown bigger.A Treasury spokesperson said the economy was \"already outperforming forecasts\" and it was driving growth \"with billions of pounds in new capital spending, strong private investment and bold planning reforms\".\"This Budget doubles down on our long‑term plan to grow the economy and create good jobs,\" they added.The truth is that any government or chancellor's ability to \"unleash\" growth is pretty limited. Most people just want not to be over-molested by tax and regulation and allowed to get on with their lives. On that score, this Budget is a big improvement on last year's.By building in a lot more wiggle room in her tax and spending plans over the next five year, Rachel Reeves has reduced the likelihood we will need such a bewildering smorgasbord of policies next year. Stability can be a powerful fertiliser for growth.The former chief economist of the Bank of England Andy Haldane may have over egged it by saying that the \"fiscal fandango\" - the months of speculation before this year's Budget - was the single biggest reason for growth to flatline for the second half of the year, but it sure didn't help.Ahead of the Budget, Steve Rigby, the boss of large private company Rigby told the BBC, \"we just hope [it] isn't too catastrophic for business and we can get on with it\".Test passed he says - but that's a pretty low bar for a government desperate for growth.",

    "body": "1 day agoGetty ImagesThe two-child benefit cap will be lifted from April 2026, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in the Budget.The limit means that many low-income families do not currently receive further benefits after having a third or subsequent child.What is the two-child cap and how many people does it affect?The policy, introduced by former Conservative chancellor George Osborne, means parents can only claim universal credit or tax credits for their first two children.It applies to third or subsequent children born after 6 April 2017.A total of 1.6 million children are in larger families which cannot claim these means-tested benefits as a result. If the cap had not been introduced, affected families could have received an average of £4,400 in benefit entitlements a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank. It estimates that the policy has saved the Treasury about £3.6bn a year.Budget 2025What changed in the Budget?Reeves said the two-child cap had pushed \"hundreds of thousands of children into poverty since it was introduced\".She announced that the cap will be scrapped from April 2026.In 2029-30 an estimated 560,000 families will see an increase in universal credit  averaging £5,310 per year. The government says this measure will lift 450,000 children out of poverty. Removing the cap will cost £2.3bn in 2026-27 and £3bn in 2029-30, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.Are there exceptions to the cap?Currently, if you have, for example, four children born before 6 April 2017, then you will still receive additional payments. That relates to children aged under 16, or young people aged under 20 who are in full-time education or training.If a parent, or parents, have one child, and the next are twins or triplets, then a claim can be made for all these children.Claims can also be made if children are born after rape, or from a coercive relationship. Reeves said she would end this \"rape clause\" calling it \"dehumanising and cruel\" to women.Payments can also go to children who are adopted, in your care rather than local authority care, or are a child of your child.Why was the cap criticised?More than 100 charities had written to the chancellor to call for the two-child limit to be scrapped.A host of backbench Labour MPs also wanted the chancellor to scrap it, arguing that it would bring hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.The Conservatives supported the cap, saying it made the system fairer, and meant parents on benefits face the same financial choices as parents who fund themselves solely through work.So the cap has nothing to do with child benefit?Correct. There is often a misconception that the two-child limit affects the payment of child benefit, because it is called the two-child benefit cap.So, take a breath between \"two-child\" and \"benefit\".This policy is specifically directed at universal credit and tax credits, not child benefit.

    "body": "9 hours agoPete AllisonCulture reporterGetty ImagesRuth Codd had said before her operation she hoped to feel \"pretty unstoppable\" after the procedureCelebrity Traitors player and actress Ruth Codd has said she is recovering after a second leg amputation operation.The Irish performer posted on TikTok, saying she is staying with family after surgery to remove her leg below the knee.Codd had her first amputation aged 23, after injuring her foot playing football as a teenager, saying it had led to eight years of complications and pain.Speaking about her recent operation, she said: \"Good news, we've had a full-circle moment. I'm back making TikTok content in my parents' house. Bad news, I can't do it upstairs, because I've just had my second below-knee amputation.\"She added: \"There's a lot to unpack for everyone involved.\"The 29-year-old built a following posting on TikTok, before being cast in Netflix horror series The Midnight Club, her TV debut.More recently, Celebrity Traitors viewers saw Codd share her correct suspicions about fellow player Jonathan Ross, before being murdered on the show.Codd had spoken previously about intending to have her latest operation in an interview on YouTube channel FFTV.\"The way I use my crutches means I'm always up on my tippy-toes,\" she told host Grace Neutral.\"With the second one, it was just the same situation.\"My quality of life, it's never going to get any better from this point.\"Celebrity Traitors viewers saw Ruth Codd share suspicions about fellow player Jonathan RossCodd appeared in a live-action remake of How To Train Your Dragon earlier in 2025.She played Phlegma the Fierce, a Viking warrior without part of her leg.Around the film's release, Codd said she was proud to play a \"strong, capable\" character with a limb difference.\"The amount of health problems I've had the last year haven't stopped me doing anything,\" she told FFTV.\"But I feel like it has hindered me and made my ability to do my job more difficult.\"I've been through it once before, so I think with two prosthetics, I'll be pretty unstoppable.\"",

I don't know how I will get through this. I love him so much. I want to wake up from this horrible nightmare.\"</p><p>Details of what caused the incident are not clear, but Miller's brother Dylan told AFP he was lead rope soloing - a technique that enables climbing alone while still protected by a rope - on a 2,400ft (730m) route named Sea of Dreams.</p></div><div><p>He had finished the climb and was hauling up equipment when he likely rappelled off the end of his rope, Dylan said.</p><p>Tom Evans, a Yosemite-based photographer who witnessed Miller fall, told <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/alpinist-balin-miller-dies-in-yosemite/\">Climbing magazine</a> he called 911 after Miller tried to free his bag, which was stuck on a rock.</p><p>Originally from Anchorage, Miller grew up climbing with his father and brother. </p><p>He was an accomplished alpinist and gained international attention for claiming the first solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct, which took him 56 hours to complete, according to a post on his Instagram in June. </p><p>\"He's had probably one of the most impressive last six months of climbing of anyone I can think of,\" veteran alpinist Clint Helander told the Anchorage Daily News in July. </p><p>Another renowned Alaskan climber Mark Westman, compared him to Alex Honnold, who became the first person to free solo a full route on El Capitan. </p><p>Miller's death came on the first day of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdr6pnky7vyo\">federal government shutdown</a>, which left national parks \"generally\" open, with limited operations and closed visitors centres. </p><p>The National Park Service said in a statement that they were investigating the incident and \"park rangers and emergency personnel responded immediately.\" </p><p>Miller had spent weeks solo climbing in Patagonia and the Canadian Rockies, completing a notoriously difficult ice climb called Reality Bath, which had been unrepeated for 37 years, according to Climbing magazine.</p><p>He was known affectionately as the \"Orange Tent Guy\", due to his distinctive campsite at the base of El Capitan. </p><p>El Capitan, an enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915 meters), is a major landmark in the national park and entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world.</p><p>Miller's death marks the third at the Californian national park this year. In June, an 18-year-old from Texas died in the park while climbing without a rope on a different formation.</p><p>And in August, a 29-year-old hiker died after being struck in the head by a large tree branch. </p></div>",

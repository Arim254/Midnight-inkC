    "body": "5 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , JerusalemGaza's Hamas-run civil defence says 11 people were killed, all from the same family, after the bus they were in was hit by an Israeli tank shell in northern Gaza.The Abu Shaaban family, it said, were trying to reach their home to inspect it when the incident happened in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday night.This is the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire eight days ago.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.Israeli soldiers continue to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency the victims were killed while \"trying to check on their home\" in the area.The dead included women and children, according to the civil defence.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle.It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.\"Hamas said the family had been targeted without justification.The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control. With limited internet access, many Palestinians do not know the position of Israeli troops as the yellow demarcation line is not physically marked, and it is unclear if the area where the bus was travelling did cross it.The BBC has asked the IDF for coordinates of the incident.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday the army would set up visual signs to indicate the location of the line.In a separate development, Hamas on Friday released the body of Israeli hostage Eliyahu Margalit to the Red Cross, which returned it to Israel.Mr Margalit was the tenth deceased hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people are yet to be repatriated. Israel handed the bodies of 15 more Palestinians over to officials in Gaza via the Red Cross, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the dead hostages' bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identity theft. In a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"The former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023. Santos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported. He served less than three months of a seven-year sentence.\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.In April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"He reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"Prosecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.In his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.Trump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old. \"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month. Santos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.From there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.He was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.A report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.Santos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.Earlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned. The letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"He wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions. \"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. \"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"Santos began serving his sentence in July at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey.Trump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.In May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.He also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.Commutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon.",

    "body": "13 hours agoFergus WalshMedical editorA blood test for more than 50 types of cancer could help speed up diagnosis, according to a new study.Results of a trial in North America show that the test was able to identify a wide range of cancers, of which three-quarters don't have any form of screening programme.More than half the cancers were detected at an early stage, where they are easier to treat and potentially curable.The Galleri test, made by American pharmaceutical firm Grail, can detect fragments of cancerous DNA that have broken off a tumour and are circulating in the blood. It is currently being trialled by the NHS.The trial followed 25,000 adults from the US and Canada over a year, with nearly one in 100 getting a positive result. For 62% of these cases, cancer was later confirmed.  Lead researcher Dr Nima Nabavizadeh, associate professor of radiation medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, said the data showed that the test could \"fundamentally change\" their approach to cancer screening. He explained that it could help detect many types of cancer \"earlier, when the chance of successful treatment or even cure are the greatest\".The test correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative.  When combined with breast, bowel, lung and cervical screening it increased the number of cancers detected overall seven-fold.  Crucially, three-quarters of cancers detected were those which have no screening programme such as ovarian, liver, stomach, bladder and pancreatic cancer.The blood test correctly identified the origin of the cancer in nine out of 10 cases.These impressive results suggest the blood test could eventually have a major role to play in diagnosing cancer earlier.But scientists not involved in the research say more evidence is needed to show whether the blood test reduces deaths from cancer.Clare Turnbull, professor of translational cancer genetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"Data from randomised studies, with mortality as an endpoint, will be absolutely essential to establish whether seemingly earlier-stage detection by Galleri translates into benefits in mortality.\"The topline results are to be released at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Berlin on Saturday, but the full details have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Much will depend on the results of a three-year trial involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, which will be published next year.The NHS has previously said that if the results are successful, it would extend the tests to a further one million people.Sir Harpal Kumar, president of biopharma at Grail called the results \"very compelling\".  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"The vast majority of people who die from cancer do so because we find their cancers too late.\"Many cancers are found when they are \"already very advanced\" he added, explaining that the aim is to \"shift to earlier detection, when we have the chance to use treatments that are much more effective and potentially curative\".But Naser Turabi of Cancer Research UK cautioned that further research is needed to \"avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm\". \"The UK National Screening Committee will \"play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS,\" he added.",

    "body": "Just nowNoor NanjiCulture reporterPrince Andrew's removal from the last vestiges of royal life has not only reshaped his future - it's sending ripples through his family too.His ex-wife has now lost her duchess title and will simply be known as Sarah Ferguson.Their daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, will continue to have the title of princess as scandal surround their parents.Prince Andrew lost use of his Duke of York title over his links with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.So, what does life after the royal shake up look like for the women of the York Family?For Ferguson, 66, the change will be the most visible.For all these years, she has kept the courtesy royal divorcee title Sarah, Duchess of York. Now, she reverts to her maiden name of Ferguson.And while arguably we've always referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer said that will \"no doubt\" have an impact.\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title – even her Twitter bio is @SarahTheDuchess.\"But the loss of her title may impact her much less than the scandal she's facing separately about her own links with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Accuser's brother urges King to strip Andrew of prince titleSarah Ferguson dropped from multiple charities over Epstein emailAfter all those scandals, why did Andrew quit his titles now?Last month, several charities dropped her as patron or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\"I think as far as Sarah is concerned, her own recent controversy involving the email she is said to have sent Epstein is what has had the biggest impact for her of late,\" said royal commentator Victoria Murphy.\"Prior to that, she had sidestepped the firing line of the controversy around Epstein and I think may have continued to do so, albeit without calling herself Duchess of York, had that not happened.\"Away from her philanthropy, Ferguson also has various business ventures.And these, too, are more likely to be affected by the Epstein controversy than any change in title, says Murphy.\"I would say it's likely they will be impacted by the revaluations of her own contact with Epstein, in the same way her charity work was and the fact that charities didn't want to be associated with her.\"But Ferguson has been a great survivor in royal circles. She's kept bouncing back.Even though she split from Prince Andrew more than three decades ago, she has remained his strong supporter and still lives in his Windsor estate.The Christmas before last, she was back in the royal fold, joining a royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham the first time in decades. That was despite she and her ex-husband not being working royals or allowed to be part of official royal events.That ability to bounce back may help her this time too.\"She's the ultimate survivor and master of reinvention,\" said royal author Katie Nicholls.\"Not only has she been reaccepted by the public, but the late Queen Elizabeth II brought her back into the fold, and Charles is also very fond of her.\"Nicholls argues that Ferguson, over the years, has been through \"much worse\", and won't be too impacted by the loss of her title.\"Having been a royal outcast for all these decades, she's learnt not to attach too much weight to things like that.\"For the couple's two daughters, Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, there's no formal change.They will still be known as princesses, which they have been entitled to since birth.There is also no change to the line of succession.Andrew remains eighth in line to the crown, followed by his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, in ninth and twelfth place respectively.But in reality their positions are \"low down\" and will likely become much further down as time goes on, says Murphy.\"So practically, their positions have little meaning for the future,\" she says.King Charles III's closest family and line of successionBeatrice and Eugenie are also currently non-working royals, and while they do sometimes take on roles – Princess Eugenie was recently announced as a mentor for the King's Foundation's 35 under 35 network for example - Murphy also says she \"can't see a world\" in which they would step up into royal duties in any official way.\"I don't think that was ever really on the cards, and I certainly don't see it as an option,\" she said.They have also benefited from all of the contacts their parents have made over the years, says Palmer. And while Andrew still remains a prince, losing the dukedom could have a knock-on impact there.Prince Andrew will also no longer join the King and the rest of the royal family at Christmas at Sandringham, but it's possible his daughters will still attend, says Palmer.\"As far as Beatrice and Eugenie go, I think there's an appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them, and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves,\" says Murphy.\"Their daughters are most unfortunate victims, they've had to suffer in silence and have been dignified in their silence,\" adds Nicholls.\"It can't be easy to see their parents dragged through something like this, and they remain very much loved nieces for the King. It wouldn't surprise me at all to see them at Christmas occasions in the future. They're largely untarnished.\"Ultimately, there seems to be little doubt that the person who will be most affected by all of this will be Prince Andrew himself.For a man who always liked the trappings of royalty, the pomp and the ceremony, the loss of his titles is deeply humiliating.So to not have those, on a personal level, will really matter.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJohn SudworthKyivReutersTrump says he has faith in Putin, but Zelensky does notOne word sticks out in the Ukrainian leader's description of his latest high-stakes foray into the nerve-centre of American power.His White House conversation with President Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X, was \"pointed\".But we don't need to parse his semantic description of the exchange to know that this was not the meeting that the Ukrainian side had been expecting.If the old British adage holds true that a week is a long time in politics, then Zelensky appears to have set a new record.A short transatlantic flight, it seems, is now an age.As they set off for Washington on Thursday, the Ukrainian side was in high spirits.Listen to the words of Ruslan Stefanchuk, the speaker of Ukraine's parliament – effectively the country's second in command – and a politician fiercely loyal to Zelensky.In an interview with the BBC shortly before the president's plane took off, Stefanchuk described the trip as a \"very important historical moment\".The meeting, he said, would leave the world in no doubt that Trump \"finally understands that Putin is a liar, he can't be trusted, and actions are needed to stop the war\".And, he appeared to suggest, the crucial question for Ukraine – whether Trump would agree to its use of American long-range Tomahawk missiles - was close to being \"solved\".But it was as Zelensky's flight was in the air that news of the two-and-a-half-hour Trump-Putin phone call began to emerge and, before its wheels were even on the Washington tarmac, we had the announcement that another summit between the two was in the offing.The Ukrainians descended the steps, to be met with a low-key American greeting, and with their optimism, like a piece of waylaid luggage, lost somewhere en route.Trump tells BBC Putin 'wants to make a deal', cites threat of TomahawksJust a few weeks ago, the US president appeared to be running out of patience with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting he thought he might be stringing him along, that his continuing attacks on Ukraine were \"crazy\" and that he was growing \"very angry\" with him.But Friday's meeting confirmed that the sense of frustration was gone.\"I think he wants to make a deal,\" Trump said, and then proceeded to repeat some of his old talking points, framing the conflict as, in essence, a personal gripe between two leaders.\"There's a lot of bad blood,\" he said.Zelensky has learned from bitter experience that there are great risks in being seen to challenge Trump inside the walls of the White House.And so, the underlying tension was - once again - palpable as Trump, his secretary of state, the war secretary and treasury secretary looked on sternly, while prominent members of the MAGA (Make America Great Again)-leaning media clustered around the back of his chair.As expected, Zelensky was careful to offer effusive praise for the host's prowess as a peacemaker and to repeatedly express his gratitude.Flattery is the currency of diplomacy in Washington nowadays.But Zelensky also made it clear he did not share Trump's apparent confidence that Russia is acting in good faith.\"We understand that Putin is not ready,\" he said.The outcome, though, appears to have been a foregone conclusion.Trump ended the day insisting that the war should simply be frozen on the existing battle lines and both sides should simply \"go home to their families\".For Ukraine and its allies, the conflict is not a personal dispute but a war of aggression being fought by an authoritarian state, with imperial ambitions, against a European democracy.Ukraine wants the US Tomahawk missiles to help it pressure Putin into genuine negotiations, and it wants US security guarantees to make sure he is forced to abide with any future peace settlement.Zelensky left the White House without either of those things.Zelensky fails to secure Tomahawk missiles at talks with TrumpWatch: How might Tomahawk missiles change the Ukraine-Russia war?What do Ukrainians think of it all?In a suburb of Kyiv, recently hit by two Russian missiles, I spoke to some of the residents still working to repair the damage to their homes and businesses.I asked Volodymyr Tsepovatenko - still busy fixing windows that were blown out of the small shop he owns – for his views on where Ukraine stands after the latest White House meeting.Volodymyr Tsepovatenko has been fixing windows at a shop he owns after Russian missiles struck a suburb in Kyiv \"If we make a peace deal now,\" he told me, \"Russia will start to prepare a new more professional war against Ukraine, or maybe other countries.\"\"I see one way for our safety and it's to destroy the possibility of Russia occupying or fighting any country in Europe.\"Ukraine needs to keep fighting, he said.Oleksandr Vilko's car was destroyed by the blast wave when the missiles struck. He is not too worried, he says, about the decision on the Tomahawks.\"The only power who decides what's going to be next is our army,\" he told me.Oleksandr Vilko's car was damaged by the blast wave when the missiles struckWhile Ukraine is grateful for any assistance provided so far, he said, it was Washington's sovereign right whether or not to give Ukraine its own long-range missiles to fight back.But with or without them, Ukrainians would fight on, he said.\"It's almost the fourth year of the war with the biggest country in the whole world,\" he said.\"And still we survived.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoGeorge WrightVirginia Giuffre's brother calls on King to strip prince Andrew of 'prince' titleThe brother of Virginia Giuffre has called on King Charles to strip Prince Andrew of the title \"prince\" after he announced he is giving up his other titles, including the Duke of York.Ms Giuffre alleged she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions, including when she was aged 17 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London in 2001.The prince made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him. He denies all the accusations against him. Sky Roberts told BBC Newsnight his sister, who took her own life earlier this year, would be \"very proud\" of the latest development regarding Prince Andrew.The prince has been under increasing pressure over his links with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with calls for Buckingham Palace to take action against him.On Friday, the prince announced that he was deciding to voluntarily hand back his titles and to give up membership of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.He will also cease be the Duke of York, a title received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II. But Mr Roberts said he would like to see the King go a step further, saying: \"We would call on the King to potentially go ahead and take out the prince in the Andrew.\"I think anybody that was implicated in this should have some sort of resolve. They should have some sort of responsibility and accountability for these survivors.\" He added that he would \"welcome any contact from the King, from members of parliament\".When Prince Andrew was born in 1960, he was automatically a prince as the son of a monarch. This could only be changed if a Letters Patent was issued by the King.Virginia RobertsMs Giuffre alleged that the prince had sex with her when she was 17 years old, at his friend Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London in 2001In his statement on Friday, Prince Andrew said: \"In discussion with the King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family.\"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first.\"I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"He said he continued to \"vigorously deny the accusations against me\".The prince had already ceased to be a \"working royal\" and had lost the use of his HRH title and no longer appeared at official royal events. His role now will be even more diminished.Getty ImagesVirginia Giuffre took her own life earlier this yearThe prince has faced a series of scandals over recent years, including a court case he settled with Ms Giuffre.Next week a posthumous memoir by Ms Giuffre will be published. It is likely to cast further attention on Prince Andrew's involvement with her and Epstein.Ms Giuffre claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections.She alleged that she was forced to have sex with the prince at the house of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London in 2001, when Ms Giuffre was 17 years old.Her memoir describes two other occasions on which she alleges she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.In the book, she also writes that she agreed to a gag order.Queen Elizabeth II was celebrating her platinum jubilee in 2022 - the first British monarch to reach the milestone - as the civil case against her son gathered pace.\"I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured that his mother's platinum jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,\" Ms Giuffre writes in her book.Ms Giuffre's brother, Mr Roberts, told BBC Newsnight: \"We have shed a lot of happy and sad tears today. I think happy because in a lot of ways this vindicates Virginia.\"All the years of work that she put in is now coming to some sort of justice, and these monsters can't escape from it - the truth will find its way out.\"He said this was \"a moment where survivors are not staying quiet any more\".\"It's just a joyous moment for them because we're finally getting some sense of acknowledgement, like 'this actually happened, what we're saying is the truth',\" Mr Roberts added.He said there was \"so much more to be accomplished, especially here in the United States\".Haley Robson, a survivor of Epstein's abuse, said the prince losing his titles was \"long delayed\" but \"very appropriate\". \"I have moments of joyous tears,\" Ms Robson said. \"I'm just flabbergasted that something finally broke and somebody is finally holding accountability.\"This is why King Charles is King. He is showing the world, including America, what it looks like to have somebody held accountable.\"Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight in 2019Prince Andrew has faced intense scrutiny over his links with disgraced financier Epstein, more recently including questions about when he had really cut off contact.In a now-infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019, Prince Andrew said that he had severed all links with Epstein after they had been photographed together in New York in December 2010.But emails sent in February 2011 later emerged suggesting that he had privately stayed in touch with Epstein, including sending a message that read: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!\"Prince Andrew is expected to stay in his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, on which he has his own private lease which runs until 2078.His ex-wife will be known as Sarah Ferguson and no longer Duchess of York, but their daughters will continue to have the title of princess.",

    "body": "No Kings protests draw huge crowds as anti-Trump rallies sweep across US19 minutes agoGrace Eliza Goodwinin New York City andCaitlin Wilsonin Washington, DCProtesters gather for No Kings demonstrations against TrumpPlanned protests against President Donald Trump have begun in cities across the United States.The protest in New York City's iconic Times Square was already crowded with thousands of people not long after it began Saturday morning. The streets and sidewalks, even the entrances to subway stations, were densely packed with people holding up signs with slogans like \"Democracy not Monarchy\" and  \"The Constitution is not optional\".Sections of the crowd regularly erupted into chants like \"This is what democracy looks like\" as a near-constant drumbeat boomed in the background alongside cowbells and noisemakers. But while the atmosphere at the rally in New York and other cities like Washington, DC and Los Angeles was almost party-like, Trump allies were accusing the protesters of being allied with the far-left Antifa movement, and condemned what they called \"the hate America rally\".Getty ImagesProtesters gather in New York City's Times SquareOrganisers and protesters out on Saturday insist the events were peaceful.In New York City, helicopters and drones could be seen flying overhead, and police stood on the sidelines.One organiser with a loudspeaker announced that 100,000 had shown up today, though it's not clear if he meant in the Times Square vicinity or across the city's five boroughs where smaller rallies and events were also being held. One police officer standing by estimated that over 20,000 were marching down 7th Avenue. Beth Zasloff, a freelance writer and editor, said she's out protesting in New York  because she's outraged and distressed at what she sees as a \"move toward fascism and an authoritarian government\" happening in the Trump administration.\"I care a lot about New York City,\" Zasloff said. \"It gives me hope to be out here with many, many other people.\"Grace Eliza Goodwin/BBCBeth Zasloff is protesting against Trump in New York CitySince returning to the White House, Trump has embraced an expansive view of presidential power, using executive orders to block funding approved by Congress and dismantle parts of the federal government, to introduce sweeping tariffs on other countries and to deploy national guard troops to cities despite objections by state governors.The president says his actions are necessary to rebuild a country in crisis and he has dismissed claims he's a dictator or fascist as hysterical. But critics warn the some of the moves by the administration are unconstitutional and a threat to American democracy.Massimo Mascoli, a 68-year-old retired electronic engineer and resident of New Jersey who grew up in Italy, said he's protesting because he can't watch the US descend into fascism as his home country did in the last century. \"I am the nephew of an Italian hero that deserted the Mussolini army and joined the resistance,\" Mascoli said. \"He was tortured and killed by the fascists, and after 80 years, I didn't expect to find fascism again in the United States.\"Grace Eliza Goodwin/BBCMassimo Mascoli is protesting in New York City against what he sees as a rise in fascism in the country Mascoli is particularly concerned about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, implementation of widespread tariffs, deployment of National Guard troops into US cities, and cuts to healthcare for millions of Americans. \"We cannot count on the Supreme Court, we cannot count on the government,\" Mascoli said. \"We cannot count on the Congress. We have all the legislative, the executive and judiciary that are all against the American people right now. So we are fighting.\"Protests are expected to continue across the country throughout the day. In Washington DC, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders delivered a keynote speech.\"We're not here because we hate America, we're here because we love America,\" he said to a crowd of thousands.At the DC march, the BBC saw one man wearing a Maga hat, who said he was in town to visit and decided to check out the protest. He declined to give his name, but said while he didn't really \"get it\", people had been civil. Shortly after, a woman shouted a derogatory comment at him.Throughout Europe, protesters have taken to the streets in Berlin, Madrid and Rome to show solidarity with their American counterparts. A couple hundred protesters also gathered outside the US embassy in London, UK. US protest organisers say the gathering will challenge Trump's \"authoritarianism\". Getty ImagesA protest outside the US embassy in LondonIn an interview with Fox News, set to air on Sunday but teased on Saturday, Trump appeared to address the upcoming rallies.\"A king! This is not an act,\" Trump said in a preview clip of the interview. \"You know – they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king.\"\"We'll have to get the National Guard out,\" Kansas Senator Roger Marshall said ahead of the rallies, according to CNN. \"Hopefully it'll be peaceful. I doubt it.\"Republican governors in several US states have placed National Guard troops on standby, but it is unclear how visible the military presence will be. Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday activated the state's National Guard ahead of a protest scheduled in Austin, the state's capital. He said the troops would be needed due to the \"planned antifa-linked demonstration\".Democrats denounced the move, including the state's top Democrat Gene Wu, who argued: \"Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do - and Greg Abbott just proved he's one of them.\"Virginia's Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin also ordered the state National Guard to be activated.Getty ImagesIn Washington, DC, where the National Guard guard has been deployed since August, at Trump's request, no troops were visible at the protest, although local police were.One protester at the rally in the capital held up a sign that read \"I am antifa\".Chuck Epes, 76, said it was a \"loaded\" term, and just meant he supported \"peace, daycare, livable wage, healthcare\", as well as immigrants and people of colour.\"He's gaslighting everybody - or trying to, and it ain't working,\" he said.A core principle of all No Kings events is non-violence, the group explicitly states on its website, which also urges all participants to de-escalate any potential altercations. Getty ImagesA \"No Kings\" protest in Waxhaw, North CarolinaAmericans are deeply divided on Donald Trump. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that only 40% approved of his performance as president, while 58% disapproved. This puts him about on par with his average approval rating during his first term, but lower than his 47% approval rating when he took office for the second time in January.It is common for presidents to become more unpopular as their term wears on. Joe Biden had a 55% approval rating, according to Reuters/Ipsos, in January 2021. By October of that year, his approval had declined to 46%.Getty Images",

Her youngest child Ben said she was \"quite simply irreplaceable\". He added: \"We are bereft, not for her – because her life has been extraordinary and complete - but for us, because of the immense hole in our lives she leaves behind.\"Hulton Archive via Getty ImagesLady Annabel with her children Ben, Zac, Jemima and Jane in 1981 Mr Goldsmith said: \"I spoke to her every day for 45 years, she truly had my back and we loved each other very much. I will miss her terribly.\"Annabel's, which was opened by her first husband in 1963 and was one of London's first modern nightclubs, was named in her honour. It was popular with the British aristocracy and celebrities in the 1960s and 1970s.Born in London in 1934 into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family, Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart was the daughter of Viscount Castlereagh, who later became The 8th Marquess of Londonderry.

    "body": "McLaren Formula 1 bosses Zak Brown and Andrea Stella blamed rival drivers for the crash between Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris at the start of the United States Grand Prix sprint race.Piastri, leading Norris in the championship by 22 points, bounced into his team-mate after colliding with Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg.The crash took both McLaren drivers out of the race, along with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, who was on the inside of Hulkenberg.Brown, McLaren Racing's chief executive officer, told Sky Sports some of the driving at the front was \"amateur hour\", adding: \"Clearly Nico drove into Oscar and he had no business being where he was.\"McLaren F1 team principal Andrea Stella added: \"The reaction is that we are disappointed that we didn't have the possibility to race.\"It's surprising that some drivers with a lot of experience don't act with justful prudence. Go to the first corner, make sure you don't damage competitors and carry on.\"McLaren indicated that Stella was referring to both Hulkenberg and Alonso.However, 1996 world champion Damon Hill, commentating for BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, said he thought Piastri had not shown enough awareness of the risks of the first corner of an F1 race when he chose to cut back to the inside to try to pass Norris.The Australian had a better start than the Briton and initially challenged on the outside on the uphill entry to the corner.But he then cut back to the inside in an attempt to get a run on Norris on the exit, only to collide with HulkenbergPiastri said: \"Not ideal but I haven't seen what happened, I tried to cut back on Lando and we were both very far from the apex and then got a hit and it sent me into Lando. A shame.\"Norris said: \"I just got hit, right? I did nothing wrong. Further back things happened and I just got unlucky and got hit because of it. I don't know. I need to look a bit more carefully. It's more people further back just being a bit careless and we are the consequence of that.\"Alonso said: \"At one point I thought I was in the right place on the inside, but some cars came very fast from the outside switching back and then I was there in the middle.\"Hulkenberg, who had qualified a season-best fourth, said: \"Big frustrations. All the good work from yesterday in the bin. Just messy.\"Oscar turned in pretty aggressively trying to get the undercut and exit of Turn One but I can't just disappear.\"I had Fernando attack on the inside and I couldn't see him any more. I wanted to leave space for him and then Oscar turned in and the contact was inevitable.\"McLaren will review the incident with their drivers but not until after the race weekend. Both cars needed significant repairs before grand prix qualifying at 22:00 BST on Saturday.Stella said: \"Overall disappointed but we take it on the chin, we are now focusing on repairing the cars, there is a lot to do and then we will restart the weekend from there.\"We are in a strong position from our competitiveness point of view so I hope we have the possibility to race, race normally and capitalise on our performance.\"The points are the most important thing, I don't want to talk about mal-intent, just prudence. A little more prudence would be good for everyone.\"The race was won by Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who closed in on both McLaren drivers in the championship - he is now 55 points behind Piastri and 33 adrift of Norris.Stella said: \"The implication is what the maths says - we lost eight points with both drivers, but we focus on ourselves. We have a very competitive car and two strong drivers. We look forward to just some normal racing.\"Verstappen said he was taking the championship race by race.",

    "body": "Image caption, Why is the UK so cold now?Call it a cold snap or just typical British weather. One thing is certain, the weather outside is frightful, freezing, and just really cold.BBC Bitesize spoke to Dr Sylvia Knight, Head of Education at the Royal Meteorologist Society to answer all your cold weather questions.How cold does it have to be for snow?Image caption, The cold never bothered him anywayTo get snow, there has to be enough water vapour in the air to make clouds, and it must be cold enough (0°C) that snowflakes will form and not melt as they fall through the atmosphere to the ground.In the UK, we commonly get snow when the wind is blowing from the north or north east (for example, from the Arctic or Siberia). This air is then warmed from below as it approaches the UK, and rises further when it hits the coasts, hills and mountains.Once the air gets high enough, it cools again until it reaches the point where there is more condensation happening than evaporation - this makes clouds.As the UK is surrounded by sea, there is always plenty of moisture in the air for cloud to form.“It’s never too cold to snow in the UK,” says Dr Sylvia Knight, Head of Education at the Royal Meteorologist Society, “but it can be elsewhere in the world.”“It can be too cold for snow in the centre of large land masses, such as Eurasia, Antarctica or North America, where the wind has not encountered enough water that can easily evaporate.”Water vapour might be picked up over the oceans, such as the North Atlantic or Arctic ocean.“The rate of evaporation from lakes and rivers, which may be frozen, is far slower than from oceans,” Dr Sylvia says. “The oceans change temperature far more slowly than the land does, and so are a source of water vapour all year round compared to places where there is a lot of frozen water.”So, it's not too cold to snow in other places - it’s just too dry!How to tell between a common cold and the flu?Image caption, Should you starve a fever, feed a cold?While their symptoms are similar and they are both communicable viruses, colds and flu are quite different.Flu is characterised by a sudden fever, aches, pains and nausea, and avoiding rest can worsen symptoms and slow down recovery.Colds may make you feel lousy, but don’t always stop you from your day-to-day tasks and the symptoms should start to go away in the second week.You shouldn’t do is take antibiotics for either, as antibiotics fight against bacterial infections, they don’t treat viruses. It’s best to keep your fluids up for either, avoid sneezing on your hands, and eat if you can stomach it!Why don't gloves work on touch screens?Image caption, Woolly gloves are the enemyYou’re out playing in the snow and you need to check the Bitesize website - but oh no! Your woolly gloves act like a barrier between you and your phone screen. You can always get touch screen gloves - but how do they work?A capacitor is a device that has the ability to store electric charge.  Most phones and tablets have capacitive touchscreens - screens that have an insulator that is coated in a conductive material.Capacitors work by detecting anything that can store an electric charge. This includes you (think about when you rub your feet on the carpet and then get a static shock).When your finger comes into contact with a touchscreen, you create an electrical circuit between your body’s electrical field and the conductors in the screen. This ‘tells’ the conductors exactly where you’re touching.Touch screen gloves have conductive wire woven into the fingertips (usually copper yarn), which completes the circuit and allows the touch screen to detect your electrical field. Now you can stay warm and revise!Is it okay to wear a coat inside?Image caption, Staying warm this winterSome people say you must take your coat off indoors, or you won’t feel the benefit when you go back outside. But is this true?When you wear a coat, you insulate yourself. This makes it harder for infrared radiation (heat) to escape from your body and be lost to the atmosphere. However, that coat also insulates you from heat coming in.“If you put a coat on when you’ve been inside for a while, you may get a bit warm, but you’ll be fine when you go outside and start slowly losing some of that extra warmth to the atmosphere,” says Dr Sylvia.However, she says you should take your coat off indoors for another reason. If you’ve been outside for a long time with your coat on, and are chilly when you come in, then the coat is also cold and will need to warm up. You’ll warm up far quicker without it on.How to stay safe while driving in icy conditions in the UK?Image caption, This icy barrier is no match for methanolUsing a de-icer is an important way to safe of the road. But how does it work?There are many different solutions of windscreen fluid, but the key ingredient to typical de-icer is methanol. This can be in bottle form so you can de-ice a windscreen manually, or in the washer system of the car itself.Methanol is a type of alcohol and is incredibly toxic to humans. It is diluted with water before it goes into the washer system, but it should definitely stay on the outside of the car and never be ingested.Methanol freezes way below sub-zero temperatures, and, when mixed with water, creates a solution which lowers the freezing point of moisture already on the windscreen. Using only water to de-ice the windscreen is counterproductive as there will just be more moisture on the screen to freeze again.Some cars have a washer system that heats the fluid before squirting it out. The methanol stops the warm water from freezing again on the windscreen. However, pouring boiling water over the windscreen can shatter the glass in cold conditions.Some people use vinegar or rubbing alcohol as an alternative to methanol solution, as they both have lower freezing point than water and are effective glass cleaners.The de-icer will always be more effective if you give the driver a hand in scraping their windows and windscreen first!Image caption, This gritter is the real winter soldierGrit saves the day, you might complain about getting stuck behind the winter service vehicles, but the school run would be an even bigger nightmare without them.While it’s called grit, most gritters actually use halite, also known as rock salt. But halite doesn’t actually melt snow the way heat does.Grit lowers the freezing point of moisture on the road surface, preventing snow from sticking in the first place.The moisture on the road mixes with the salt and creates a saline solution preventing snow or ice from building up.Technically you could use table salt to clear your driveway, but you’d have to get the timing and conditions right before too much ice builds up. Salting your drive before it’s too icy can help prevent slips and falls, but throwing salt at a pile of snow won’t work so well.Table salt is not exactly the same as halite - it’s refined for eating, so is treated to remove any impurities. Rock salt is already mined whole and does not undergo this process.This article was published in December 2019 and updated in November 2025",

    "body": "A man who supplied thousands of small boats and engines to people smugglers in the English Channel has been jailed.Adem Savas was described by the National Crime Agency, which previously listed him as its most wanted man, as \"without a doubt the most significant supplier\" to gangs behind the dangerous crossings between 2019 and 2024.The Turkish national was sentenced to 11 years in prison and received a fine of €400,000 (£346,000) on Wednesday, after admitting to offences of people smuggling and being a member of an organised crime group.The NCA said he had likely made millions from the operation, having charged on average around £4,000 for packages of boats and engines.The 45-year-old is also thought to have supplied equipment used in about half of all crossings in 2023, the agency said, \"making him a key figure in the European people smuggling hierarchy\".Savas was sentenced at a court in Bruges, Belgium, after a joint operation between the NCA and Belgian authorities, having been arrested at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport in November 2024.He was first identified during an investigation into Hewa Rahimpur, a Kurdish national who led a smuggling ring thought to be responsible for the movement of more than 10,000 migrants in small boats to the UK and jailed in 2023.Savas was found to be his \"key supplier of boats and engines\", according to the NCA. The agency's director general of operations, Rob Jones, said Savas's supplies \"were likely involved in numerous fatal events in the Channel\".\"He pretended to run a legitimate maritime supply company, but in reality he knew exactly how the equipment he provided would be used.\"He also knew exactly how unsuitable it was for long sea crossings.\"Border Security Minister Alex Norris said the UK was \"cracking down on the criminals exchanging human lives for cash\" and praised officers for apprehending \"this smuggling kingpin\".Home Office figures showed that a total of 41,472 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - almost 5,000 more than the previous year.It was the highest number since 2022, when nearly 46,000 migrants crossed.Such crossings have become the most common way for people to be detected entering the UK illegally since 2020.According to the United Nations, at least 84 people died while attempting to cross the Channel in 2024. Experts say the risks involved with the journey are increased by overcrowding on boats.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaulin KolaReutersEmotions are still raw outside the barFamilies of the victims of a fire at a Swiss bar on New Year's Eve have expressed shock after officials admitted the venue had not undergone safety checks for five years.Romain Jordan, who represents some of the families, said the \"staggering number of breaches and shortcomings in the inspections raises the question of whether the municipality should be investigated with even greater urgency\".Other lawyers also urged officials to take responsibility for the disaster at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana in which 40 people died and 116 were injured. Prosecutors believe the fire started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached set light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling. The two bar managers have been placed under criminal investigation, but not in custody. French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.In their first statement since the fire, they said they were \"devastated\" and pledged \"full co-operation\" with the investigation.Venues like Le Constellation should have been checked annually, but the mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, said on Tuesday he could not explain why it hadn't been checked in so long. \"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers would be banned in local venues.ReutersRicardo Minghetti, whose funeral was held on Wednesday, was one of eight victims under the age of 16More on this storyMost of the victims of the fire were young - eight under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns and are being treated in Switzerland and other European countries.The funerals of some of those who died have been taking place.Watch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor saysUnder Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities.

    "body": "Just nowEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesLearner drivers could have to wait six months before booking a practical testThe UK government has launched the first major road safety strategy in over a decade, aimed at lowering the number of people who are killed or seriously injured on the roads.The changes only apply to England and Wales - some of them are in force in Scotland and Northern Ireland already.The measures will be open to public consultation but here are the government's main proposals and how they might affect you. Eye and cognitive tests for older driversDrivers over the age of 70 could have to have their vision checked every three years, instead of simply declaring that their sight is good enough to get behind the wheel.Drivers must be able to read a number plate from 20 metres away, but they do not have to provide proof of this.NHS eye tests are free for over-60s across the UK.The Department for Transport (DfT) has also pledged to \"develop options for cognitive testing for older drivers\".A learning period before your testLearner drivers could face a minimum learning period of up to six months between sitting their theory and practical tests.Currently, novice motorists can book a practical test as soon as they have passed a theory exam.The government believes a minimum period between sitting the theory test and the practical exam would help learner drivers develop their skills, including driving in different conditions.This change is not set in stone — it will be subject to a public consultation before the government makes a decision.The proposed learning period would include any informal learning people may do with parents or guardians as well as formal lessons with a driving instructor.Evidence from other countries suggests minimum learning periods could reduce collisions by up to 32%. Learner drivers currently face a waiting time of around six months to take their practical tests anyway, due to a backlog from the Covid pandemic. The backlog is expected to last until late 2027.Stricter drink driving limitsThe DfT has proposed reducing the alcohol limit in for novice motorists and those within their two-year probation period from 80mg per 100ml of blood to around 20mg.For all other drivers, the level would be lowered to around 50mg. This is the current limit in Scotland.The current limit in England and Wales is 35 micrograms per 100ml of breath. It is difficult to say how much of a drink this translates to, as people process alcohol differently depending on factors such as their age and weight.The strategy also proposes a new requirement for some drink-drive offenders to have \"alcolocks\" installed in their vehicles — devices which prevent a vehicle being started or driven unless the driver passes a breath test.Fitting these on an offender's car would be a condition of them being allowed to drive again.They are already used in several countries such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands and the US.Penalties for drink driving will also be reviewed.Changes for motorcyclistsThe process of learning to ride a motorbike could be overhauled following a consultation. This could include changes to the existing Compulsory Basic Training and to government-funded schemes to ensure motorcyclists are wearing safe helmets.The government also wants to roll out new pilots of Project Prime, an initiative to help motorcyclists drive more safely on rural roads.Tougher fines and penaltiesEnforcement of road regulations will be updated to \"penalise the most dangerous road users\".Proposed ways to do this include new powers to suspend the licences of people suspected of drink or drug driving until they appear in court. Currently, people on bail for these offences are free to continue driving.Drivers could be given penalty points for not wearing a seatbelt, or for driving with children who are not wearing a seatbelt.Tougher punishments are also planned for people who drive without insurance or an MOT, as well as people using \"ghost\" number plates which cannot be read by recognition cameras.",

    "body": "17 minutes agoTelor Iwan,Oscar Edwards,BBC WalesandSarah Easedale,Mold Crown CourtMiles Cross pleaded guilty to four counts of intentionally committing an act capable of encouraging or assisting suicideA man who sold chemicals online to help people kill themselves has been jailed after what is thought to be the first investigation of its kind.Miles Cross, 33, admitted four counts of intentionally doing an act capable of encouraging or assisting suicide and was jailed for 14 years.Cross, from Wrexham, admitted sending a fatal chemical to four people between August and September 2024 who he had met on an online forum.One of the four people, 29-year-old Shubreet Singh, from Leeds, who paid £100 for a package, has since died.North Wales Police raided Cross's home in January 2025 after Thames Valley Police, who were investigating another case of suicide, came across his name during \"financial investigations\".At his home officers found quantities of the same chemical he had sent through the post along with other paraphernalia.Sentencing Cross, Judge Rhys Rowlands said: \"This is a rare and extremely serious case involving you sending [a substance] out to individuals who were distressed and in contact with you in a suicide forum.\"Tragically two individuals died as a result of your actions.\"The court heard from the prosecution who said Cross advertised the drugs on an online forum which discussed suicide and suicide methods, with anyone wishing to join having to provide a detailed explanation about their reasons.The court also heard that the encouragement of suicide is not permitted and sale of drugs is not permitted.The prosecution said Cross supplied the chemicals to those who asked for them, at a cost of £100, adding that the offence involved a financial benefit.The prosecution went on to say he had joined the forum to research methods for his own use after suffering from \"emotional deterioration\" which led to gambling, alcohol and sedative use.Cross described the forum as \"a bible\", telling probation officers he had sourced the chemicals before receiving two tubs of a substance which he would use to \"help others end their lives\".North Wales PoliceCross was sentenced to 14 years in prison after admitting to selling chemicals online to help people end their own livesThe prosecution did not accept this, adding that Cross had set up his venture and bought the substance before he joined the forum.They said he also ordered other drugs which have also been linked to suicide.When he joined the forum, the prosecution said Cross posted a message and a picture of the chemicals saying he \"finally had everything\".He also said things were \"on my terms now\" and that it was the \"only relief I've had in a long time\".By 2 August 2024, Cross had opened an account on the website where he directed the victims to pay him for the chemicals, according to the prosecution. He had also purchased 100 zip foil bags, which were later recovered by police at his property. Four of the bags were missing.All four packages sent had Cross's return address on them and one of the foil bags was found at the scene of Singh's death.On her phone, there was a screenshot of a conversation between her and Cross where he asked if she needed help sourcing the drug, to which she replied that she did.Another screenshot showed that she had made a payment to him.In the days leading up to Singh's death, the pair exchanged messages talking about their \"last meal\".Evidence suggests Singh died after taking the chemicals on 1 September, but she was not discovered until two days later.Cross received a £100 payment into his account after another person, in respect of count one, became suicidal and began researching online.Cross sent them a QR code and said he could provide the kit.The court also heard about another victim, who purchased a chemical compound from Cross.The father of the person who bought the drug went missing and his body was found weeks later.He had taken his own life using the chemical compound which had been purchased from Cross.Another victim, said she had bought a chemical but threw it away after feeling she was \" in a better place\".In her victim impact statement, she said it had been \"too easy\" to obtain the chemical and she had \"panicked\" before eventually putting the substance in the toilet.Cross was arrested on 13 January 2025 with two 1kg (0.15st) tubs of the chemical found in his property. One was unopened and the other had about 300g (0.7lbs) remaining.The court previously heard Cross supplied the substance to four people, via an online business, during August and September 2024 - receiving £100 from each of themSince his arrest, one of the people who bought packages from Cross has spoken out to warn others who may be vulnerable to seek help from professionals instead of using online forums.The individual, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said when they purchased the substance they felt \"vulnerable, overwhelmed and struggled silently\".\"This experience caused me significant emotional pain.\"I am no longer in that state of mind, but I have had to work hard to heal and move forward in a healthier direction.\"The fact this was so easy makes me think, had I not come to my senses, I wouldn't be where I am today,\" they added.The individual said: \"Although he does not know me and may not fully understand the impact of his actions, the substance he advertised, sold and sent me could have ended my life, and seriously impacted on my family.\"I hope my words can be used to support others and to ensure safety for those who might be in similar situations.\"A first of its kind in the UKAssistant Chief Constable Gareth Evans said the force hoped that the sentencing would \"alert vulnerable people to predators\" like Cross.\"It has been a unique investigation and I believe it is the first prosecution of its kind in the UK involving someone using an online forum to target vulnerable people,\" he said.North Wales Police worked alongside Ofcom to close down the forum used by Cross to search for victims.The force added that experts were also brought in from the National Crime Agency and the NHS, and it also spoke with Samaritans and Ofcom \"who have been successful in reducing people's access to certain forums where we think people could be harmed\".If you have been affected by issues in this story, you can contact BBC Action LineMore top stories Related internal links",

    "body": "Is AI taking the fun out of fantasy football?1 day agoJack GrayandYasmin Malik,BBC NewsbeatPA WireAI tools offer \"expert management\" that could help you top your mini-leagueFor years, fantasy football has given every armchair manager the space to back up claims they \"could do a better job\" than the real thing.Whether you're competing against workmates, family members or strangers, the ability to pull together your own dream team is irresistible to millions of football fans.The competitive pastime has spawned a whole industry of content creators offering weekly tips for anyone looking to gain an edge as they sift through stats and manage transfers.Recently, more players have been turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for advice - but not everyone agrees they have a place in the virtual dugout.Ryan JordanContent creator Ryan Jordan posts fantasy football tips and advice to TikTokFantasy Premier League (FPL) is the UK's most popular fantasy league, and claims to have more than 11 million players taking part.Users select squads of 15 footballers, who each earn points based on their weekly on-pitch performance. The catch? A £100m budget, constant price changes, and a strict limit on how many players you're allowed from each side. Content creator Ryan Jordan, who posts fantasy football tips and advice to his 15,000 followers on TikTok, says FPL makes the real-life game \"more engaging to watch\".The Bristol City fan says it encourages him to pay attention to teams he might not usually follow, and makes \"every match really matter\".  \"So even a team lower in the table that you might not want to watch on TV each week, you'll watch it because you've a player from their team in your FPL team,\" he says.\"It brings the community together to watch a lot more.\"Fantasy Football HubFantasy Football Hub gives players advice, including possible transfersRyan tells BBC Newsbeat he uses Fantasy Football Hub, an app which offers AI tools, including one that rates a manager's squad. He says it gives advice on transfers, predicts how many points a certain player will achieve each week, and when it's best to play or bench them.Fantasy Football Hub's founder Will Thomas told Newsbeat the app has attracted about 793,000 members since it launched in 2019, with about 59,000 of those paying a subscription to access AI features.Of those paid members, he said, about 28,000 signed up in 2025, with about 381,000 joining as free members.Fantasy Football Fix, another popular app, told Newsbeat it had also seen user numbers climb.It now has 690,000 members overall, up from about half a million in 2022.The company believes one of its key features, an AI-powered chatbot the company says is trained on \"FPL-specific\" data, has contributed to the increase.Newsbeat understands the Premier League is set to add features to its official Companion app, which uses Microsoft's Copilot, to help users pick fantasy teams and strategies later in the season. But do AI tools actually do what they claim?Ryan says he mostly finds Fantasy Football Hub reliable. \"A lot of the time, some of the players they put in there are spot-on,\" he says.\"I'm not going to lie, there are some times I see a player and I think: 'What's he doing in there?'\"In groups dedicated to fantasy football on Reddit and other platforms, some users argue that the subscription apps don't provide insights or data which players can't get elsewhere. And one of the biggest complaints is that they remove the elements of gut instinct and luck that keep people hooked on fantasy leagues.Ryan says he understands why some people are against AI use, but he sees it as similar to getting advice from YouTube or podcasts.\"At the end of the day, I think people should play FPL in whatever way they enjoy most,\" he says.\"AI tools don't replace skill, they just support decision-making.\"Villa fan Jake reckons AI should stay on the benchTwo-thirds of FPL players who replied to a survey from Virgin Media O2 published in August said they were planning to use AI this season.However, many respondents told the company it \"takes the fun out of the game\" and others felt it was \"outright cheating\".It's a view that Newsbeat encountered among fans travelling for the Aston Villa v Manchester United match in Birmingham last month.Supporters told us they felt puzzled by others using AI to help them pick their squads.When we spoke to Jake Thomas O'Donnell, a long-time FPL player, in Birmingham city centre, he was also unimpressed.\"I think AI ruins the banter a little bit,\" the Aston Villa fan said.\"People that use AI have no clue what they're doing and automatically become these great people.\"It should be done by the person.\"Other players we spoke to say they weren't too fussed about it - and some didn't even know AI was used by others. 'I don't really see it spoiling the game'Dani GonçalvesDani Gonçalves co-created Aerial Fantasy which follows the Women's Super LeagueDani Gonçalves is a co-creator of Aerial Fantasy, one of several unofficial fantasy games developed for the Women's Super League after England's Lionesses won the 2022 Euros.It opened the 2025-26 season with more than 30,000 users.Dani argues there is little difference between following advice from an AI chatbot and a fantasy football \"expert\", such as a podcaster.\"People have always been trying to game the system and figure out a way to get the edge,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"I don't really see it spoiling the game.\"Dani admits there is a risk that widespread AI use could lead to lots of similar-looking teams as \"everyone's using the same data\".But she says those running fantasy leagues can use incentives to encourage players away from obvious or popular picks.Aerial Fantasy, for example, offers \"visionary points\", or bonuses, boosting rewards for those who choose lesser-picked squad members.Dani says there can also be a benefit for players who do enjoy the old-fashioned method of trawling stats and spreadsheets to optimise their teams.\"Some players really enjoy digging through all the data and finding that gem, and obviously using AI does make that faster,\" she says.\"They're almost more engaged than the person who is rolling the dice and just picking a random person.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this ",

    "body": "1 day agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaThe US military action in Venezuela was the right thing to do \"morally\", Kemi Badenoch has said.The Conservative leader told the BBC that while she did not understand the legal basis for Donald Trump's operation to remove President Nicolás Maduro from the country, he was overseeing a \"brutal regime\" and she was \"glad he's gone\".However, she added that the move did \"raise serious questions about the rules-based order\".The UK government has so far avoided criticising the US move or saying whether it breached international law, instead arguing that Maduro was an \"illegitimate president\".However, some Labour MPs and opposition parties including the Liberal Democrats, Green Party and SNP have called on the government to condemn Trump's actions and brand them illegal.Badenoch told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the US action was \"extraordinary\" but she understood why it was taken.\"Where the legal certainty is not yet clear, morally, I do think it was the right thing to do,\" she said.The Tory leader, who spent her childhood in Nigeria before moving back to the UK at the age of 16, added: \"I grew up under a military dictatorship, so I know what it's like to have someone like Maduro in charge.\"However, she said it was right to tell Trump not to intervene in Greenland because \"there is a big difference between democratic states\" and the \"gangster state in Venezuela\".\"What happens in Greenland is up to Denmark and the people of Greenland,\" she added.In recent days Trump has repeated his threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory which has a strategic location and is rich in minerals - arguing it is vital for US national security.The UK has issued a joint statement with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark insisting it is for Denmark and Greenland alone to decide on matters concerning the territory's future.Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Breakfast the UK's approach to Greenland was different to Venezuela as Denmark was a member of the Nato military alliance and it was not in the UK's national security interests to question the territory's future.Streeting also defended the prime minister's response to the developments in Venezuela, arguing he was acting in the UK's national interest, as well as the \"best interests of the people of Venezuela\".\"I appreciate there are others who have been more strident and have been more critical of the United States,\" he said.\"The prime minister has a different responsibility, and he is choosing his words carefully and wisely to try and influence how events unfold from here on.\"Critics of the government's approach, including Labour MP Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, have argued the US action risks emboldening Russia and China and that the UK should be clear the operation breached international law.In a statement in the House of Commons on Monday evening, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she had reminded her US counterpart Marco Rubio of his obligations under international law.However, she reiterated the prime minister's position that it is for the US to set out the legal basis for its actions.Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife were seized from Caracas on Saturday in an operation by US forces which also saw strikes on military bases in the country.The pair have been taken to New York where they have been charged with weapon and drug offences, accused of enriching themselves from a violent crime ring smuggling cocaine to the US.Maduro has long rejected the allegations as a pretext to force him from power and both have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.Trump has vowed to \"run the country\" until there is a \"proper\" transition of power, with Venezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as interim president.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterActress Jessie Buckley has said she was \"brutalised\" on the 2008 TV talent show that catapulted her to fame.The 36-year-old was the runner-up on the BBC's I'd Do Anything, about the search for an actress to play Nancy in a West End production of Oliver!In an interview with Vogue, Buckley said she experienced \"unfair objectification\" at a time when she was still growing and \"trying to move into a space for myself\".The Irish actress has since become a Hollywood star and is tipped to win a string of best actress prizes in the current film awards season for her performance in Hamnet.Reflecting on her time on I'd Do Anything, Buckley said: \"I look back at it and I feel like, 'God, you're so brave.' I don't know if I'd have that courage now. And I don't know if that was kind of innocence or ignorance.\"She added that she was \"not fully well\" and \"depressed\" at the time she took part.Buckley said she experienced her treatment on the show as \"a lot of body shaming and bringing me to femininity school\".\"And I was growing into my body,\" she continued. \"I was 17. I was in a moment of discovery. As women, it's such unfair objectification.\"Vogue noted that some judges and other stars on the show commented on her appearance, with one choreographer encouraging her to be \"more ladylike\" and learn how to dance in six-inch heels.\"Back then, I was just trying to move into a space of myself,\" Buckley said. \"I really hope that a 15, 17, whatever-age woman never has to be brutalised quite like what happened on that show. \"But I didn't recognise it fully at the time. I just felt it, which was difficult.\"In response, the BBC pointed to its policies to ensure a duty of care for all who work with the corporation, which it said had been strengthened over decades.Anybody putting complaints or concerns to the corporation are treated with the utmost care and seriousness, the BBC added.Buckley also revealed that, after appearing on the talent series, she turned down an offer to be the understudy for winner Jodie Prenger. Instead, Buckley pursued her own trajectory in London's theatre landscape, taking a job in Stephen Sondheim's A Little Night Music at the Menier Chocolate Factory theatre.But she struggled in the early part of her career, telling Vogue: \"I was just lost. When you're told, culturally, in different ways, that you have to kind of mould yourself into a shape that doesn't naturally fit you, in some ways you incubate that messaging and then it becomes self-destructive.\"Once I realised that, my life goal has been to unravel myself from the sort of miseducation, from stories that don't actually serve me, and just find life.\"Buckley is now widely predicted to win best actress for Hamnet at events such as the Golden Globes, Baftas and Oscars in the coming weeks. She stars opposite Paul Mescal in the film, which is directed by Chloé Zhao and adapted from the novel by Maggie O'Farrell. It follows the death of the 11-year-old son of William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes, which some believe led the Bard to write his play Hamlet.",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Storm Emma in 2018 combined with a 'Beast from the East' to bring significant heavy snow to parts of the UK.BySimon King Lead Weather PresenterUpdated 6 January 2026Storm Goretti has been named by Meteo-France with the biggest impacts expected across northern France.However, the first named storm of the year will also bring strong winds to south-west England and the chance of widespread snow in Wales, central and southern England.If a storm is named by one meteorological agency then all will use the same name to ensure consistency in communication.In the UK, the Met Office work with Ireland's Met Éireann or the Netherlands' KNMI in naming a storm when they are forecast to cause \"medium\" or \"high\" impacts.The list of storm names is announced on 1 September each year and runs in alphabetical order.The season started with with Amy, followed by Bram in early December 2025.Next names on our list will be Chandra, Dave and Eddie.Why are storms named?Met Office Head of Situational Awareness Will Lang, who leads responses in times of severe weather, said: \"We do it because it works. Naming storms helps to make communication of severe weather easier and provides clarity.\"According to the Met Office, surveys following Storm Floris in August 2025 found that 93% of people in amber warning areas were aware of the alerts, and 83% took action to prepare.Wind is the main factor for naming a storm, but sometimes rain or snow are taken in to account as part of the process.Names are selected from a shortlist of suggestions from the public in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands.Amy was selected for 'A' as it was the most popular female name suggested to the Met Office. But there were more personal reasons behind some of the names chosen, such as  Fionnuala which was suggested by someone who said \"My daughter's name... Good strong name! What you'd expect from a storm.\"Image source, BBC / Getty imagesYou may notice a few Dutch names too after KNMI, the national weather service of the Netherlands, became part of the western storm naming group in 2019.Wubbo was a KNMI submission and a tribute to Wubbo Ockels, the first Dutchman to fly through space.Why are there no storms for Q, U, X, Y and Z?The list of storm names covers only 21 letters of the alphabet, to maintain consistency with World Meteorological Organisation naming convention of tropical cyclones around the world.Regional centres such as the National Hurricane Centre - which names Atlantic tropical storms - produces six lists of storm names that are used in rotation and it is difficult to find six suitable names (one for each list) starting with Q, U, X, Y and Z.So, if you are called Quentin, Ursula, Xavier, Yvonne or Zendaya you will never see your name on the list of storms.How many storms were named in winter 2024/2025?After five storms were named in autumn and early winter, the weather turned a bit quieter with no further storms through the rest of that season.It wasn't until August for the sixth and last storm of the 2024/25 period - Storm Floris -  to bring widespread damaging winds and disruption.In recent years the UK has seen frequent periods where the jet stream is either being directed towards the UK or to the south of the UK and this helped develop and steer low pressure systems to our shores which sometimes became named storms.Image caption, Number of named storms varies each yearBut no two years tend to be the same.One of the challenges for forecasters comes from the natural variability in our weather patterns. In the 2022/23 season there were only two named storms and they both occurred in August.And sometimes storms can come in clusters. In February 2022 there were three storms in a week - Dudley, Eunice and Franklin. A Met Office red wind warning was issued for Storm Eunice. The winds gusted to 122mph (196km/h) on the Isle of Wight - England's highest recorded gust speed.Does climate change impact UK storms?We know climate change is making our weather more extreme so that when it rains, that rain tends to be heavier with a greater chance of causing flooding.It is more difficult to link storms to climate change.The UK has a history of impactful storms stretching back hundreds of years, long before the introduction of named storms in 2015.Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle says: \"There is some evidence that storms with strong winds (windstorms) will become slightly more frequent in the future in north-west Europe and also become more clustered, so that we experience several storms one after the other.\"Scientists are more confident that the coastal impacts of windstorms, from storm surges and high waves, will worsen as the sea level rises.",

    "body": "Opposition leader Machado says her coalition should lead Venezuela 2 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWatch: 'We are ready and willing to serve our people', says María Corina MachadoVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has said her coalition should \"absolutely\" be in charge of the country, following the US ousting of President Nicolás Maduro last week.\"We are ready and willing to serve our people as we have been mandated,\" Machado said in an interview with the BBC's US partner CBS. She thanked US President Donald Trump for his \"leadership and courage\" after US forces stormed Caracas and arrested Maduro, but said nobody trusted the deposed president's ally, who has been appointed as interim leader. Machado and her opposition movement claimed victory in 2024's heavily disputed elections, but Trump has refused to back her, saying she lacks popular support.The former legislator, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, described US military action in Venezuela over the weekend as \"a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela\".She said she had not spoken with Trump this year, but expressed gratitude to him for deposing Maduro.\"President Trump's leadership and courage has brought Nicolás Maduro to face justice and this is huge,\" she told CBS. Despite her overtures, the US president has publicly dismissed Machado as a credible successor to Maduro.\"I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader,\" Trump told a news conference days ago, referring to Machado. \"She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country. She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect.\"Who is Venezuela's new interim president, Delcy Rodríguez?Machado, who has been in hiding for months after being barred from running in the 2024 presidential elections in Venezuela, has previously called for the opposition's Edmundo González to assume power after Maduro's arrest.Machado rallied support for González in the election, and vote tallies released by her party suggest he won by a landslide.However, Maduro was declared president by Venezuela's electoral council (CNE), a body dominated by government loyalists.Despite this, the US and dozens of other countries recognised González as the president-elect.David Smolansky, a spokesperson for the Venezuelan opposition, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that there was no future for a well-functioning country without González and Machado in power.\"They could guarantee a democratic transition and they have the respect of Venezuelans and several governments across the world,\" he said. Asked why he thinks Trump has so far chosen to back Venezuela's interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez - formerly Maduro's vice-president - rather than the opposition, Smolansky said: \"Every transition when it begins is not perfect. It's messy.\"He also responded to suggestions that the opposition's lack of support within the military is one of the reasons Trump has chosen to back Rodríguez, saying there are members of the armed forces - both currently serving and in exile - that are ready to work with them.Watch: Mixed reactions among some Trump supporters to Venezuela operationMachado has said nobody trusts Rodríguez, telling CBS that Rodríguez was \"one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people\" in the South American country.\"Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,\" Machado said. While Rodríguez, 56, has faced US sanctions for her ministerial roles in the Maduro administration, she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes. Rodríguez was sworn in on Monday, days after a US special forces breached Venezuelan security to arrest Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.Earlier on Tuesday, Rodríguez rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela. \"The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does,\" she said in a televised speech. \"There is no external agent governing Venezuela.\"",

    "body": "Just nowChloe AslettYorkshireBBCThe incident occurred on the road between Dinnington and TodwickA police force has admitted mixing up the identities of an 18-year-old killed in a car crash with another teenager who survived the collision.South Yorkshire Police believed Trevor \"TJ\" Wynn, 17, had died in the crash near Rotherham on 13 December and told his family.But on Sunday it emerged he had survived and it was Joshua Johnson who had been killed alongside a 17-year-old girl, who was driving the vehicle.Assistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) since identifying the error, adding that he was aware of \"the additional trauma this may cause\".Police were called to Todwick Road between Dinnington and Todwick in the early hours of 13 December after a silver Toyota Corolla crashed off the road.At the time the force said a 17-year-old girl, who was driving, and a 17-year-old boy had been pronounced dead at the scene, while an 18-year-old male had been taken to hospital with serious injuries.Trevor's family were subsequently told he had died while it was believed that Johnson was the male in hospital receiving treatment.The 17-year-old girl has not been formally named by police, but she was identified as Summer Louise Scott at the opening of an inquest at Doncaster Coroner's Court.In a statement issued on Tuesday, South Yorkshire Police said \"concerns\" had been raised about the identities of those killed.A spokesperson said \"information came to light\" on Sunday which prompted \"further formal identification processes, including forensics, to be undertaken\" and resulted in the mistake being identified.South Yorkshire PoliceAssistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the IOPCMcFarlane said he had since offered to meet with both sets of parents to discuss the matter.He said: \"This has obviously come as a huge shock to everyone and we recognise the additional trauma this may cause. \"We are supporting Trevor and all the families through this and have engaged specialist agencies to help provide that support. \"I have also offered to meet with both sets of parents as I am sure they will have many questions, most of which we are not able to answer yet but we are absolutely committed to understanding how this happened so it cannot happen again.\"He said South Yorkshire Police would fully cooperate with any subsequent investigation by the police watchdog.The IOPC said it was assessing the referral to determine whether an investigation was required.An 18-year-old who was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and a 19-year-old arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in connection with the crash both remain on bail pending further inquiries.'Life-changing situation'Trevor was not named publicly by police at the time of the crash, but was widely identified on social media and in local news outlets as having died in the collision.A fundraiser set up in his name by family friend Jonathan Stoner last month has raised more than £1,000.In an update on Tuesday, Stoner said following the news that Trevor was alive, the money raised would go \"directly toward helping TJ move forward in life and supporting his family through this recovery process\".\"The police initially made a mistake and identified the wrong person, and we were informed incorrectly at the time,\" the update read. \"This has since been clarified, and we want to be completely transparent with everyone who has supported us.\"Stoner said the focus would now be on helping the teenager, who had been through \"a serious, life-changing situation\", recover.\"We understand this news may come as a shock, and we appreciate everyone's patience, kindness, and continued support,\" the update said. \"Every single share, donation, and message has come from a place of love - and that love is still needed now more than ever.\"Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, said she was \"deeply troubled that an error of this magnitude has occurred\". \"My heart goes out to the families involved; I will be holding the police to account to make sure this cannot happen again, the pain they have caused is unimaginable,\" she said.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "A £4m-a-year lease for a prison that has been empty for 18 months has been a \"needless waste of taxpayers' money\", a report from MPs found.The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the lease agreed with the Duchy of Cornwall for HMP Dartmoor was signed by HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) in March 2022 despite it being known the site had high levels of radon gas two years earlier.The prison in Princetown, Devon, was closed in July 2024 after the government found levels of the radioactive gas were up to 10 times higher than the safe limit.PAC said it did not accept HMPPS' excuse that the lease needed to be signed due to a prison capacity crisis.In its report, PAC said the lease - which cannot be terminated until at least 2033 - was signed without further comprehensive radon testing being carried out.The report said a reduction to the annual rent or safeguards to mitigate the financial risks of increased radon levels were not negotiated and \"poor commercial decisions\" were made when the lease was signed.PAC said improvement costs until the lease ends would cost £68m and neither the MoJ or HMPPS had clear plans for the prison's future.It added MoJ and HMPPS were now less than certain reopening the site represented best value for money.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, PAC's chairman, said the issue was an \"absolute disgrace, from top to bottom\".\"Dartmoor appears to the Committee a perfect example of a department reaching for a solution, any solution, in a blind panic and under pressure,\" he added.\"This is, obviously, not how policy should be delivered.\"The Duchy of Cornwall said: \"Dartmoor Prison has been let to the Ministry of Justice since 1850. \"The Ministry of Justice and the Duchy of Cornwall are in regular communication in connection with the lease and the current temporary closure of the facility.\"PAC said once a plan for the prison had been decided, MoJ and HMPPS officials should assess whether they continued to spend money on the unoccupied site or consider negotiating an early exit from the lease.It has also asked HMPPS to set out what it had learnt for the future from the \"failures of its decision-making and contract management\".A MoJ spokesperson said: \"This government inherited a crisis in our prisons system, where prisons were on the brink of collapse, threatening a total collapse in law and order.\"This government is addressing the prisons crisis through building 14,000 new prison places, and the Sentencing Bill which will deliver punishment that works.\"The MoJ previously said the closure was temporary and the site had been made safe, adding it was working with specialist radon gas experts to \"investigate whether we can reopen the prison safely\".The terms of the lease mean the MoJ has responsibility to undertake all repairs needed at the facility.",

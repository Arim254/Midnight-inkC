    "body": "The Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment engage in bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport. We'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.Interviews will drop from Friday across BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week's interview will be broadcast on BBC One from 23:40 GMT on Saturday, 21 February (and in Scotland at 00:55 on Sunday morning). Michael Carrick is certainly enjoying life as Manchester United caretaker head coach.Since Carrick replaced Ruben Amorim last month, United have taken 13 points from five matches to climb to fourth in the Premier League.That included back-to-back wins over title rivals Manchester City and Arsenal en route to the 44-year-old being named Premier League manager of the month.Much has been made of the former United midfielder's faith in 20-year-old academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, who has gone from not starting a league match this season under Amorim to being a mainstay.In an in-depth interview with Mark Chapman, Carrick refers to Mainoo as a \"huge talent\" and speaks more broadly about continuing the club's 88-year record of having an academy product in every matchday squad.He also answers questions about his future, with his contract at Old Trafford only running until the end of the season.Mark Chapman: The last time I saw you was on Match of the Day. Were those experiences so bad that you felt you just had to jump at a job that came your way?! Michael Carrick: I have to say, I really enjoyed it - seeing it from a different perspective, watching football in a different way. I enjoyed it, but this one was too good to turn down, unfortunately!Mark: Take us back to the process of getting here - the first phone call that you got... what went through your head?Michael: I was actually in the car. I was driving on the way up to Newcastle at the time when the message came through. It was a nice thing to hear - of course it was - but I was quite calm about it actually.I don't know why, but it just felt right. And that's not me being arrogant or blase in any way - it just felt quite normal. You get a good feeling from it, but I've been here for so long and experienced so much that probably, at some point, I was always hoping in the back of my mind that the opportunity would come along - and thankfully it has.Mark: You smiled, surely? And who did you ring after you put the phone down on that call?Michael: Listen, I was delighted obviously. To be at this club is special, so I'm not playing it down, but it wasn't the case that I came off the phone shouting and screaming and celebrating on the motorway or anything. I just called my wife and said, 'this is what's happened, this is where we're at'.Mark: So when you agree to do it and you know the length of time that you're doing it for, what do you start preparing for? Your backroom staff? Had those calls already gone in?Michael: Obviously assessing what needs to be done, what needs to be put in place, what staff, what that balance looks like. And it's condensed into quite a short space of time. Putting the staff together was something that we had to get right and wanted to get right. So, I was really happy with that - how it came together... I was absolutely delighted with the staff.It's about getting the best out of the players, isn't it? So, like you say, the first conversations... that first impression goes a long way. I've been on the other side when someone new comes in the room. My message, to be honest, was: 'I'm here to support you. I'm here to help you. We're here to push you.' Ultimately, we want to get good results here, but there are ways of doing it and hopefully they've felt that support so far.Mark: Did you think that they'd been underachieving as a group?Michael: It's not really to say whether they achieved or underachieved. For me, walking in the door, it was about what was in front of us and I knew it was a really talented group... a lot of potential within the group. It was just about what can we do to help and improve things. We had three days before we played Manchester City so it was a really condensed, compressed game-prep week with a lot of things going into it in a short space of time.Mark: Did it help that it was Manchester City and Arsenal as the first two games?Michael: You could say it helped now... Mark: But hindsight's a wonderful thing isn't it?Michael: Yeah. I think the fact that it was two massive games... City was a huge game - playing at home, and the atmosphere I have to say was pretty special on the day. Even building up to the game, you could feel it in and around the stadium before kick-off. It's impossible to describe how much that helps, but to feel that between everyone - it's a real special feeling for me to be in the position to be able to share that with so many people. That's probably the most satisfying thing so far - getting that connection and feeling that emotion from everyone in such a positive way.Mark: With the three members of staff that you brought in - Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans - how do you work as a four? Because there was a lot of attention on the people you brought in...Michael: There's Travis as well - Travis Binnion, who's been here for a number of years now through the academy. And Craig Mawson - the goalkeeping coach. There's a really strong group and it feels like we've been together a long time, but we didn't all know each other. I didn't really know Steve personally an awful lot. I thought it would come together nicely and was balanced and there's a reason why I wanted to bring Steve in. Jonathan... I had him at Middlesbrough - loyal, gets me, knows me, pushes me, challenges me... really good relationship. Jonny knew the club. He's been here so long and has a really good relationship with the players as well... loves coaching, loves helping, cares a lot.  And then with Travis... the club needs the academy. It's a massive part of this football club.I think there's a really good balance with the responsibility of the academy, young players and then Jonathan and Jonny - being two of the best centre-backs you could come across in the last 20-25 years - to pass their information on. Steve - with his experience in so many ways... Chelsea, with change of managers and different styles of managers and top, top players, and England. All the staff are able to cope being around the environment and I think that's so important.Mark: And they challenge you? They tell you when you're wrong?Michael: For sure, yeah. Mark: Not every manager would accept that.Michael: I can't be right the whole time - it's impossible. That's why we've got a group of six in our office. We've all got strong opinions, but I think we all filter it and it's important that we have a connection and understanding of what direction we want to go in. We have to push each other, for sure.Mark: You mention the academy. What does the academy mean to you?Michael: An awful lot. Listen, I've always kept that feeling of what it was like as a young player. It's something I've always had an eye on and been passionate about. With the tradition of this football club, it's natural to take that on. It's just as proud a moment as any to give a young player their debut and there's certainly a want - from not just me but all the staff and everyone at the club - to try and produce the young players and give them opportunities as much as we can.Mark: A United academy player has always been in the first-team matchday squad since 1930-something, isn't it? Is that a sense of pride? How much can it become a slight millstone if you would be the one that breaks that run?Michael: Huge sense of pride on behalf of the whole football club, I think. It's really outstanding to have for such a long period of time and it's something we need to hold on to. It's what this football club is built upon really, and has been for so many decades. So, yeah, I'm definitely well aware of it and we want to carry it on.Mark: When you watch the academy and you're watching the under-age teams as well... is the pipeline - and I'm not putting pressure on them - but is the academy in good health?Michael: Yeah, I think it's in great hands. I think it has been. I think historically here it's kept producing players, year after year. We always hope for the next group or the next individual. There's so much good work that goes into the academy.We get carried away sometimes about the football and results. Where we're at now, it's wins and draws and losses that count in some ways. But it's about developing young people and behaviours and helping them. There are so many players from this club that have maybe not even made a debut here, but have moved on and had unbelievable careers in the game. And I think that's something, again, that as a football club we're really proud of.Mark: So, following on from the academy chat, there's been so much noise around Kobbie Mainoo this season... and not featuring, and now he's featured all the time under you. What did you see when you first got to work with him? Mentally, how was he and how have you got to where he is at the moment?Michael: I've known Kobbie a long time. I started working with him when I think he was 13 or 14, when I was starting to do my coaching badges - a good few years ago. Just little bits. And then, obviously, when I was here the first time, he was in and around a little bit.So I think knowing him and having experience with him and seeing him perform at such a level on such big occasions... I said earlier about coaches being able to cope with being here and at the level to deal with it. What Kobbie's done at such a young age is quite incredible really.We forget how young he still is. I was just a big fan of watching him play and knowing what he was capable of. So it wasn't really a big decision to play him. And, to be fair, it's not easy when you haven't played to find your rhythm and find your form.There are things he can get better at, things he can improve on, but we haven't really got started on any of that because we're just letting him go and find his flow and find his rhythm of playing football again. I've been really conscious of not giving him an awful lot - a couple of little pointers, a bit of positional things and some little bits here and there - but trust in what he is. He's a fantastic footballer and he's got a huge talent.Mark: It sounds, in many ways, that you rely on on the human being side of things rather than - I don't mean this in a disparaging way - rather than a flipchart.Michael: I like being around people. I like to share things. I'm not one that would be an individual as such and I don't promote the fact that I've got all the answers. I'm quite happy to discuss that. I think getting the best out of people - whether that's in the industry of TV or in the industry of sport or business... I think treating people with respect. I think that whatever it is, the technical side, tactical side, we can get better at all that, but if you haven't got a connection and that buy-in and that willingness to want to come with you and follow you, then all the other bits kind of lose their value and you don't get to fulfil all that potential. So I see it as a massive, massive thing to get that connection with people.Mark: Do you shout at them?Michael: I haven't yet, no. There's a time for all sorts of emotions and that's the beauty of being in this position - you've got to pick the right time and tap on the right kinds of buttons to get the right reactions.Mark: When you witnessed the hairdryer [which Sir Alex Ferguson's fiery outbursts became known as] were you like: 'Crikey'?Michael: Yeah, I'm not sure I could replicate that! I wouldn't try to! A couple of times I've seen it and it puts you at the back of your seat, trying to get further away from it. But, again, you're talking about Sir Alex and he was the genius at using people and getting the best out of people in so many different ways - support, pushing, a bit stronger than pushing at times - but it worked. It was all about getting the best out of his players.Mark: Who are the managers that you played for that you look to incorporate now in what you're doing?Michael: There's a few times I've done something and then it's not until after that I remember something that happened years ago with different managers or coaches. Experience is a beautiful thing to draw upon in different ways and that's just life. Listen, Sir Alex had the biggest impact on me - I think that's pretty obvious to say because of everything we achieved here. But I think just learning and knowing that I've never got all the answers and to just keep searching for more experience. That's why the staff are there to help in that regard.Mark: A lot of the players from that era are now pundits - in the same way that when you were playing, a lot of the successful Liverpool team were pundits. Do you have to accept it and shut it out? And is that easier for you than it is for your younger players?Michael: It doesn't bother me one bit. Genuinely, it doesn't. I'm not going to really fall out with anyone over that. I think it's a respect thing as much as anything and I'll give and take that. I think for younger players in general it's something we need to help them with and look after them. It's a different world now to when, say, I was coming through, but we do that and we look after them.Mark: If I were to ask you if you wanted it [the job] beyond... I know you'll have a stock answer, but I also think you're probably very much just 'what will be will be' are you?Michael: It's not a stock answer - for me, it's the ultimate role. I'm really enjoying it, I love what I'm doing. I'm fortunate. I feel privileged to be in the position I am, but it's not the fact that I believe I can do it and I'm here to do it.I said it when I came in - there's the sentimental side of that... of understanding the role and coming through the club and being here and loving the club and being a supporter and all that side of it is one thing. But, actually, I'm here to do a job now and to make a good team and be successful.I don't decide how long that's going to be but I love being here and and while I'm here, I'll give everything I can. And I always plan for the long-term future for the benefit of the football club. That's how I believe it should be.Mark: And you're very happy, aren't you?Michael: Yeah. Have I smiled enough for you?!Mark: Yeah.Michael: I'm loving what I'm doing. Again, you know... really good people. The staff are fantastic, the players have been unbelievable. It's a really good place to come in every single day - to drive in and look forward to being here. And then, obviously,  around the city and globally, the reaction and the support that you get - it's very hard to describe it. It's incredible. So, yeah, I'm delighted to be here.Mark: But if people keep asking you that, then you might shout at them?Michael: Possibly!",

    "body": "42 minutes agoJack BurgessReutersVenezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has announced on social media that he has been freed after \"almost nine months of unjust imprisonment\". His comments come shortly after the country's interim President, Delcy Rodríguez, signed an amnesty bill approved by its National Assembly that could lead to the release of hundreds of political prisoners. Rodríguez's interim government has faced pressure from the US to speed up the release of Venezuela's remaining political prisoners after delays to the law. However, Guanipa described the bill as a \"flawed document\" that excludes many Venezuelans who remain \"unjustly\" behind bars. Guanipa is the leader of Venezuela's centre-right Justice First party and was a former vice-president of the National Assembly.Venezuela's socialist government has always denied holding political prisoners but first announced days after Maduro's capture, on 8 January, that \"a significant number\" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture.Opposition and human rights groups have said the government under Maduro for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.Interim President Rodriguez has described the amnesty bill as being intended for the offering and receiving of forgiveness.But activists within the South American country have denounced delays to the law and a lack of transparency over who is being freed.",

    "body": "12 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterAFP via Getty ImagesEMI Records was one of the major players of the music industryWarning: this article contains offensive and derogatory languageJeffrey Epstein considered investing in music company EMI after his associate David Stern appeared to suggest it potentially offered access to women, recently released emails suggest.Epstein replied that he was interested, adding: \"Do we need help - mandelson? [sic]\"Stern and Lord Mandelson did not reply to requests for comment.Many of his emails to Epstein flagged potential deals, and in February 2010 he forwarded a short news article about the financial woes of EMI at the time. EMI is a now-defunct conglomerate that included EMI Records, formerly one of the major players of the music industry. It was acquired by Universal Music in 2012.\"Troubled industry but related to P,\" Stern wrote to Epstein.\"P\", which Epstein apparently used to refer to women, is believed to be an abbreviation of the word \"pussy\", another term Epstein often used.For birthdays and New Year greetings, Stern wished Epstein \"lots of P\", according to the recently released files. He once offered to get Epstein fashion show tickets \"to review Chinese P\". He would send Epstein a \"P factor\" for the places he visited, giving the Spanish island Ibiza 9/10, and Sarah Ferguson's 50th birthday party 0.2/10.The emails have been newly released by the US Department of JusticeAt the time Epstein had considered asking Stern for his help in an EMI investment, Lord Mandelson was First Secretary of State and Business Secretary in the UK government.Stern said it was \"too early to get Mandelson involved before i know more\".Epstein appears to have emailed Lord Mandelson a few days later, saying: \"please email me bens contact info.. or havehim cal me re emi. [sic]\"In reply, Lord Mandelson appears to say: \"Gave to [redacted]. Email is [redacted]. Talk re EMI ??\".It's not clear exactly who \"ben\" is.Epstein sent another reply to Stern, suggesting that if the deal went ahead, he would put US businessman and former Sony Music company CEO Tommy Mottola in charge of it.He wrote, \"my friend is tommy mottola former head of sony I'd like him to be brought in to fix it\".Mottola did not reply to a request for comment. US Department of JusticeAn image from the Epstein files showing David Stern at the opening of a new office for his company Asia Gateway in Beijing in 2011Epstein's proposed deal did not go ahead – and EMI's main lender Citigroup ended up taking control of the company.However later on, in 2011, Epstein's circle were still discussing a bid for EMI.Kevin Law, a businessmen in the US state of Connecticut who was often in touch with Epstein, apparently wrote: \"Tell your buddy Andrew from the UK if he's interested in EMI as we discussed I can put him in the syndicate w KKR.\" It is not clear if Epstein's \"buddy\" referred to here is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.PA MediaDavid Stern sits to the left of the Queen at a Pitch@Palace event at St James's Palace in London, in November 2016Law has said he \"never bid on EMI with any group nor did I ever do a business deal with Epstein,\" and said he did not know the former prince.The giant private equity firm KKR declined to comment. At the time KKR had a controlling stake in a rival record company, BMG.Stern was apparently still keen on acquiring a record company in 2011. He wrote: \"EMI may now come up for sale. Could actually be of interest to Chinese if structured properly. Also, most certainly great asset to have for P!\"However Epstein did not buy it then either.In November 2011, Citigroup split EMI into two parts and, the following year, sold it to Universal and a consortium involving Sony and record executive David Geffen.The DOJ files show other discussions between Epstein and associates about buying model agencies and fashion-related businesses, which also did not go ahead.French prosecutors have previously suspected that Epstein used his contact in the fashion industry, Jean-Luc Brunel, to house and transport young girls.More on this story",

    "body": "We traded our London terraced home for an 80-acre nature reserve in Wales6 hours agoAmelia Shone-AdamsBBC WalesLou BournsAdam and Lou have always been passionate about being in the outdoors, making many trips to west Wales in their campervanIt was a decision that shocked their friends - quitting life on a busy terraced street in London for rural Wales. But after being continually drawn back in their campervan, Adam and Lou Bourns decided to leave their life in Brixton and start afresh in Carmarthenshire. They have spent 14 years turning their nature reserve into an award-winning sustainable glamping retreat.Everything has been built from scratch, and as they share the hills with Exmoor ponies, their busy fast-paced lives in London seem like a distant memory.\"We just kept on getting drawn over the bridge [to Wales],\" said Lou.\"Every opportunity we could dash out of London in our campervan and come west, we would.\"It's a very special place.\"Adam grew up in rural Norfolk and worked as a sound engineer, while Lou was born in the Netherlands and had a career in arts education in London.Despite both being successful in their chosen jobs, and having young children growing up surrounded by the buzz of the city on a London terraced street, they felt something was missing.\"The business was always part of the dream,\" said Lou. \"It was kind of our way of changing our pace of life, having something a bit more gentle for the kids, living closer to nature.\"Lou added: \"We just kind of had this strong feeling that it felt like a time for change.\" Under Starry SkiesAdam and Lou moved to west Wales from London in 2012After spending a few years looking at properties, the couple, who bonded over their love of nature, camping and outdoor activities, came across the 80-acre piece of land in the Carmarthenshire countryside.While family and friends were initially shocked the couple were moving to Wales to open a glamping retreat, Lou and Adam felt they were vindicated in making the life-changing decision when their new neighbours started popping around to introduce themselves and offer a hand with unpacking. \"Moving from a big city where you quite often don't know anyone, this has just been so precious,\" Lou said. Under Starry SkiesFamily and friends were initially shocked that the couple were moving to Wales to open a glamping retreatSince then Adam has slowly built everything from scratch over the years, with help from friends and family. There are now two cabins, a shepherd's hut and a barn. \"The whole thing's been really slow and organic, but it works well that way,\" he said. It has all been made as eco-consciously as possible, with the cabins completely off grid including tanks for collecting rain water, solar panels for power, and gas bottles for cooking.The couple do all the cleaning, washing and maintenance - with the help of four Exmoor ponies who live on the land. Their grazing helps with land conservation and encouraging wildflowers to grow.Under Starry SkiesRosemarie, Jasper, Nora and Bear live on the land full time.Since 2017, the land has also been home to several beehives.These are cared for by a local beekeeper, with their honey available at the on-site honesty shop.In 2020, Marsh Fritillary butterfly larvae webs and Brown Hairstreak butterfly eggs were laid at the retreat and continue to thrive there. Both species are in decline due to habitat loss, making their presence even more important.Under Starry SkiesThe land is also home to several beehives, with their honey available at the on-site honesty shop.The retreat has won awards over the years for their sustainability.In 2018 they were named Silver Sustainable Tourism Business of the Year by the Carmarthenshire Tourism Association, and in 2025 they won an award for being the best stargazing accommodation in Carmarthenshire.  The couple couldn't imagine living anywhere else.Lou added: \"I can't believe we actually lived in such a busy, fast-paced place because I don't know that I would be happy there now.\"But do they miss anything at all about London?Adam, who used to cycle to and from work regardless of the time of day, something that isn't always possible in Wales, said: \"You get a bit more headspace if you're on your bike rather than being jammed in the Tube with someone's armpit in your face.\"More top stories",

An autopsy did not reveal any evidence of foul play.Griffiths co-founded Asos in 2000 and remained a significant shareholder after leaving the firm five years later.City AM/ShutterstockQuentin Griffiths, pictured in 2008A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We are supporting the family of a British national who has died in Thailand and are in contact with the local authorities.\"Police in Pattaya told the BBC Griffiths was found dead outside a luxury hotel where he had been staying in as a long-term resident in a suite on the 17th floor.He was involved in two ongoing court cases that might have caused him stress, police also told the BBC.Griffiths was separated from his second wife, a Thai national, and had reportedly been engaged in a legal dispute with her over a business they ran together, the BBC understands.He co-founded Asos in London with Nick Robertson, Andrew Regan and Deborah Thorpe.Its name originally stood for As Seen On Screen as it sold fashion inspired by clothing worn by TV and film stars.It grew to become an online fashion marketplace stocking hundreds of brands as well as its own lines and at one time was valued at more than £6bn.Its largest shareholders include Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen - who owns Danish clothing giant Bestseller and Mike Ashley, owner of Frasers Group.Additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone in BangkokIf you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support in the UK are available at BBC Action Line",

    "body": "8 minutes agoShakira AbdiBusiness reporterGetty ImagesAn increase in demand for sports supplements likely driven by New Year's resolutions helped lift retail sales by more than expected to 1.8% in January.Continuing strong sales from online jewellers after a recent spike in gold prices was a key driver in the increase, as were artwork and antique auctions.The 1.8% increase in January was the strongest monthly growth since May 2024, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show, and much higher than the 0.2% predicted by some economists.But analysts said the uptick could be temporary, as sales nearly flatlined in the three months to January, and a weak jobs market potentially added to consumer caution.Sales volumes in non-store retailing, which is mostly online, grew by 3.4% over the month.Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said the weather played its part here, pushing people away from the high street and onto their laptops.She said: \"New year health goals also sent many of us who overindulged during the festive period on the hunt for sports supplements as we pushed our bodies back into exercise mode.\"Sales volumes in the \"other non-food stores\" category saw the biggest increase in percentage terms, rising 5.3% over the month.The ONS said this was partly driven by auctions of artwork and antiques, which analysts said could also be linked to soaring gold prices.But Hewson cautioned that the monthly rise should be taken with \"a big pinch of salt\", citing ONS figures showing sales volumes grew by just 0.1% in the three months to January.\"It's clear consumers are still under pressure and still making complicated decisions about where to spend every penny,\" she said.Separate ONS data released this week put unemployment at a near five-year high at the end of last year, with wage growth also slowing to 4.2%.Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the surge in sports supplement sales suggested that \"the new year resolution health-kick has made the economy look more healthy\".\"But with employment growth weak and wage growth slowing, households won't be able to maintain this rate of spending,\" he added.",

Around 15 out of 100 breast cancers are of this type.Cats develop this subtype more often than humans, giving scientists access to samples, and offering clues to new medicines that might help in treatment. Getty ImagesCancer is one of the leading causes of illness in catsAlmost a quarter of UK households own at least one cat, making the animal almost as popular as dogs as a trusted companion.But while cancer studies have been carried out extensively in dogs, cats have remained unexplored.The scientists say both household pets could give clues to environmental factors involved in some types of cancer.They share the same spaces as us, meaning that they are also exposed to the same environmental factors that we are. \"This can help us understand more about why cancer develops in cats and humans, how the world around us influences cancer risk, and possibly find new ways to prevent and treat it,\" said Prof Geoffrey Wood of the Ontario Veterinary College, Canada.The research is published in the journal, Science.",

    "body": "Break from wintry weather as UK temperatures to climb as high as 14CImage source, BBCWeatherWatchers/NadeznaImage caption, Daffodils in the Vale of Glamorgan on Thursday. Spring is just around the cornerByDarren BettLead Weather PresenterA major change in the UK's weather pattern is heading our way.The brief spell of cold weather with frost, ice and hill snow is ending, with temperatures set to jump by up to 10C from Friday onwards.The blocked weather pattern which has been maintaining the recent wintry spell is being pushed away with milder air sticking around for the next week or so.It will be accompanied by further spells of wet weather coming across from the Atlantic. Heaviest rain is expected to be over western hills and the ongoing threat of flooding is likely to continue.How warm will it get?Image caption, Maximum temperatures this weekend will be higher than the average for mid FebruaryRecent days have seen temperatures typically 4C or 5C (39-41F) by day and as low as minus 9C (16F) in Scotland at night. It also felt colder in the strong south-easterly wind.The cold air is being pushed away to the east of the UK and a change to south-westerly winds will bring much milder air from the Atlantic. Daytime temperatures will be 10-14 Celsius (50-57F) in many parts of the country over the weekend and into next week. The risk of frost is much reduced with temperatures at night generally falling to 5-9 Celsius (41-48F).There has been a stark lack of mild days in Scotland this year, with the start of 2026 marking the longest wait for the temperature to reach 12C (54F) in the country since 1986.Why such a significant change?Image caption, Jet stream further north allowing south-westerly winds to lift temperaturesThe cold blocking area of high pressure over Scandinavia that has been in place for much of 2026 so far is being pushed away. That means milder winds can push across the whole of northern Europe more consistently. The jet stream, which has been positioned across the UK for the last few weeks will move further north at times, keeping the UK in warmer air. Risk of flooding to continueImage source, BBCWeatherWatchers/s PaceImage caption, Flooding in Datchet. A large number of flood warnings are in southern EnglandThe persistence of the rain has led to the flooding many parts of the UK have experienced. Parts of Cornwall have had rain falling on each of the last 50 days. Katesbridge in Northern Ireland and Aboyne in Scotland have already had half a years rainfall in just a few weeks.Image caption, Wettest places in each home nation with rainfall totals all well above averageThe predominantly south-westerly winds over the next few weeks will bring in spells of rain and areas of low pressure from time to time. The wettest weather is expected to be over western hills. That means a change of fortune in Scotland, where up to now it has been extremely wet in eastern Scotland but drier than normal in the west of the country.The recent snowfall will also melt rapidly as temperatures rise.Given saturated ground in many parts of the UK and flood warnings, mainly in England, the risk of flooding will remain a concern well in to March.You can find the longer range forecast here.",

    "body": "5 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinWatch: Obama gave \"classified information\" with alien comments, says TrumpUS President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to \"begin the process of identifying and releasing\" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life. Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said \"aliens are real\" on a podcast last week. \"He's not supposed to be doing that,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: \"He made a big mistake.\"Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: \"Well, I don't know if they're real or not.\"Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. \"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,\" Obama said. \"There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.\"After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe. In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: \"I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!\" Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire \"lightning\" round of questions on the podcast.There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and \"doesn't have an opinion on it\". Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that \"based on the tremendous interest shown\" he will seek the release of files \"related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters\".The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a secret Pentagon programme to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.In 2022, Congress held the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter - setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.The following year, a US House of Representatives panel on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the Pentagon said there was \"no evidence\" that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterBBCMisley Mandarin (L) says the British will have to \"drag me from my beach\"A judge has issued an order to temporarily block the deportation of four Chagossians who travelled to the Chagos Islands to protest against a deal to hand over the territory to Mauritius.The Chagossians arrived on a remote part of the archipelago on Monday after sailing from Sri Lanka, with the aim of establishing a permanent settlement on their \"homeland\".British authorities served the four men with eviction papers, which warned them they could face fines or jail if they did not leave.But lawyers representing the men have successfully applied for an injunction to prevent their removal for at least seven days.The BBC has asked the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) for comment.In his ruling, the judge upheld challenges about an unreasonable delay or failure to grant the men permits to visit the territory and the lawfulness of the removal orders.\"There is no doubt the balance of convenience falls on the side of the claimants,\" James Lewis KC, chief justice of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), said.\"They are 120 miles (193km) from Diego Garcia and pose no threat to national security on the evidence before me. If they are deported they will have great difficulties in returning.\"The judge said the British administrators of the Chagos Islands had seven days to respond to the ruling.The lawyers supporting the Chagossians said they were prepared to go to court if the removal orders were not dropped.The FCDO had branded their journey an \"illegal, unsafe stunt\" and said they did not pose any security risk to the UK-US military based on Diego Garcia.A UK government spokesperson said: \"Under BIOT law, there is no legal right for anyone to enter the territory without a valid permit, regardless of their citizenship or heritage.\"Misley Mandarin, one of the British-Chagossians who journeyed to the territory, said he had come \"peacefully, respectfully, and without threat to anyone - simply to stand on our homeland again\".He said he and the other four men \"remain committed to pursuing our rights lawfully, with dignity and determination.\"He had told the BBC the British would have to \"drag me from my beach\" and \"kill me\" if they wanted him to leave.Mandarin and the other three Chagossians on the islands are backed by the Great British PAC, a right-wing British political pressure group.Their visit to the territory is being funded by donations organised by the group, which is campaigning against the British government's Chagos Islands deal.One of Manarin's lawyers, barrister James Tumbridge, said the BIOT and FCDO \"had ignored our requests for permits, but the judge was willing to take an urgent application and deal with it whilst flying over Africa\".\"This injunction gives a proper chance to understand when a deportation is appropriate,\" he said.Trump pressureThe ruling further complicates the UK's government's ongoing efforts to hand over control of the islands to Mauritius.Britain has controlled the Chagos Islands since 1814 and evicted its inhabitants in the 1960s to make way for a military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia.The islands became formally established as an overseas territory in 1965, after the British government paid Mauritius a £3m grant to retain the archipelago.But last year, the UK government agreed to hand over control of the islands to Mauritius, arguing the future of the military base had been threatened by recent international court decisions.Under the deal, the UK has agreed to pay £101m annually for 99 years to keep control of the UK-US military base.The deal is now in doubt, after US President Donald Trump posted on his Trust Social platform to urge Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to not \"give away Diego Garcia\".The deal has also not gone down well with many people of Chagossian descent, who were granted the right to claim British citizenship in 2022.Many Chagossians see the deal as a betrayal and want to see the UK retain sovereignty over the islands so they can one day return to their homeland.But while many do oppose the deal, Chagossians - who live in the UK, Mauritius and the Seychelles - do not speak with one voice.",

It’s also triggered a number of conspiracy theories online about the presidential bunker that sits underneath the East Wing of the White House.\nAnd, Sarah and Marianna speak to White House historian and First Lady specialist Katherine Sibley about the historic significance of the East Wing, what’s being lost in its demolishment, and what Melania Trump might think about losing her office in the complex.\nHOSTS:\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Correspondent\nGUEST\n• Katherine Sibley, White House historian\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve, Alix Pickles, Kris Jalowiecki and Rufus Gray.

Police  were working to establish the breed of the animal and no arrests had been made.Ch Supt John Davies said: \"Officers are on scene and will be making further inquiries as the investigation progresses.\"Residents said they were in in utter disbelief at the death of the child, with the community in shock and trying to come to terms with what had happened. They said they saw police cars and ambulances on the quiet residential street in south Wales at the time of the incident. By 22:00 the police cordon had been lifted and all the ambulances and most police cars had gone, replaced by scenes of crime investigation vehicles.At this time two police officers were still guarding a house on Crossway, a street now silent but for the hum of cars on the M4 and trains on the south Wales to London line.",

    "body": "Hamas has handed over three coffins it says contain the bodies of deceased Gaza hostages, according to the Israeli military.Israel has received the coffins, via the Red Cross in the Gaza Strip, and transported them to Israel for formal identification.If confirmed as deceased hostages, it would mean eight Israeli and foreign deceased  hostages remain in Gaza.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Israel that started last month, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding.Israel has accused Hamas of being too slow to return the deceased hostages, while Hamas has said it is working to recover bodies trapped under rubble in the territory.Hamas's armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said the remains had been found earlier on Sunday \"along the route of one of the tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip\".Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official X account said: \"All of the hostages' families have been updated accordingly, and our hearts are with them in this difficult hour. The effort to return our hostages is ongoing and will not cease until the last hostage is returned.\"Hamas and Israel have accused each other of violating the ceasefire.On Sunday, an Israeli air strike killed a man in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military said it had struck a militant that was posing a threat to its soldiers. Under the first phase of the ceasefire, all the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 225 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 15 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Prior to Sunday, nine of the 11 dead hostages still in Gaza were Israelis, one was Tanzanian, and one was Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,500 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "An earthquake has struck northern Afghanistan near Mazar-e Sharif, one of the country's largest cities around 20:30 GMT (01:00 local time).The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.3 and a depth of 28km (17 miles), according to the US Geological Survey. The agency also warned of \"significant casualties\" and \"potentially widespread\" disaster.A Taliban spokesman in Balkh province - of which Mazar-e Sharif is the capital -wrote on X that four people have died and \"many people are injured\" in Sholgara district. The BBC is unable to verify this figure independently. In an earlier post, Haji Zaid wrote that they had received \"reports of minor injuries and superficial damages from all districts of the province\". \"Most of the injuries were caused by people falling from tall buildings,\" he wrote.Mazar-e Sharif is home to more than 500,000 people. Many of the city's residents rushed to the streets when the quake struck, as they feared their houses would collapse, AFP reported.The Taliban spokesman in Balkh also posted a video on X appearing to show debris strewn across the ground at the Blue Mosque, a local landmark in Mazar-e-Sharif.The religious complex is believed to house the tomb of the first Shia Imam - a religious leader believed to hold divine knowledge. It's now a site where pilgrims gather to pray and celebrate religious events.Khalid Zadran, a Taliban spokesman for the police in Kabul, wrote on X that police teams were \"closely monitoring the situation\". The quake on Monday comes after a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan's mountainous eastern region in late August, killing more than 1,000 people.That earthquake was especially deadly as the rural houses in the region were typically made of mud and timber. Residents were trapped when their houses collapsed during the quake.Afghanistan is very prone to earthquakes because of its location on top of a number of fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.",

    "body": "4 hours agoFrank Gardnersecurity correspondent, in BahrainNato \"will stand with Ukraine up to the day in which we will have them sitting around the table for a long-lasting peace\", a senior official from the military alliance has told the BBC.Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, chair of Nato's military committee since January, added from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was bogged down, and \"it was almost time to sit and talk because it's a waste of lives\".Pointing to the fact that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had resulted in two more countries joining the Western alliance - Finland and Sweden - Adm Dragone described the war as a strategic failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite recent slow, incremental advances by Russia on the battlefield. \"They will not get a friendly or puppet government like in Belarus. Putin will not succeed.\"Asked if European nations were prepared to keep going with supporting Ukraine's defence, he said they were. It was beneficial, he believed that they had had something of a wake-up call and were now taking charge of their own defence.In June, Nato members agreed to raise their defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. The move followed repeated urges from US President Donald Trump for members to do so.On Russia's recent announcement about long-range, nuclear-powered weapons like the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, the former Italian chief of defence staff and naval aviator played down concerns by Nato, saying that it was a defensive nuclear alliance. \"We are not threatened by them,\" he said, \"we are just ready to defend our 32 nations and our one billion people. We are a nuclear alliance.\"On the risk of future invasions or attacks, Adm Dragone said if - and he emphasised the conditional here - there was to be anywhere it would likely be the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But he pointed out that as Nato states Article 5 would be requested - which considers an attack on one nation to be equivalent to an attack on all - and that Nato would come to their defence. Asked if that included the US, he replied: \"Yes, because they have committed to this and they have underlined that they are still in the business.\"Of all Nato defence needs right now, Adm Dragone said air defence was the top priority. Recent incursions by Russian drones into Poland and Romania have prompted the alliance to upgrade its air defences. Regarding the possibility of activating a notional \"drone wall\" on Nato's eastern borders, he said this would be done within months and that \"the alliance's Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk [Virginia] is already working on that\".\"There is a lot of stuff on the market which will fulfil our immediate needs so we set up a new activity which is Eastern Sentry... integrating all the air defence that we already have on our eastern flank. \"Airspace incursions are pretty frequent, we escort them out and that's basically the game,\" the admiral said.Despite no sign that Russia is changing course on the war in Ukraine and despite signs that some members - notably Slovakia and Hungary - are increasingly opposed to supporting Ukraine's defence, Adm Dragone ended on a positive note. \"The alliance is reliable, it is mature, there is a cohesion which is our centre of gravity.\"\"The alliance is stronger than our adversaries, and we will stay with Ukraine up to the day that peace will break out,\" he added.",

    "body": "Private baby scan clinics putting expectant mothers at risk33 minutes agoJim ReedHealth reporterGetty ImagesSome high-street clinics are putting lives at risk by allowing unqualified non-specialists to carry out baby scans, the Society of Radiographers (SoR) has warned.The trade union says its members have seen examples of pregnant women being incorrectly diagnosed with serious health conditions and given dangerous advice.Other expectant mums have been sent to hospital after being told an abnormality meant they would need to end the pregnancy only to find their baby was completely healthy.It is concerned that anyone using an ultrasound machine can call themselves a sonographer and offer the service - often sold as a reassurance, souvenir or sexing scan - ahead of the routine 20-week NHS check.Dangerous advice\"One time, we had a lady referred [to hospital] from a private clinic, who was eight or nine weeks pregnant,\" says Elaine Brooks, Midlands regional officer at the SoR.\"The sonographer at the private clinic said there was no heartbeat and that the baby was very, very malformed, and they sent her in for an induced miscarriage.\"We started scanning the lady, who was in tears, and on the scan there was a clearly beautiful nine-week pregnancy with a heartbeat. It was absolutely fine.\"A BBC investigation in 2020 uncovered similar failures in the diagnosis of serious medical issues during private baby scans.It heard reports of women who were bleeding and in pain being accepted for scans, rather than being told to contact their doctor.Bad practice and sexual misconductThe trade union, which is also the professional body for medical imaging, says it has seen other examples of bad practice by some private clinics including:Major foetal abnormalities such as spina bifida or polycystic kidneys being missedEctopic pregnancies, where the fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, either not being diagnosed or being falsely diagnosedA radiographer continuing to work as a private sonographer despite having been struck off and banned from working for the NHS due to sexual misconduct The president of the SoR, Katie Thompson, said there were some \"really great\" private services offering checks with properly trained staff, but she was particularly concerned about the growth of pop-up clinics in shopping centres and on high streets selling souvenir images or scans to reveal the sex of the baby.She said she was aware of another case where a private scan late in pregnancy did not record the baby was still breech or lying bottom first in the uterus. The mother was not immediately referred to the NHS and the baby later died. Getty ImagesPrivate clinics often offer reassurance or sexing scans before the standard NHS anomaly scan which is normally offered between 18 and 21 weeks into the pregnancyThe SoR is now calling for sonographer to become a protected job title in the UK in the same way as dietician, podiatrist, art therapist or radiographer.That would mean only those who are properly qualified and registered with a regulatory body would be allowed to use that job description.Many private sonographers are already qualified midwives or radiographers, and  accredited training courses are also available, although this is currently not a legal requirement.Individual sonographers can also decide to join the Register of Clinical Technologists, which the public can then search to see if certain standards have been met, but again participation is voluntary.The Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care recently carried out a public interest test of that register and has written to the government to say the \"risks appear sufficiently high\" that it should consider if stronger regulation of sonographers may be needed.The Care Quality Commission which inspects private clinics said many were providing good quality care, but it \"remains concerned that some are not\" with worries over staff training, consent policies and procedures for escalating unusual findings. Where its inspections identify concerns it said it would \"hold providers to account and make clear that action is required to ensure staff are adequately trained\".In a statement, the Department of Health said the safety of patients was paramount and the regulation of all healthcare professionals was kept under review.\"We will carefully consider any proposals from professional bodies regarding this,\" added a spokesman.",

    "body": "An avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains has killed five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, according to rescuers. The mountaineers, travelling in separate groups, were scaling Cima Vertana in the Ortler Alps at around 16:00 local time on Saturday when the fast-moving snow hit.  A group of three people \"was fully swept away by the avalanche\" and all died, said Italy's Alpine rescue service, Soccorso Alpino e Speleologico.Separately, the father and daughter were carried away by the avalanche and their bodies were recovered on Sunday. Two other climbers in a third party survived.The alarm was raised by the survivors, triggering the rescue operation.Olaf Reinstadler, a spokesperson for the Sulden Mountain Rescue Service, told German media that the avalanche on the 3,545-metre (11,630ft) mountain, also called Vertainspitze, could have been caused by recent snow drifts which had not bonded to the ice below.He said climbing tours were popular and the weather conditions were good, but wondered why the mountaineers were climbing late in the afternoon, as the descent would have then taken until nightfall.The bodies of the three people climbing together were recovered on Saturday before rescue efforts were suspended due to fading light and safety conditions. The Alpine rescue service said that due to fog and low visibility, helicopters could not take off at first light on Sunday.However, once conditions improved, rescuers and avalanche dog units were airlifted to 2,600 metres before setting out on foot.By late morning, the bodies of the two missing mountaineers - the father and daughter - were found.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersLast month's jewellery heist at the Louvre museum was carried out by petty criminals rather than organised crime professionals, Paris's prosecutor has said.\"This is not quite everyday delinquency... but it is a type of delinquency that we do not generally associate with the upper echelons of organised crime,\" Laure Beccuau told franceinfo radio.She said four people arrested and charged so far over the theft that shocked France and the world were \"clearly local people\" living in Seine-Saint-Denis, an impoverished area just north of Paris. Jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the most-visited museum, in the French capital, on 19 October.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenIn Sunday's interview to franceinfo radio, Beccuau said the four arrested people - three men and a woman - \"all live more or less in Seine-Saint-Denis\".She said two of the male suspects had been known to the police, as they each had multiple theft convictions.On Saturday, a 38-year-old woman was charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime.Separately, a man, aged 37, was charged with theft and criminal conspiracy.The suspects - who have not been publicly named - both denied any involvement.Beccuau said the two were in a relationship and had children together, without giving any further details.Two men who had previously been arrested were already charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after officials said they had \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the heist.Investigators believe four men carried out the daylight theft, and one of them is still on the run.Three other people detained earlier this week have been released without charge.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOn the day of the heist, the suspects arrived at 09:30 local time (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Ms Beccuau told reporters last week.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape. The other seven jewels have not been found.The fear is that they have already been spirited abroad, though the prosecutor in charge of the case has said she is still hopeful they can be retrieved intact.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist.",

    "body": "France's consumer watchdog has reported fast fashion giant Shein to authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website. The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said in a statement that the online description and categorisation of the dolls \"makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content\", French media reported.Shein told the BBC: \"The products in question were immediately delisted as soon as we became aware of these serious issues.\" It said its team was \"investigating how these listings circumvented our screening measures\".Shein is also \"conducting a comprehensive review to identify and remove any similar items that may be listed on our marketplace by other third-party vendors\".The DGCCRF has reported Shein to French prosecutors as well as Arcom, the country's online and broadcasting regulator, according to French media.The news has emerged just days before Shein is set to open its first permanent physical shop anywhere in the world - in a Parisian department store.The decision to allow Shein to open at BHV Marais, a shop in France's capital city that traces its roots back to 1856, has provoked controversy. The company has faced criticism for its labour practices and environmental record.Shein will open at BHV on Wednesday ahead of other shops across France, all owned by property firm Société des Grands Magasins.Commenting on the dolls sold on Shein's site, France's consumer watchdog warned that \"the dissemination, via an electronic communications network, of child pornography is punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment and a fine of €100,000 (£88,000)\".Shein said it \"maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any content or products that violate our platform policies or applicable laws\".A spokesperson said the fast fashion firm is taking the matter \"extremely seriously\".\"We are taking immediate corrective actions and reinforcing our internal controls to prevent this from happening again,\" they said. Shein has already been fined millions of euros in recent months.In September, France's data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de L'informatique et des Libertés, imposed a €150m (£132m) penalty on Shein for failing to get users' consent to allow \"cookies\" which collect information about people visiting a website.  Shein is contesting the fine, which it called \"wholly disproportionate\" and \"politically motivated\".",

    "body": "17 hours agoTheo LeggettBusiness CorrespondentJas BainsJas Bains alerted Danish authorities to a £1bn tax scam and they hit him with a lawsuit\"We'd be met at airports in 20-foot limousines, and taken to places like the Atlantis hotel in Dubai or the Singapore Grand Prix. There'd be a hundred grand spent in the bar.\"In 2013, Jas Bains was an ambitious young lawyer, enjoying the high life that came with working for an extremely profitable City hedge fund.Today, he is jobless and has lost most of his wealth, having spent years fighting legal battles and attempting to clear his name of association with a huge tax scam.The irony, he says, is that he blew the whistle on the scam in the first place – only to find himself one of the targets of a £1.4bn lawsuit.He is reflecting one month after the case ended, bringing to a close eight years of legal arguments and one of the highest value civil cases ever heard in the UK.The Danish tax authority was left licking its wounds, after failing to establish that a large group of defendants, including Mr Bains, were liable for huge losses it had suffered.It all began in 2009, when a banker named Sanjay Shah established a London-based hedge fund called Solo Capital. It also had offices in Dubai. It was one of a network of funds, banks and legal outfits that were to become heavily implicated in the so-called cum-ex trade.This focused on transactions where shares were sold from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend (cum, or with, dividend) but delivered afterwards (ex-dividend).Those involved exploited delays in processing the sale to create confusion over who actually owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. This tactic allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued.From the outside, it was complicated, but for those involved it led to ever bigger and more elaborate trades which ultimately cost taxpayers across Europe billions.It initially became popular in Germany, before spreading to other countries including France, Belgium, Italy and Austria. Solo Capital targeted Denmark, with the bulk of its cum-ex trades taking place from 2013 onwards.Jas Bains joined the company in 2010, as its head lawyer, but went on to run the London office. At the time, Solo was \"a successful firm, making money in five or six different areas pretty well\".Getty ImagesSanjay Shah was imprisoned in Denmark in a separate criminal trial last year And making money meant enjoying the high life, with staff going on sprees to places like Las Vegas, Singapore and Dubai.\"What I will say about Sanjay is he knew how to throw a party,\" he says.\"One time we were in the Ku De Ta club at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore. He bought 20 bottles of vintage Dom Perignon champagne, and people were just spraying each other with the stuff.\"People have likened it to Wolf of Wall Street and such like.\"It didn't end there. \"Sanjay organised private concerts in Dubai with Prince. A small room with him and his friends at three or four million dollars for an evening ... private concerts with Snoop Dogg.\"By mid-2014, however, Mr Bains had fallen out with his boss and left the company for a competitor. At the time, the cum-ex transactions targeting Denmark were dramatically picking up.\"I was hearing from people who'd left Solo that Sanjay was doing some big trades in 2014, but look, I'd moved on, it didn't have much to do with me,\" he says.\"But then I heard, actually Sanjay made close to €100m in trades from Denmark in 2013, closer to €250m in 2014 and he was looking for a billion in 2015.\"Alarm bells were ringing.Jas BainsAt the height of his career Jas Bains enjoyed living the high life in Las Vegas, Singapore and Dubai.\"I thought this can't be right. It's not that I thought the trades were invalid or criminal in some way. It's just any country that has a billion Euros syphoned off it will scream bloody murder.\"Solo Capital wasn't the only company now targeting Denmark. Others were getting in on the act. Jas believed it was only a matter of time before the house of cards came tumbling down.\"I was quite confident I'd done nothing wrong, but I knew if this carried on and blew up in spectacular style, I was going to get pulled in,\" he explains.With that in mind, in 2015, he decided to blow the whistle.He contacted a Danish lawyer, who in turn put him in touch with the Danish police. He went on to spend two and a half years assisting them with understanding how the cum-ex scam worked.Danish prosecutors did not target Mr Bains. Their attention was focused firmly on Mr Shah. The 54-year-old was eventually extradited from Dubai to face fraud charges – and in December last year was sentenced to 12 years in jail.It was the heaviest penalty ever handed out in Denmark for a fraud case. He is currently appealing.'Impossible to get a job'But when the Danish tax authority, Skatteforvaltningen (Skat), launched its huge case, seeking to recover its lost money, Mr Bains was one of the more than 100 individual and corporate defendants initially targeted - alongside Mr Shah.With that lawsuit hanging over him it became out of the question for him to work as a lawyer, or to get a role in the City of London. \"It's impossible to get a job if you're being sued as part of a two billion dollar international tax fraud case,\" he says.However, in October, High court judge Mr Justice Andrew Baker threw out Skat's claims.Acknowledging that \"greed can be a powerful motive, and I consider there was substantial greed here\", he nevertheless concluded that Skat has failed to prove it was a victim of deception.The authority's \"controls for assessing and paying dividend tax refund claims were so flimsy as to be non-existent,\" he said.That seemed to echo a statement previously made by Mr Shah in a 2021 German TV interview, which was also cited in the ruling:\"Why would they pay out for years and years and then, after four years of payments they say, 'Oh, we made a mistake, or we were cheated'\", he said.\"If there's a big sign on the street saying 'please help yourself', then me or somebody else would go and help themselves.\"There may still be an appeal. But for Mr Bains, the ruling provided some much-needed closure – and, he says, a chance to move on.",

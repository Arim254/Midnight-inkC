    "body": "5 hours agoLuke MintzBBC NewsBBCOne morning in May 2024, Doris Suchet noticed something was amiss outside her flat in north Oxford. A chunk of pavement had been repainted into a parking bay for electric scooters. The box was labelled \"E-scooter hire\" in large white letters, and Suchet says it obstructed a walkway for her neighbours.\"These are elderly people, then you have younger families, mums with prams… there's no chance in hell that person can manoeuvre around a scooter badly parked randomly in the middle of the pavement,\" she says.She embarked on a battle with the council to get it removed. In one email she wrote, \"I and all residents of the apartment block are appalled and demand this rank be removed swiftly, with immediate effect.\"The council says that the bay allowed a two metre space on the pavement for pedestrians to walk.Eventually, Suchet won. With agreement from the council, the Swedish company Voi (which operates the city's fleet of e-scooters) repainted the pavement back to its original state a few weeks after the parking bay was installed. But Suchet says the e-scooters - part of a shared transport scheme introduced in 2021 - are still parked haphazardly around the area, blocking pavements.\"They are absolutely everywhere,\" she sighs.Oxford Pedestrian AssociationResidents in Oxford have complained of e-scooters parked inconveniently on pavementsTo an outsider, the situation in Oxford might seem like a classic local skirmish between angry residents and their council. In fact, it's a microcosm of battles happening across the country.The biggest operator in the UK is the California-based Lime, with tens of thousands of e-bikes in London alone. In 2024, London's Brent Council threatened to remove their bikes over parking issues before an agreement was reached. Meanwhile in December, Islington Council told Lime and fellow operator Forest to improve parking or face losing permission to operate in the borough. Both companies said they were working with the council.Council-approved e-bike and e-scooter schemes have been introduced in virtually every major British town and city over the last decade. For their users, they represent freedom and convenience; cutting journey times and carbon emissions. But for opponents they are an ugly, obstructive blight on Britain's urban landscape.To soothe concerns about obstructed pavements, councils are now installing parking bays directly onto streets, permanently embedding the schemes into the architecture of cities. But deciding where those bays should go creates headaches. Painting them on pavements risks angering pedestrians (as Suchet's case shows). To avoid that backlash, several London boroughs have instead moved towards placing the bays on the road - an approach that comes with its own problems.Now, Labour is introducing legislation that will give local officials more powers to regulate the schemes.Is it possible, or even desirable, to crack down on e-bike and e-scooter parking? And what does the growing culture war over these schemes tell us about who feels listened to in modern Britain - and who feels shut out?Docked vs docklessIt was London's Barclays bicycles in 2010 that kickstarted Britain's craze for \"micro-mobility\" schemes, in which users can rent a lightweight vehicle for a short period. Nicknamed \"Boris Bikes\", after the city's mayor, they quickly spread around the country. More than 2.6 million Britons used a bike-share scheme in the year to September 2025, according to the transport charity CoMoUK.But from about 2018 an important thing changed, says Richard Dilks, the charity's chief executive.Until then, schemes like Barclays's were docked hire schemes - meaning you had to wheel the bike into a physical holster (and listen to it click into place) after your journey finished.But after 2018, dockless schemes - where the bicycle or scooter could be left virtually anywhere - became more popular. This is what truly sparked the war over pavement space.Getty ImagesLondon's shared-hire bicycles were nicknamed 'Boris Bikes' after the city's then-mayor Boris Johnson, who demonstrated them in 2010 with Barclays Chairman Marcus AgiusLiverpool, Edinburgh, Milton Keynes, Oxford, and Brighton are among the places that have introduced some form of dockless bike or scooter scheme since the 2010s, though many of those places have since imposed rules about where the vehicles can be left.Matthew Lesh, who researched the topic for the Adam Smith Institute, a free market think tank, says that dockless schemes are \"far more convenient for users, because you don't have to start and stop at specific points\".Dockless schemes can usually operate over large areas of cities, benefiting poorer and badly connected neighbourhoods, says Lesh. In contrast, traditional docked schemes tend only to operate in city centres, he says, meaning they mostly help people who already have good transport links. London's docked Santander scheme mostly operates in zones one and two (in the city centre), whereas dockless schemes like Lime stretch all the way to zone five (in the outer fringes).\"It's a question of what kind of city do you want to be - a city that embraces innovative new technologies… or a relatively backwards, reactionary [city]?\", Lesh says.Getty ImagesLime e-bikes have become popular among young adults - including Timothée Chalamet, who cycled in on one for the premiere of his Bob Dylan biopicDockless schemes might also help the economy - something that Ant Breach, a director at the Centre for Cities, an economic think tank, says is explained by the \"agglomeration\" effect. The theory is that businesses perform better and workers get richer when they are based in big, dense cities, because of the concentration of knowledge. And the easier it is to get around a city, the richer it can become.For agglomeration to work at its best, travelling within a city would ideally be frictionless - and Dilks says that dockless e-bike schemes promise \"the ultimate flexibility\".'Breeding' e-bikes But still, many residents balk at the sight of their pavement space being taken away.Just one week after e-scooters were introduced to Newcastle in 2021, a councillor warned they were being \"dumped all over the place\". In Colchester, residents complained just last month about e-bikes being \"abandon[ed]\" on pavements, \"with no consideration for others\".Sushila Dhall, a psychotherapist who has lived in Oxford for 42 years, broadly welcomes e-vehicles as a green form of transport - but she thinks they should be parked on roads, not pavements.\"You can walk through central Oxford any time and you'll find at least one pavement blocked by e-scooters,\" she says. \"Even just one scooter… abandoned in the wrong place can block a route.\"Under its deal with the council, it is the responsibility of Voi, the e-scooter operator, to clear up badly parked vehicles in Oxford. Voi told the BBC they are \"working closely with the council and local groups to improve parking across the city\" and that they ban riders for repeat bad parking incidents.Oxfordshire County Council said that public hire e-scooters help to achieve \"safer, cleaner, less congested and more accessible streets\", adding: \"We encourage riders to use the e-scooters responsibly.\"Many authorities have responded to complaints by imposing tougher rules on where vehicles can be parked. In many cities riders are now asked to park their e-vehicle in a designated bay (with GPS trackers helping to ensure they do this).But this doesn't always soothe concern. For one, the parking bays are sometimes painted on pavements, not roads - meaning pedestrian space is still lost (as happened in Doris Suchet's case in Oxford). Plus, riders don't always follow the rules. The GPS is not totally precise, meaning often riders can simply leave a bike or scooter near a parking bay without incurring a penalty.E-scooters and e-bikes blocking sections of pavements in Liverpool (left) and south London (right)For David Spencer, a former Detective Chief Inspector at the Metropolitan Police, badly parked e-bikes are corrosive to our sense of fairness.\"It just has a negative impact on how we all feel about the state of our public realm,\" says Spencer, who is now head of crime and justice at the Policy Exchange think tank.\"You see [e-bikes] at specific street corners. It's almost like they breed - a couple of people park them, and then lots of people. [It] starts to take over,\" says Spencer.And there's one group in particular who say they feel largely silenced.Parking bay 'sprawl'I meet Erik Matthies at a busy street market in Lambeth, south London. It's a vibrant neighbourhood, popular with young people and tourists - but it's also said to be a hotspot for e-bike clutter. That's why we've come here today.Matthies, who is registered blind and a policy lead at the Royal National Institute of Blind People, says e‑bike pavement clutter is the top transport complaint he hears from blind people.\"This has changed so much in only the last few years,\" Matthies says.He shows me what he means. Walking away from an underground station, it's less than two minutes until we reach our first obstacle: a single e-scooter, parked in the middle of the pavement.\"It looks like someone left it there, hopped off to whatever they were doing and never thought about the scooter again,\" he tells me with an exasperated sigh.After another few minutes of walking, we reach a street corner littered with e-bikes and e-scooters. It's a classic case of parking bay-sprawl: there's an official parking box painted on the road, but many of the vehicles have been left outside the boundary, meaning they block much of the pavement. Some are lopsided on the ground.Erik Matthies, who is registered blind and relies on a white cane, shows the BBC a case of 'parking bay sprawl'Matthies uses a white cane to guide him over the ground and along walls, but he says that becomes near-impossible when the path is obstructed. \"The way we're trained to use white canes means that I would come up to this junction, expecting the corner, curb, everything to [feel] a certain way, in a certain position. But I can't access any of that - it's covered with bikes and scooters.\"Lambeth Council told us it is \"unacceptable\" for e-bikes to block walkways for disabled and elderly people, or parents pushing buggies. They say they are rolling out dedicated parking bays across the borough and telling riders they have to park within them. Lime, the US company that operates most of the bikes we came across, says they will usually remove a badly parked bike within a few hours of it being reported to them. Riders who flout rules are warned and sometimes fined, they say, with repeat offenders banned.Even most of those campaigners who enthusiastically support the roll-out of e-bikes say that the experience of disabled people like Matthies needs addressing. Dilks of CoMoUK says there is \"no excuse\" for e-bikes to block pavements, and says some rules are needed.Labour's regulationOne option is to beef up the powers of local officials.The Labour government is trying to do that via its English Devolution Bill, which is at committee stage in the House of Lords.Currently, councils regulate these e-bike and e-scooter schemes (meaning rules can vary considerably over small areas). Labour's measure will shift that power to metro mayors, who cover larger areas. In London, decisions currently made by boroughs like Camden or Wandsworth would instead fall under the city mayor, Sadiq Khan.The Department for Transport says the measure will give mayors \"greater flexibility to shape schemes around their needs and tackle badly parked cycles quickly and decisively\". The Bill will also give officials the power to fine e-bike companies that break licence conditions, they added.More from InDepthBreach, of Centre for Cities, hopes it will allow mayors to impose sensible, consistent rules across cities, helping both riders and pedestrians.But Dilks says it \"remains to be seen\" whether the measure will actually reduce parking clutter, \"the original problem it's trying to solve\".He argues that whilst metro mayors will get the powers to set city-wide e-bike strategies, it will still be up to individual councils to actually build the necessary infrastructure. So, theoretically, a mayor like Khan or Andy Burnham could tell councils they want to see a new network of on-street parking bays - but if councils drag their feet, or say they can't afford it, there's a risk that little will happen, he says.The Copenhagen modelAnother option is to convert council-run car parking into space for e-bikes and e-scooters.This could be called the Copenhagen model. Since the 1970s, Danish planners have converted thousands of car park-spaces in the city into bicycle park-spaces. Copenhagen has now become renowned for its supersize bicycle parks, where thousands of personally-owned bikes and dockless e-bikes are clustered together.Tristan Fender admits it was a \"culture shock\" when he moved to the city from Germany last year. He commutes to his job at a Copenhagen newspaper via bicycle, and says it can sometimes be difficult just to find a bike amid the mess of metal and rubber.Tristan FenderCopenhagen has become famous for its bicycle parking\"It gets crazy. You'll leave your bike, come back and there's a person who's parked right next to you, and their pedal is stuck in your wheel. Or you try to pull out your bike and knock over the one next to you,\" says Fender.But any attempt to mess with roads or car parks comes loaded with risk. English councils made £2.16bn from car parking in 2024-25, according to the RAC Foundation. That amount will be hard to recoup from e-vehicle schemes, says Dilks. There's also the politics: drivers are a loud, powerful voting bloc, and they \"get uppity\" when they see parking space taken away, he says.Improving technologyMost analysts think that e-bike and e-scooter schemes are here to stay - and local skirmishes over how they are parked may simply become a fact of life.Breach wants to see e-bike schemes that are widely available - but also for rule-breaking users to face consequences. \"A balance has to be struck,\" he says.Technology might also ease the problem: more precise GPS tracking could make it easier to tell when an e-bike is parked inside or outside of a parking bay.Lesh takes a longer view, pointing out that virtually every advance in transport technology has come with controversy. \"When it came to the emergence of bicycles in the 19th Century, you saw all this discussion in the Times of London about how bicycles are menaces to society, going too quickly, causing far too much danger,\" he says.\"Over time, we get used to it.\"Top image credit: InPictures / Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "'The second home ban has breathed new life into my village' 4 hours agoJo LonsdaleBBC North East and Cumbria InvestigationsBBCMany generations of Jennifer Hall's family fished out of a now largely empty Beadnell Harbour Nearly eight years ago, Beadnell on the Northumberland coast became one of the first villages in the country to ban any homes built on new sites being used as second homes or holiday lets. The number of permanent residents has increased, bringing what some say is \"new life\" but others argue the policy is not enough to save rural communities or think it an unwarranted attack on tourism.Driving towards Beadnell harbour, 75-year-old Jennifer Hall nods one by one at the large houses overlooking the sea.\"Holiday let, second home, second home, holiday let, second home, holiday let,\" she intones. Clustered barnacle-like at the end of a glorious arc of sand, Beadnell, along with the neighbouring villages of Bamburgh and Seahouses, has long been a magnet for those seeking refuge from the madding crowd. According to the 2021 census, 64% of homes in Beadnell are second homes or holiday lets, up from 55% in 2011.Almost every house on Beadnell seafront is a holiday let or second homeHall's family has been in Beadnell since at least the 1700s. \"Fishing folk mainly,\" she says, but her great-grandmother opened the village's first hotel, an irony not lost on her given her years-long campaign against over-reliance on tourism. \"I don't hate holiday lets and I don't hate second homes at all,\" she says.\"But, in winter when there are no lights on, it can be very lonely.\" For much of the last half century, planning policy encouraged tourism. As recently as 2016, a new estate of 40 houses, Bernicia Way, was completed with a legal condition they could only be used as second homes or holiday lets. \"We were thinking there would come a point when there was nobody living here at all,\" Hall says.Among its policies was a requirement that all homes built on new sites would come with a legal restriction that they could only be used as a permanent residence. Planning policies previously supported tourism so the 40 homes in Bernicia Way, completed in 2016, can only be used as holiday lets or second homesAn estate of 45 houses called The Kilns was built and it included nine homes designated \"affordable\" - available for a set amount below market rate. The policy has been positive, Hall says, with the number of residents \"up by more than 10%\". \"It's really brought new life,\" she says. \"We have several new clubs in the village, and a fantastic new playground.\" Homes on The Kilns estate can only be lived in as permanent residencesAmong the newcomers to The Kilns determined to get \"stuck in\" to village life are Jacolyn Priestley-Jayes and Tim Jayes, both in their mid-sixties.They host a new monthly wine club, have joined Beadnell volunteers and Priestley-Jayes has begun a book club.  Jayes is also on the parish council \"for my sins\", he says with a wry smile. \"There's so much going on,\" his wife adds.Jacolyn Priestley-Jayes and Tim Jayes have begun a book club and a wine clubHall accepts the policy is \"not perfect\". Some houses in The Kilns remain unsold, and rumours abound that a few are being used as second homes despite the legal restriction.\"There are definitely some people who don't appear to be using their houses as their permanent residence, which is a shame,\" Priestley-Jayes says. Northumberland Estates, which was behind the project, said responsibility for enforcing the planning condition rests with Northumberland County Council and pointed out the residency requirement was \"very clearly communicated throughout the sales and marketing process\". The council said it would be inappropriate to comment further as the situation was \"part of an active investigation\".A further problem is the policy only applies to new sites.\"We've had developers buy up an old house, knock it down and replace it with a bigger property which has become holiday lets,\" Hall says. \"So that's a frustration.\"We've built The Kilns but there's not much space for more new houses.\" The parish council made a map using red and orange dots for holiday homes to demontrate how they dominate BeadnellDespite this, other villages have followed Beadnell in adopting the same policy. Helen Coyne, 72, has a flat in one of them, Alnmouth, with panoramic, ever-changing views of another of Northumberland's seemingly endless beaches. Although this is her second home, she says she understands the rationale behind the changes, and accepts the doubling of council tax since April last year. But she thinks second home owners contribute a lot to local businesses. \"We're here at least two or three nights every week, I use the lovely gift shop, we go out for meals, we drink in the pubs,\" she says.\"When family and friends stay, they do that even more.\"Helen Coyne, who has a holiday home in Alnmouth, says she tries hard to support local businessesBut Tim Farron, the MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale in Cumbria, says some second home owners visit \"just a couple of times a year\". \"They're definitely not sending their children to local schools either,\" he adds. The Liberal Democrat's constituency includes part of the Lake District National Park where one in four properties is a holiday home.Farron wants to go even further than applying restrictions to new-builds and is advocating a change in planning law.\"If I wanted to change my house into a fish and chip shop, I'd have to apply for planning permission,\" he says. \"But if I want to turn it into a second home or a holiday let, I can just do that. But it has a material impact on the community I live in.\"He wants separate categories of planning use for holiday lets and second homes, which would allow local authorities to limit their numbers.\"That way we can ensure rural communities don't die.\" The Lake District National Park Authority hopes to build affordable homes available only as a principal residenceThe Lake District National Park Authority's head of development management, Andrew Smith, agrees the current tools it has are \"quite limited\" and school populations continue to decline.The authority has set a target for 1,200 new permanent homes by 2035 but has no control over what happens to the existing housing stock.\"All you can do is approve or refuse new houses and try and facilitate new housing coming forward,\" he says. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it knew \"too many second homes and holiday lets can be harmful for communities\" and was taking action.Councils had the power to charge more council tax for second homes and the ministry was \"removing the incentive for landlords to prioritise short-term holiday lets over longer-term homes\", a spokesperson said.\"We'll continue to monitor impacts on communities and consider more powers for councils where needed,\" they added.PATourism revenue for the Lake District in 2024 was £2.3bnHowever, Richard Sayer, a former director of the North-East estate agents Rook Matthews Sayer, is wary of anything that might reduce the number of visitors.  \"An elderly person living permanently in a village has a perfect right to be there but is not hiring paddleboards and kayaks, or going to restaurants,\" he says.\"A holiday let with six people, they're spending thousands every week which is all going into the local economy.\"He has a holiday property near Keswick in Cumbria and thinks the doubling of council tax on second homes is already causing some to sell up. \"What is really needed is accommodation for the staff who work in the tourist industry, not fewer holiday homes,\" he adds. \"Every business in Keswick seems to have a sign up saying they are looking for staff.\"PAMore than half the properties in the Northumberland village of Bamburgh are second homes or holiday lets Back in Beadnell, on the kind of grey blustery day when the rain pecks at your face, the Craster Arms has a steady stream of windbent visitors. Owner Michael Dawson, who employs about a hundred staff across three cafes and pubs - \"young people, local people\" - also has little time for policies which deter second homes and holiday lets. \"The gift shops, ice-cream parlours, fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants,\" he says\"Make no mistake, we all rely on them.\"  Publican Michael Dawson would like to see even more holiday lets and second homes in Beadnell What everyone agrees on is rural communities need more young families amid falling birth rates and an ageing population.    There are about 750 properties in Beadnell but no school and only about 20 children. Esther Graham, 46, grew up in the village but could only afford to live there with her children by moving in with her parents, who extended their home to accommodate. \"There's nothing for the kids, no clubs, no brownies or scouts,\" she says.Like Hall, her family have been in Beadnell for centuries but she worries about future generations. \"What we need more than anything is affordable housing and more jobs,\" she says. Esther GrahamEsther Graham grew up in Beadnell but says she can only afford to live there because she shares a house with her parentsNorthumberland County Council said the provision of affordable housing was one of its \"top priorities\" and it had updated its Housing Allocation Policy so council houses were only offered to people with \"a very strong connection to Northumberland\". It said, between 2017 and the end of 2025, more than 1,700 affordable homes had been built across the county and planning permission had been granted for 1,369 more.Related internet linksRelated stories",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporter Watch: Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle says he passed information onto policeThe Metropolitan Police has apologised to the Commons Speaker for \"inadvertently revealing\" he was the source of information relating to Lord Mandelson's arrest on Monday.It comes after Sir Lindsay Hoyle confirmed he had passed on information to the force suggesting the peer could be a flight risk.Lord Mandelson's lawyers have complained about the Met's decision to detain him as part of its probe into misconduct in public office allegations.They say he had agreed to an interview next month, and the decision to take him into custody was prompted by a \"baseless\" suggestion he was planning to \"take up permanent residence abroad\".The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's lawyers were twice told by the police that information about his alleged travel plans had been passed on by Lord Forsyth, the Speaker of the House of Lords.On Tuesday evening, Lord Forsyth denied any involvement after he was initially reported as the source of the referral, calling the suggestion \"entirely false and without foundation\".On Wednesday, The Times then reported the information had in fact been shared by Sir Lindsay. Shortly afterwards, the Commons Speaker made a statement to MPs confirming he had given \"relevant\" information to the force.He told MPs he had done this \"in good faith\", considering it to be his \"duty and responsibility\". \"It is regrettable this rapidly ended in the media,\" he added.He did not provide any details, but the BBC understands Sir Lindsay passed on information he received in the British Virgin Islands during a visit last week that Lord Mandelson was planning to travel there.Senior officers from the Met met Sir Lindsay on Wednesday to explain the situation, which is regarded by the force as a serious breach of protocol.A spokesperson for the force said: \"The Met has apologised to the Speaker of the House of Commons this afternoon for inadvertently revealing information during an investigation into allegations of misconduct in public office.\"The BBC understands the Speaker of the House of Lords has not yet received an apology from the Metropolitan Police.Lords sources said Lord Forsyth had arranged an urgent meeting with the Metropolitan Police on Thursday and was expected to receive clarification about how his name came to be mentioned.The sources said he wanted to know why, when the media was widely reporting erroneous information attributed to him, he was not contacted about the issue and the record was not corrected.Lord Mandelson's lawyers Mishcon de Reya have written to the Met asking what information and evidence they based their decision to arrest their client on.The force is understood to have conducted its own assessment of the credibility of the information passed on by Sir Lindsay before deciding to arrest Lord Mandelson on Monday afternoon.The former Labour minister was taken to Wandsworth police station in London for interview, before later being released on bail pending further investigation. It is understood he surrendered his passport as one of his bail conditions.ReutersLord Mandelson pictured outside his home after police launched their investigation earlier this monthIt comes after the force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. Lawyers for the peer say he intends to co-operate with police to \"clear his name\". Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.

    "body": "11 hours agoPatrick BarlowSouth EastDenhamsA photo of Lot Long, which inspired the album cover of Led Zeppelin IVA \"real one-off\" photograph which inspired the album cover of Led Zeppelin's fourth album has sold for £16,000 after a transatlantic bidding war.A Victorian image of thatcher Lot Long, from Wiltshire, is believed to be the original frame behind the cover art of Led Zeppelin IV, which included the rock band's hit Stairway to Heaven.The print of the picture, said to be the largest and best quality example found to date, sold for nearly £15,000 more than it was originally listed for when it was auctioned in Horsham, West Sussex, earlier.Leo Denham, managing director of Denhams auctioneers, said: \"There has been a lot of interest from collectors in America and around the world.\"Denham added: \"I am delighted to have sold such a significant piece of music history and got such a great result for the seller. \"The new UK-based buyer is very pleased with his purchase, where it will take pride of place in his collection.\"It's a real one-off in music memorabilia.\"Denham said \"fierce bidding\" between prospective buyers in the UK and America had driven the price up.Getty Images / Michael Ochs ArchivesThe album cover for Led Zeppelin IVThe origins of the image of Lot Long were first uncovered by Brian Edwards, from the University of the West of England (UWE), in 2023, and the earliest known example of the image is owned by Wiltshire Museum.Denham said the 19th Century print, taken from the original negative of the image, is the largest of its kind.Art consultant Tim Williams said: \"Two of the known surviving prints are of poor condition and quality but this is the sole known example in the larger size of 60.8 x 44.4cm (29.3 x 17.4 inches), rendering it unique in scale and rarity.\"Its survival in this size places it among the most important examples associated with the Led Zeppelin album imagery\".Getty ImagesLed Zepplin's Robert Plant and Jimmy PageThe album cover is believed to have come about after Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant found a version of the image in an antique shop near the home of guitarist Jimmy Page in Pangbourne, Berkshire, and adapted a photograph of it for the album sleeve.Released in 1971, Led Zeppelin IV has sold more than 37 million copies worldwide.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoKoh EweandDanny Vincent,Hong KongGetty ImagesJimmy Lai was sentenced to nearly six years in jail in 2022 for a fraud offenceJimmy Lai, Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon, has won an appeal against a fraud conviction in 2022, which had seen him sentenced to nearly six years in jail. On Thursday, Hong Kong's Court of Appeal quashed the convictions of Lai and another defendant who had been accused of illegally subletting office space.But the 78-year-old will remain in prison. Earlier this month, he was sentenced to 20 years in jail for colluding with foreign forces under the city's national security law.Lai, a British citizen, is a fierce critic of Beijing and is one of the biggest figures in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. He has been detained since 2020.In 1995, he founded Apple Daily, a local tabloid that was critical of Beijing and became Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy paper. The paper was shuttered in 2021 after Lai and other key staff members were arrested.The paper was at the heart of Lai's fraud trial. Prosecutors argued that Lai breached lease terms by allowing his private consultancy firm to operate in office space that Apple Daily had rented.Wong Wai-keung, a former executive at Lai's media company, was also charged in the same case and jailed for 21 months.Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, who leads Lai's international legal team, said Thursday's decision \"changes nothing\" and that Lai risks dying in prison because of ill health.\"No one should be fooled into thinking that this fraud appeal belatedly succeeding suggests the Hong Kong system operates fairly or justly,\" she told the BBC.Critics say Lai's trials and detention are a sign of the shrinking civil liberties in Hong Kong, especially after the introduction of a Beijing-imposed national security law.This month, the UK and the US governments said the national security law has been used to \"silence\" activists like Lai.Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have argued that the law is necessary to maintain stability and deny it has weakened the territory's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region of China. Rights groups and Lai's family have raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison. Last December his daughter, Claire, told the BBC that his teeth were rotting and his fingernails \"sometimes fall off\".But Chinese authorities maintained that Lai was \"in good health\" and received \"appropriate\" care.Supporters claim that Jimmy Lai has long been facing political persecution through the courts. The overturning of the sentence on Thursday has been met with some scepticism by some.\"Even if [he] is released at 96 rather than 98, it doesn't make much difference,\" one supporter who attended court told the BBC.",

    "body": "Aldi shop staff to receive two pay rises this year5 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesAldi is now the fourth-most popular supermarket in the UKAldi has announced its second wage increase for floor staff since the new year, as it vies to increase its market share in the UK.The budget supermarket will pay its store assistants £13.50 per hour from April — just a month after an increase is due to take effect in March.Staff in London will be paid £14.88. Both rates increase with length of service.Lidl GB, Waitrose and Sainsbury's all announced above-inflation pay rises for staff earlier this month.Aldi said the wage increase will benefit 28,000 staff members, and says it makes its entry-level workers the highest paid of all supermarket staff, including its fellow budget chain Lidl.The legal minimum wage will rise to £12.71 an hour in April 2026. Some employers voluntarily pay a higher rate called the Real Living Wage, which is calculated by the Living Wage Foundation, a charity. The current Real Living Wage is £13.45.John Lewis shop staff, including those working in Waitrose, will receive a pay rise on 1 April, bringing their hourly rate to £13.25, or £14.80 in London.Sainsbury's has also announced a pay rise, bringing its rate to £13.23 and £14.54 for London workers.Lidl staff will be paid £13.45, or £14.80 in London, from 1 March. Until Aldi's announcement of a second wage hike, this made Lidl the highest-paying supermarket in the UK outside of London.Aldi also claims it is the only major supermarket to offer paid breaks to all staff.Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said the company knows that \"every single member of Team Aldi is fundamental to our success and deserve nothing less\".\"Our colleagues work incredibly hard to deliver exceptional value for our customers, and we're rewarding that dedication with the highest pay in the sector.\"The cost of groceries soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy prices. Own-brand products, which make up most of the goods on Aldi and Lidl shelves, now make up more than half of everything shoppers buy, by value.",

    "body": "1 hour agoHarry SekulichBBC News Getty ImagesHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán says he has stationed soldiers at key energy facilities across the country after he blamed Ukraine for disrupting energy supplies.Orbán has accused Kyiv of imposing an \"oil blockade\" on Hungary by deliberately delaying the reopening of the Druzhba pipeline, the main route for delivering Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia.Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia through the pipeline have been cut off since January 27, with Kyiv saying it was closed after Russian strikes. Orbán said the suspension of the critical oil flow was purely political and that Ukraine was \"preparing further actions\".Ukraine did not immediately respond to Orbán's comments.Kyiv has repeatedly attacked Russian oil facilities, including the section of the Druzhba pipeline running through Russian territory, with a Ukrainian drone strike hitting an oil pumping station earlier this week.The attacks forced Russia's oil operator to reduce the amount of crude oil it takes into its system by about 250,000 barrels a day, according to Reuters.Ukraine has been dealing with acute power shortages due to sharply intensified Russian attacks on its power and gas networks.It has had to increase imports from Europe, some of which come from Hungary and Slovakia. Both countries have threatened to halt emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine until the oil pipeline has been reopened.Earlier this week, Hungary vetoed a vital €90bn European Union loan (£78bn) to Ukraine, citing anger over the Druzhba pipeline dispute.An EU spokesperson told AFP on Wednesday that Hungary and Slovakia do not currently run the risk of a shortage of oil despite the interruption of Russian deliveries from the pipeline, as alternative sources are supplying both countries. \"Croatia confirmed at the meeting that non-Russian crude oil is being transported through the Adria pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia,\" European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said after experts met to discuss the situation. \"It remains the main alternative pipeline for Hungary and Slovakia to cover their needs, and the pipeline has sufficient capacity to increase volumes to fully cover the Hungarian Slovakian requirements,\" she said. Following a meeting of the Hungarian Defence Council on Wednesday, Orbán uploaded a video on social media announcing measures that he said were to protect the country's critical energy infrastructure.Soldiers have been deployed to energy stations, police will patrol power stations, and drones are banned in Hungary's north-east border region with Ukraine, the Hungarian PM announced. \"The Ukrainian government is exerting pressure on the Hungarian and Slovak governments through an oil blockade,\" he said, adding that \"they are preparing further actions to disrupt Hungary's energy system\".Zelensky did not immediately respond to the accusation, and there was no indication that Ukraine was planning such an attack. Orbàn's critics say he has been stepping up the war of words with Ukraine in order to convince the public that Hungary is under attack in the run up to elections in April. His ruling Fidesz party is trailing in most opinion polls, suggesting he could lose power after 16 years. ",

But in real life I'm an absolute sweetheart.\" For about five seconds a poster for the James Bond film No Time To Die appears.McCullagh then appears back on screen and continues to play, telling viewers: \"I don't have too many loved ones in my life but the ones I do, I love with all my heart.\"Throughout the video, McCullagh tells the camera he is a \"very angry gamer\".Earlier, the jury of six men and six women were shown items removed from Natalie's home in the aftermath of her death, including a small black-handled knife found at the scene beside her.They were also shown a piece of paper, which contained information on diabetes, and a silver metal dog bowl, all found close to Natalie's body.Det Sgt Stewart held up the evidence to show the court and then it was passed to the jury to examine.The jury was also shown photographs from inside and outside the defendant's home and heard WhatsApp messages exchanged between Natalie and McCullagh in the days leading up to her death. In one message McCullagh said \"right I'm off to stream the night away\", to which she replied: \"Good luck, might have a sneak peek later.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorPA MediaOn the day households found out their energy bills would fall in April, the Chancellor chose to go to the headquarters of the company that has quietly become the UK's biggest domestic energy supplier, Octopus.Rachel Reeves was shown the screens displaying the real-time management of energy demand for electric vehicles, as well as the cheaper prices for the communities that had volunteered to host clean energy infrastructure such as wind farms.This was an attempt to not just illuminate the notable cut to energy bills announced under the Ofgem price cap, but also to start to float a broader story about the UK economy, after some rosier numbers in recent days.I asked a couple of times, if she was seeing \"green shoots\" in the economy. Eventually she said that we were \"beginning to see the economy turning a corner\".\"I think this will be the year that people start to feel the change in their pockets,\" Reeves said.Is that right, or could that prove a hostage to fortune?The 7% cut to electricity bills is real and substantial (though it's worth noting that energy bills remain stuck in a higher band than before the Russia Ukraine energy crisis four years ago).This has been a very conscious strategy from the Chancellor. She spent Autumn actively looking for ways to use policy and the tax system to lower inflation.\"I know that the last few years have been tough for people, but the measures that I took, all fully costed and fully funded in the budget, should start to ease those cost of living pressures that people have been living with for too long,\" she told me.Digital advertising hoards currently plastered with adverts for the \"Big Rail Fare Freeze\" are part of the same strategy. Reeves told me that energy companies should all pass on the £150 cut to every customer, even those who had fixed their bills.The cut is unusual as it does predominantly come from the Government's decision at the Budget to shift the burden of green levies from bills into general taxation.That is important. But it is also true that at that Budget, Reeves also announced she would extend the freeze on income tax thresholds which effectively means more of peoples' income will be taxed at higher rates as their pay increases.We've also seen some sluggish economic growth numbers at the end of last year, and increases in unemployment especially for younger workers.But more generally we have seen better figures for high street spending, economic surveys of the service sector, consumer confidence, and lower borrowing numbers and costs.Inflation had already begun to fall even before today's energy bill cuts. In turn, interest rates set by the Bank of England are also set to continue to fall.It may be a little too early to call \"green shoots\", but it is also the case that the doom mongering about the UK economy has been overdone too.So the Chancellor is trying to use this moment of a tangible cut to every household's energy bill as a launching pad for a wider attempt to gee up consumer and business confidence. The official independent forecast numbers for the economy, prices, borrowing and jobs come next week at the Treasury Spring Statement, which should give us a clearer picture of just how green the economic shoots are expected to be.",

Critics have raised the spectre of \"circular financing\" deals in which investments by Nvidia in other companies may be clouding perceptions about how robust AI demand really is.Meanwhile, the company has been caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China.The outlook released by Nvidia on Wednesday did not include expectations about chip revenue in China.Last month, the Trump administration began allowing Nvidia to sell its H200 chips - Nvidia's second-most advanced type - to Chinese customers under certain conditions.But this week, a US Commerce Department official told lawmakers that none of those chips have yet been sold to Chinese customers.Nvidia is also expanding its own product line in a bid to have more involvement in the physical products in which AI is embedded.Last month at the CES technology trade show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled a new tech platform for self-driving cars.Huang said the open-source AI model, which the company is calling \"Alpamayo,\" will bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.Nvidia also said it is was planning to launch a robotaxi service by next year in partnership with an unnamed partner.Nvidia chips have lead in the training of AI models, but it has faced of onslaught of competition in inference, the process whereby a trained model is applied to real-world data to generate answers through reasoning.During the fourth quarter, Nvidia acquired rival Groq in a $20bn deal that's expand its expertise in inference.",

On the agenda was a full-throated defence of the administration’s record, hailing a \"turnaround for the ages,” whilst playing down the Supreme Court's ruling against his signature tariff policy (with the judges themselves in the crowd).\nDespite the speech lasting nearly two hours,  there was little to suggest a change of course from Trump’s favourite taking points. He focused on the economy, immigration, the Democrats…. And the US men’s olympic hockey team.\nBut with growing voter dissatisfaction souring the polls, will Trump’s sales pitch be enough to counter sliding approval ratings and convince voters to stick with him for November's midterm election?\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "Just nowBBC News observes strict reporting restrictions on polling day when elections are held in the UK. We have omitted or cropped some of Thursday's front pages in connection with the Gorton and Denton by-election. There is a mix of stories in Thursday's papers. The Daily Telegraph leads with the Metropolitan Police apologising to Sir Lindsay Hoyle for \"inadvertently revealing\" he was the source of information relating to Lord Mandelson's arrest on Monday. \"Met exposed Hoyle\" is the paper's headline. It comes after Sir Lindsay confirmed he had passed on information to the force suggesting Lord Mandelson could be a flight risk. Lord Mandelson's lawyers have complained about the Met's decision to detain him as part of its inquiry into misconduct in public office allegations.The Daily Mail says the apology from the Met shows its investigation into Lord Mandelson has descended \"into farce\". The paper's headline asks: \"Is prince of darkness up to his hold spin tricks?\" Lord Mandelson's lawyers said the decision to take him into custody was prompted by a \"baseless\" suggestion he was planning to \"take up permanent residence abroad\".The Times stays with the continued fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, reporting that records show the late sex offender was trafficking women through UK airports as late as 2019. The paper says documents indicate Epstein flew in and out of the UK by private jet \"more than 60 times\". Elsewhere, the top picture spot features Queen Camilla meeting Paddington at a Windsor Castle reception.Chancellor Rachel Reeves says Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor should \"reimburse the public purse\" if he is found to have misused funds, according to the i Paper. It comes after civil servants alleged that the former prince charged taxpayers for massages and excessive travel costs while working as the UK's trade envoy. Mountbatten-Windsor has always rejected any wrongdoing in his associations with  Jeffrey Epstein and denied any personal gain from his role as trade envoy.The Guardian focuses on the NHS as it says a report has revealed that hospital maternity wards often resort to a \"cover-up\" of their mistakes when women and babies are harmed during childbirth. Baroness Valerie Amos, who led the review into NHS maternity care, said \"negligent\" care had \"devastating\" consequences for families, the paper reports.Iran is seeking to tempt Donald Trump to invest in its oil and gas reserves in a bid to convince the US president to agree on a nuclear deal and avoid war, according to the Financial Times. Alongside, Microsoft is on the hunt for a new London headquarters, with the paper saying the tech giant is looking at sites on the Elizabeth Line from Paddington to Canary Wharf.\"Tourette's storm rages\" says the Sun, reporting on the ongoing Baftas row after a racial slur was shouted at US actors Michael B Jordan and Delroy Lindo by Tourette's campaigner John Davidson. The paper says Davidson is questioning the decision by producers to seat him so close to a microphone with the knowledge of his involuntary tics. The BBC and Baftas have apologised for the scandal, saying a review is under way.Ministers have been told to \"just say non!\" to France until it stops the migrant boats, reports the Daily Express. It adds that more than 600 migrants crossed the Channel on Wednesday, prompting calls for the UK not to \"reward\" France with taxpayer money \"for boats failure\".Police have busted a huge cannabis farm in Northampton, discovering more than 7,000 plants filling a four-storey building, the Metro reports. The site was a former casino, inspiring the paper's headline: \"High rollers.\"Finally, the Daily Star says Strictly Come Dancing contestant Pete Wicks has revealed he fears a real-world Planet of the Apes takeover. \"Gorillas get on my Wicks\" is the headline.The Daily Mail focuses on Scotland Yard's \"extraordinary apology\" for inadvertently revealing that the Speaker of the House of Commons told its officers Lord Mandelson was considering leaving the country.  Lawyers representing Lord Mandelson say there is \"absolutely no truth\" to the suggestion he was a flight risk.The i Paper says the chancellor wants Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to reimburse the public purse if he is found to have misused funds. The paper says Rachel Reeves has made the demand in light of \"allegations of profligate spending\". Mountbatten-Windsor has previously denied wrongdoing.The Time says records appear to show that the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein trafficked women through British airports as late as 2019 - the year he died. It says police are \"investigating up to 60 private flights\".The Guardian calls a report into NHS maternity services in England \"damning\". It says the review found that \"hospitals that cause harm and injury to women and babies during child birth often resort to a 'cover up' of their mistakes\". The Daily Mirror has spoken to mothers who say staff delayed an emergency C-section due to limited operating theatre capacity, and missed signs of \"massive internal bleeding\" during a phone assessment.The Daily Telegraph says the former Conservative health minister, Lord Bethell, has noted that the doubling in the annual amount spent on the NHS over the past 17 years has had \"no impact\" on the nation's health. The government says it is shifting the focus from sickness to prevention through its ten-year health plan.The Sun highlights scrutiny of the BBC for failing to edit out an involuntary racial slur shouted by a man with Tourette's syndrome during the Bafta awards. John Davidson, whose story inspired the film I Swear, has questioned why he was seated near a microphone. The BBC has apologised.The Financial Times focuses on Microsoft's hunt for a fresh London office with the paper saying the tech giant is riding the \"Lizzy Line\". According to people familiar with the matter, the firm is looking at sites along the Elizabeth Line from Paddington in the west, to Canary Wharf in the east. The paper says finding high quality space in the capital is challenging for big companies which generally want newer buildings with amenities such as \"terraces, gyms, juice bars\".Related Internet Links",

Issues found included:Services depleted or stopped because of capacity pressures, with stretched antenatal wards and delivery units resulting in delays to admissions and the use of community midwives in delivery units impacting safety\"Poor relationships\" between team members, including obstetricians and midwives. Racist and bullying behaviour of senior clinicians was not always dealt with by managementStructural racism and persistent inequalities leading to \"notably higher risk of adverse outcomes\" for women from black and Asian backgrounds and women from more deprived areas. Discrimination against disabled women, Muslim families, refugee and asylum women and LGBT families was also reportedA lack of compassion and transparency when baby loss and harm occurs, which can lead to mothers wrongly blaming themselves, compound trauma and impede opportunities to learn from mistakesCare being delivered in outdated and dilapidated buildings, in some cases compromising clinical care. Bereavement spaces were insufficient or non-existent in some trustsStaff reporting maternity units did not have enough personnel to provide safe careBaroness Amos said in a statement that it was \"clear from the meetings and conversations I have had with hundreds of women, families and staff members across the country, that maternity and neonatal services in England are failing too many women, babies, families and staff\".Reuters\"Maternity and neonatal services in England are failing too many women, babies, families and staff,\" said Baroness Amos, who is leading a government-commissioned review (file photo)Failures within the system have been known about, and reported on, for years. The BBC has spent more than a decade speaking to bereaved and harmed families following poor care at Morecambe Bay, Shrewsbury & Telford, East Kent, Nottingham, Leeds and a number of other NHS Trusts, gathering evidence of failing maternity services.Orlando Davis died in September 2021, aged 14 days, after staff at Worthing Hospital in Sussex failed to spot his mother had developed hyponatremia, a lower than normal level of sodium in the bloodstream, during labour. An inquest concluded that neglect had contributed to the infant's death.His mother, Robyn, said that \"not listening to my concerns is the main reason we're sat here without our son\".Her husband Jonathan believes there is a \"cultural\" problem within maternity services that midwives believe they know better as they are the professionals. In actual fact, he said, \"the only one that truly knows what's going on in that individual's body is the mother\".Family handoutNewborn Orlando Davis died aged just 14 days after hospital staff failed to spot his mother had developed hyponatremiaThe couple are part of a group, Truth for Our Babies, who are campaigning for an independent investigation into maternity services at the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust. Earlier this month, BBC News and the New Statesman found that at least 55 babies over a five-year period might have survived with better care.The Davis family does not believe that the Amos review will lead to better care across England and are calling for a statutory inquiry.  \"It's not going deep enough... it's not just what's happening at these hospitals. It's the regulators as well,\" said Robyn. The regulators are not being reviewed by Baroness Amos.\"As families, we have received lacklustre care,\" added Jonathan. \"We [therefore] deserve the gold standard of accountability - and progressing a rushed, high-level review, instead of a statutory inquiry, is not receiving the gold standard. \"Future mothers and future children may not suffer the same irreversible fate that we have if a [properly] conducted inquiry happens.\"Jonathan and Robyn Davis said their concerns had not been listened to during labourLabour MP Michelle Welsh, a prominent campaigner on maternity safety, says there is a danger the Amos review will become a damp squib and is urging the government to act decisively, including creating a maternity commissioner responsible for ensuring care improves.\"This inquiry must result in some big, bold policies with regards to maternity services, that really says that as a government we want to improve maternity services, we want to invest in it, and we will secure the truth and accountability for families,\" she said.Announcing the review last June, Streeting also promised that he would chair a maternity taskforce early this year to drive improvements. But it's emerged this week that the group has not yet been established. The Department for Health and Social Care said they would be announcing the membership \"shortly\".\"It is important that the taskforce is established as soon as possible,\" said Welsh, \"because without it we don't have that driving force [and] those big, bold policies.\"",

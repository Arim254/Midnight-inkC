Gill was jailed in November, after admitting to taking bribes for pro-Russian interviews and speeches when he was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP).\nAnnouncing the review, Communities Secretary Steve Reed said the government must \"learn the lessons\" from the case so \"this can never happen again\". Responding to Reed's statement in the Commons, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said his party welcomed the review but called on the government to also make sure it looked into the influence of China on the Labour Party. Victoria and Chris discuss what the review could mean\nPlus, President Trump has filed, what is being reported as, a $5 billion dollar lawsuit against the BBC. Caitríona Perry and the FT’s global media editor Daniel Thomas explain what’s in the lawsuit and why the BBC has said it plans to fight it. \nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.

    "body": "The Metropolitan and Greater Manchester police forces have said they will arrest people holding placards and chanting the phrase 'globalise the intifada' - an Arabic word for uprising. In a statement following Sunday's mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, they said: \"Violent acts have taken place, the context has changed - words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests\".The two forces also referenced the Manchester synagogue attack in October. The UK's chief rabbi told the BBC this week that chants of 'globalise the intifada' had helped lead to the two attacks.The police forces said: \"We know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as 'globalise the intifada' and those using it at future protests or in a targeted way should expect\" the two forces \"to take action\".\"Frontline officers will be briefed on this enhanced approach. We will also use powers under the Public Order Act, including conditions around London synagogues during services,\" the statement said.Visible patrols and protective security measures around synagogues, schools, and community venues have been stepped up in London and Greater Manchester.Fifteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured in Sunday's Bondi attack, which targeted Australia's Jewish community at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.Two people died in the knife attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on 2 October.Criticising the decision by the police forces on Wednesday, Palestinian Solidarity Campaign director Ben Jamal described the move as \"another low in the political repression of protest for Palestinian rights\". He said police did not consult with the coalition that organises major protests in London or representative groups of the Palestinian community in the UK \"before making this far reaching statement on our rights\".\"The horrific massacre in Sydney, Australia should not be used as a justification to further repress fundamental democratic rights of protest and free speech in this country,\" Mr Jamal added.Responding to the joint statement by police, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said: \"We strongly welcome this necessary intervention.\" \"We have long warned that people chanting slogans like 'globalise the intifada' are inciting violence, and we have been making the case for robust enforcement in relation to this slogan with government at all levels for some time,\" the board said.But Gideon Falter, chief executive of Campaign Against Antisemitism, said in a statement that \"banning this one chant is a useless token measure\", adding \"it is hard to see how they will possibly enforce this ban\".UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced in parliament on Wednesday that his government has increased funding for Jewish security up to £28m.\"I'm pleased to do that, but I'm sad to do that,\" he said, adding that he has ordered a review of protest and hate crime laws.He was responding to a question from Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who said antisemitism was real, \"poisonous\" and that \"we must all work together to stamp it out\".The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people.Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.",

    "body": "23 minutes agoSakshi VenkatramanBBC North AmericaResearchers tracking wild polar bears in northern Canada witnessed something exceedingly rare this fall: a mother bear adopting a cub that was not biologically her own. The five-year-old mother bear and her 10- to 11-month-old cubs were observed and captured on camera during the annual polar bear migration along the Western Hudson Bay near Churchill, Manitoba, a town known for its polar bear population.\"It's unusual,\" Alyssa McCall, a scientist at Polar Bears International, said in a video. \"We don't really know why it happens...but we know it doesn't happen often at all.\"It's only the 13th known case of adoption out of the 4,600 bears studied for nearly five decades in the area. The mother bear was first captured as she emerged from her maternity den this spring. At the time, she had one cub, which scientists tagged for study.In the fall, she was seen again, but this time with two cubs - the original cub that had been tagged and another without a tag. Researchers aren't sure what happened to the new cub's biological mother, but they are trying to identify her with genetic samples. \"The bears need all the help they can get these days with climate change,\" Evan Richardson, a polar bear scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, said in a video statement. \"If females have the opportunity to pick up another cub and care for it and successfully wean it, it's a good thing for bears in Churchill.\"Polar bears in the wild only have a 50% chance of surviving into adulthood, but having a mother caring for them improves their odds. The cubs appear to be healthy, researchers said, and they will likely stay with their mother until they are about two-and-a-half years old. Next, the family is expected to head out to sea ice, where the cubs will learn from their mother how to hunt seals and survive on their own. \"It's just nice to know that the bears are looking out for each other,\" Richardson said.

    "body": "44 minutes agoGetty ImagesRuth CleggHealth and wellbeing reporter More babies are being born by caesarean section in England than delivered naturally - without assistance - for the first time.Latest NHS data for 2024-25 shows that 45% of births were by C-section, compared to 44% which were spontaneous, a term used to describe a natural vaginal birth. Another 11% needed extra support and interventions like forceps.Nearly half of the caesaereans - when the baby is delivered by surgeons cutting into the mother's abdomen and womb - were planned in advance.NHS England says the increase is influenced by many factors, including women choosing to have this kind of birth and a rise in pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and obesity.Experts say the picture behind the figures is \"very complex\".Dr Donna Ockenden, who is chairing an independent review into maternity services at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals, says it has been an \"evolving picture over time\".\"We know there is an increasing maternal age, we know there is rising ill health. I also think previous experience will play a part.\"Birth trauma and having a caesarian section first time, may influence their decision to have a C-section the second time round.\"For many women, having a C-section (also known as a caesarean) is a matter of choice.Over the past 10 years, the number of caesareans has doubled. Dr Alison Wright, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said part of this was down to improvements \"in our ability to detect when a baby's wellbeing is deteriorating during labour, and therefore respond appropriately\".'Least worst option'Soo Downe, a professor of midwifery studies at the University of Lancashire, says there are many factors contributing to the rise. \"The average age of being a mother has only gone up by one year over the past decade, and women's BMI [Body Mass Index] has only increased very slightly.\"This doesn't explain this very rapid rise that has happened over the last 10 years.\"She suggests part of the picture is a growing number of women who feel a caesarean is the \"the least worst option\" because there is a fear they might not get the support they need for a \"safe straightforward positive labour\".Maternity services in England have been heavily criticised, with reviews into maternity care ongoing at 14 NHS trusts.An NHS spokesperson said: \"All women should receive safe, personalised maternity care in line with best practice guidance and clinical evidence.\"The priority should always be the safety and wellbeing of both mothers and babies, and decisions about how a baby is born are made through informed discussions that consider individual circumstances, clinical advice and a woman's preferences, ensuring the safest and most appropriate approach for each birth.\"",

    "body": "29 minutes agoOsmond Chia,Business reporterandDanielle Kaye,Business reporterGetty ImagesThe Warner Bros. logo is displayed at Warner Bros. Studio on December 5, 2025 in Burbank, California.Warner Bros Discovery has told its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4bn (£80.75bn) takeover bid.Paramount had said its offer was \"superior\" to a $72bn deal that Warner Bros struck with Netflix for its film and streaming businesses.But in a dramatic plot twist in the story of who will take control of one of Hollywood's oldest and most famous movie studios, Warner Brother's board \"unanimously\" recommended rejecting the offer and agreed the deal with Netflix was in the firm's best interests.The media giant put itself up for sale in October after receiving \"multiple\" expressions of interest from potential buyers, including approaches from Paramount Skydance.On 5 December, Warner Bros Discovery said it had agreed to sell its film and streaming businesses to Netflix.In a lengthy legal filing, Warner Bros Discovery's board said the offer from Paramount poses numerous and significant risks, and strongly rejects the idea that the Ellison family - one of America's richest - is financially supporting the bid.Paramount is backed by the billionaire Ellison family, which has close ties to the president.In a reflection of where power now lies in the entertainment industry, the Warner Bros board says the offer from streaming giant Netflix is well financed and offers better long term value to shareholders.Netflix welcomed the recommendation from Warner Bros. Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-chief executive, called the company's merger agreement \"superior\" and \"in the best interest of stockholders\".In a letter to Warner Bros shareholders, Netflix reiterated its stance that its bid for Warner Bros involves a clearer funding structure and less regulatory risk.Paramount could still come back with another offer, meaning the take-over saga gripping Hollywood isn't over yet.The are considerable differences between the Netflix and Paramount offers.Netflix wants to buy Warner Bros. movie studio and its HBO streaming service, which would also give it access to Warner Bros' rich library of content and secure access to those movies and shows for its subscribers.But it doesn't want the media giant's pay-TV channels. If Warner Bros. goes with the Netflix deal it would leave Warner Bros to sell off its television networks, such as CNN and TNT, into a separate company before the takeover is completed.Paramount, on the other hand, wants to buy Warner Bros in its entirety, which would mean acquiring competitors to its own TV channels such as CBS, MTV and Showtime.Regulators might raise questions about an erosion of consumer choice, as the entertainment industry continues to consolidate ownership.The week after Netflix announced its deal to acquire Warner Bros, Paramount Skydance launched a new offer for the whole company, including its television networks.A takeover of Warner Bros is expected to face scrutiny from competition regulators in the US and Europe.A new owner of Warner Bros would gain a significant edge in the highly competitive streaming market. It would get a huge library of films and TV shows, including Harry Potter, the MonsterVerse, Friends and the HBO Max streaming service.Some in the film industry have criticised the plan to merge all or part of Warner Bros with a rival. The Writers Guild of America's East and West branches called for the merger to be blocked, arguing that it would result in lower wages and job cuts.The volume of content for viewers would also be reduced, it said.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAlex Partridge,Politics reporter,Emer Moreau,Business reporterandDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentThe prime minister has said Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich must \"pay up now\" to victims of the war in Ukraine or face court action.Mr Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea Football Club, pledged in 2022 that the £2.5bn he made from the sale of the club would be used to benefit victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.But there has been a delay in releasing the funds, which are currently frozen in a British bank account, due to a standoff over how exactly they should be used.The government wants the money to be used for humanitarian aid, but Mr Abramovich insisted it should be used for \"all victims of the war\" – meaning that Russians could also benefit.The oligarch cannot access the money under UK sanctions but the proceeds from the Chelsea sale still legally belong to him.\"If Mr Abramovich fails to act quickly, this government is fully committed and prepared to going to court to enforce that commitment if necessary,\" a government spokesperson said.They said the funds \"would strengthen frontline capacity, enhance protection for the most vulnerable and support sustainable solutions that help Ukraine move from crisis response to long-term resilience\".\"It would be hard to overstate the impact that an additional two and a half billion pounds could have for the people of Ukraine.\"Mr Abramovich's representatives declined to comment.Speaking in the Commons, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK had issued a licence \"to transfer £2.5bn from the sale of Chelsea Football Club that's been frozen since 2022.\"Sir Keir said: \"My message to Abramovich is clear: the clock is ticking. \"Honour the commitment that you made and pay up now, and if you don't we're prepared to go to court and ensure that every penny reaches those whose lives have been torn apart by Putin's illegal war.\"The Treasury said that under the terms of the licence, the money must go to \"humanitarian causes\" in Ukraine and cannot benefit Mr Abramovich or any other sanctioned individual.The government first threatened to sue Mr Abramovich in June.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"It is unacceptable that more than £2.5bn of money owed to the Ukrainian people can be allowed to remain frozen in a UK bank account.\"Mr Abramovich – a Russian billionaire who made his fortune in oil and gas – was granted a special licence to sell Chelsea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, providing he could prove he would not benefit from the sale.He is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, something he has denied.It is understood that Mr Abramovich has 90 days to act before the UK considers taking legal action.On Thursday, EU leaders are set to review proposals to use proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's huge budget and defence needs. Russia has fiercely opposed the proposals.",

    "body": "Naveed Akram, the surviving suspect in Sunday's mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act, the New South Wales police say.Akram, 24, was critically injured during the incident. His father Sajid Akram, 50, was killed in an exchange of fire with police at the scene.Fifteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured in the attack, which targeted Australia's Jewish community at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. It was the country's deadliest shooting since 1996.Akram also faces 40 charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, as well as one charge of causing a public display of a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol.Akram had his first hearing from his hospital bedside, the local New South Wales court said. The case has been adjourned until April 2026, the court added. Earlier on Wednesday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said they were waiting for medication to wear off before formally questioning Akram.\"For his fairness, we need him to understand what is exactly happening,\" Lanyon said.As of Wednesday evening local time, 17 people are still being treated in hospitals across Sydney. One is in critical condition, with four others described as critical but stable.Police have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been \"motivated by Islamic State\" group ideology.On Tuesday, it emerged that the father and son had travelled to the Philippines in November.The Philippine immigration bureau told the BBC that they were in the country from 1 November to 28 November. Their final destination was the southern city of Davao, an immigration spokesperson said.Naveed Akram travelled to the Philippines using an Australian passport, while his father Sajid used an Indian passport, border authorities in Manila told the BBC.Sajid Akram was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, but had \"limited contact\" with his family there, a police official from the Indian state of Telangana said.Among those killed in the attack were two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl, named by her family as Matilda.Boris and Sofia Gurman, a couple filmed wrestling with one of the gunmen during the early stages of the attack, were also among the victims.Another 27 people were taken to hospital with injuries, including two police officers. One of the officers, named as 22-year-old Jack Hibbert, has lost vision in one eye and faces a \"long and challenging recovery\", his family said in a statement.Earlier in the day, thousands gathered to mourn British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, at the first funeral to be held for victims of the shooting.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was not present. Asked on ABC NewsRadio about his absence, he said: \"I would attend anything that I'm invited to. These are funerals that are taking place to farewell people's loved ones.\"The Jewish community has criticised Albanese for not taking enough action on antisemitism - he defended himself against those accusations, telling ABC NewsRadio he had taken a series of measures including appointing the country's first antisemitism envoy, toughening hate speech laws and increasing funding for social cohesion projects and Jewish institutions.Speaking at Rabbi Schlanger's funeral, Rabbi Levi Wolff described his death as an \"unspeakable loss\" for the community.\"Eli was ripped away from us, doing what he loved best,\" he said.\"Spreading love and joy and caring for his people with endless self-sacrifice in his life and in his death, he towered above as one of the highest and holiest souls.\"Rabbi Schlanger had helped organise Sunday's Hanukkah event.Funerals for the other victims are expected to happen over the coming days, including for the youngest victim, Matilda, on Thursday.",

    "body": "Finland's delegate to last month's Miss Universe pageant held in Thailand has sparked controversy and outrage after a photo of her pulling the corners of her eyes went viral.Sarah Dzafce, who has been stripped of her Miss Finland crown, uploaded the photo with the caption \"eating with a Chinese\". The slanted-eyes pose is often seen as disrespectful to East Asians.The post drew backlash in Japan, South Korea and China against the 22-year-old and even against her country's flag carrier, Finnair.Finland's prime minister weighed in on Monday, saying that making such gestures was \"thoughtless and stupid\" and that the controversy that ensued was \"damaging\" to the country.Ms Dzafce claimed the gesture was her reaction to a headache during dinner. She said a friend added the offensive caption to the 11 December post without her consent, according to local tabloid Ilta-Sanomat.Ms Dzafce has apologised for the photo, noting it has \"caused ill will in many people\".\"That was not my intention in any way... One of the most important things for me is respect for people, their backgrounds and differences,\" she wrote on an Instagram post.  The apology still drew criticism, with some calling it \"insincere\" given it was written in Finnish.One person wrote: \"That was uncalled for, Asian people didn't do anything to you... We [are] still disappointed in you.\"Two right-wing MPs in Finland, Juho Eerola and Kaisa Garedew, posted photos of themselves mimicking Ms Dzafce's gesture to show their support for the beauty queen.The posts were taken down after backlash. Eerola apologised adding he felt Ms Dzafce was given \"disproportionately harsh punishment\".Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo condemned the MPs' actions as \"childish\", adding that lawmakers should set an example of proper conduct.The Finns Party is deliberating whether the MPs should face any sanctions for their actions, local media reported.Finnair told public broadcaster Yle that the controversy had affected the company, and that there had been calls for tourists to boycott Finland.\"The statements or posts mentioned by some Finnish members of parliament do not represent the values of Finnair,\" the airline wrote on its Japanese X account on Tuesday.\"As an airline supported by employees from diverse backgrounds and customers around the world, we promise to welcome everyone with respect,\" it wrote.The debacle has also drawn attention in Japan, South Korea and China, among other East Asian countries.A Japanese man living in Finland launched a petition calling for an investigation into anti-Asian discrimination, which had gathered more than 7,000 signatures as of Sunday evening, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.The Finnish embassy in Japan said it had received \"numerous opinions and questions\" on Finland's efforts to address racism. \"Racism remains a challenge in Finnish society, and its resolution requires continuous and resolute efforts,\" it acknowledged in an X post earlier this week.The controversy around Ms Dzafce is a postscript to a chaotic Miss Universe pageant hosted in Thailand that had been beset by walkouts and allegations of rigging.The Miss Finland Organisation said dethroning Ms Dzafce was a \"difficult but necessary\" move.\"Miss Finland holds a position of role-model status, which requires respecting all people regardless of their origin, background, or appearance,\" the organisation said in a statement.\"We are deeply sorry for the harm these events have caused. Especially to the Asian community, but also to everyone affected. Racism is never acceptable in any form,\" it wrote.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNadine Yousif,Senior Canada reporterandJames FitzGeraldGetty ImagesCanada's foreign minister Anita Anand confirmed the MPs were denied entry, and said she she had \"expressed Canada's objections\"Six Canadian members of parliament, along with a delegation of 24 other people, were denied entry by Israel to the occupied West Bank on Tuesday while trying to cross the border from Jordan.The group were attempting to enter as part of a trip to Israel and the West Bank sponsored by non-profit organisation The Canadian-Muslim Vote (TCMV).The Israeli ambassador to Canada said the group of 30 had been denied entry because TCMV had links to Islamic Relief Worldwide, a non-governmental organisation proscribed by Israel as a terrorist group.The Canadian affiliate of Islamic Relief has strongly denied that characterisation. TCMV also hit out, saying its funding came from qualified donors only.Israeli military body Cogat, which oversees the Allenby border crossing, told CBC News that the group had been denied entry \"for security reasons\", after they arrived at the Allenby border crossing \"without prior co-ordination\".The denial was described as \"deeply troubling\" by the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), who said its staff members and community leaders were in the delegation alongside the MPs.Five of the six MPs who were denied entry were from the governing Liberal Party. They were Fares Al Soud, Iqra Khalid, Aslam Rana, Gurbux Saini and Sameer Zuberi. The sixth MP was Jenny Kwan, from the left-leaning New Democratic Party.  Kwan called the situation \"completely unacceptable\" and rejected the suggestion that the lawmakers posed a public safety risk. The NCCM said the goal of the trip was \"observing conditions on the ground and engaging directly with Palestinian and international stakeholders\". Stephen Brown, the CEO of the NCCM, criticised the Israeli government, saying the denial of entry was part of a \"broader pattern\" to restrict access \"to those seeking to independently witness the realities in the occupied territories\". Iddo Moed, the Israeli ambassador to Canada, told CBC that the reason for denial was due to TCMV's links to Islamic Relief Worldwide. \"The issue really is the link to a terrorist organisation,\" he said.In its statement of denial, Islamic Relief Canada CEO Tufail Hussain told Canadian media: \"Claims that our charitable resources support terrorism are baseless and dangerous and they place aid workers and the beneficiaries we serve at risk.\"EPAIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously hit out at the Canadian decision to formally recognise a Palestinian stateCanadian Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand confirmed the delegation had been denied entry in a statement on X on Tuesday afternoon. She added that her ministry \"expressed Canada's objections regarding the mistreatment of these Canadians while attempting to cross\".A different group of MPs were permitted to travel on a similar trip in 2024, also organised by TCMV.Tensions between the Canadian and Israeli governments have risen in recent months after Canada - alongside the UK, France and other Western nations - formally recognised a Palestinian state in September.At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticised the recognition as \"disgraceful\".Earlier this year, two MPs from the UK's governing Labour Party were also denied entry by Israel after crossing from Jordan during a visit organised by the Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU).Simon Opher and Peter Prinsley were travelling in a parliamentary delegation in September to see medical and humanitarian work being carried out by organisations, including Medical Aid for Palestinians.A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said at the time that the incident was \"totally unacceptable and deeply concerning\".Two other Labour MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, had earlier been denied entry to Israel in April on another visit organised by the same organisation.",

    "body": "VAR errors increase: Each of the 13 mistakes so far this seasonImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liverpool and Bournemouth were drawing 0-0 when Marcos Senesi should have been sent off through a VAR reviewByFootball issues correspondentVideo assistant referee errors have risen in the first half of the Premier League season.Data collected by BBC Sport taken from the Premier League's Key Match Incidents (KMI) Panel shows mistakes have increased 30% season-on-season from 10 to 13.It is still a marked improvement on previous years, with 20 errors at this stage of the 2023-24 campaign and 23 in 2022-23.All but two of the mistakes are missed interventions, up from seven to 11, when the video assistant refereee (VAR) failed to advise the referee he should change a decision.Incorrect interventions are down from three to two. But total overturns have also dropped from 57 in 2024-25 to 47 this season - a fall of 17.54%.The KMI Panel also catalogues on-field mistakes which did not reach the clear and obvious threshold for VAR to intervene. There are also up from 12 to 15.Here is every mistake this season across these categories.How the KMI Panel worksThe KMI Panel meets every week to dissect each decision, from goals to penalties to red cards.  It has five members: three former players and coaches, plus one representative each from the Premier League and Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO).The KMI Panel was created by the Premier League clubs in 2022 to take performance stats out of the hands of the refereeing body.Crucially, it is not intended to look at each incident like any fan or manager would. It takes into account the laws of the game and, crucially, how the Premier League expects its games to be refereed. That is why the list of errors will not be as extensive as supporters would expect.The KMI Panel first looks at the decision of the on-field referee team, and then of the VAR.As the VAR is operating to a higher threshold - clear and obvious - there are times when the KMI Panel will say the referee was wrong but the VAR was correct not to intervene. The KMI Panel also considers second yellow cards which were missed, or incorrectly shown.1. Liverpool 4-2 Bournemouth: Senesi red cardThe ball accidentally hit Marcos Senesi's arm but he then deliberately batted it away just as Hugo Ekitike was about to run through on goal. The referee did not show Senesi a card having deemed it to not be foul play.The VAR, Michael Oliver, only looked at the first touch on the arm.On-field vote: 1-4VAR vote: 1-4What the panel said: \"There is a secondary action by Senesi, where he moves his arm to flick the ball away, which is a handball offence. The majority feel that this was an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.\"2. Chelsea 2-0 Fulham: King's goal is disallowedThe game was goalless in the 21st minute when Josh King scored to give Fulham the lead. Referee Rob Jones initially gave the goal. It was wrongly ruled out through a VAR review for a foul in the build-up by Rodrigo Muniz on Trevoh Chalobah.This was a high-profile error which led to the VAR, Michael Salisbury, being stood down from his next appointment. On-field vote: 5-0VAR vote: 0-5What the panel said: \"Muniz has possession and Chalobah tries to step in to win the ball. This contact is normal in the context of the skill Muniz was performing.\"3. Wolves 2-3 Everton: Bueno denied a penaltyHugo Bueno tried to jink back inside in the 70th minute, but went down under a challenge from Iliman Ndiaye.Referee Michael Oliver allowed play to continue and the VAR, Craig Pawson, decided there was not enough in it for a review.Wolves trailed 3-1 at the time and could have got back into the game. On-field vote: 1-4VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"Bueno turns back into Ndiaye who does not make any contact on the ball. The contact made is careless and the panel felt that a penalty should have been awarded.\"4. Brentford 3-1 Man Utd: Collins escapes red cardImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nathan Collins escaped with only a yellow card after dragging back Bryan Mbeumo as he was about to shootNathan Collins pulled back Bryan Mbeumo as he was about to latch on to a pass. Referee Craig Pawson gave the penalty but only cautioned Collins. The VAR, Andy Madley, did not think Mbeumo was in control to be denied a scoring chance. Brentford, 2-1 up in the 71st minute, should have been reduced to 10 men. And Bruno Fernandes' penalty was saved.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 0-5What the panel said: \"There is an impactful holding action by Collins which is not an attempt to play the ball. Mbuemo is clearly prevented from having a clear shot at goal.\"5. Chelsea 1-3 Brighton: Gusto's high bootMalo Gusto raised a foot to make a clearance, not realising Yankuba Minteh was behind him. The Brighton player went down holding his head, but referee Simon Hooper did not believe there was contact. The VAR, Darren England, felt there was no conclusive proof for an overturn.The game was 1-1 in the 87th minute but Brighton scored twice in stoppage time.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 0-5What the panel said: \"Gusto's foot is raised and makes clear contact with the shoulder and head of Minteh and the VAR should have intervened.\"6. Crystal Palace 3-3 Bournemouth: Senesi avoids red againImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Marcos Senesi would have been suspended for a total of three games had he been shown the two red cardsReferee Jarred Gillett was sent to the pitchside monitor by the VAR, Alex Chilowicz.Gillett rejected the advice that Senesi should be sent off for a denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO) foul on Ismaila Sarr. He stuck by his yellow card because he felt the ball was moving away from goal. Bournemouth were 2-0 up in the 51st minute when the incident happened. This goes down as a correct VAR intervention, but incorrect final outcome. On-field vote: 3-2VAR vote: 3-2What the panel said: \"The majority felt that Sarr was very likely to gain possession with the ability to create an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\"7. Brentford 3-1 Newcastle: Burn trips OuattaraImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Dango Ouattara was booked for simulation but the Premier League's KMI Panel says he should have been awarded a penalty kickDan Burn stood on the foot of Dango Ouattara with the Brentford player theatrically throwing himself to the ground.It was the reaction which caused the VAR, Paul Tierney, to stay out of it. Brentford did get a penalty shortly afterwards for a clash between the same two players. On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"The panel were unanimous in their view that Burn commits a careless tripping offence. The panel were however split regarding the VAR outcome. Two members felt that the referee's call should stand as the contact was glancing.\"8. Bournemouth 2-2 West Ham: Kilman's swipe at the ballImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Max Kilman should have been sent off for handball through a VAR review as well as conceding a spot-kickBournemouth trailed West Ham 2-0 when they were given a penalty in the 66th minute. Max Kilman had handled the ball when he was on the ground.Referee Thomas Bramall only showed a yellow card, and VAR Michael Oliver supported that.But there had been a deliberate movement of the arm by Kilman to prevent Evanilson getting a shot off.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 1-4What the panel said: \"There is clear evidence that Kilman makes an additional movement with his arm to swipe the ball and in doing so this denies an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\"9. Newcastle 2-1 Man City: Foden caught lateImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The game was goalless when Fabian Schar fouled Phil Foden inside the box, and Newcastle went on to win the game 2-1The game was goalless after 17 minutes when Phil Foden released a shot. He was caught late by Fabian Schar.Defenders are given a fair bit of latitude to try to block a shot, and a natural collision will not be ruled as a penalty. On-field vote: 2-3VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"Despite Foden getting a shot away, Schar makes a reckless foul challenge. Two panellists supported the decision as contact was a consequence of the momentum of the blocking action, and not clearly reckless.\"10. Wolves 1-4 Man Utd: Agbadou handballEmmanuel Agbadou angled his body into the path of a shot to stop the ball, but VAR Stuart Attwell did not send referee Michael Salisbury to the monitor.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 1-4What the panel said: \"Agbadou leans in towards the ball with a straight arm and his arm blocks the shot heading towards goal.\"11. Everton 0-1 Arsenal: Gunners get luckyImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Everton could have made it 1-1 from the penalty spot had there been a VAR interventionEverton were losing 1-0 when William Saliba and Thierno Barry went for a bouncing ball. Barry got there first and was kicked by the Arsenal defender. The VAR, Michael Salisbury, decided there wasn't enough contact to send referee Sam Barrott to the screen.On-field vote: 2-3VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"A late challenge where Saliba carelessly kicks Barry with no contact on the ball. Two panellists supported the on-field no penalty call as they felt there was not enough impact and a delayed reaction.\"12. Chelsea 2-2 Bournemouth: Gusto avoids another spot-kickFor the second time the VAR failed to intervene to award a penalty against Gusto.It was 2-2 in the 54th minute when Marcus Tavernier played a long cross to David Brooks. Gusto jumped to head it and the ball landed on his outstretched arm.The VAR, Craig Pawson, wrongly determined that the ball had hit the Chelsea player too high on the arm for handball.On-field vote: 1-4VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"The panel felt that the ball hit the 'red zone' of his arm that was raised in an unjustifiable position.\"13. Brentford 0-0 Tottenham: Romero escapes redImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Tottenham would have had to play for 10 men for almost 40 minutes had Cristian Romero been sent offIgor Thiago ran on to a ball over the top in the 56th minute, with Tottenham defender Cristian Romero making a wild swipe to try to intercept.Romero made no contact on the ball and brought down the Brentford striker. The VAR, Alex Chilowicz, felt there was no clear and obvious error in not giving the foul.  On-field vote: 2-3VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"Romero doesn't play the ball and then brings down Thiago,  who has a high likelihood of gaining control of the ball, travelling towards goal, with no covering defenders.\"How clubs have been affectedThe number of mistakes only tell part of the story. It is just as important when they happened.For instance, the one error Brighton suffered came late in a game at Chelsea which they went on to win 3-1. The mistake had no impact upon the result. Errors suffered:Bournemouth 2Brentford 2Manchester United 2Brighton 1Crystal Palace 1Everton 1Fulham 1Liverpool 1Manchester City 1Wolves 1Bournemouth, Brentford and Manchester United have suffered two VAR errors. Manchester United would argue that had Brentford been reduced to 10 men they would have had a better chance of rescuing the game. Their other error came in a 4-1 win at Wolves.Brentford have experience of this too, as Spurs should have had 10 men for most of the second half in that match. Their second error suffered came in the win against Newcastle.Bournemouth were affected when West Ham's Kilman was not sent off after conceding a penalty in the 69th minute of a 2-2 draw. They should also have had a penalty at Chelsea in a game which was also 2-2.Errors gained from:Chelsea 3Bournemouth 2Newcastle 2Arsenal 1Brentford 1Everton 1Tottenham 1West Ham 1Wolves 1Chelsea have gained the most from errors. Their home win over Fulham and draw with Bournemouth could have had different outcomes if the VAR had got the decisions correct.Bournemouth twice should have had Senesi sent off: in the 3-3 at Crystal Palace and the loss at Liverpool.Newcastle should have conceded an early penalty in their win over Manchester City, though they lost at Brentford.Arsenal, Brentford and Everton benefited in games they won; Tottenham's and West Ham's came in draws.VAR decisions by club so far this seasonWhat about all the other mistakes?The second category is mistakes on the field which the KMI Panel felt did not reach the threshold for a VAR intervention.There have been 15 this season, compared to 12 in 2024-25.The 15 are:Man City v Tottenham: Penalty not given for a foul on Oscar BobbBrentford v Aston Villa: Goal disallowed for a push on Emiliano MartinezArsenal v Leeds: Penalty given for a foul on Max DowmanFulham v Man Utd: Goal awarded despite push on Calvin BasseySunderland v Brentford: Penalty not given for Reinildo holding Nathan CollinsWest Ham v Tottenham: Disallowed goal for a foul by Micky van de VenMan City v Liverpool: Disallowed goal, Andrew Robertson offside and impactingSunderland v Bournemouth: Penalty given for a foul on ReinildoChelsea v Arsenal: Enzo Fernandez offside and impacting on Trevoh Chalobah goalTottenham v Brentford: No Cristian Romero serious foul play red cardFulham v Crystal Palace: Penalty not given for challenge by Joachim AndersenLiverpool v Brighton: No serious foul play red card for Diego GomezNewcastle v Chelsea: No penalty for challenge on Anthony GordonWolves v Brentford: Penalty award for foul by Caoimhin KelleherBrentford v Tottenham: No penalty for a foul on Archie GrayIf a decision has not appeared on this page then the KMI Panel voted it correct on the field and through VAR.Missed second yellow cardsThe panel has ruled that five players have escaped a second caution. At the halfway stage of 2024-25 there had been eight errors.This season's list is: Malick Thiaw for Newcastle at BournemouthAndre for Wolves at Aston VillaAaron Wan-Bissaka for West Ham at Manchester UnitedRuben Dias for Manchester City at Nottingham ForestMikel Merino for Arsenal at home to Aston Villa",

    "body": "9 hours agoKate WhannelPolitics reporterReutersDamien Egan first won his parliamentary seat in a by-election in 2024A visit by a Jewish MP to a school in their constituency was cancelled, after concerns were raised by local pro-Palestinian campaigners.Palestine Solidarity Bristol said it had opposed the visit by Damien Egan, the Labour MP for Bristol North East, due to his support for Israel. The cancellation took place in September but was highlighted by Communities Secretary Steve Reed during a speech to the Jewish Labour Movement at the weekend.Reed did not name Egan but told the audience: \"I have a colleague who is Jewish, who has been banned from visiting a school and refused permission to visit a school in his own constituency, in case his presence inflames the teachers.\"That is an absolute outrage... and they will be called in, and they will be held to account for doing that, because you cannot have people with those kinds of attitudes teaching our children. \"You just can't have it.\"Egan confirmed the event had been cancelled but declined to comment further. In a statement to the Times, the school said it postponed Egan's appearance because of a planned protest near the school grounds, and said it had a concern it would clash with the end of the school day. The school rearranged a date for the MP's visit and contacted police for advice.The BBC has reached out to the school for comment. On 5 September, when the event had been due to go ahead, the Palestine Solidarity Bristol group published a social media post celebrating the cancellation. It said the event had been axed after \"concerns were raised by the National Education Union trade union staff group, parents and local constituents\".It said the cancellation was \"a clear message\" that politicians who support Israel's actions in Gaza \"are not welcome in our schools\". The National Education Union has been contacted for a comment. ",

    "body": "Mandelson makes personal apology for continuing Epstein friendship4 hours agoNicholas Watt,Newsnight political editorandHarry SekulichBBCLord Mandelson has offered a personal apology to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein over his decision to maintain a friendship with the late paedophile after his conviction.The former cabinet minister had faced criticism after he offered a limited apology for system failures that had let women down, in a BBC interview on Sunday.But in a statement to BBC Newsnight on Monday, Lord Mandelson went further: \"Yesterday, I did not want to be held responsible for his [Jeffrey Epstein's] crimes of which I was ignorant, not indifferent, because of the lies he told me and so many others.\"I was wrong to believe him following his conviction and to continue my association with him afterwards. I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.\"The government dismissed Lord Mandelson as its ambassador to the US last September. Downing Street said \"new information\" had emerged relating to the former ambassador's friendship with Epstein. Emails revealed Lord Mandelson had been in contact with Epstein after the American financier's first conviction in 2008, where he advised Epstein to clear his name in a string of supportive messages.Epstein's first conviction was part of a plea bargain he reached in Florida. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to two charges, including soliciting girls as young as 14 for prostitution.In 2019, Epstein died in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.In his first interview since his dismissal as ambassador on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Mandelson did not apologise for maintaining his friendship with Epstein, insisting that he would have done so if he were \"in any way complicit or culpable\".During the interview, Mandelson also said he believed he was \"kept separate\" from Epstein's sex life because he is gay and denied seeing young girls at Epstein's properties.But in his statement to BBC Newsnight, Lord Mandelson said: \"I was never culpable or complicit in his crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death.\"But his victims did know what he was doing, their voices were not heard and I am sorry I was amongst those who believed him over them.\"Shortly before he was sacked as US ambassador, Lord Mandelson told the BBC he had \"relied on assurances of [Epstein's] innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false\".In a letter to embassy staff following his dismissal, he said: \"I continue to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims.\"Watch: Mandelson initially declined on Sunday to apologise for Epstein emailsLord Mandelson's interview on Sunday drew criticism from government benches.One cabinet minister told BBC Newsnight that Mandelson was now \"persona non grata\". Another minister described his interview as \"horrendous and toe curling\".Labour peer Baroness Kennedy said it was \"shocking\" Lord Mandelson had not initially apologised.\"I'm glad he's come out tonight and at least now is saying that his preoccupation was that people should understand that he did not himself know and had been persuaded,\" she told Newsnight.\"Somebody like Peter Mandelson should have known better than to go on television and not to be apologising to those women who have suffered so terribly,\" she added.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "17 minutes agoDearbail JordanBusiness reporterCentral banks across the world have joined together to declare that they stand in \"full solidarity\" with the Federal Reserve's chair after the US launched a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell.The heads of the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada are among 11 senior bankers who have signed a statement highlighting the importance of independence in setting interest rates.   \"Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,\" they said.The Department of Justice is conducting the probe. President Donald Trump has said he did not \"know anything\" about the investigation.The probe is linked to testimony Powell gave to a Senate committee about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. It follows a year of relentless attacks on the Fed chair by Trump.As well as criticising Powell's decisions on interest rates, Trump has made personal comments, calling the Fed chair a \"major loser\" and a \"numbskull\".Commenting on the Fed chair, the global central bankers said in their joint statement: \"To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"Until the weekend, Powell had stayed largely silent in the face of Trump's attacks but on Sunday, he publicly pushed back and warned that the independence of the US central bank was at stake.\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said.In their joint statement on Tuesday, the senior financial institutions said: \"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve.\"It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability.\" Powell, who Trump nominated as Fed chair in 2017 during his first term in the White House, is set to step down in May.Trump is expected to name his successor in the coming weeks.North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, until the matter was \"fully resolved\".Powell has also been backed by three former chairs of the Fed - Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan. A number of other eminent former officials have publicly declared their support for him and the bank's independence. Yellen, who was Powell's immediate predecessor, said the criminal investigation was \"extremely chilling\", adding that investors should be concerned. \"You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt… It is the road to banana republic,\" she told CNBC.The signatories in full are: Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of EnglandChristine Lagarde, president of the European Central BankErik Thedéen, governor of Sveriges RiksbankChristian Kettel Thomsen, chairman of the Danmarks NationalbankMartin Schlegel, chairman of the Swiss National BankMichele Bullock, governor of the Reserve Bank of AustraliaTiff Macklem, governor of the Bank of CanadaChang Yong Rhee, governor of the Bank of KoreaGabriel Galípolo, governor of the Banco Central do BrasilFrançois Villeroy de Galhau, chair of the Bank for International SettlementsPablo Hernández de Cos, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements",

    "body": "The BBC will file a motion to dismiss Donald Trump's lawsuit over how his 6 January 2021 speech was edited in a Panorama documentary.The US president filed a $5bn (£3.7bn) lawsuit in a Florida court last month, accusing the BBC of defamation and of violating a trade practices law.Court papers filed on Monday show the broadcaster will argue the Florida court lacks \"personal jurisdiction\" over the BBC, the court venue is \"improper\" and that Trump has \"failed to state a claim\".The BBC previously apologised to Trump over the edit, but rejected his demands for compensation and disagreed there was a basis for a defamation claim.The corporation will also argue that Panorama programme was not aired in the US and did not defame the US president.It will also assert that the president has not demonstrated that the documentary caused any actual damage to him, noting that he was re-elected after the programme aired and carried Florida with a commanding majority.Trump claims that the documentary aired on Britbox, which the BBC said is not correct.The BBC will add that Trump cannot plausibly allege that the documentary was published with \"actual malice\". It points out that the clip is some 15 seconds of an hour-long programme containing extensive coverage of his supporters and balanced coverage of his path to re-election.During Trump's speech on 6 January 2021, before a riot at the US Capitol, he told a crowd: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme, a clip showed him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"The BBC previously acknowledged the edit had given \"the mistaken impression\" Trump had \"made a direct call for violent action\", but disagreed that there was basis for a defamation claim.An internal BBC memo leaked in November criticised how the speech was edited, and led to the resignations of the corporation's director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness.In Monday's court documents, the broadcaster also asked the court \"to stay all other discovery\" - a pre-trial process in which opposing parties exchange evidence and information - pending the decision on the motion.A proposed trial date in 2027 has been indicated should the case progress.A BBC spokesperson said: \"As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

    "body": "A high-stakes appeal by far-right French politician Marine Le Pen starts on Tuesday against a ruling that banned her from running for public office for five years.Le Pen, 57, was found guilty last year of embezzling EU funds and, if the ban is upheld, she will not be able to stand in the 2027 presidential election. She denies  any wrongdoing and, as the appeal was about to start, told reporters she was \"hopeful\" about the outcome.On Monday, the president of her National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, said barring her from the election would be \"deeply worrying for democracy\". Bardella said he would not stand for president but would instead seek the lower-ranking post of prime minister.   The case at the Paris Court of Appeal will last until 12 February but a ruling is not expected before the summer, well ahead of next year's presidential vote.Last year's case centred on charges that Le Pen, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, hired assistants who worked on her RN party affairs rather than for the European Parliament which paid them.The judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been at the \"heart of the system\" that saw the embezzlement of €2.9m (£2.5m) worth of European funds.Le Pen was given a four-year prison sentence – with two years suspended and the remaining two to be served with an electronic tag rather than in custody. She was handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine and banned from seeking public office \"with immediate effect\".If she loses her appeal, she could face an even longer jail term.More than 20 RN figures were also found guilty in last year's trial and the party was ordered to pay a €2m fine, with half the amount suspended. Eleven of Le Pen's colleagues are taking part in the Paris appeal, but 12 have decided not to challenge the original verdicts, including her sister Yann Le Pen who was given a one-year suspended prison term.Addressing journalists on the eve of the appeal trial in the presence of Le Pen, Bardella said the RN leader would prove her innocence.\"It would be deeply worrying for democracy if the justice system were to deprive the French people of a presidential candidate, already qualified twice for the second round and now considered the undisputed favourite in the election,\" he said.Under the French legal system, an appeals court reviews the decision of the lower, first-instance, court in its entirety - including facts as well as points of law.Le Pen will be hoping the Paris appeals court overturns last year's verdict and clears her name and path to run for the highest office in France for the fourth time.A second possible outcome would be for the appeals panel to affirm the guilty verdict but remove the \"immediate effect\" clause. This would enable her to run even if she decided to appeal to the country's highest court – the Court of Cassation – to overturn the guilty verdict.A third outcome could see the appeals judges curtail the five-year ban sufficiently to enable Le Pen to register by the March 2027 deadline.And a fourth would be to leave the lower court's decisions intact. This would make it next to impossible to run – even though she would still be expected to take the case to the Court of Cassation.The fifth - which would definitely rule Le Pen out of the race - would be for the original conviction to be upheld and the sentence to be stiffened. After all, the offence may be punishable with up to 10 years in jail.With the presidential election expected to be held around April 2027, much will depend on the substance – as well as the timing – of the judgements. The far-right leader has twice made it to the run-off stage and many of her supporters think she has a chance of winning if she is cleared to run next year.However, an opinion poll - published by Le Monde newspaper on the eve of the appeal - suggested her protege Bardella may have a better chance of winning - 49% against 18% for Le Pen.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterA crackdown on migrants working in the UK illegally has led to a surge in arrests, the government has said. The Home Office said the number of immigration raids on businesses such as nail bars, car washes, barbers and takeaways had increased by 77% since Labour came to power, with an 83% rise in arrests.Opposition parties have warned that opportunities to work illegally in the UK act as a pull factor for migrants, encouraging people to cross the Channel in small boats.More than 41,000 people made the dangerous journey in 2025, the highest number since 2022 and almost 5,000 more than the previous year.Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said \"illegal working is booming because Labour have turned Britain into a soft touch\".  He added: \"As long as people who arrive illegally can work, earn, and stay, smugglers have a sales pitch, a reward they dangle in front of those crossing the Channel.\"The number of people arrested during immigration raids on businesses has been rising steadily for some time and was increasing before Labour took office.Between July 2024 and the end of December 2025, more than 17,400 businesses were raided by immigration enforcement teams, a 77% increase on the previous 18 months, according to the Home Office.It said these raids had led to more than 12,300 arrests, which equates to an 83% rise, and more than 1,700 of those people have been deported. Dr Peter Walsh, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said enforcement action alone was unlikely to be a \"game-changer on small boat crossings\".He pointed out that historically detentions and removals have been far lower than arrests.He added: \"Raids may lead to some increase in removals, but they're not the biggest source. \"The bigger impact is likely on employers, where there is evidence that workplace enforcement discourages hiring people without the right to work.\"The government said arrests by immigration enforcement teams had risen in every region of the UK, with the largest number of arrests in London, the West Midlands and south-west England.In London, more than 2,100 arrests were made last year, a 47% rise compared to 2024. Meanwhile, more than 1,100 arrests were made in both the West Midlands and south-west England, a rise of 76% and 91% respectively.In Wales, 1,320 raids were carried out last year, resulting in 649 arrests - a rise of 103% and 85% respectively.In Scotland there were 695 raids leading to 400 arrests - a rise of 61% and 49% respectively.In Northern Ireland, 187 raids led to 234 arrests - a rise of 76% and 169% respectively.Among the businesses raided were a warehouse in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, on 25 November, where 13 people were arrested, with 11 Brazilian and Romanian nationals detained for removal from the UK.Other examples included a raid on a construction site in Swindon on 16 December, which led to 30 arrests of Indian and Albanian men, who were nearly all detained for removal.Meanwhile, a raid on a market at Kempton Park racecourse in Surrey on 11 December resulted in 11 arrests.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"There is no place for illegal working in our communities.\"That is why we have surged enforcement activity to the highest level in British history so illegal migrants in the black economy have nowhere to hide.\"I will stop at nothing to restore order and control to our borders.\"The surge in raids followed an extra £5m of funding for Immigration Enforcement last year.The government is also planning to introduce digital ID, which will be mandatory to prove someone's right to work by 2029, to make it harder for migrants to work illegally.",

    "body": "6 hours agoEmma Clifford BellBBC Scotland NewsBBCMegan Lafferty is hoping to move out of her mum's house but can't afford private rentsIt is Budget Day in Scotland, and decisions made at Holyrood later will shape lives far beyond the debating chamber. Announcements on income tax, housing, education and benefits will have an impact across the country.With just four months until the election, BBC Scotland News asked voters what would make a difference to their lives.Their concerns highlight the tough choices facing the government.The under 30: 'Private rent is unaffordable'Megan would like more focus on housing and support for young adults leaving home and setting up for the first time.The retail assistant, from Airdrie in North Lanarkshire, says she is planning on finding her own place this year.\"I'm currently living with my mum but looking to move out this year as we are being evicted from our house due to the landlord selling.\"Private rent it is just so unaffordable for me. \"It's affecting my mental health, my confidence, feeling like I may not have anywhere to go or feeling like I'll never be able to be independent.\"I'd like the government to really keep a close eye on councils and offer them support when they can, offer as much as they can to people who cannot afford to move out on their own.\"Public transport is another issue that's important to Megan.She added: \"The costs are becoming more unaffordable and I'd like them to offer more alternative transport links to Glasgow city centre.\"The low earner: 'I don't want to be taxed on a pay rise'Alan wants more support for low earners like himself and his wife.The 54-year-old, from Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, has been working for the same retail company since the age of 17 and receives more than the National Minimum Wage.With his wife also earning a low amount, the household budget can be a challenge.He would  like to see the Scottish government move the bands for income tax to make sure he is not penalised for any pay increases.Alan's other priority would be giving more money to the NHS, especially given some recent \"horror\"' stories about people having to wait several hours for an ambulance.The higher earner: 'I earn more so I should pay more'Graham, a father-of-two based in Edinburgh, is comfortable now but faced insecurity recently.\"I was made redundant [and didn't work] for six months last year and it was a horrible time - especially with the cost of living so high.\"He thinks the highest earners should be paying a bit more tax.\"I'm on the second tax bracket now and I'm happy to pay tax. I was previously in the top bracket. I believe the biggest shoulders should be paying more.\"There's far too much money in society now between a small group of people so those with multiple properties etc need to be doing a bit more.\"Scottish Budget 2026Graham also feels the NHS is feeling the strain and a better distribution of wealth might help with that.\"In terms of education, I know how lucky we are in be in a good catchment area - but we need to be balancing things out a bit,\" he added.\"I'm so proud to live in a country that provides free university education but I don't know how sustainable it is. \"Maybe after students graduate there could be a system of contributing back when you get into a good job.\"The small business owner: 'We can't grow when we are trying to stay afloat'Temi started a small business in Dunfermline, Fife, selling African groceries. She did her research and managed to find repayable grants to get set up.Temi also secured a 100% business rate reduction because she is based in the city centre.She has found a good customer base but she finds herself unable to move forward with her ambitions.\"I want to open a restaurant but if I take another property the rates will be through the roof,\" Temi said.\"The Scottish government could look at providing a funding budget for councils to help small businesses.\"Some funding is there but people don't know what is accessible. People do not have the capital to launch a business.\"Temi feels that ministers don't understand what small business owners need.She added: \"We need a proactive government that will listen to the actual reality of businesses.\"We can't grow when we are trying to stay afloat.\"BBC Scotland will air a special Budget programme on Tuesday, and you can follow live coverage on the BBC Scotland News website.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesStyles has won six Brit Awards as a solo artist, including album of the year for his last release, Harry's HouseHarry Styles has hinted he is about to end his four-year musical drought, with a series of cryptic billboards appearing in cities around the world including New York, Manchester, Palermo, São Paulo and Berlin.The posters bear the message \"we belong together\" superimposed over a photo of a stadium of fans, taken from the last date of Styles' 2022-23 world tour.A website with the same branding launched simultaneously. Clicking on the page opens a WhatsApp group chat called \"HSHQ\" - Harry Styles Headquarters.Fans believe that all this activity points to Styles gearing up to announce his fourth album, after a brief detour into marathon running last year.  The star, who was propelled to fame as part of One Direction, was spotted at both the Tokyo and Berlin Marathons last year - clocking up an impressive time of 2 hours 59 minutes in the latter race in September.He was also seen in St. Peter's Square for the announcement of the new pope and then, according to the Mirror, with actress Zoe Kravitz in his Cheshire hometown over Christmas.But he is believed to have been working on new music since his Love On Tour concerts wrapped up three years ago.The billboards have appeared in more than a dozen cities worldwideThe new album would be his first since 2022's Brit and Grammy Award-winning Harry's House, which spawned singles As It Was, Late Night Talking and Music For A Sushi Restaurant.Sessions for the record were initially confirmed in August 2024, when Styles was seen arriving at London's RAK Studios. Last year, Australian radio hosts Fifi, Fev and Nick claimed it was finished and that Styles wrote it entirely \"on a typewriter\" - although their sources seemed dubious, at best.The New York Post has also reported that Styles has signed a deal for a residency at the city's iconic Madison Square Garden, where he played for 15 nights on his most recent tour.There have also been rumours that the star will play a residency at Manchester's Co-op Live arena. Styles is a significant investor in the venue, which opened in 2024 and will host this year's Brit Awards.Harry Styles / YouTubeStyles' posted a new music video over Christmas as a gift to his fansStyles first hinted at his comeback on 27 December, when he posted an eight-minute video on YouTube, titled Forever, Forever.The clip began with fans preparing for the final date of his world tour, which took place in Reggio Emilia, Italy, in July 2023. They were shown practicing dance moves and exchanging friendship bracelets outside the stadium, but also shedding tears as they prepared to say goodbye to their idol.\"Some sadness because it is the last show... then he will disappear,\" one fan said.\"We won't see him dancing on stages anymore,\" added another.'Let the light in'The video then cut to Styles on stage, sitting at a piano wearing a sparkly open vest and matching trousers.\"I wrote this for you,\" he said in Italian, before launching into a moving instrumental ballad that he had written especially for the occasion.As he ended the performance and waved \"grazie\" to his fans, the words We Belong Together flashed up on the screen - tying the video directly to the new poster campaign.Getty ImagesStyles' last tour made more than $500m (£371m) at the box office and he has sold more than 30m records, as part of One Direction and as a solo artistThe phrase \"we belong together\" feels very in character for Styles - who launched his last album with the slogan \"treat people with kindness\".It's also the name of a Mariah Carey song, so maybe he's been training to hit her infamous whistle notes in his time off?Either way, fans are ravenous for more information. \"It's happening?!\" said one, kicking off a long discussion on a Reddit forum dedicated to Styles.There, people speculated that a new logo - 12 arrows emanating from the centre of a circle - could mean there will be 12 tracks on the new record.Some of the posters also carry extra text, which could be song titles or lyrics.Among them are \"let the light in\" (Berlin), \"it's all waiting there\" (Naples) and \"here we go again\" (Manchester).Nothing has been confirmed yet - and there's always the possibility that Styles is simply teasing the release of a concert film.Whatever happens, though, fans are ready.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJose TembeMaputoSABCCarolina Cecilia Chirindza and Rosita were lifted to safety by a South African helicopter helping recovery operationsShe was seen as a \"miracle baby\" after being born in a tree which her mother had climbed to escape flooding, but nearly 26 years on Mozambican Rosita Salvador Mabuiango has died after a long illness, her sister told the BBC.The sight of the newborn and her mother being winched to safety by helicopter amid the deluged landscape became a defining image of the floods of 2000 – Mozambique's worst ever.Reflecting on the life of Rosita, also known as Rosita Pedro, President Daniel Chapo described her as a symbol for girls in the country.In February 2000, hundreds died and hundreds of thousands of others were forced from their homes after the Limpopo river burst its banks in southern Mozambique.SABCThe TV cameras captured the first images of RositaRosita's mother, Carolina Cecilia Chirindza, was one of those caught up in the crisis.\"It was a Sunday afternoon about four o'clock, and the waters began rising,\" the Red Cross quoted her as saying later in 2000 about what happened that February.\"The water was coming right up to the house, and was getting stronger and stronger, so like everyone else in the village, we headed for the trees.\"I put my two small children on my back and tried to climb up. It was very difficult.\"There were 15 of us all together, and we were there for four days. We prayed and prayed.\"We had nothing to eat, and the children cried and cried, but we could do nothing for them.\"In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Carolina went into labour and shortly afterwards she and the newborn were spotted by a South African military helicopter that was helping in the rescue operations.The Guardian newspaper later reported that while Carolina was giving birth her mother-in-law held a capulana (sarong) under her, to ensure that the baby did not fall into the floodwater. Rosita was still attached to her mother through the umbilical cord when they were found, reports said.\"I think my baby is different from the other babies in that she was born in a tree and in that it was God's will for her to live and for her to get through this situation,\" Carolina said later.The two became symbols of the aftermath of the disaster, and they travelled to the US later in 2000 to speak to Congress and help raise awareness about what had happened.AFP via Getty ImagesCarolina and Rosita were photographed in Washington in July 2000 during a short trip thereOn Monday, confirming the news of Rosita's death at 25, her sister Celia Salvador told the BBC that she had \"passed away after a prolonged illness. I'm extremely sad. She died of an illness I am unable to explain what it was.\"According to other family sources, Rosita had been battling against the blood disorder anaemia for years. As a result of the worsening of her condition, she had been in hospital for more than two weeks, where she eventually died on Monday morning.Rosita's mother also told a local TV station that in addition to anaemia, she was suffering from tuberculosis. \"My God. Very bad news. My condolences to the bereaved family,\" the president told the BBC.\"She was a symbol for girls in Mozambique. That's why, I extend my condolences to all the Mozambican people, especially to Mozambican girls.\"Rosita grew up with her family and graduated from high school in the same rural area - Chibuto - where she was born. She herself had a daughter five years ago.Her family has said that after high school, Rosita had failed to get a scholarship to study petrochemical engineering even though the government had promised to fund her studies from primary to higher education.Political analyst Charles Mangwiro described her death as a \"wake-up call for the government to improve service delivery in the entire health system in the country. \"You cannot expect to survive when health professionals complain every day about unpaid salaries for months and about the shortage of essentials like protective materials and antibiotics.\"Despite the recruitment of more health workers in recent years, analysts continue to describe an overstretched health system short of basic drugs and equipment.Chibuto Mayor Henriques Machava told the press that conversations were under way with the family to formalise the funeral arrangements, which, according to him, would be taken care of by the municipality.More about Mozambique from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "17 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorBBCOne of these images is a real photo, while the other two have been digitally altered by Grok to change what I'm wearing. Can you tell which is real?Here's me, at the end of a pier in Dorset in the summer.Two of these images were generated using the artificial intelligence tool Grok, which is free to use and belongs to Elon Musk.It's pretty convincing. I've never worn the rather fetching yellow ski suit, or the red and blue jacket - the middle photo is the original - but I don't know how I could prove that if I needed to, because of those pictures.Of course, Grok is under fire for undressing rather than redressing women. And doing so without their consent.It made pictures of people in bikinis, or worse, when prompted by others. And shared the results in public on the social network X. There is also evidence it has generated sexualised images of children.Following days of outrage and condemnation, the UK's online regulator Ofcom has said it is urgently investigating whether Grok has broken British online safety laws.The government wants Ofcom to get on with it - and fast.But Ofcom will have to be thorough and follow its own processes if it wants to avoid criticism of attacking free speech, which has dogged the Online Safety Act from its earliest stages.Elon Musk has been uncharacteristically quiet on the subject in recent days, which suggests even he realises how serious this all is. But he did fire off a post accusing the British government of seeking \"any excuse\" for censorship.Not everyone agrees that on this occasion, the defence is acceptable.\"AI undressing people in photos isn't free speech - it's abuse,\" says campaigner Ed Newton Rex.\"When every photo a woman posts of themselves on X immediately attracts public replies in which they've been stripped down to a bikini, something has gone very, very wrong.\"With all this in mind, Ofcom's investigation could take time, and a lot of back-and-forth – testing the patience of both politicians and the public.It's a major moment not only for Britain's Online Safety Act, but the regulator itself. It can't afford to get this wrong.Ofcom has previously been accused of lacking teeth. The Act, which was years in the making, only came fully into force last year. It has so far issued six fines, the largest of which is £1m - and so far only one has been paid.The Online Safety Act doesn't specifically mention AI products either. And while it is currently illegal to share intimate, non-consensual images, including deepfakes, it is not currently illegal to ask an AI tool to create them. That's about to change. The government will this week bring into force a law which will make it illegal to create these images.And the UK says it will amend another law - currently going through Parliament - which would make it illegal for companies to supply the tools designed to make them, too.These rules have been around for a while, they're not actually part of the Online Safety Act but a completely different piece of legislation called the Data (Use and Access) Act.They've not been brought into enforcement despite repeated announcements from the government over many months that they were incoming.Today's announcement shows a government determined to quell criticisms that regulation moves too slowly, by showing it can act quickly when it wants to.It's not just Grok that will be affected. A political bombshell?The new law that will be enforced this week could prove to be a headache for other owners of AI tools which are technically mostly capable of generating these images as well.And there are already questions around how on earth it will be enforced - Grok only came under the spotlight because it was publishing its output on X.If a tool is used privately by an individual user, they find a way around the guardrails and the resulting content is only shared with those who want to see it, how will it come to light?If X is found to have broken the law, Ofcom could issue it with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18m, whichever is greater. It could even seek to block Grok or X in the UK. But this could also be a political bombshell.I sat at the AI Summit in Paris last year and watched Vice President JD Vance thunder that the US administration was \"getting tired\" of foreign countries attempting to regulate its tech companies.His audience, which included a huge number of world leaders, sat in stony silence.But the tech firms have a lot of firepower inside the White House – and several of them have also invested billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the UK. Can the country afford to fall out with them?",

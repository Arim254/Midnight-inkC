    "body": "1 hour agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesPolice have identified the first four bodies of people who were killed in a fire at a bar in a Swiss ski resort on New Year's Eve.The bodies of two Swiss women aged 21 and 16, and two Swiss men aged 18 and 16 have been returned to their families, police said.\"Extensive\" work from officers and the Institute of Forensic Medicine made the identifications possible, Valais cantonal police said in a statement, and work to identify the remaining victims continues.The blaze at Le Constellation in Crans-Montana killed 40 people and injured 119 others, officials have said. With many of the injured identified, families now face an agonising wait for information about those still missing.The likely cause of the fire was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation of how the fire began found. Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin called it \"one of the worst tragedies\" experienced by the country.Further details about the identified victims, including names, have not been released.Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.On Friday, police said 113 of the injured have been identified, and include 71 Swiss, 14 French and 11 Italian citizens.A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

    "body": "The government has launched a recruitment drive for thousands of new magistrates  to volunteer in England and Wales as part of its efforts to grapple with the crown court backlog.The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said more than 2,000 magistrates have been trained since 2022 and the latest call aims to boost that number by another 2,000 within the next financial year.Justice Secretary David Lammy said magistrates served \"a vital role\" in the court system and \"we need more people of every age and background to volunteer\".In December, Lammy announced sweeping reforms to the criminal courts, including removing juries from a number of trials in England and Wales to speed up the justice process.Latest figures showed more than 79,600 criminal cases were caught in the courts backlog in England and Wales - a record high since early 2023 and is projected to hit 100,000 by 2028, according to the MoJ.The delays mean that for some serious crimes charged in 2026, victims and suspects could be left waiting years for justice as they are unlikely to see the case come to trial before 2030.Lammy praised magistrates as \"everyday heroes\" who hear thousands of cases across every jurisdiction.\"Volunteering to become a magistrate can make a real difference to your life and the lives of others - that's why I'm calling on the public to apply and play your part,\" he added.The Magistrates' Association described the push as a \"big vote of confidence\" in magistrates, but called for more resources for the courts, including trained legal advisers and repairs for crumbling court buildings.Shadow justice minister Kieran Mullan said while the recruitment drive was welcome, the move \"cannot paper over the failings of a justice secretary and Labour government that has consistently failed to deliver meaningful reform\".All magistrates are expected to volunteer at least 13 days a year to hear cases.Magistrates are wanted across criminal, youth, and civil and family proceedings, and have specialist legal advisers to support them to deal with a range of cases.Latest figures show 57% of magistrates are female and 14% come from an ethnic minority background, with London having the highest proportion of 31%, according to the MoJ.",

The incident was reported at 15:10 GMT on Friday, resulting in a major search involving a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.BBC/Jessica LaneConditions at the scene have been described as \"horrendous\" as snow and ice warnings apply across much of the UKSnow and ice warnings are covering much of the UK over the weekend and beyond, with a yellow warning in place for the east coast of England until 23:49 on Saturday.At Withernsea, snow began to fall just after first light and those searching are battling bitterly cold and windy conditions.The sea is rough, with waves crashing above the sea wall, and members of the coastguard were walking along the promenade, scanning the rocks below.Search teams moved on to the beach as the tide started to go out, but a few inches of snow had already settled.BBC/Jessica LaneMembers of the coastguard resumed searches at first light on SaturdayWithernsea Methodist Church opened its doors for prayers on Saturday morning.Reverend Ian Greenfield said he had received messages from all over the country offering support to the seaside town.\"When we realized the severity of it and the tragedy of it, we felt it was really important that we had our church open this morning for people to come along.\"For people to be able to come and pray and to receive emotional support,\" he said.BBC/Amanda WhiteReverend Ian Greenfield says the community has received messages of support from across the UKThe search had been paused at about 00:30 on Saturday and resumed at first light.A spokesperson for HM Coastguard said teams from Hull, Withernsea, Hornsea and Bridlington were sent to the scene at 06:30 to continue the search.A police spokesperson said: \"Residents will continue to see an increased police presence in and around the area as the search continues.\"We continue to ask that people avoid the area to allow emergency services to work efficiently and safely.\"Hornsea Inshore Rescue said on Friday it had faced \"horrendous conditions\" and there had been 9.8ft (3m) waves.The operation has involved about 100 members of the emergency services, including Yorkshire Ambulance and Humberside Fire and Rescue.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesRelated internet links",

The Met Office issued an amber weather warning for snow up until midday on Saturday, and numerous yellow weather warnings for snow and ice have been issued for the coming days.The frigid conditions are set to persist by day and night into next week. Overnight snow showers may lead to disruption for the first proper commute of the year on Monday. Atlantic weather fronts clashing with the cold air may cause further issues as we head through the week too.",

    "body": "4 hours agoWill JeffordEast MidlandsLouise GatherLouise Gather said she had not foraged any mushrooms on the day that she was reportedA police officer involved in a controversy sparked by efforts to sanction a woman for  mushroom foraging has been found to have committed gross misconduct.In November 2024, Louise Gather travelled from her home in Derby to Bradgate Park, Leicestershire, in search of magpie inkcaps - a rare kind of fungus.The 39-year-old told the BBC she did not pick any mushrooms, but despite this, former PC Christopher Vickers later attended her property and issued a community resolution order.However, the misconduct panel found he had issued the paperwork to her husband and then lied when updating an official police database - claiming to have spoken directly to Mrs Gather.Louise GatherMrs Gather had travelled to Bradgate Park in search of magpie inkcaps - a rare kind of fungusThe misconduct panel said he would have been sacked over the incident if he had not already left the force.It was found Mr Vickers's actions had been dishonest, deliberate, and had the potential to damage police confidence.A report issued by Leicestershire Police following the hearing said the case could have caused Mrs Gather \"significant\" harm.\"She ultimately could have lost her job had the CR [community resolution] remained on her enhanced DBS checks,\" the report added.Community resolution orders are an informal agreement between a complainant and an alleged offender.For one to be valid, the alleged offender should be spoken to directly, accept responsibility and sign the relevant paperwork.The report concluded Mr Vickers did not follow this policy when issuing the resolution.Mrs Gather previously said the order had included agreeing not to take items from the park in the future, and looking into Bradgate Park's status as a designated site of special scientific interest (SSSI).Picking mushrooms is illegal in sites of special scientific interest, which are protected areas of land or water.At the time of the incident, Mrs Gather had said she felt the actions of Leicestershire Police had been \"a bit excessive\" - although this was not assessed by the misconduct panel.The hearing, which took place on 29 October 2025, was told the force received a call from Bradgate Park Trust about a woman who was picking mushrooms at their park in Leicester on 8 November 2024.On 25 November, Mr Vickers went to her home address and advised her husband that he would issue a community resolution, an informal agreement between a complainant and an alleged offender.Her husband signed the relevant paperwork before the officer left.PA MediaBradgate Park is protected as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI)Following the visit, Mr Vickers put an entry on a police system stating that he had spoken to Mrs Gather, that she had admitted to the offence and that she had received the community resolution.In response to the allegation, the former officer accepted his actions, but said he was intending to call Mrs Gather but had forgotten.Concluding the report, the misconduct committee said Mr Vickers knew his actions did not align with police policy and were done \"for his own convenience\" and to avoid what he \"perceived to be unnecessary work\".Following the misconduct hearing, Mrs Gather told the BBC: \"I did not personally instigate or pursue a complaint against the officer.\"The professional standards department asked for my version of events after the story was picked up by the press, when they realised that the officer had recorded a crime on my record without evidence or ever speaking to me.\"Leicestershire Police had already apologised, and the charge was removed from my record.\"I had no idea that records had been falsified or that the officer's actions constituted gross misconduct.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Two people including a three-year-old child have been killed and around 28 others injured in a Russian strike on Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. A multi-storey residential apartment block was almost completely destroyed in the dual missile attack on Friday afternoon, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called \"heinous\". Russia's Defence Ministry denied reports of an attack, suggesting the blast had been caused by Ukrainian ammunition detonating.The strike comes ahead of crunch talks on a US-brokered peace plan in Kyiv on Saturday.Zelensky says around 15 countries are expected to attend the talks, along with representatives from the EU and Nato, with a US delegation joining the meeting via video link. Leaders of the so-called coalition of the willing are then set to meet in France on 6 January.Officials in Kharkiv said the bodies of a woman and a three-year-old child were found in the rubble, with preliminary information suggesting the pair may have been a mother and son. \"Unfortunately, this is how the Russians treat life and people – they continue killing, despite all efforts by the world, and especially by the United States, in the diplomatic process,\" Zelensky wrote on X.Of the 28 injured, which included a six-month-old baby, 16 have been taken to hospital. A search and rescue operation is ongoing, with more than 80 volunteers working at the scene, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Telegram that its armed forces \"neither planned nor launched attacks using missile weapons or aircraft weapons within the city of Kharkiv\".It added that footage from before the attack showed \"heavy smoke of unknown origin\", which it cited as evidence of ammunition detonated by Ukrainian armed forces.The ministry also alleged that the reports were seeking to distract attention from a New Year's Eve strike on a hotel in a Russian-held part of the southern Kherson region of Ukraine.Russia has accused Ukraine of killing at least 27 people and injuring more than 30 others in the drone strike on a New Year's party in the village of Khorly on the Black Sea.The BBC has not been able to independently verify either these claims or the number of casualties.Ukraine told the BBC it would not directly respond to sources of information such as claims from governors of occupied regions.It added that it adhered to the norms of international humanitarian law and conducted strikes exclusively against military targets.Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened an investigation into the attack, while the Russian foreign ministry accused Zelensky of \"seeking to intimidate the populations of the reunited Russian regions, who have forever linked their fates with Russia through referendums\".",

    "body": "4 days agoJonathan GeddesGlasgow and West reporterBBCDr Tori Herridge visited Kelvingrove Park to witness the skatepark excavation, When archaeologists began work on the site of Scotland's first skatepark last August, there was one prominent question being asked - when had the ground actually been filled in?It was a mystery solved through research, hard work - and a chocolate wrapper more than 40 years old.A team from the University of Glasgow team worked with volunteers and students to excavate the former Kelvin Wheelies park in Kelvingrove Park.Now the work on the skatepark will feature in an episode of the BBC's Digging For Britain programme, due to air 7 January.The skatepark opened in May 1978 and featured bowls, a slalom run and a half-pipe, all with names like Jaws, Torpedo and Bazooka.At the time it was considered state of the art and hosted events like the Scottish Skateboarding Championship, but several years later the site was out of commission, after a decline in popularity, concern about maintenance costs and safety risks.Exactly when it closed was a matter of debate, though.Speaking to Digging For Britain host Dr Tori Herridge, Dr Kenny Brophy of the university of Glasgow explained that while it was known that the skatepark was out of use by the early 1980s, an exact date had not been confirmed.He said: \"Even the smallest bit of evidence could help us say when this was backfilled, because there is actually no record of when this happened. Everyone is saying was it 1982 or 1983 or 1984, but no-one remembers exactly when. \"It's amazing how quickly people forget - archaeology can bring those memories back.\"Iain UrquhartThe skatepark was popular in the late 70s, but fell out of fashion a few years laterThe team, which included a number of modern skaters who use the current park at Kelvingrove - yards away from the original site - then got to work, using the same techniques that would be used on sites hundreds or thousands of years old.They analysed soil and rubble within the original slalom they discovered, while on another section members of the team discovered two white lines - which they eventually guessed was a way of telling skaters where to aim for when performing a trick.Skaters young and old gathered to appreciate the discovery - one younger skater said hearing about the old park was like \"hearing fairytales\" and like nothing she had ever skated on before.Another called the find interesting because skateboarding has changed so much, meaning parks like the 1970s one no longer exist.See Scotland's first skatepark in its 80s heydayFor Jamie Blair, who owns Glasgow skateboarding shop Clan Skates, the excavation brought back many memories.He was a member of the Kelvingrove skateboard team, and as a teenager would perform tricks and flips on a regular basis at the Kelvin Wheelies.     \"It was a great shame that this park got filled in, it broke a lot of skateboarders' hearts,\" he told Dr Herridge.\"It was good to roll back, and see it, and it was fun trying to find things you remembered from the past – 'oh, this is where that was…'  \"My other reaction was 'jeez, am I that old?' - I was literally digging up the bones of my childhood! But skateboarding is alive and well, so it's all good.\"The best before date of a chocolate biscuit provided evidence for when the park had closedHowever, it was later in the dig that the team were finally able to establish a more definitive date for when exactly the skatepark had closed.The solution involved Scottish football great Denis Law, and a couple of popular chocolate brands.\"In terms of dating some of the material, we have been quite lucky,\" says Kieran Manchip, a project officer with Archaeology Scotland. \"We were able to find sweetie wrappers that had best before dates on them. So we have a six pack of Penguin biscuits  and on the rear side it says 14 March 1983, and we found a lovely Twix wrapper at the bottom of the rubble. \"It says 21 May 1983, so we know the site was backfilled by May 1983.\"We found a hologram sticker or poster of Denis Law wearing a Man Utd shirt, which can be dated to the early 70s (Law left Manchester United in 1973).\"The processes are the same with archaeology – you can apply them to any time in the human past.\"Part of the original skatepark was unearthed during the digDr Brophy hopes the work on the skatepark site will help ensure it is remembered by future generations. In Jamie Blair's case, the excavation brought the past flooding back.\"I remember the laughs you had, your friends, your teammates. We were just crazy for skateboarding.\"",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" of demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.Meanwhile, an Iranian police spokesman said officers would not allow what he called \"enemies\" to turn \"unrest into chaos\".Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while and another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the country's Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi-Azad warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with a \"decisive response\".This stance was echoed by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said it was \"completely fair\" that shopkeepers protest the economic situation, but that any \"rioters must be put in their place\".Iran's UN Ambassador Amir-Saeid Iravani called on the UN Security Council to condemn Trump's statement in letter to the secretary-general and president of the Security Council on Friday, news agency Reuters reported. \"Iran will exercise its rights decisively and proportionately. The United States of America bears full responsibility for any consequences arising from these unlawful threats and any ensuing escalation,\" he wrote in the letter.",

    "body": "7 days agoJonathan GeddesGlasgow and west reporterGetty ImagesThe Bearsden shark was discovered near Glasgow in 1982Think of sharks and the most common images that spring to mind will likely be of dangerous predators hunting prey, accompanied by ominous music.  However, a town in the leafy suburbs of Glasgow has its own connection to the famous fish - and it dates back millions of years.In 1982 a complete shark fossil was discovered in Bearsden, in East Dunbartonshire. It was so complete experts could even see the remains of the last meal eaten by the fish, 330 million years after it died.Now a group of local enthusiasts are hoping to install a sculpture of the fish in the town, ensuring the tale of the Bearsden Shark will be remembered for future generations.     The one metre long shark - officially named as the Akmonistion zangerli - was discovered at the Manse Burn in Bearsden, among dozens of other fish and plant samples found during an excavation of the site.According to local legend, some boys in the area had discovered fossils and brought them to the attention of Bearsden fossil hunter Stan Wood, at that time working at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow.He arranged for the excavation to take place throughout the summer of 1982, with the Bearsden shark the most exciting find.\"It's the most complete fossil shark of any kind, anywhere, of any age,\" says Dr Neil Clark, the curator of palaeontology at the Hunterian.  \"It's totally preserved, so every vertebrae and every tooth is in the place it was when it was alive. It's a very useful fossil for understanding what these sharks are like, as before we usually worked with just pieces of teeth or the head.\"For something like the megalodon (usually portrayed in various action and horror films as gigantic) we have no idea how big it really was because we just have the teeth to go on.\"These sharks became extinct during the Triassic period when around 96 per cent of creatures died out – that was far more than during the Cretaceous period which marked the end of the dinosaurs. \" Hunterian MuseumThe fossil is on display at the Hunterian MuseumGiven this was hundreds of millions of years ago, Scotland bore no resemblance to the land it is today, instead being located near the equator.\"What is now Bearsden was part of a lagoon,\" explains Neil Buchanan, an enthusiast on the shark.  \"That lent to the type of fish that were there, shrimps and the like. Then there was some sort of catastrophic event for the shark, which killed it, but it seemed to sink into mud.\"Yet while soft tissue usually rots away, the lack of oxygen caused by the manner of the shark's death and more mud landing on top preserved the fish.A plaque on a small cairn already marks where the discovery was made, but Mr Buchanan and others in the Bearsden Shark Group would now like to see a sculpture in the town as a memento of the shark.\"People are beginning to forget about it, \" he says. \"You mention the Bearsden shark to people and sometimes they have no idea about it.  \"One of the things we have come to realise is that the site itself is isolated from the population, so we came up with the idea of a permanent display in the town centre.\"The quality would hopefully be attractive enough for people locally to look at, and maybe even have visitors come.\"Dr Neil Clark says there are still mysteries to be solved regarding the sharkDespite the shark being so well preserved, Dr Clark says there remain many mysteries about the fish found in a Bearsden burn.\"There is still a lot to be found out about them, especially the structure behind the head,\" he explains. \"There are a lot of different theories. At the time it was found they thought maybe it arched its back and make it look like a huge mouth, but it's so narrow it wouldn't actually look like a mouth, so that theory is out the window. \"Another theory has it as a male shark and perhaps it was a purpose in mating, like for scratching females. \"There is still so much more to be found about these creatures, but we may never discover it. \"Research is still ongoing regarding the things dug out of Bearsden and there's always something new coming out from them - that's what is so magical about it.\"",

    "body": "Baby loss couple recognised in New Year Honours5 days agoAlec BlackmanCoventryRyan JacksonAmy and Ryan Jackson, co-founders of the Lily Mae Foundation, have each been awarded a British Empire Medal in the New Year Honours listA couple who founded a charity to support parents who have lost babies through stillbirth, miscarriage or neonatal death have been recognised in the New Year Honours list.Amy and Ryan Jackson started the Lily Mae Foundation in 2010, which was named in memory of their stillborn daughter Lily, after they felt families should be offered more support than they received during one of the hardest moments of their lives.The couple, from Balsall Common in the West Midlands, have now each been awarded a British Empire Medal (BEM).\"It came from a way of us basically trying survive back then, and has kind of grown from just seeing what's absolutely missing for bereaved families,\" Ms Jackson said.'She'd be really proud'Mr Jackson said that the foundation aimed to support families in the West Midlands and show people that it \"was okay\" to talk about their babies.Every year, the couple create around 600 memory boxes for parents who have lost a baby, while around 30 people a month turn to them for individual support.They were awarded honorary doctorates by Coventry University in 2024 in recognition of their efforts.\"If [Lily] had the ability to know and understand just how many people she has helped in her name, I can't imagine her being anything other than proud,\" Mr Jackson said.\"We're doing what we're doing to help and support as many people as possible, because we know ourselves how devastating it is and how we were at the time when we lost Lily.\"We don't want any family to have to experience the journey that we went on, the sort of very limited support that was available at that time.\"He said they are yet to find out when they will be presented with their BEMs and are also waiting for the date of the King's Garden party, for which they have also received an invitation.Other recipients of New Year Honours from Coventry and Warwickshire include: Sarah-Jane Catherine Perry, from Kenilworth, is appointed an OBE for services to squash Anna Rose, from Rugby, is appointed an OBE for public serviceLouise Richards, from Leamington Spa, is appointed an MBE for services to danceNaomi Clare Rees Issit, from Rugby, is awarded a BEM, for services to defibrillator training and awareness in RugbyProf Jacquelyn Bridget Dunne, from Coventry, is appointed an MBE for services to Higher EducationValerie Ann Birchall, from Stratford-upon-Avon, is appointed an MBE for services to public libraries and to cultureRebecca Jane Bollands, from Kenilworth, is appointed an MBE for services to cultural education in the West MidlandsBeth Gibson, from Nuneaton, is appointed an MBE for services to educationAmanda King, from Coventry, is appointed an MBE for services to early years educationClare Sawdon JP DL, from Warwick, is appointed an MBE for services to justice Craig Beresford Wilson, from Stratford-upon-Avon, is appointed an MBE for services to enterprise and to the economyPeter Crathorne, from Henley-in-Arden, is awarded a BEM for services to the community in Henley-in-ArdenDavid John Eadon, from Rugby, is awarded a BEM for services to the community in RugbyIolene Jennifer Scholes, from Shipston-on-Stour, is awarded a BEM for services to the community in Shipston-on-StourColin Henry Wells, from Coventry, is awarded a BEM for voluntary serviceSandra Crowder, from Coventry, is awarded a BEM for services to adoption and foster careMore on this story",

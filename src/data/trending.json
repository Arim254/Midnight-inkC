    "body": "2 hours ago\"It's one in, one out and back in again!\" for the Daily Express as it says a migrant sent to France - under the prime minister's immigration scheme - has returned to the UK \"on a small boat\". Tories have branded the news a \"farce\" says the Express, adding the return is \"making a mockery of Sir Keir Starmer's 'one in, one out' deal with France.The Daily Telegraph also goes with \"one in, one out then back in again\" for its top line calling it a \"major embarrassment to Sir Keir Starmer\". In other front page news, Jim Gamble, a former police chief \"lined up to lead\" the national inquiry into grooming gangs has withdrawn his candidacy.Metro carries the same headline as the Express and Telegraph, calling it a \"bizarre twist in Starmer's migrant plan\". The face of \"schoolboy Harvey's killer\" is also seen on the front page, as 15-year-old Mohammed Umar Khan has been sentenced to life for the murder of Harvey Willgoose.The Daily Mail dubs the migrant scheme \"le farce\" as it reports a man who has returned to the UK made his second Channel crossing \"just 29 days after he was kicked out of the country\".For The Sun, it says \"come again?\" as it reports on the migrants who have returned. A shot of a dinghy filled with people attempting to cross the Channel takes up much of its front page. The paper quotes Reform UK leader Nigel Farage who says \"illegals are laughing at us\". The Daily Mirror goes with \"unmasked\" for its main headline. The front page is dominated by the newly-released photos of the 15-year-old who fatally stabbed teenager Harvey Willgoose in February.The Guardian leads with the latest on the grooming gang inquiry calling Jim Gamble's exit \"fresh turmoil\". He was the only remaining candidate to chair the inquiry, it writes. A photo of three men in hard hats each carrying a toddler is the paper's lead image - taken in Ukraine, the paper says, after a Kharkiv nursery was hit in a \"wave of Russian airstrikes\".The Times also tops with the grooming inquiry, as it reports \"victims say minister should quit\". Four survivors who quit the inquiry panel said they would only return if Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips steps down. The paper reports survivors have sent a letter to the home secretary saying Phillips is \"unfit\" to oversee the process. Phillips has denied claims the government is seeking to dilute the focus of the inquiry, insisting its scope will be \"laser-focused\".Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been \"urged\" to raise income tax \"as Labour Budget splits emerge\" according to The i Paper. A \"bold move\" is what senior Labour figures argue will \"help fix the UK public finances - and raise £22bn next month\".The Financial Times also headlines on the chancellor, as \"lawyers and accountants rail against Reeves' plans for tax raid on partners\". The paper says they argue the \"raid would hit a cornerstone of the economy\".There's a \"traitor at the Beeb\" writes the Star, as \"celeb circles are awash\" with spoilers for the Traitors finale. It claims TV chiefs are \"battling to keep result under wraps\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "15 minutes agoTom BatemanState Department correspondentGetty ImagesAllegations of excessive use of force during anti-government protests in Colombia in 2021 were reported on the tip lineThe US State Department has removed an online portal for reporting alleged human rights violations by foreign military units supplied with American weapons.The Human Rights Reporting Gateway (HRG) acted as a formal \"tip line\" to the US government.It was the only publicly accessible channel of its kind for organisations or individuals to inform it directly of potentially serious abuses by US-armed foreign forces.Its deletion has been condemned by human rights campaigners and by a senior congressional aide who drafted the law requiring it. The State Department insisted it was still abiding by the law.The portal was established in 2022 following pressure on successive administrations to abide by updated provisions of the Leahy Law, named after former US Senator Patrick Leahy. These require the government to \"facilitate receipt\" of information on alleged gross violations of human rights by military units supplied by Washington.Among the cases submitted via the HRG was the alleged excessive use of force by security forces during anti-government protests in Colombia, while several cases were due to be submitted relating to US-armed units of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the occupied West Bank, according to Amnesty International.BBC NewsThe State Department portal where violations could be reported - before it was taken downTim Rieser, former senior aide to Senator Leahy who wrote the 2011 amendment mandating information gathering, told the BBC the gateway's removal meant the State Department was \"clearly ignoring the law\".He added it was a further sign that \"the entire human rights architecture\" within the department was being \"rendered largely ineffective\".\"The United States will find itself supporting foreign security forces that commit heinous crimes even though nothing is done about it,\" said Mr Rieser. \"As a result there will be less incentive for foreign governments to bring people who commit such crimes to justice.\"In response, the US State Department insisted it was continuing to receive reports regarding gross violations of human rights and was engaging with \"credible organisations\" on a full spectrum of human rights concerns.  It said: \"The Department abides by its legal requirements\".Secretary of State Marco Rubio has overseen a sweeping reorganisation of the State Department involving widespread layoffs and eliminating some offices focused on human rights monitoring. The department this year released a slimmed-down annual human rights report which critics said omitted alleged crimes by US allies but included those by foreign leaders the Trump administration opposes.The department has previously said its restructure made it leaner and more efficient and followed President Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy which sees some human rights promotion as ideologically driven.Charles Blaha, former Director of the Office of Security and Human Rights at the State Department, said people in the field would now have \"no established channel\" for reporting gross violations of human rights by foreign security forces.The government's ability to deter abuses was \"severely weakened\", said Mr Blaha who is now an adviser to the Washington-based think tank Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN).The BBC learned during the summer that the HRG site was earmarked for deletion. Its removal was highlighted by DAWN in August but has not previously been acknowledged by the State Department. The BBC confirmed this week that officials phased out the reporting channel during the department's restructure.Screengrabs of the portal taken by the BBC before its deletion show it asked for information on US-armed foreign military units involved in alleged abuses including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture and rape. It required extensive details to ensure credible reporting including unit names, identities of alleged perpetrators, specific locations and dates.Blaha had already voiced frustration that despite the HRG passing its pilot phase, the Biden administration had not done enough to publicise it, meaning the provision to \"facilitate receipt\" of information was still not being fully honoured before the Trump administration deleted the channel entirely.The US is the world's biggest contributor of military aid to foreign countries, supplying funding, equipment, training and arms to more than 150 nations. Its vetting procedures to prevent arms going to units involved in breaches of international law have evolved over the years, with the 1997 legislation named after Senator Leahy being one its major pillars.At the heart of the law is Congress sending a message to the administration that taxpayer funding cannot support human rights abuses abroad, says Amanda Klasing, who overseas government relations at Amnesty International USA.\"If I'm a member of Congress, my perspective is: 'I want to protect my constituents and their taxpayer funding from going to torturers or people that kill their own citizens for protesting,\" she told the BBC.Klasing oversaw the compilation and submission of several reports to the Human Rights Reporting Gateway.These included allegations that American arms were used by Colombian security forces during mass anti-government protests in 2021, in which at least 47 people were killed and many wounded according to the group. Amnesty says among the arms were US-supplied high-capacity launchers for stun and smoke grenades.Klasing says she had also gathered evidence relating to the killing of 20 Palestinians during IDF raids in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in October and November 2023. Amnesty was preparing to submit its report on these incidents to the HRG before its deletion.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAoife WalshWashingtonWatch as parts of White House East Wing torn downUS President Donald Trump has said the \"existing structure\" of the White House East Wing must be torn down in order to construct a new $250m (£186m) ballroom.  Crews began demolishing parts of the structure on Monday, and two administration officials earlier told the BBC's US partner CBS that it will be completely torn down by the weekend.It marks a significant expansion of the construction project announced over the summer. Trump previously said his ballroom addition would not \"interfere with the current building\". He rejected accusations he had not been transparent over the extent of the works, telling reporters on Wednesday: \"I think we've been more transparent than anyone's ever been.\" The White House has served as the historic home of the US president for two centuries. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and was last modified in 1942.It is a section of the White House that holds offices for the first lady and other staff, as well as meetings and special events. Trump said the building had gone through several changes over the years and was \"very, very much changed from what it was originally\". He added that was \"never thought of as being much\" and that the changes have been wanted \"for at least 150 years\". The construction was being fully funded by Trump and \"some friends of mine - donors\". The military is also involved, he added.Getty ImagesConstruction work began on MondayGetty ImagesThe US president announced construction had begun in a social media post on Monday, saying \"ground has been broken\" on the \"much-needed\" ballroom space.He said that the East Wing was \"completely separate\" from the White House, although it is attached to the main structure.The Trump administration officials told CBS it was always the case that the East Wing would have to be modernised to enhance security and technology, but that during the planning process, it became apparent that the best option would be to demolish the entirety of the East Wing.Trump says White House renovation is 'music to my ears' as criticism mountsWho is paying for Trump's White House ballroom?His comments came after the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Washington non-profit organisation that protects historic US sites, wrote a letter to White House officials saying it was \"deeply concerned\" by the project.The trust asked Trump to pause demolition work, arguing that the White House was a national historic landmark and that officials needed to hold a public review process of the plan for the ballroom.Some Democrats have been critical of the renovation, including Hilary Clinton, who ran against Trump for the US presidency in 2016.In a post on X, she wrote that the White House was not Trump's house, and \"he's destroying it\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoBecky Morton,Political reporter and Dharshini David,Deputy economics editorPA MediaChancellor Rachel Reeves is considering changes to the tax system which would lead to some lawyers, accountants and doctors paying more, in next month's Budget.The professions are among those which sometimes use limited liability partnerships (LLPs), meaning they are treated as self-employed and not subject to employers' National Insurance.The Times reported that Reeves would impose a new charge on people using LLPs, which would be slightly lower than the 15% rate of employers' National Insurance.Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her Budget on 26 November, after gloomy economic forecasts and a series of U-turns on welfare cuts made it harder for her to meet her own fiscal rules.The chancellor has signalled she is likely to focus on wealthy individuals, saying \"those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share\".A number of tax experts and think tanks have suggested extending employers' National Insurance to partnerships, arguing this would make the tax system fairer.Supporters of the idea also point out it would mostly affect high earners.Adam Corlett, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, a think tank which focuses on people on low-to-middle incomes, said: \"The chancellor will need to raise taxes in her upcoming Budget, and should do so in ways that improve the tax system. \"An important step would be to level the playing field in how different ways of working are treated, with wages currently taxed more than other forms of income.\"NHS GPs are not allowed to operate as an LLP under the terms of their contract.However, changes to the taxation of LLPs could affect locum doctors and those working in private practice.A spokesperson for the British Medical Association, the trade union for doctors in the UK, said extending National Insurance to LLPs would be highly likely to erode \"the financial viability of many small, doctor-led practices\".\"This added cost will inevitably be passed on to patients, making private care less accessible and discouraging doctors from continuing or entering private practice,\" the spokesperson added.The CenTax think tank has estimated imposing employer national insurance on all forms of partnerships would raise around £2bn a year. However, this figure would be smaller if changes only applied to LLPs.Stuart Adam, a senior economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC there was uncertainty over how much such a measure could raise as he would expect some people to restructure their tax affairs in response.He said taxing this group of people more heavily would also be \"a disincentive to work\" and \"in some extreme cases, you might see some people leaving the country or not coming to the UK in the first place\".Mr Adam added that it would not address the \"fundamental underlying issue\" that tax rates on the self-employed are much lower than on employees.A Treasury spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on speculation around future changes to tax outside of fiscal events.\"Some analysts have estimated Reeves will have to raise taxes or cut spending by around £20bn to meet her \"non-negotiable\" financial rules.These rules mean her plans must be projected to get government debt falling as a share of national income by 2029-30, and day-to-day government costs must be paid for by tax income rather than borrowing.In its general election manifesto last year, Labour promised not to increase income tax, VAT and corporation tax, limiting the government's options to raise revenue.The party also promised not to raise National Insurance - prompting a row last autumn when it announced a hike in the contributions paid by employers.",

    "body": "2 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorIt might be the peak, or perhaps the mini-summit for the current bump in inflation.Economists across the city suggest its downhill from here, after the inflation rate for September remained static at 3.8%, failing to breach the expected 4% mark.In absolute terms inflation remains too high, higher than other similar countries, and too visible in the everyday items seen in the shops. Just under double the official target of 2% set for the Bank of England.But the direction of travel matters significantly. Even if it should stay around this level for the rest of the year, some significant falls are on the way in the spring, as various regulated price rises last year drop out of the calculation. It would be a much happier place if it were 2.5% in April. However, it is worth remembering that even as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pointed to the highest inflation in the G7 this year and next, it also said inflation would fall back to the 2% target by the end of next year.Crucially retail industry experts now assert food price inflation has also peaked, though prices remain at painful levels for many.This lowers - though does not eliminate - the chances of self-fulfilling expectations of inflation in the way wages and prices are set. This is the critical factor for the setting of interest rates.My immediate thought was the \"Santa\" rate cut from Andrew Bailey may be back on the table for December. But then I looked again at the information underlying some of last week's numbers from the IMF. Buried in the forecast is the suggestion of four rate cuts over the next year to take interest rates down to 3%. The only reason a cut is not expected next month, according to the IMF, is because it is too close to the Budget.A more benign inflation outlook suddenly makes that look less fanciful. The US Federal Reserve rate cuts are also in the background.The markets seem to be reassessing their view here and around the world. The effective interest rates on UK government debt fell sharply, regardless of whether those loans were for two or for 30 years. Ten-year rates fell to the lowest level this year, while two-year rates dropped to the lowest since last August.This could save a few billion from the gap in the Budget calculations, at just the right time for the chancellor.Even more important, it shows the UK is not being treated as an outlier by the markets. The chancellor went to some effort in her off-the-cuff UK sales pitch to worldwide investors in the US last week. Britain was, she said, the best place to invest and trade globally, that she was going to sort out Brexit-related economic problems and the UK had the fastest declining deficit in the G20.The Budget is going to be a challenge, but catastrophic suggestions about British bankruptcy and bailouts seem quite spectacularly off the mark, assuming that is, that the government does have nearly 400 MPs for its agenda. No one wants to be caught on the wrong side of the very real chance of a tech market crash, or unpredictable spike in the US-China trade war, or perhaps any unexpected innovations in the appointment of the new chair of the Federal Reserve in the US.The inflation number and gilt rate falls offer the chance of some respite, for a break in the circle of doom. The question is whether the tax measures Reeves needs to close even a smaller Budget gap, risk bringing it back through another door.",

    "body": "Menopause screening to be included in NHS health checks from next year41 minutes agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesHealth checks would include asking women about menopause symptoms, though exact questions have yet to be decidedMenopause screening is to be officially incorporated into NHS health checks in England for the first time.Women getting the checks - offered to adults aged 40 to 74 every five years - will be asked about the menopause and possible symptoms from next year.The aim is to identify women who may benefit from advice and support, including treatment, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), drugs to combat hot-flushes, and counselling.The government said the measure will bring menopause into the mainstream, but campaigners warned uptake of health checks was worryingly low in some communities so not enough women may benefit.Health checks are primarily aimed at identifying people at risk of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney disease, diabetes and dementia.They include blood pressure and cholesterol checks as well as measuring a person's BMI (body mass index) and are normally carried out in pharmacies and GP surgeries.But under these changes, from 2026 women will also be asked about the menopause. The exact questions have yet to be decided, but Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he hoped the move would improve the support offered.\"Women have been suffering in silence for far too long and haven't been encouraged to open up about the symptoms they're experiencing,\" he said.\"This often means they're left to navigate menopause alone with very little support. No-one should have to grit their teeth and just get on with what can be debilitating symptoms or be told that it's simply part of life.\"Reduce stigmaMenopause affects all women differently with most experiencing the transition between ages 45 and 55, though symptoms can begin earlier during perimenopause.Three-quarters of women experience symptoms – from physical changes like joint pain, weight gain and hot flushes to cognitive effects such as memory issues and brain fog.These symptoms can last an average of seven years and significantly affect daily life, yet research shows fewer than one in 10 feel they have enough information to deal with it.Women's Health Ambassador Dame Lesley Regan welcomed the move to ask women about the menopause.She said: \"Some 400,000 women in the UK will become menopausal this year, but the vast majority of them will have very little knowledge of what underlies the many and varied symptoms.\"Prof Ranee Thakar, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said it would help \"break down barriers and reduce stigma\". But she said staff carrying out the health checks would need training for the change to have the maximum positive impact.And she added more needed to be done to help women from ethnic communities and the poorest areas access NHS health checks.Janet Lindsay, from Wellbeing of Women, said she hoped the move would help more women understand their symptoms and seek help.But she too is concerned about uptake of health checks.\"Women and people from marginalised communities are less likely to know about or attend these appointments and progress on menopause support cannot leave them behind,\" she said.Latests figures show fewer than half of people invited for a health check actually attend.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterBBCSpoiler warning: This article reveals details from the fifth episode of The Celebrity Traitors\"We've utterly failed,\" said David Olusoga, as the fifth episode of the Celebrity Traitors neared its end.And he wasn't the only celebrity who seemed mired in self doubt.\"So far, I've been so useless it's breath-taking,\" said Kate Garraway.Celia Imrie admitted being \"befuddled\", Sir Stephen Fry complained it's \"so dashed difficult\".And the whole nation shouted at their screens, wondering why the celebrities are quite so rubbish at catching a traitor.The episode started with another faithful - singer Charlotte Church - hitting the dust, as she became the Traitors' latest victim.Presenter Claudia Winkleman echoed all of our frustration, as she ticked off the celebs at breakfast.\"The voice of an angel and now she is among them,\" Winkleman said, solemnly, about Church's murder.\"You've lost seven faithfuls. Think about that while you enjoy your cheese,\" she said, before storming out.\"She doesn't like us does she,\" noted comedian Lucy Beaumont.But cracks quickly started to emerge in the treacherous trio of Traitors - Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross and Cat Burns.Celebs stumped as they try and decipher Traitors' identityEarly on in the episode, Burns started turning on Ross. \"This game is making me evil, but I've got to think for myself here,\" she said to the cameras.She also raised his name in an incredibly tense roundtable later in the show.Imrie and Sir Stephen also shared their suspicions that Ross could be a traitor during Wednesday's episode.And social media certainly wants him out. \"Get Jonathan Ross OUT!\" wrote India Willoughby, while Freddie Fraser from this year's civilian traitors said the same on TikTok. But the episode ended in a dramatic tied vote at the roundtable, with two faithfuls - Scottish actor Mark Bonnar and historian David Olusoga - receiving an equal amount of votes.That means the banishment will be left “to the hands of fate,” Winkleman said.\"Jonathan Ross could put a giant 'It's Me' sticker on his head and still not get voted off,\" lamented one X user.“As Alan Carr says, the faithful have got to up the nerve at the banishment table and behave less like pussycats and more like rottweilers,” said TV reporter Siobhan Synnot.Social media users were left wondering who has been dressing Jonathan RossElsewhere, the giggling, sweating, nervously-scratching-his-head Alan Carr remains a thing of the past.Now a cold-hearted killer, Carr seemed to take great pleasure in watching the faithfuls try and work out who had been murdered.“To be sitting there outwitting Steven Fry, I mean, it's like beating Albert Einstein in chess or Cluedo or something,\" Carr said.\"I just started stuffing cheese in my mouth cos I can't stop grinning. Isn't it funny? I was so nervous when Claudia squeezed my shoulder blade, and now I just love being a traitor.\"Other talking points from Wednesday's show include Ross's outfits... again. And not only because he insists on walking around in sunglasses (surely this looks like a man who has something to hide?).“Once again Jonathan Ross proves he has one of the strangest choice of clothes ever seen on Traitors,” wrote one X user.Cat Burns - one of the younger celebs - revealing she doesn’t know who Helen Mirren is was another joyful moment. “She’s a national treasure,” her fellow players told her.Elsewhere, Celia Imrie continues to surprise us all - as she revealed she has a crush on Ross when she voted for him.And people on social media seemed pleasantly surprised at Mark Bonnar's singing during the challenge.\"Mark singing from the trap is such a vibe,\" wrote one X user.\"Not Mark singing Loch Lomond in the bear trap, I love it,\" said entertainment reporter Jodie McCallum. \"This is the Scottish representation we need.\"The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer. There will be nine episodes.More on The Celebrity Traitors",

    "body": "1 hour agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsHelen LedwickWhen Helen Ledwick typed \"why do my insides feel like they're falling out\" into Google a decade ago, she had no idea that search would mark the beginning of a life-changing journey.The former BBC 5 Live journalist and podcaster was experiencing pelvic organ prolapse - a condition that affects around one in twelve women, but which many have never even heard of.Prolapse happens when one or more of the organs in the pelvis, such as the bladder, bowel or uterus, slip from their usual position and bulge into the vagina. It's not life-threatening, but it can have a profound impact on daily life, relationships and mental health.For Helen, the shock came just two weeks after a difficult birth with her second child.\"I stood up from the sofa and suddenly felt things shift,\" she recalls. \"It felt like when a tampon isn't sitting properly, you can feel something's not right.\"Confused and frightened, she grabbed a mirror and her phone to see what was happening.\"I'd never even heard the term prolapse before,\" she says, and since talking openly about it she's realised it's often a \"taboo\" subject despite being very common.Helen believes the shame and stigma surrounding it has led to a lack of awareness among women and health professionals - something she's now fighting to change.Helen LedwickHelen says her diagnosis, confirmed by a doctor, brought confusion and fear as she was \"hoping for an explanation, fix or some sense of urgency, instead I got a shrug of the shoulders.\"The initial advice she was given was to not do anything that could make it worse such as running, jumping or lifting.\"It kind of felt like the advice was don't live your life,\" she says.Perhaps more debilitating than the physical symptoms was the isolation Helen felt.\"You live with it in embarrassment, silence, shame and isolation,\" she explains. \"Because you don't talk about it, you think you're the only person in the world it's happened to.\"Helen initially ventured onto Instagram to seek support. Finding other people on the social platform who were similarly anxious and confused and in some cases too embarrassed to seek help prompted her to eventually launch a podcast and write a book, Why mums don't jump.Her goal was to create a platform for women to share stories and break the silence around pelvic health.\"I was angry because no-one ever talked about it. So I decided I would.\"I wanted to give women the knowledge that I'd found so hard to come by, and comfort in knowing they were not on their own.\"Dr Nighat Arif, a women's health specialist, says Helen's experience is far from unique and issues can arise as symptoms aren't always obvious.\"Sometimes physically there isn't a lump to see, there's just a feeling of pressure and it might be in the lower back, at the front or slightly higher up near your belly button,\" she explains. \"The symptoms can also be more pronounced during sex which is again massively taboo.\"Prolapse can happen for a variety of reasons including childbirth, heavy lifting, being overweight or even after a hysterectomy. And in rare cases, it can affect men too.Pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle changes can help to improve symptoms, but sometimes medical treatment is needed such as vaginal pessaries or surgery.Gynaecologist Dr Christine Ekechi says women with prolapse may notice a swelling or a lump within their vagina \"as essentially what has happened is that we have weakening of the ligaments within the pelvic floor that can move for example the bladder\".Helen LedwickHelen says what began as a lonely Google search 15 years ago, has now become something far more powerful, helping women to recognise when there is a problem and seek help.In her case, recovery has been slow, but transformative.\"For me it's been a long process of building up slowly, doing postpartum [immediately after pregnancy] exercises, building up some strength work.\"Eventually she saw a physio who helped her to start running again. Helen says this was \"a massive moment because I really thought that was something I would never do again.\"Now, Helen is doing more than she ever thought possible and has signed up for a 10k run.\"I feel good and I've learned how to manage my symptoms. I've still got prolapse, but it doesn't rule my life in the way that it once was.\"I feel like I'm kind of winning the battle.\"Find out more about the symptoms of pelvic floor prolapse on the NHS website ",

    "body": "Which benefits are going up and by how much?11 hours agoLucy HookerBusiness ReporterGetty ImagesThe cost of living is always important to our finances, but this month what is happening to prices will have a particular extra impact for millions of people.The September inflation figure reflects what has been happening to prices over the past year, and will affect how far your money goes and how much benefits will go up next year as well as influencing the Bank of England's interest rate decisions.It also comes just over a month before the Budget, with the chancellor confirming she has been looking at further measures on tax and spending.Here are some of the ways in which the latest inflation figure will directly affect you and your money. Universal credit and other benefitsTypically, September's Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, which this time is 3.8%, is the benchmark for raising benefits the following April.Some benefits, including all the main disability benefits, such as personal independence payment, attendance allowance and disability living allowance, as well as carer’s allowance, will rise by at least as much as prices have been rising. That is a legal requirement.Universal credit (UC) - which is the most common benefit, claimed by seven and a half million people - is expected to rise by more than inflation next year. But ministers have the final say.Currently UC is expected to rise by about 6.2%, reflecting the 3.8% September inflation figure, plus an additional 2.3% uplift already outlined in government legislation.That would mean the standard UC allowance would rise from £92 to £98 per week for single claimants, and from £145 to £154 per week for couples, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation calculates.Bigger increase for the state pensionThe state pension rise is set using different criteria: what is known as the triple lock.Under that arrangement, the state pension goes up each year by either 2.5%, or by inflation, or by earnings growth - whichever is the highest figure. This time around, we now know, that average earnings growth is the highest of these, at 4.8%.This means:The full, new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) is expected to increase from its current £230.30 a week to £241.30 a week. That will take it to £12,547 a year.The full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) is expected to go up from £176.45 a week to £184.90. That will take it to £9,615 a year.Not all pensioners receive the full state pension, and some rely on other benefit income.Wages and pricesStubbornly rising prices in the UK over the past year mean that everyone's incomes are stretched further.Rising wages can help counter that, putting more money in peoples' pockets so that even if prices are higher, their spending power doesn't fall.However, the poverty-focused think tank the Resolution Foundation says real pay growth, once inflation has been taken into account, has been weakening. It calculates that weekly wages have grown \"by no more than the price of a Gregg's sausage roll\", or £1.50, over the past 11 months.Workers on the government-set minimum wage have fared better following inflation-busting rises in April.Interest and mortgage rate cuts more likelyGetty ImagesInflation remains well above the Bank of England's 2% target. But September's 3.8% figure was lower than the 4% the Bank of England and other economists had forecast. So speculation is growing that another interest rate cut could be on the cards.Usually the Bank of England keeps interest rates higher if inflation is causing concern, to discourage borrowing and spending that can make the problem worse.If inflation seems to be easing, there could be a rate cut as soon as November or December, some economists suggest, which would make it cheaper to borrow, including for mortgages.An easing of mortgage costs would be welcomed not only by homeowners but also by renters. Lower costs for landlords might help put a stop to persistent rises in rents.On the other hand, lower Bank of England interest rates can mean lower rates for savers, too.Implications for the BudgetAll eyes are now on the chancellor who is busy finalising her Budget set for 26 November.Rachel Reeves said she wasn't satisfied with a slightly smaller than expected rise in prices in September and planned to take action to bring inflation down further. There have been hints that might come through lower household energy bills.But the prospect of easing inflation could also throw her a lifeline as she battles to make the numbers add up without breaking manifesto promises on borrowing and taxation.It will mean welfare spending, and other government costs, are lower than they might have been. And borrowing costs for the government itself are already edging downwards, all of which would give her more room for manoeuvre.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSean Seddon, Dominic Casciani,Home and Legal Correspondent and Andrew HardingA migrant has returned to the UK on a small boat after being removed to France under the \"one in, one out\" scheme less than a month ago, BBC News understands.The Guardian newspaper reported that the man claimed to have been a victim of modern slavery at the hands of smuggling gangs in France.The Home Office declined to directly confirm the report but said a migrant had been detained and their removal was being sought as soon as possible.Forty two people who arrived in the UK illegally have been removed so far under the scheme in which the UK agrees to take in asylum seekers who have a case for protection.The BBC understands the man is an Iranian national, and was initially detained on 6 August and was removed on 19 September, becoming the third person to be sent to France under the scheme. He returned four days ago on 18 October.The male migrant - who the Guardian has not named -  told the newspaper he returned to the UK because he feared for his life in France.Speaking about his alleged treatment at the hands of smugglers, he said: \"They took me like a worthless object, forced me to work, abused me, and threatened me with a gun and told me I would be killed if I made the slightest protest.\"Asked about the report, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"We will not accept any abuse of our borders, and we will do everything in our power to remove those without the legal right to be here.\"Individuals who are returned under the pilot and subsequently attempt to re-enter the UK illegally will be removed.\"Maddie Harris, director of Humans for Rights Network, told BBC News her organisation has been in direct contact with the Iranian man.She said: \"From very on early [after his removal] he was experiencing acute fear... as a result of the experience he had at the hands of the smugglers.\"While in France he experienced horrendous treatment at the hands of the people who are organising journeys to the UK.\"She said the man returned because he felt he \"was not receiving protection in France and feared those individuals may continue with that horrendous treatment\".She also said her organisation had seen cases of others returned under the scheme who have had \"compelling\" evidence of mistreatment, and who were not able to receive \"adequate legal advice\" during the \"rushed\" removal process.Asked about the \"one in, one out\" scheme on Wednesday, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"We've been clear about the arrangement with France, that this is the beginning of a landmark scheme which is not in itself a silver bullet\".Separately, the BBC has spoken to an Eritrean man in France who says he was also returned under the scheme.The man, who asked to be identified as Jonas, said he fled his home country because he feared religious persecution during mandatory conscription in the military.Jonas said he travelled to the UK via Belarus, Poland and France, and boarded a small boat with 71 others to cross the Channel, some of whom he said have now received asylum in the UK.Jonas said he believes he was selected for removal arbitrarily, and told the BBC he was detained for two months prior to be flown to France. Asked why he believed he was chosen for removal, he said: \"I don't know. The only reason they say is 'you came from safe country' - but it's not only me. How many people are crossing? Three thousand, four thousand [per month]?\"Jonas, who is now temporarily living in a refugee centre in Paris, would be unlikely to be deported to Eritrea from the European Union, but said he fears he would be imprisoned if he returned.The scheme, which was announced in July, is intended to deter people from crossing the Channel and encourage migrants to make asylum claims on the continent. Twenty three people have returned to France.Under the treaty, France agreed to take back migrants who had travelled to the UK by small boat and had their asylum claim rejected.For each person returned to France, the UK has agreed to accept someone with a case for protection as a refugee who has not attempted to cross the Channel.On Sunday, the Home Office said 16 people had been removed to France on a single flight, the largest group removal under the scheme yet.The Iranian man's return to the UK came as small boat arrivals on Wednesday meant that the number of attempts to cross the Channel this year have now exceeded the 36,816 recorded in 2024.An official figure won't be confirmed until Thursday.The record number of arrivals for a single year was 45,755 in 2022, and this year's rate is closely tracking that.Home Office figures show that there were no crossings on six out of the last seven days but that 369 made the journey on 18 October.",

    "body": "Trump says Putin talks 'don't go anywhere' as he imposes new sanctions 1 hour agoBernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House and Max Matza'It was time', says Trump on increase in Russia sanctionsThe US has announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies - Rosneft and Lukoil - in an effort to pressure Moscow to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere. They just don't go anywhere,\" President Donald Trump said, after a meeting with Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte to discuss peace negotiations. The sanctions announcement came one day after Trump said a meeting planned with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest would be shelved indefinitely.Earlier Wednesday, Russia unleashed an intense bombardment on Ukraine that killed at least seven people, including children. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the new sanctions were needed due to \"Putin's refusal to end this senseless war\". He said these oil companies fund the Kremlin's \"war machine\". \"Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,\" Bessent said in a statement.Speaking alongside Rutte in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump criticised Putin for not being serious about making peace and said he hoped that the sanctions would help force a breakthrough.\"I just felt it was time. We waited a long time,\" Trump said.He called the sanctions package \"tremendous\", and added that he hoped they could be swiftly withdrawn if Russia agrees to stop the war. Rutte also praised the move, saying it was \"putting more pressure\" on Putin.\"You have to put pressure, and that is just what he did today,\" Rutte said.Getty ImagesTrump and Putin met in Alaska in August in hopes of ending the war in Ukraine. A second meeting has now been shelved. The move comes as key differences between US and Russian proposals for peace became increasingly clear this week. Trump has indicated that a key sticking point has been Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line. Last week, the UK slapped a similar sanctions package on Rosneft and Lukoil.\"There is no place for Russian oil on global markets,\" UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves said while announcing the move.Responding to the UK, Russia's embassy in London said targeting its country's major energy companies would disrupt global fuel supplies and drive up costs worldwide.It also said the sanctions would have \"a detrimental impact on the energy security\" of developing and underdeveloped countries, adding \"pressure only complicates peaceful dialogue and leads to further escalation\".The two Russian oil firms export 3.1 million barrels of oil per day. Rosneft is responsible for nearly half of all Russian oil production, which makes up 6% of the global output, according to estimates from the UK government.Oil and gas are Russia's biggest exports, and Moscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey. Trump has also urged these countries to halt purchases of Russian oil in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin.Trump's move was praised by UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who said the US sanctions are \"strongly welcome\". Children among victims in Russian strikes, hours after Trump-Putin talks shelvedWhy Trump made breakthrough in Gaza but can't with Putin over UkraineEU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen posted on X that she spoke by phone to Bessent on Wednesday about \"Russia's lack of commitment to the peace process\". She also praised a new sanctions package approved by the European Union on Wednesday, which includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports.\"With the imminent adoption of the EU's 19th package, this is a clear signal from both sides of the Atlantic that we will keep up collective pressure on the aggressor,\" she wrote.Earlier this year, the UK and US also sanctioned major Russian energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas.At the White House, Rutte was expected to discuss a 12-point plan formulated by European NATO allies and Kyiv, which would see the current front lines frozen, a return of deported children as well as a prisoner exchange between the two warring countries. The plan also includes a war recovery fund for Ukraine, as well as security pathways and a clear pathway for Ukraine to join the EU, as well as increased military aid to Kyiv and economic pressure on Moscow. Earlier this week, Trump said he did not want a \"wasted meeting\" with Putin in Budapest, and suggested a main point of contention is Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front lines of the war. He last met with Putin in Alaska for a summit the White House hoped would lead to the end of the conflict. Instead, the fighting has continued. A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was also shelved. The meeting this week was no longer \"necessary\" after a \"productive\" call, the White House said. Trump has repeatedly endorsed proposals to freeze the fighting along current frontlines. \"Let it be cut the way it is,\" he said on Monday. \"I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"Europe's leaders back Trump call for frontline freeze but Russia says noRussia has pushed back against that idea, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying that \"the consistency of Russia's position doesn't change\" -  a reference to its desire for Ukrainian troops to leave the Donbas region in Ukraine's east. On Wednesday, Trump also pushed back against reporting in the Wall Street Journal that the US had approved Ukrainian long-range missile strikes into Russia, calling it \"fake news\". Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky has expressed a desire for the US to supply long-range US Tomahawk missiles to his forces and suggested that the threat of their introduction to the war theatre may bring Russia to the negotiating table.

    "body": "3 hours agoCachella SmithAFP via Getty ImagesPrince Andrew should be called in front of MPs to give evidence about his lease of Royal Lodge, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said.It follows calls for greater transparency into royal finances and the independently-run Crown Estate, which leased Andrew his mansion in Windsor.Sir Ed called for a select committee inquiry to \"properly scrutinise\" the Crown Estate during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) in the Commons, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer replying that it was important there was proper scrutiny of all Crown properties.Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment.While there is nothing preventing a House of Commons committee from inviting Prince Andrew to give evidence, an appearance in such a setting by a member of the Royal Family would be unprecedented. It is unclear whether the committee would be able to compel him to do so.In a written request to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) - which scrutinises public spending - Sir Ed said the proposed inquiry should take evidence from \"everyone involved\" in Andrew's housing arrangement.\"The public are understandably asking whether this is an appropriate arrangement by the Crown Estate,\" he said.A PAC spokesperson suggested it would not launch an immediate inquiry, saying its programme was \"currently full up until the new year\". They added that the National Audit Office would look at the Crown Estate's annual report in the next financial year, \"as part of its normal programme of work\". Speaking to BBC Newsnight on Wednesday, Sarah Olney, a Liberal Democrat MP and a member of the PAC, said the \"question about the rent paid\" was \"absolutely a legitimate course of inquiry for the PAC to ask if this is the best deal for taxpayers\".She added: \"We have the power if we wish to summon Prince Andrew to come and give evidence to us so that we can find out more about that.\"There has been increased focus on Prince Andrew - who had already stepped back as a working royal - after he relinquished his titles last week following growing pressure over his links with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Sir Ed's question came after a document seen by BBC News confirmed the arrangement for the Royal Lodge means that the prince has only ever paid a token annual rent on property, and that it might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate.The deal meant that, instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments upfront, including for renovations.In effect, those payments - which totalled about £8m - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the 75-year lease.Part of the deal was that if he left early in the lease he could reclaim some of the money he had paid upfront, with that amount tapering down over time until 25 years - at the current rate, it is about £186,000 for each remaining year until 2028.Former Crown Estate commissioner Lord Curry told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley the estate would be \"honour bound to honour that lease\" and that any inquiry would be a \"waste of time and money\".\"There's nothing they can do about the lease without reneging on its terms, and that would be inappropriate,\" he said.The Crown Estate is a property business owned by the monarch but run independently, with profits from it going to the Treasury. The level of profit is used as a benchmark to calculate the funding given by the government to the Royal Family in the Sovereign Grant.Baroness Margaret Hodge, who chaired the Public Accounts Committee between 2010 and 2015, said the Royal Lodge arrangement \"looks like a rotten deal\".\"The Royal Lodge is run by the Crown Estate [which] is under a duty to maximise the income it collects because that goes to the taxpayer,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday.She also made a call for greater transparency regarding royal finances generally.\"We don't know,\" she underlined, \"there's no transparency - so inevitably we're sceptical and we ask questions\".\"All we've got here is another specific issue which is an example of a much much wider problem which is that the royal finances are mired in secrecy and that lack of transparency associated with those finances ends up with us asking all sorts of questions.\"The Royal Family has three main funding streams in addition to private income.The Sovereign Grant is funded by the taxpayer while the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall provide income for the King and the Prince of Wales respectively.Annual financial statements from the Royal Family include details on the Sovereign Grant - which funds official duties, the maintenance of the Occupied Royal Palaces and more recently has funded the Buckingham Palace Reservicing Programme. Separate reports are published for the two duchies which are described on their respective websites as private estates.Baroness Hodge said: \"There is this muddy territory [...] in my view, they are public because they were given by the State to the Royal Family for the purpose of sustaining themselves.\"The Duchy of Cornwall's official site said the Prince of Wales pays income tax on this income - which is not a requirement, but something he does voluntarily.The King also voluntarily pays income tax on the Duchy of Lancaster.The King ended financial support for Prince Andrew last year as he faced increasing public scrutiny over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The prince announced he would stop using his Duke of York title earlier this month – however York MP Rachael Maskell, who had the Labour whip suspended in July, is introducing a proposal to the House of Commons on Wednesday for a new law which would enable the King to remove titles.This proposal would give the King the power to formally strip the prince of the dukedom.The Removal of Titles Bill was already introduced in parliament in 2022 and would require the support of government to become law.This week has also seen the publication of the posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Prince Andrew had sex with her at Ghislaine Maxwell's house when she was 17. Andrew has always denied the allegations.",

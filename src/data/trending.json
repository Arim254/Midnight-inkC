    "body": "12 hours agoFiona NimoniGetty ImagesJojo Moyes revealed Sophie Kinsella's support to the Desert Island Discs showThe late author Sophie Kinsella convinced fellow writer Jojo Moyes to complete her bestselling romance novel Me Before You. Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Moyes has credited Kinsella with inspiring her to keep going, when she nearly gave up on the book after writing 20,000 words. It became an international bestseller and was adapted for the 2016 film starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Kinsella, whose real name was Madeleine Sophie Wickham, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2022 and died earlier this month at the age of 55.  Author Sophie Kinsella remembered as a 'wonderful, warm woman'Speaking to Lauren Laverne on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Moyes described how she almost abandoned writing her bestselling novel because she was feeling depressed after years of little commercial success. She said: \"I met up with my friend Sophie Kinsella and had lunch with her and I was broke at the time and I was feeling quite depressed because I thought my writing career was coming to an end.\"I told her the story of my 20,000 words over lunch and she just looked at me, and she said, 'You have to write this book, you do know that? You have to write this book'.\"When I got home, her husband, Henry, called me up and said, 'Jojo, Maddy... told me about this book and I think you should write it too'.\"I love her for many reasons, but that's one of them.\"The Me Before You series follows the life of Louisa Clark, a working-class girl who ends up as a carer for paraplegic Will Traynor, a wealthy man who is paralysed after a motorcycle accident.The book was based on a news story Moyes had seen about a young rugby player who had been left quadriplegic after an accident and persuaded his parents to take him to a Swiss assisted dying clinic. \"I knew I loved this book and I knew it was the best version of itself that it could be, but I had no idea it was going to resonate in the way that it did,\" she told Laverne. The full interview is available to listen to on BBC Sounds. Getty ImagesSophie Kinsella was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2022",

    "body": "The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued two amber health alerts for parts of the country as cold weather is set to ring in the new year.The alerts, which warn of a rise in deaths particularly among elderly and vulnerable people, cover the North East and North West of England from 20:00 GMT on Sunday to 12:00 on 5 January. Temperatures in these regions are expected to fall to around -4C, with snow predicted in the North West on 3 and 4 January. The low temperatures are likely to affect health and care services, the agency added.Overnight into Monday, temperatures are expected to fall to as low as -1C in Penrith, while -10C is possible in parts of the Scottish Highlands.Other consequences of very cold weather include temperatures inside hospitals and care homes dropping below the levels recommended for assessing health risks, and challenges for people keeping indoor temperatures at the recommended 18C, the UKHSA said.Staffing issues, due to travel delays, may also arise from the cold spell. Most of England will be cloudy overnight, and there will be patches of frost and fog which could mean \"tricky travelling conditions\" on Monday morning, the forecaster said.Between 2 and 11 January, cold northerly winds in Scotland are expected to become dominant across the UK, bringing snow showers mainly to coastal areas that will work south, the Met Office said. Inland locations across central and southern areas will remain mostly dry but cold.On Friday, temperatures in the the North East and North West will feel colder due to the wind chill - a temperature of -4C could feel more like -8C, the Met Office said. The agency also issued less serious yellow cold health alerts for the rest of England, covering the East Midlands, West Midlands, South East, South West, East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and London.Temperatures in areas covered by the yellow warning are expected to fall to around highs of 6C and lows below freezing from New Year's Day.Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said it was \"vital\" to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are vulnerableThe predicted temperatures can have a \"serious impact\" on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions, he warned. Cold health alerts and weather warnings were issued for parts of the UK on Christmas Day, forcing several annual open water swimming events to be cancelled. ",

    "body": "Dark energy just got even weirder and why the Universe may end in a 'Big Crunch'1 day agoPallab GhoshKPNO/NOIRLabA lonely telescope in the Arizona desert tracks millions of distant galaxies to determine the ultimate fate of the UniverseThere is growing controversy over recent evidence suggesting that a mysterious force known as dark energy might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space.An analysis by a South Korean team has hinted that, rather than the Universe continuing to expand, galaxies could be pulled back together by gravity, ending in what astronomers call a \"Big Crunch\".The scientists involved believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation.Other astronomers have questioned these findings, but these critics have not been able to completely dismiss the South Korean team's assertions.NASA/ESAThese are thousands of galaxies captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. dark energy is driving them apart at ever increasing speedWhat is dark energy?Astronomers previously thought the Universe's expansion, which began with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, should gradually slow due to gravity.Then evidence for dark energy was discovered in 1998 as a force accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Studies of very bright exploding stars called supernovas showed that rather than slowing down, distant galaxies were actually accelerating away from each other.Some theories suggested that this ever‑accelerating Universe could first spread the stars so far apart that almost nothing would be visible in the night sky and, more shockingly, might eventually tear even atoms themselves apart in a \"Big Rip\".The controversy began in March with unexpected results from an instrument on a telescope in the Arizona desert called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Desi).Desi was built to discover more about dark energy. It tracked the acceleration of millions of galaxies in exquisite detail, but astronomers were not expecting the results it came up with.The data hinted that acceleration of the galaxies had changed over time, something not in line with the standard picture, according to Prof Ofer Lahav of University College London, who is involved with the Desi project.\"Now with this changing dark energy going up and then down, again, we need a new mechanism. And this could be a shake up for the whole of physics,\" he says.Then in November the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) published research from a South Korean team that seems to back the view that the weirdness of dark energy is weirder still.Prof Young Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team went back to the kind of supernova data that first revealed dark energy 27 years ago. Instead of treating these stellar explosions as having one standard brightness, they adjusted for the ages of the galaxies they came from and worked out how bright the supernovas really were.This adjustment showed that not only had dark energy changed over time, but, shockingly, that the acceleration was slowing down.\"The fate of the Universe will change,\" Prof Lee tells BBC News starkly.\"If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.\"If, as Prof Lee's results suggest, the force that is pushing galaxies away from each other - dark energy - is weakening, then one possibility is that it becomes so weak that gravity begins to pull the galaxies back together.\"Rather than ending with a Big Rip, a Big Crunch is now a possibility.\"Which outcome wins, depends on the true nature of dark energy, for which we still do not know the answer,\" says Prof Lee.Prof Lee's work has been checked by fellow experts and published in a respected journal of the RAS. But his claims have not gone down at all well with many senior astronomers working in the field, such as Prof George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.\"I think that this is just reflecting the messy details of supernovas,\" he says. \"The correlation with age is not very tight, so I think it is dangerous to apply a 'correction'. It looks weak to me.\"The mainstream view is that the Universe is still accelerating with almost unchanging dark energy.But Prof Lee pushes back strongly on such criticisms.\"Our data is based on 300 galaxies. The statistical significance is roughly one-in-a-trillion chance of being a fluke. So, I strongly feel that already our research is very, very significant.\"Marilyn Sargent/Berkeley LabA cathedral for the cosmos: an instrument inside this telescope can track the movement of 5,000 galaxies at a timeSince the South Korean results, two teams have reassessed the brightness of some of the supernovas. They looked at an earlier study that fed into the Desi results from March which began the whole hoo-hah. They did so to double-check the March results because the claim that dark energy was changing was so controversial.Both teams have pulled back slightly from the original hints, but the hints have not gone away, even after extensive scrutiny.Consequently there will continue to be passionate, sometimes contentious, debate over whether the cosmos is gently whispering to us about its true nature, or whether astronomers are chasing celestial ghosts.Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on the subject and astronomers are split on what they think is the best explanation. This is no bad thing, according to Prof Robert Massey, who is RAS's Deputy Director.\"Who doesn't want to understand how the universe is going to end and how it began?\" he says. \"Human beings have always been interested in that, whether you take it from a religious perspective or a scientific one.\"Being able to think, okay, this is how things will end in many, many billions of years, wouldn't that be extraordinary?\"",

    "body": "The Albanian nationalist Vetevendosje party has won a landslide victory in Kosovo's parliamentary elections, according to preliminary results. With 90% of the votes counted, the party, whose name means \"self determination\", was on 50.8%, meaning a third term in power for its leader, Albin Kurti. The two main opposition parties, the centre-right Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), were on 20.98% and 13.89%, respectively.Vetevendosje won elections in February, but without a majority, and Kosovo has been without a functioning government since then. The impasse meant there was one big question hanging over this second parliamentary election of the year. Would voters punish Kurti for the long months of deadlock in the country's National Assembly – or the opposition parties who refused to countenance a coalition with Kurti's left-wing movement?The electorate has given a clear answer. This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.It is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.Kurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.Arben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.There is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.Repairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.The EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.The fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.One analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power. But he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".",

    "body": "7 minutes agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringThe much-anticipated talks lasted two-and-a-half hours, and that's an achievement in itself. Presidents Trump and Zelensky had never before spent this long in one room, negotiating.Afterwards, optimism was much on display at Mar-a-Lago. It was a \"terrific meeting\", according to Donald Trump. Volodymyr Zelensky agreed, describing it as a \"great meeting\" with \"great discussions on all the topics\".But even if the two presidents sounded more upbeat than before, yet again we did not hear any evidence of progress - just like after all the previous talks held this year.Follow live updates: Trump and Zelensky meet in FloridaThere is still no answer to the key question of whether Ukraine will have to give up territory in exchange for a promise of peace. This is one of the main demands put forward by Russia and apparently backed by the US, so the fact that Zelensky has not accepted it - at least not in public - counts as good news for Ukraine. He did appear to leave the possibility of territorial concessions open, however, by saying that a referendum may be held to approve any deals to end the war.There is also no clarity on another crucial issue: security guarantees. Even though President Zelensky says they were \"100%\" agreed with the US, we do not know what they are and whether they would be enough to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.No less importantly, regardless of what agreements presidents Trump and Zelensky may have reached, there is no reason to assume that Russia would accept them. In fact, it has already rejected key ideas floated immediately before the talks in Florida: that a ceasefire be declared and a multinational force be deployed to Ukraine to monitor it.And this begs the question of what Donald Trump is prepared to do should Russia reject his agreements with Volodymyr Zelensky. So far, it has been the Ukrainian leader who has borne the brunt of his pressure, irritation and anger. Donald Trump's continuing positive rhetoric about Vladimir Putin (who, the US president said today, is \"serious\" about peace and \"wants to see Ukraine succeed\") suggests that this is unlikely to change.At the end of the day, all this means that despite Donald Trump's and Volodymyr Zelensky's optimism, we've seen little indication that lasting peace will prevail in Ukraine any time soon.",

    "body": "More than 300 earthquakes were recorded in the UK in 2025, British Geological Survey data shows.The two largest earthquakes occurred just hours apart near Loch Lyon in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, when a 3.7 magnitude tremor was registered on 20 October, followed by one of 3.6. Up to 18 December 2025, 309 earthquakes had been recorded across the UK. Areas of Perthshire and the western Highlands in Scotland, southern parts of Wales, and Yorkshire and Lancashire in England recorded the most seismic activity overall. On average, the UK experienced an earthquake \"almost once a day\" in 2025, seismologist Brian Baptie said.The report said 34 earthquakes in total occurred near Loch Lyon between October and December. \"The west of Scotland is one of the more active parts of the UK,\" Dr Baptie said.Some of this can be attributed to geological faults including the Great Glen and the Highland Boundary Fault.\"By contrast, north-east Scotland experiences very few earthquakes.\"Two minor earthquakes hit Lancashire in as many weeks in December, with the epicentre of the 2.5 magnitude tremor located off the coast of Silverdale, in Morecambe Bay.The BGS confirmed the quake was an aftershock of a 3.3 magnitude earthquake which hit the area at the start of December.Seismic activity is recorded by 80 monitoring stations around the UK, operated by BSG.It said the UK experiences between 200 and 300 earthquakes a year but only about 20 or 30 are felt or heard by people.This year, it received 1,320 reports from members of the public who felt tremors this year.A magnitude-four event in the UK and surrounding areas is typically recorded every three to four years, and a magnitude-five event happens every few decades - with the most recent one in 2008 in Lincolnshire.A magnitude-six earthquake happens every few hundred years. The largest known earthquake in the UK occurred in 1931, near the Dogger Bank, in the North Sea off the coast of Yorkshire.It had a magnitude of 6.1 and was powerful enough to cause minor damage to buildings on the east coast of England, despite its epicentre being 60 miles offshore.In general, earthquakes are caused by the tectonic plates that make up the earth moving and rubbing together. Smaller earthquakes, including those experienced in the UK, can be caused by movements on geological faults in the Earth's crust.The UK is situated within the Eurasian plate, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) away from the nearest plate boundary. This is why it does not experience earthquakes as large as those in other parts of the world.",

    "body": "Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has received a medical procedure to treat his chronic hiccups, his medical team has said.Saturday's treatment \"went well\", according to one of his doctors. Another, Claudio Birolini, added that the procedure - which he stressed was not a surgery - lasted for \"about an hour\".The far-right former leader is currently serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the Latin American nation's 2022 presidential election to left-wing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.This latest procedure comes after the 70-year-old successfully underwent surgery for a double hernia earlier this week, after being granted permission to be transferred to hospital.Ahead of the surgery, Bolsonaro also endorsed his son Flávio to run against Lula in Brazil's 2026 presidential election. His statement - a handwritten letter - was read out by the younger Bolsonaro outside the hospital.Following the successful surgery, his medical team deemed it necessary to treat his recurrent hiccups, which he had been suffering from for months.\"It's been nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups,\" Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, said on Saturday.She explained in a social media post that her husband's procedure had \"blocked\" one of his phrenic nerves.The phrenic nerves contract and expand the diaphragm, which allows the lungs to inhale and exhale. Hiccups are caused by the involuntary spasming of the diaphragm, typically as a result of an irritated phrenic nerve.His doctors later confirmed they had treated the right phrenic nerve and had scheduled to work on the left nerve on Monday.Once discharged from hospital, the former president will return to a cell in the federal police headquarters to continue serving his sentence. Bolsonaro was found guilty of the coup plot in September. He was placed under house arrest pending appeals, but was taken into police custody last month after being deemed a \"concrete flight risk\".Court officials said he had attempted to break his ankle monitor and planned to use a rally outside his house as cover for an escape attempt. Bolsonaro insisted he had no intention of fleeing.Also on Saturday, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest of 10 officials for participating in his coup attempt. All of them had served in his government.",

    "body": "13 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterAn evening surge in shoppers keen on Boxing Day bargains drove a decade-high increase in footfall for the annual sales, figures suggest.It was up by 4.4% across all UK retail destinations including high streets and shopping centres compared to the same day last year, according to data from MRI Software.Footfall also remained strong on Saturday, and MRI anticipated the strong post-Christmas shopping momentum to continue into the new year.But higher footfall does not necessarily translate into higher spending, and Barclays has forecast that consumers would spend £1bn less on this year's Boxing Day deals.By 3pm on 26 December, it appeared there had been a muted reaction to the sales, according to early MRI data with high street visits down 1.5% compared to 2024 and shopping centre visits down 0.6%.MRI counts footfall in more than 660 retail locations across the UK and retail analyst Jenni Matthews said that as the day progressed, it became clear that shoppers were deciding to head out but just a bit later in the day.\"The boost in activity was driven by a peak in visits across all UK retail destinations from 5pm - 11pm averaging +9.6% versus an average increase of +3.1% from 6am-5pm,\" she said.With many stores not reopening until 28 December, Ms Matthews said it was likely that hospitality and leisure venues would have benefited from the increase in foot traffic.\"This is an early indicator that the retail sector may well end the year on a positive note given the challenging times faced at the beginning of the year,\" she said.Shoppers were also out in force on Saturday, according to the MRI data, with footfall across retail destinations up by 1.6% compared to 27 December last year.Ms Matthews said that with family gatherings ending and the new year looming, MRI anticipates footfall will continue to rise over the coming days.\"Consumers [will be] likely shopping the sales, making the most of the festive events and attractions within towns and cities, and stocking up on New Year's Eve essentials, keeping the festive retail period firmly in motion,\" she said.Analysts say 2025 has been a challenging year for people as rising prices and other factors have squeezed household finances.Barclays' consumer spend report suggested that fewer people planned to take advantage of the sales, forecasting shoppers to spending £3.6bn, down from £4.6bn last year.Recent retail spending data from the Office for National Statistics showed that many shoppers resisted the lure of November's Black Friday sales, with only a 0.1% lift in sales volumes.",

    "body": "Tributes have been paid to a \"devoted family man\" who died after an assault outside a pub in Leicestershire. David Darke, 66, suffered a serious head injury when he was punched outside The Crown Inn, in Church Street, Appleby Magna, at about 21:45 GMT on 21 December. Leicestershire Police launched a murder investigation after Mr Darke died at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham on Saturday. A 36-year-old man, previously arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm, was re-arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody, police said. In a statement released by the force, Mr Darke's family said his life had been \"tragically cut short\" and he would be \"sorely missed by all who knew and loved him\". They added: \"Dave was a deeply loved father to three daughters and a proud grandfather to three boys.\"He was a much-loved brother and a dear friend. Dave will live on forever in our hearts, minds and souls.\"He was a strong, active, intelligent and kind person who was a friend to all. \"He was a devoted family man with a deep passion for life, the outdoors, nature and walking.\"The force said it was continuing to appeal for anyone who could help its investigation to come forward.

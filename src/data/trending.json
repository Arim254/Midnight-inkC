    "body": "Where does Old Trafford thriller rank among best Premier League games?Media caption, Kroupi levels for Bournemouth in eight-goal thriller against Man UtdWhen it comes to the greatest Premier League game ever, where do you even start?Manchester United and Bournemouth served up an eight-goal thriller on Monday, which former Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher described as the \"best game\" so far this season in the English top flight.  Speaking on Sky Sports, Carragher said: \"That's what makes the Premier League the greatest product in the world. \"For the majority of that Manchester United were absolutely fantastic. Bournemouth were not at the races at all in the first half but they were fantastic in the second half. What a game. Brilliant.\"I think we have just seen the best game of the Premier League season so far.\" The Red Devils famously played out a 5-5 draw at West Brom in Sir Alex Ferguson's final match in charge of the club in 2013. And United's 4-4 draw against the Cherries was the 17th time the scoreline has occurred in the Premier League era. But where does Monday's match rank among some of the other remarkable contests we have seen down the years?Liverpool 4-3 Newcastle (3 April 1996)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, This result played a major factor in the outcome of the title race eventually won by Manchester UnitedHaving blown a 10-point lead at the top of the table, Newcastle's title hopes suffered a major blow as they lost a classic in stoppage time at Anfield despite having led twice. \"Collymore closing in...\"Man City 3-2 QPR (13 May 2012)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sergio Aguero's late winner delivered the most dramatic end to a Premier League title raceIn an extraordinary conclusion to the 2011-12 campaign, Manchester City scored twice in stoppage time to beat Queens Park Rangers on the final day and win their first title in 44 years.Sergio Aguero's famous late winner ensured City pipped rivals Manchester United, who had already won that day, to the trophy on goal difference.Liverpool 4-4 Arsenal (21 April 2009)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Andrey Arshavin enjoyed his finest night in an Arsenal shirt at AnfieldOn another remarkable evening at Anfield, Arsenal's Andrey Arshavin produced a stunning individual display - netting all four goals for the Gunners to deliver a serious blow to Liverpool's title ambitions.Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal (5 February 2011)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cheick Tiote scored a sensational late equaliser for NewcastleArsenal were 4-0 up at and cruising at half-time as they looked to chase down league leaders Manchester United. However, Abou Diaby was then sent off for the Gunners as Newcastle produced a stunning comeback to earn an improbable draw - with Cheick Tiote's thumping 87th-minute strike clinching the point.Newcastle 5-0 Man Utd (20 October 1996)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Philippe Albert (right) scored a superb chip to round off Newcastle's 5-0 win With Manchester United having beaten Newcastle to the title the previous season, this felt like payback for Kevin Keegan and his players, who had also suffered a 4-0 reverse to Sir Alex Ferguson's side at Wembley in the Charity Shield just weeks earlier.Tottenham 3-5 Man Utd (29 September 2001)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, David Beckham scored Manchester United's fifth goalManchester United staged a magnificent comeback from 3-0 down at the break to overwhelm Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Dean Richards, Les Ferdinand and Christian Ziege all scored for the hosts but a transformed United hit back through Andy Cole, Laurent Blanc, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Juan Sebastian Veron and David Beckham.Man Utd 4-3 Man City (21 September 2009)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Michael Owen provided the decisive moment for the hosts late onMichael Owen's winner deep into stoppage time gave Manchester United a dramatic victory in a classic derby at Old Trafford.The moment prompted Ferguson to set off on an impromptu wild dance along the touchline, while City boss Mark Hughes - whose side had come from behind three times - questioned why the game had gone on for six added minutes rather than the four allocated.Leeds 4-3 Liverpool (4 November 2000)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mark Viduka scored all four goals for LeedsLiverpool had gone 2-0 up early on with goals from Sami Hyypia and Christian Ziege, but Mark Viduka scored either side of half-time to drag Leeds level.Vladimir Smicer restored Liverpool's advantage, before two goals in three minutes from former Celtic forward Viduka secured an incredible win for the hosts.Crystal Palace 3-3 Liverpool (5 May 2014)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Crystal Palace's late show had huge implications in the title raceTitle-chasing Liverpool had just lost to Chelsea at Anfield, but looked set to power themselves back into the race when they took a commanding 3-0 lead at Selhurst Park.But they squandered that advantage in a chaotic final 11 minutes, leaving Luis Suarez in tears at the final whistle. Man City went on to win the league by two points. Arsenal 3-2 Man Utd (9 November 1997)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, This was another Arsenal v Manchester United match packed with incidentA tight pitch, a packed Highbury and another compelling contest between two of English football's heavyweights. The Gunners went two goals up courtesy of Nicolas Anelka and Patrick Vieira only for the champions to draw level thanks to two Teddy Sheringham efforts. But in a season when Arsene Wenger's side were to wrestle the title away from Manchester, David Platt scored the winner. Everton 3-2 Wimbledon (7 May 1994)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Everton have not been relegated from the top flight since 1950-51Everton are one of only six sides that have never been relegated from the Premier League, but they were on the brink at 2-0 down to Wimbledon in the first 20 minutes of the final day of the 1993-94 season.However, a Graham Stuart double helped the Toffees preserve their stay in the top division, with his winner coming in the 81st minute, which kick-started jubilant scenes at Goodison Park.Arsenal 2-4 Man Utd (1 February 2005)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, There were fireworks in the Highbury tunnel before play even got under wayMost people will remember this game because of the fiery exchange between captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane in the tunnel before the game, but the 90 minutes itself were just as thrilling.Vieira opened the scoring for Arsenal before they were pegged back by an Ashley Cole own goal. Another Gunners legend, Dennis Bergkamp, helped the hosts retake the lead before two goals from a young Cristiano Ronaldo and a delightful John O'Shea chip stunned Arsene Wenger's side.Chelsea 2-2 Tottenham (2 May 2016)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chelsea supporters enjoyed dashing the title hopes of their London rivals TottenhamA match that meant most for a side that wasn't involved - the day that Leicester City were crowned champions will go down in footballing history.Two first-half goals from Harry Kane and Heung-min Son gave Tottenham hope of chasing the Foxes down at the business end of the season. But Gary Cahill and Eden Hazard scored to get Jamie Vardy and his Leicester team-mates' party started as tempers flared in the second half of a match dubbed the 'Battle of the Bridge'.Man Utd v Bournemouth (15 December 2025)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Eli Junior Kroupi's goal rounded off a thrilling evening at Old TraffordManchester United and Bournemouth played out the latest Premier League classic at Old Trafford. The hosts led three times and thought they had won the game when they scored twice in 129 seconds to turn a 3-2 deficit into a 4-3 advantage. But Eli Junior Kroupi's strike in the 84th minute pegged Ruben Amorim's side back once again as both sides had to settle for a share of the spoils.",

    "body": "More UK families will \"know what sacrifice for our nation means\" as the nation seeks to deter a potential confrontation with Russia, the head of the military has said.Sir Richard Knighton said the country's security \"cannot be outsourced to the armed forces\" and \"requires a whole-of-society response\", including harnessing UK universities and manufacturing.While the chief of the defence staff suggested there was only a remote chance of Russia directly attacking the UK, he told an event at the Royal United Services Institute that so-called hybrid attacks showed the threat was worsening.He referenced a Russian spy ship that was recently suspected of mapping undersea cables near UK waters.\"Every day the UK is subject to an onslaught of cyber-attacks from Russia and we know that Russian agents are seeking to conduct sabotage and have killed on our shores,\" he added.At the same time, Russia's military had become a \"hard power [which] is growing quickly\".While Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine had been a strategic failure, he said, \"we should be under no illusions that Russia has a massive, increasingly technically sophisticated, and now highly combat-experienced military\".Sir Richard said the UK needed to make itself a \"harder target\" for hybrid threats and to avoid war.Building the nation's resilience went beyond strengthening the military and \"more people being ready to fight for their country\", and included harnessing the UK's universities, energy and manufacturing industries, and the NHS.It also meant building industrial capacity \"to meet the demands in the UK and of our allies to re-stock and re-arm\".\"Building this industrial capacity also means we need more people who leave schools and universities to join that industry.\"He added that \"we need defence and political leaders to explain the importance of the industry to the nation, and we need schools and parents to encourage children and young adults to take up careers in the industry\".Addressing a skills gap highlighted in a recent report by the Royal Academy of Engineering, Sir Richard also talked about the need to work with industry and young people, announcing £50m for new defence technical excellence colleges.In recent weeks, both France and Germany have outlined plans for voluntary national service.Last year, the then-Conservative government set out its own compulsory proposals, which Labour dismissed as a gimmick.Sir Richard, who became chief of the defence staff in September, said he found himself in a position none of his predecessors had: \"looking at the prospect of the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War\".The government announced earlier this year that UK defence and security spending would rise to 5% of GDP by 2035 at the latest.\"Sons and daughters, colleagues, veterans will all have a role to play - to build, to serve, and if necessary, to fight,\" Sir Richard said. \"And more families will know what sacrifice for our nation means.\"That is why it's so important we do explain the changing threat and the need to stay ahead of it.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoPeter HoskinsBusiness reporterThree members of Ben & Jerry's independent board will no longer be eligible to serve in their roles, after the ice cream company introduced a new set of governance practices. These include a nine-year limit set on board members' terms. Chair Anuradha Mittal, who earlier said she had no plans to resign under pressure, is among those affected.The move was criticised by the company's co-founder Ben Cohen, who called it a \"blatant power grab designed to strip the board of legal authority and independence\".His remarks are the latest in a long-running row between Ben and Jerry's and its owner over the Cherry Garcia maker's social activism and the continued independence of its board.The BBC understands that Ms Mittal will leave the company immediately, while board members Mr Dodson and Ms Henderson will go at the end of this year.\"Anuradha Mittal, Daryn Dodson, and Jennifer Henderson have served this company with integrity and courage. Over many years, they helped the board make bold, often difficult decisions to uphold Ben & Jerry's social mission,\" said Mr Cohen.Ben & Jerry's said the move is aimed \"to preserve and enhance the brand's historical social mission and safeguard its essential integrity.\"The Vermont-based firm is now owned by The Magnum Ice Cream Company, after a spinoff from Unilever last week that created the world's largest standalone ice cream maker.A spokesperson for Magnum said the firm wanted to build and strengthen Ben & Jerry's \"powerful, non-partisan values-based position in the world\".But Ben & Jerry's would be destroyed as a brand if it remains with Magnum, Mr Cohen told the BBC.Ben & Jerry's was sold to Unilever in 2000 in a deal which allowed it to retain an independent board and the right to make decisions about its social mission.Since the sale there have been deepening clashes between the Vermont-based brand and Unilever, with this conflict now inherited by Magnum.In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel, resulting in its Israeli operation being sold by Unilever to a local licensee.Co-founder Jerry Greenfield left Ben & Jerry's in September after almost half a century at the firm, deepening a dispute with parent company Unilever.In a letter shared on social media by Mr Cohen, Mr Greenfield said Ben & Jerry's had lost its independence after Unilever put a halt to its social activism.",

The deceased couple's 28-year-old daughter, Romy, found her parents in their home with multiple stab wounds on Sunday, sources told the BBC's US partner CBS News.Rob Reiner is known for directing several iconic films in a variety of genres, including When Harry Met Sally, This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, Misery and A Few Good Men.Emergency services were called to provide medical aid at the Reiners' Brentwood, California, home at around 15:38 local time (23:38 GMT) on Sunday. The Los Angeles Fire Department said two people - later identified as Rob Reiner, 78, and his wife Michele, 68 - were pronounced dead at the scene.Police said Nick Reiner was arrested several hours later, at about 21:15 local time on Sunday. Investigators have not publicly outlined a motive and said the investigation remains ongoing.Watch: \"Lucky\" to have parents that \"care about me\", says Nick Reiner in 2015 interviewNick Reiner has spoken publicly about his struggles with addiction and homelessness. His experiences formed the basis of the semi-autobiographical film Being Charlie, which he made with his father in 2015.The family's home is in Brentwood, a wealthy celebrity enclave full of large mansions, boutique shops and restaurants. On Monday morning, a security guard stood outside the home as media gathered outside the front gate.Rob Reiner, the son of comedy great Carl Reiner, began his career in the 1960s and rose to fame playing Meathead in the TV sitcom All in The Family.He cemented his success with the cult mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap in 1984, which he directed and starred in. Reiner was married to Laverne & Shirley actress Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981 and is the adoptive father to Marshall's daughter, actress Tracy Reiner.He married Michele Reiner in 1989, who he said he met during the making of the romantic comedy-drama film When Harry Met Sally. The couple have three children together.Getty ImagesRob Reiner and his family, including son Nick attend a movie premiere Michele Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.Rob Reiner was also known for his outspoken political activism and support for Democratic candidates. In a post calling their deaths \"very sad\", President Donald Trump criticised Reiner, saying that they \"reportedly\" died \"due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction\" with \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\".\"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump,\" the president wrote.It is not clear what reports the president was referring to, and while the investigation is being treated as a homicide, police have yet to comment on any possible motive. The president and his allies often used the term Trump Derangement Syndrome in reference to those who are critical of him. Reiner was a vocal critic of Trump's. Several Republicans criticised Trump over the post, including former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said the deaths were a \"family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies\". \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder,\" she said. \"These go to 11\" - watch Rob Reiner in the amplifier scene from This is Spinal Tap, one of the films he directedTrump's post was also met with anger by some of the Reiners' friends.In a post on X, Maria Shriver, the former first lady of California and longtime friend of the Reiners, said the couple were \"devoted parents\". \"They deeply loved all their children and they never gave up trying to care for them,\" she said. Sir Elton John, who made an appearance in this year's Spinal Tap sequel, said: \"I am in disbelief at today's news of Rob and Michele.\"They were two of the most beautiful people I'd ever met and they deserved better.\"Fellow actor John Cusack, who appeared in Reiner's 1985 film The Sure Thing, called him \"a great man\", while Elijah Wood, who starred in 1994's North, said he was \"horrified\" by the couple's deaths.",

    "body": "7 hours agoEmily HoltHope JezzardHope Jezzard's phobia of hospitals was so intense that it seemed inconceivable she would ever work in one. Now, Hope is a midwife who helps mothers overcome their fears.Hospital phobia, or nosocomephobia, is one of a number of recognised anxiety disorders commonly associated with traumatic childhood experiences.Hope told BBC Radio 5 Live that her mum was in and out of the hospital during her childhood.  \"She nearly died twice and was put on life support. I had to leave her behind and although I knew she was being helped, it felt like I was being separated from her.\"When Hope entered her teens and early twenties, any routine appointment would set her heart racing, she says.\"It manifested as feeling very anxious, panicky, being very triggered by smells and noises in hospitals,\" she says.John Hawker, a psychotherapist who helps people deal with phobias, says a fear of hospitals is \"quite common\", often begins in childhood and is triggered by sights, smells and sounds.\"Perhaps when somebody was six weeks old, they were given an injection, and the memory of that injection was the smell of surgical spirit,\" he says.\"A bit of their brain was triggered by the smell of surgical spirit, and it doesn't matter how much logic that you tried to use to overcome that; they still don't want to walk into the hospital,\" he says. 'The first few shifts were terrifying'Hope JezzardHope during her training to become a midwifeWhen Hope had to go to hospital appointments during her pregnancies and for the births of her two children, she says the support she received from her midwives inspired her to think about pursuing the same career.At first her hospital phobia made the idea seem impossible but \"over time the desire to try and help people trumped my fear,\" she says.She left her job in a coffee shop to study for a degree in Midwifery at Coventry University.\"Going into a hospital was a massive challenge. I had avoided clinical settings for years. The first few shifts were terrifying,\" she says. \"But over time, I became more comfortable.\"She credits talking therapy with helping her work through the negative associations she had with hospitals.\"One of the tools I was given was the idea of the compassionate self - treating yourself in the same way you would a friend if they said to you 'I'm terrified to go into a hospital'.\"You might say 'can I come with you, can I hold your hand, would you like to talk beforehand or talk while it's happening?\"She also advised writing down a \"stream of consciousness\" when feeling overwhelmed by fear.\"Don't try and make sense of it or punctuate it or even make it legible it can be as simple as 'I'm scared I'm going to die'. You can throw it away or keep it and come back to it,\" she says.Tips to cope with a fear of hospitalsWrite down your fears - putting them on to paper can give you perspectiveTake someone with you - a trusted person may help you to relaxTell hospital staff - They will be better equipped to help you if they know Tell your GP - They may refer you to an expert in behavioural therapy, such as a psychologistTalking therapy - You can self-refer to this NHS serviceKim BlackKim now helps other people dealing with their fear of hospitals. Kim Black says she was \"absolutely frozen\" by her fear of hospitals after being diagnosed with hip dysplasia aged four. She says she developed paediatric medical traumatic stress following multiple surgeries.\"I would do anything not to go to the hospital, anything, I would just completely disassociate or avoid it altogether,\" she says.\"I once went to hospital actually dragging my leg behind me and I couldn't lift it up because that was how long I waited to go.\"Kim now helps people to overcome their hospital phobias and build confidence after major surgery.\"Something that I do with my work is actually help prepare people to advocate for themselves and set up good boundaries when they go in,\" she says.She says it helps her to \"get ahead of spiralling thoughts\" by writing them down. \"When I get to the hospital, I speak directly to whoever comes up to me and I tell them straight away, this is what I'm dealing with.\"Mr Hawker says it is possible to combat a fear of hospitals through numerous therapies aimed at helping people detach from distressing memories without having to relive trauma. \"Hopefully overcoming that phobic response will allow somebody to feel much more empowered when they walk into a medical situation,\" he says.Hope says putting herself in the environment that made her frightened for short periods gradually helped her to get used to hospitals.\"Now I'm a midwife and there are moments when I just want to run out of there but I've turned a very negative experience as a child into a very positive way to help people as an adult.\"Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "India's anti-terrorism agency, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), has charged two Pakistan-based militant groups and six people in the attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir this April, that left 26 people dead.The massacre in the tourist town of Pahalgam brought nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to the brink of war. India blamed Pakistan for the attacks – an accusation Islamabad denied. Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) - designated as a terror organisation by the United Nations - and The Resistance Front (TRF) have been charged with \"planning, facilitating and executing\" the attack.Pakistan's government has not yet commented on the charges. The TRF had initially said it was behind the attack but later denied its involvement.The 1,597-page chargesheet, filed on Monday in a special court in Jammu, names the militant groups and six others, three of whom were killed by security forces days after the attack.A man accused by NIA of being a \"Pakistani terrorist handler\", Sajid Jatt, as well as two other men already in NIA custody since June have also been named in the chargesheet. \"During interrogation, the two men had disclosed the identities of the three armed terrorists involved in the attack, and had also confirmed that they were Pakistani nationals affiliated to proscribed LeT terror outfit,\" NIA said in a statement. The accused have been charged under relevant sections of India's criminal code and its stringent anti-terror law. They have also been accused of waging war against India, the NIA statement said. The NIA said its nearly eight-month probe traced the conspiracy to Pakistan and that further investigation is continuing.Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for long. The two neighbours claim the region in full, but control only parts of it. The countries have fought two wars over the restive region. The beauty and brutality of life in the shadow of Kashmir killingsKashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over itThe Pahalgam attack was one of the deadliest militant attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir since 2019.On 22 April, a popular tourist meadow turned into a killing field when militants singled out and shot dead 25 male Hindu tourists in Baisaran, about 7km from town. A local Muslim pony handler who tried to help was also killed.Within days of the attack, India revoked the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, while Pakistan responded by withdrawing from the 1972 Simla Agreement on bilateral dispute resolution.In the weeks that followed, the two countries exchanged missile and drone strikes in a four-day conflict that ended in a fragile truce.",

    "body": "8 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterThousands of drivers could have speeding fines cancelled after a fault saw some cameras falsely triggered on English A roads and motorways.National Highways said it had found 2,650 wrongful speed camera activations since 2021 due to a delay between cameras and variable speed signs.Affected drivers will be contacted by police and be reimbursed for any fines while points will be removed from their licences where needed.Not all camera activations are enforced, so not all of the wrongful activations will have resulted in fines.National Highways apologised for the error and chief executive Nick Harris said a fix for the issue has been identified.\"Safety is our number one priority… All drivers should continue observing the posted speed limits as normal. Anyone who has been impacted will be contacted by the relevant police force,\" he said.National Highways, which runs England's motorways, blamed an \"anomaly\" in how variable speed cameras were interacting with signs on some A roads and motorways.It meant a delay of around 10 seconds between cameras and relevant variable speed signs, meaning some drivers were incorrectly identified as speeding after the limit had changed.The body said the 2,650 incidents since 2021 represent fewer than two each day, compared with more than 6 million activations of speed cameras on the affected roads over the same period. It said the anomaly has impacted 10% of England's motorways and major A roads.It is working with police to check activations and promised nobody will now be wrongly prosecuted.Meanwhile, police forces have stopped issuing fines from variable cameras until they have confidence in their accuracy.A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"We apologise to anyone who has been affected. Safety was never compromised, and we are working with policing to ensure nobody is incorrectly prosecuted in future.\"Enforcement is still in place, and the public can remain confident that only motorists who break the rules will be penalised.\"",

    "body": "22 minutes agoChristal HayesandAoife WalshUS President Donald Trump has filed a $5bn (£3.7bn) lawsuit against the BBC over an edit of his 6 January 2021 speech in a Panorama documentary.Trump accused the broadcaster of defamation and of violating a trade practices law, according to court documents filed in Florida. The BBC apologised to Trump last month, but rejected his demands for compensation and disagreed there was any \"basis for a defamation claim\".Trump's legal team accused the BBC of defaming him by \"intentionally, maliciously, and deceptively doctoring his speech\". The BBC has not yet responded to the lawsuit.Trump said last month that he planned to sue the BBC for the documentary, which aired in the UK ahead of the 2024 US election.\"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plans. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"In his speech on 6 January 2021, before a riot at the US Capitol, Trump told a crowd: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme, a clip showed him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"The BBC acknowledged that the edit had given \"the mistaken impression\" he had \"made a direct call for violent action\", but disagreed that there was basis for a defamation claim. In November, a leaked internal BBC memo criticised how the speech was edited, and led to the resignations of the BBC's director general, Tim Davie, and its head of news, Deborah Turness.Before Trump filed the lawsuit, lawyers for the BBC had given a lengthy response to the president's claims. They said there was no malice in the edit and that Trump was not harmed by the programme, as he was re-elected shortly after it aired.  They also said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama programme on its US channels. While the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.In his lawsuit, Trump cites agreements the BBC had with other distributors to show content, specifically one with a third-party media corporation that allegedly had licensing rights to the documentary outside the UK. The BBC has not yet responded to these claims, nor has the company with the alleged distribution agreement.The suit also claims that people in Florida may have accessed the programme using a VPN or by using streaming service BritBox. \"The Panorama Documentary's publicity, coupled with significant increases in VPN usage in Florida since its debut, establishes the immense likelihood that citizens of Florida accessed the Documentary before the BBC had it removed,\" the lawsuit said.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has urged the prime minister to tell Trump that his decision to sue the BBC is \"unacceptable\".\"Keir Starmer needs to stand up for the BBC against Trump's outrageous legal threat and protect licence fee payers from being hit in the pocket,\" he said.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump says he has asked Chinese leader Xi Jinping to \"consider\" releasing Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong pro-democracy tycoon who was earlier this week found guilty under the city's controversial national security law.\"I feel so badly,\" Trump told reporters. \"I spoke to President Xi about it and I asked to consider his release.\"The UK similarly called for the 78-year-old to be \"immediately released\", with UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper condemning the ruling, calling it a \"politically motivated persecution\". Lai, who is a British citizen, has been in jail since December 2020 and is due to be sentenced early next year. He faces a maximum term of life in prison. Trump made the brief comment to reporters at the White House on Monday - but did not specify when he had brought Lai's case up to Xi. \"He's an older man and he's not well. So I did put that request out. We'll see what happens, okay?,\" he said. His comments come after a Hong Kong court on Monday found Lai guilty of colluding with foreign forces. The verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said that Lai's actions had \"damaged the country's interests and the welfare of Hong Kongers\", but rights groups called it \"a cruel judicial farce\".\"He has been targeted by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression,\" UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper had told Parliament on Monday, calling for Lai's \"immediate release\".She added that the Foreign Office has summoned the Chinese Ambassador to \"underline our position in the strongest terms\", adding that it was \"heartbreaking that such a violation of a British man's rights could occur in Hong Kong\". China's foreign ministry had earlier on Monday dismissed criticisms of Lai's trial, describing them as \"brazen defamation and smearing of the judicial system in Hong Kong\".Lai was on Monday convicted under the city's controversial national security law - which rights groups say is used to crush dissent, but which Beijing defends as essential for the city's stability.He was also convicted of publishing seditious material on Apple Daily under a separate colonial-era law.His detention and conviction have drawn concern from rights groups and foreign leaders, who have long called for his release.His children have voiced serious concerns about Lai's deteriorating health in prison, with Sebastien telling the BBC earlier this year that given his father's age and health, he could \"die in prison\".",

    "body": "9 minutes agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe UK unemployment rate in the three months to October has increased to 5.1%, according to official figures.That marked a rise from 5% for the three months to September.The number of people in the UK who are unemployed is now at its highest level since January 2021, just below the peak rate seen during the Covid-19 pandemic.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the data reflected a \"subdued labour market\".Average wage growth was 4.6%, excluding bonuses, between August and October 2025.Annual average earnings growth in private companies slowed from 4.2% to 3.9% but accelerated for the public sector employees from 6.6% to 7.6%, compared with the prior three-month period. Wage growth adjusted for inflation was 0.5%, excluding bonuses. Estimates for employees on company payrolls dropped by 149,000, or 0.5%, in October compared with the previous year.Liz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, said the figures indicate \"a weakening labour market\".\"The number of employees on payroll has fallen again, reflecting subdued hiring activity.\"The fall in payroll numbers and increase in unemployment has been seen particularly among some younger age groups,\" Ms McKeown said.Young workers hit hardestJames Reed, the chief executive of Reed Recruitment said all the main measures of the labour market were \"going in the wrong direction\".\"I'm wondering whether they've hit the bottom or not,\" he said.Mr Reed told the BBC's Today programme the increase to the minimum wage announced in the Budget was \"very welcome for people who have jobs\" but \"the economics of hiring at entry level is becoming less and less appealing to employers\".The government has pledged to scrap the two-tier minimum wage and create a new rate for all adults.But many businesses have said this will make them less inclined to hire young workers with little or no experience.Meerah Nakaayi is 22 and from London. She did a two-year apprenticeship in policy and then worked in the sector for two years, but has been out of work since June. 22-year-old Meerah has been out of work since JuneMeerah said: \"The last six months have been incredibly frustrating and demotivating.\"My last interview feedback stated how they had 290 applications for a policy analyst role ... for a niche policy area. I think that just shows how competitive it really is out there.\"Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \"The prospects for a rebound in hiring activity for younger workers remain weak.The falling rate of private-sector wage growth reflects \"a marked slowdown in hiring activity amongst businesses,\" she said.Ms Selfin also said that the overall picture bolstered the case for the Bank of England to cut its base interest rate this week.Responding to the ONS figures, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden said the data \"underline the scale of the challenge we've inherited\".\"That is why we are investing £1.5bn to deliver 50,000 apprenticeships and 350,000 new workplace opportunities for young people - giving them real experience and a foot in the door.\"To go further and tackle the deep-rooted issues of our labour market, Alan Milburn is also leading an investigation into the whole issue of young people inactivity and work.\"Helen Whately, shadow work and pensions secretary, accused the government of implementing \"growth-killing policies\" that would lead to job losses in the run up to Christmas.\"Fourteen months in a row of higher unemployment means thousands of families will be struggling through the holiday season and without a steady income heading into the New Year.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterThe government has launched a new taskforce it says will help women \"enter, stay and lead\" in the UK tech sector.Led by technology secretary Liz Kendall, it will see female leaders from tech companies and organisations advise the government on how to boost diversity and economic growth in the industry.BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, recently suggested women accounted for only 22% of those working in IT specialist roles in the UK.Ms Kendall said the Women in Tech group would \"break down the barriers that still hold too many people back\".\"When women are inspired to take on a role in tech and have a seat at the table, the sector can make more representative decisions, build products that serve everyone,\" she said.BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, warned in December the amount of women working in the UK tech sector still lagged far behind men.It said the government should look to help close the gender gap in order to meet its ambitious AI goals.\"We cannot create high-trust, high-integrity AI systems if the profession behind them is missing out on the talents and perspective of half the population,\" said chief executive Sharron Gunn.Ms Kendall will lead the taskforce alongside Anne-Marie Imafidon, founder of Stemettes, who has been appointed as the Women in Tech Envoy.Dr Imafidon, who passed A-level computing aged 11 and received a Master's Degree in Maths and Computer Science from the University of Oxford aged 20, has sought to encourage more young women into careers in Stem - science, technology, engineering and maths.She told the BBC her role would build on more than a decade of work to establish greater equality for - and representation of - women.But now, amid what she called \"a fourth industrial revolution\", was a key moment to \"be part of shifting who is making those decisions for what comes next\".\"This isn't just about having women being the driving force and building the technology, but this is about building technology that benefits everybody,\" she said.The government said the taskforce will advise on ways to make the tech sector more representative and \"ensure the UK accesses the full talent pool, market opportunities, and innovation capacity needed for economic growth\".BT Group boss Allison Kirkby, Revolut chief executive Francesca Carlesi and Dr Hayaatun Sillem, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Engineering, are among its 15 founding members.It also includes TUC assistant general secretary Kate Bell, director of public policy at Uber Emma O'Dwyer, and Sue Daley, director of technology and innovation at industry group techUK.\"Entry routes, career progression to leadership, and access to capital are just some of the barriers women in tech still face today,\" Ms Daley said.\"Achieving gender equality is long overdue, and I am honoured to join the Women in Tech taskforce alongside Liz Kendall and several inspiring women from across the industry, working together to chart a path forward for true gender equality.\"",

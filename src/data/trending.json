    "body": "First snowfall of season possible for some as weekend cold snap arrivesImage source, GettyImage caption, Showers are expected to turn wintry over hills in the north UK this weekendByStav DanaosLead Weather PresenterTemperatures across the UK are set to fall this weekend, triggering the first snowfall of the season for some areas.This coincides with the end of British Summer Time as the clocks go back with the weather reflecting the shift towards a more wintry feel. Temperatures will be below average with strong, gusty winds making it feel especially cold and raw.This change in weather is driven by the position of Storm Benjamin in the North Sea, drawing down a cold Arctic northerly airflow across the UK.Image caption, Cold arctic air will affect all of the UK this weekendBeware the biting windIn the wake of Storm Benjamin, the UK will come under the influence of a brisk northerly wind, which could reach gale force at times along eastern counties on Saturday.Frequent showers are expected in coastal areas—especially along north-facing shores.Whilst there will be some autumnal sunshine, temperatures are set to dip slightly below average for the time of year, with daytime highs ranging between just 8 and 11C.But with that biting, Arctic wind it could feel up to 5C colder, especially on the east coast of Scotland and north-east England.Where will it snow?If showers fall over high ground - mainly above 400m - there is the chance these will turn to snow.This is most likely over the highest ground in Scotland where a few centimetres of snow accumulation are possible. There may also be a touch of wintriness over the highest hills of northern England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.But it's all change again next week.A change in wind direction will bring milder temperatures. Then by the end of the week, heavy rain and strong winds look likely.You can keep up to date with the weather where you are on the BBC Weather app or by checking the forecast online.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "59 minutes agoThe fallout after a former asylum seeker who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl was mistakenly released from prison dominates Saturday's papers. The Sun calls the blunder \"one out... by mistake\", playing off the government's \"one in, one out\" asylum scheme. The paper reports Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was due to be deported before being released after an \"astonishing error\" by prison staff.The Daily Telegraph says police are scrambling to track down the sex offender who was let out of HMP Chelmsford after being wrongly categorised as a prisoner due to be freed. Justice Secretary David Lammy says he is \"furious\" and has ordered an \"urgent investigation\" into the error, the paper reports. Elsewhere, a picture of Boris Johnson's ex-wife Marina Wheeler is front and centre, who poses the question \"I'm over him, surely Britain is too?\"\"A blunder that beggars belief\" is the Daily Mail's take. Police say Kebatu was last seen asking for directions from locals before boarding a London-bound train at Chelmsford station on Friday, the paper reports. Sharing the front page, the Mail says that Prince Andrew could be asked to leave the Royal Lodge by King Charles III.The Mirror also leads with Prince Andrew's \"advanced talks\" with the King to leave the Royal Lodge after the fallout from his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \"Dislodged\" is the paper's headline over an aerial view of Windsor's sprawling Royal Lodge mansion.A \"stark warning for Starmer\" after Labour suffered a \"crushing\" by-election defeat in its traditional heartland of Wales on Friday, the Guardian reports. The paper says the result highlighted the \"striking collapse\" of the party's vote, with MPs warning a repeat loss in the 2026 May local elections \"could spell the end\" of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's premiership. Alongside, the Guardian previews Claudia Winkleman's \"next steps\" after she and fellow Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly announced they were leaving the show.\"Starmer in firing line\" echoes the Independent's headline on the government's \"historic by-election defeat\" in Caerphilly. The paper reports the PM saying he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the result. Also sharing the top spot is the King's \"royal welcome\" for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday ahead of a summit with European allies in London.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to give more than a million low-paid workers a pay boost in the budget, the Times reports. The paper says Reeves has been warned by businesses the move would risk \"pricing jobs out of existence\".The i follows with more warnings from economists for the chancellor, who say raising the higher rate of income tax would hit \"ordinary workers\", including teachers and junior doctors. The paper reports Reeves is considering \"breaking Labour's manifesto pledge to give herself some breathing space on public spending\".\"Trump sets off fresh tariffs alarm\" is the Financial Times' lead, after Donald Trump \"cleared the way for new tariffs\" on China and halted trade talks with Canada on Friday. The paper says the decisions come ahead of Trump's upcoming trip to Asia, which includes a summit in South Korea with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Finally, the Daily Star is asking their readers who they want as Strictly Come Dancing's next hosts. The top names in the running include presenters Rylan Clark and Zoe Ball, with \"Lettuce Liz Truss\" also making a surge with 8% of the vote.Related Internet Links",

She passed away \"peacefully\" in a Bangkok hospital at 21:21 local time (14:21 GMT) on Friday, according to the Thai Royal Household Bureau.Sirikit had \"suffered several illnesses\" while in hospital since 2019, including a blood infection this month, it added.For more than six decades, Queen Sirikit was married to Thailand's longest-reigning monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016.King Vajiralongkorn has ordered the Thai Royal Household Bureau to organise a royal funeral, the statement added.Queen Sirikit's body will lie in state at the Grand Palace's Dusit Thorne Hall in Bangkok, according to the palace.Thai royal family members will also observe a year of mourning.Queen Sirikit married the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1950Queen Sirikit met her future husband, King Bhumibol, while studying music in Paris, where her father was stationed as Thai ambassador to France.\"It was hate at first sight,\" she said in a 1980 BBC documentary about the Thai monarchy, Soul of a Nation, adding that he had arrived late to their first meeting. \"Because he said he would arrive at four o'clock in the afternoon. He arrived at seven o'clock, kept me standing there, practising curtsy and curtsy,\" she said.The couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before King Bhumibol was crowned in Bangkok.As a young couple in the 1960s, Queen Sirikit and King Bhumibol travelled around the world, meeting US president Dwight Eisenhower, the late Queen Elizabeth II - as well as Elvis Presley.During that decade, she frequently made international best dressed lists.ReutersQueen Sirikit greeted the late Queen Elizabeth II during a 1996 state visit to ThailandIn the rare 1980 interview with the BBC, she also described the relationship between the monarchy and people in Thailand, which continues to observe strict lese-majeste laws forbidding insult of the monarchy. She said: \"Kings and queens of Thailand have always been in close contact with the people and they usually regard the king as the father of the nation.\"That is why we do not have much private life, because we are considered father and mother of the nation.\"She was seen as a key maternal figure for the country, with her birthday, 12 August, marked as Mother's Day since 1976.In 2008, she attended the funeral of an anti-government protester killed in violent clashes with police. Queen Sirikit suffered a stroke in 2012, after which she was rarely seen in public.She is survived by her son and three daughters. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoGabija GataveckaiteBBC NI Dublin correspondent , RDS, Ballsbridge, Dublin Counting is due to get under way later in the Irish presidential election.Voters in the Republic of Ireland went to the polls on Friday to elect the 10th Irish president, who will replace current head of state Michael D Higgins.There are two contenders to become the next president, but voters had a choice of three candidates - Catherine Connolly, Heather Humphreys and Jim Gavin, whose withdrawal from the race came too late to have his name removed from the ballot paper.Ballot boxes will open at 09.00 local time on Saturday and the result is due to be announced at Dublin Castle later that evening.Early unofficial indications have suggested the turnout could potentially struggle to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018.Connolly is an independent politician backed by a number of left-wing parties including Sinn Féin.She has been a TD (member of parliament) since 2016 and previously worked as a psychologist and barrister. She is from Galway.Humphreys is the Fine Gael candidate. She was a TD from 2011 to 2024 and served in a number of senior cabinet ministerial positions, including social protection and justice.She comes from a Protestant background and is from Monaghan.The votes, which will be counted in each of the 43 constituencies, will be tallied by political parties as soon as boxes open and these will give early indications of the result.Some 3.6 million people were eligible to vote in the election, which comes to an end after months of campaigning by both candidates. To get nominated, candidates needed either 20 members of the Oireachtas, the Irish houses of parliament, or four city and county councils, to back them.Connolly was the first to declare her intention to run last July.She has the support of a number of left-wing parties, including Sinn Féin, Labour and the Social Democrats as well as independent politicians.Humphreys was selected to run for Fine Gael after the party's initial candidate, former EU Commissioner Mairead McGuinness, withdrew from the race in August for medical reasons.A third candidate, Jim Gavin, who was selected by the main coalition party, Fianna Fáil, withdrew from the campaign earlier in October after intense controversy over a 16-year-old rental dispute in which he owed €3,300 (£2,870) to a former tenant.However, as his withdrawal came after the close of nominations, the law states his name must remain on the ballot paper.Any votes cast for him will be counted as legitimate and transferred to the two other candidates if necessary.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJaroslav Lukiv and Vitaliy Shevchenko,Russia editor at Downing StreetEPA/ShutterstockMore than 20 nations supporting Ukraine have pledged to \"take Russian oil and gas off the global market\" as part of efforts to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war.\"We're choking off funding for Russia's war machine,\" said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, after hosting a summit of the \"coalition of the willing\" in London.The UK and US have in recent days sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies, while the EU targeted Moscow's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was also in London, said \"pressure\" on Russia was the only way to stop the fighting. However, no long-range missile deliveries to Ukraine were announced at the summit.Zelensky has long argued that US-made Tomahawks and European missiles would help make the war costs heavier for Moscow by hitting key military targets – including oil refineries and weapons depots – deep inside Russia.But during last week's talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump indicated to Zelensky that he was not ready to supply Tomahawks.On Thursday, President Putin warned that if \"such weapons are used to strike Russian Federation territory the response will be... overwhelming\".Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Speaking at a joint press conference after the London summit, Starmer said Putin was \"not serious about peace\", and therefore Ukraine's allies agreed a \"clear plan for the rest of the year\" on supporting Ukraine.The UK prime minister said this also included targeting Russia's sovereign assets to \"unlock billions to help finance Ukraine's defence\". He gave no further details.On Thursday, EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years - but stopped short of agreeing to use frozen Russian assets worth €140bn (£122bn).Asked about a so-called \"reparations loan\" for Ukraine funded by the Russian assets, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she hoped a decision would be made by Christmas EveIn London, the \"coalition of the willing\" also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defences\" amid almost daily Russian air assaults on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure.Zelensky warned that Russia \"wants to make the winter cold a tool of torment\", adding that \"they want to break us\".Comments by the leaders in London will be disappointing for those who were hoping to hear specific examples of how Kyiv's allies were planning to make Russia stop attacking Ukraine.No doubt, a lot of the words said will be pleasing to the Ukrainian ear. For example, Starmer said the UK and Ukraine's other allies were prepared to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.But there were no concrete examples of how exactly the allies were planning to force a change on the battlefield or make Putin come to the negotiating table.EPA/ShutterstockUkrainian officials say a kindergarten was hit in a Russian air strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv earlier this weekOver in Ukraine, several people who spoke to the BBC said they were more focused on everyday problems, rather than following Zelensky's trip to the UK.Yana Kolomiets, from Odesa, said there was a lack of electricity, heating and water in the southern city.\"The more scary thing is that the Russians started launching guided bombs on our region,\" she added.Tetiana Dankevych, from the capital Kyiv, said power outages and a problems with water supplies caused by Russian strikes were making life \"very difficult\".\"I don't have a feeling this war will end soon,\" she said.Further support for Ukraine's energy infrastructure was among the issues discussed at the London summit - however, no specific announcements were made.Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte also took part in the London meeting, while other leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - participated via a video link.Ukraine and its Western allies have publicly agreed with President Trump's proposal that the fighting should be immediately frozen along the vast front line for negotiations to begin.Russia has rejected this idea, repeating demands that Kyiv and its allies describe as de facto capitulation by Ukraine.Earlier on Friday, Zelensky held talks with King Charles at Windsor – their third meeting this year.",

    "body": "6 hours agoDaniel Sandford,UK correspondent, the Old Bailey and Andre Rhoden-PaulMetropolitan PoliceJake Reeves, left, was brought into the plot by Dylan Earl Six men have been jailed for their parts in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse providing aid to Ukraine. The fire at industrial units in Leyton, east London, on 20 March 2024 caused £1.3m in damage. Ringleader Dylan Earl was recruited by the Wagner Group, a mercenary organisation that acts on behalf of the Russian state and is proscribed by the UK government as a terrorist organisation. He was sentenced to 17 years in prison plus a further six years on extended licence. Before his arrest, he was also plotting to kidnap a wealthy Russian dissident. Earl, 21, from Elmesthorpe, Leicestershire, admitted a National Security Act offence and aggravated arson, along with Jake Reeves, 24, from Croydon, who was given 12 years in prison plus one year on extended licence.Reeves helped Earl recruit a group of men to carry out the arson. The pair are the first to be convicted of offences under the National Security Act 2023. The act is designed to tackle threats that fall short of traditional spying and can involve third party actors not working directly for a hostile state, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says. Of the other four men sentenced:Nii Mensah, 23, from Thornton Heath, who streamed the attack, was convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for nine yearsAshton Evans, 20, from Newport, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, convicted for failing to tell police what he knew about a planned kidnapping, and jailed for nine years.Jakeem Rose, 23, from Croydon, who set the buildings alight, pleaded guilty to have a bladed article in a public place, convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for eight years and 10 months Ugnius Asmena, 21, of no fixed address, who arranged the getaway car and was there on the night, was convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for seven years All four each received a further year on extended licence.Earl contacted the Wagner Group on messaging app Telegram and told his handler he was keen to carry out a series of \"missions\", of which Leyton would be the first, the court previously heard. In the chat, Earl's contact instructed him to watch Cold War spy drama The Americans and use it as a \"manual\".Earl then brought in other men to carry out the arson attack. The Ukrainian-owned warehouse they targeted had been used to send goods to Ukraine, including Starlink satellite terminals, and it required eight fire crews with 60 firefighters to get the blaze under control. Earl was supposed to receive £9,000 for his role but was paid less because he carried out the plan early without his handler's sign-off.On Friday, Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described the case as a \"planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage\" in the interests of the Russian state. Police footage shows arson attack ringleader's arrestAfter the warehouse attack, Earl and Reeves set the group's sights on an arson attack on a restaurant and wine shop in Mayfair and the kidnap of owner Evgeny Chichvarkin, a critic of the Russian state.But before he could carry it out, he was arrested in a B&Q car park in Leicestershire, and videos of the warehouse fire being started were found on his phone. In a search of the drug dealer's home, police recovered a Russian flag, more than £20,000 in cash and cocaine with a street value of some £34,000.Evidence on his phone revealed details of a cryptocurrency account holding more than £58,000 and images of bundles of cash estimated to total £175,000.Earl also admitted possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of criminal property.Metropolitan PoliceThe fire caused about £1.3m worth of damage to the warehouseCommander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Policing, told the BBC Earl was \"somebody working absolutely as an agent of a foreign state to sow unrest and commit crimes in this country\". He added Russia presents \"a very real threat to our national security\" and it was not unusual now to see Russia contacting people online and then using them to conduct criminal activity on their behalf. Security minister Dan Jarvis said the sentences sent a clear message that the UK would not tolerate hostile activity by foreign states. \"To those acting for a foreign state, as the head of MI5 has said, you are disposable and you will not receive your reward, just as these individuals found out,\" he warned.

    "body": "Prince Andrew's banner bearing his coat of arms has been removed at Windsor Castle as the controversy continues over his links to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The flag, linked to his membership of the Order of the Garter, which the prince gave up last week, was on display inside St George's Chapel but is no longer hanging there.Last Friday, Andrew announced he would also no longer use his royal titles, including Duke of York, after the publication of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre revived claims about his ties to Epstein.The prince is under increasing pressure to lose further privileges, including the formal removal of his titles and his residence at Royal Lodge in Windsor. The book, Nobody's Girl, was written by Ms Giuffre before she died earlier this year. She accused the prince of sexually assaulting her - allegations Prince Andrew has strenuously denied. Prince Andrew's banner, which he was given when he became a Knight of the Garter (KG) in 2006, had been hanging in the quire - the area where clergy and the choir sit for services. A virtual tour of the area available on the website for St George's Chapel shows it still hanging near the door leading into the quire. It is not known when the tour was created.However, the banner has now been removed and only three now hang in the space. It is thought it was taken down earlier in the week. The Order of the Garter is the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain and includes other senior members of the royal family and those said to have contributed notably to public life.Current non-royal members include former prime ministers Sir Tony Blair and Sir John Major.Prince Andrew is facing scrutiny over his Royal Lodge home in Windsor Great Park, where he has paid a \"peppercorn rent\" for more than 20 years.The government this week refused to give MPs time to debate Prince Andrew's titles or taxpayer-funded home, despite growing pressure for scrutiny.The Metropolitan Police has said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about Ms Giuffre through his police protection.On Friday, it emerged the prince had been paid tens of thousands of pounds by a British businessman linked to a wealth management company which ripped off pension savers.Documents from the High Court in London showed Andrew had received £60,500 from businessman Adrian Gleave in December 2019, a few weeks after the BBC Newsnight interview which led to his withdrawal from public life.Prince Andrew has also removed his royal titles from Companies House, changing his name from \"HRH the Duke of York KG\" to \"Prince Andrew.\" A document was filed listing a change of his details for his start up venture Pitch@Palace. On 17 October, Andrew said he would stop using the titles because the \"continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family\".\"I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\" he said.",

    "body": "'I just love yapping': Spud sellers, posh-girl comedy and bus-loving gran among  TikTok award nominees2 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsCoco SarelSarel is best known for her Love Island debriefs after each episode When Sarel presses record on her phone, there's no script, no set and no meticulous plan for what she's about to say. \"I'm usually wearing my bonnet, no makeup and I just pick up the phone and start yapping,\" she says. \"I believe in maximum output for minimal effort, so if I have to do more than the bare minimum, I likely won't do it. That's why I just talk to the camera and post.\" In only a few years, Sarel's unfiltered style has turned her from an ordinary voice online into one of TikTok's most distinctive personalities, with more than one million followers on the platform. Famous for her Love Island debriefs, Sarel is among the nominees at the second annual TikTok awards - a celebration of the creators shaping online culture in the UK. There are 72 nominees across 12 categories including education, beauty, comedy, food and sport. The nominees have a combined following of more than 83 million followers.From breakout comedians to beauty innovators, this year's nominees include jacket potato entrepreneurs, tap dancing brothers, a bus loving aunty, a BookTok aficionado and a film location fangirl. Coco Sarel Sarel can't quite believe that the thing she does most naturally - talking - has gained her millions of followers and likes.\"It's mad people want to watch me yap,\" she says. But the simplicity of her process is part of the appeal and \"you really do see 100% of me on the camera\". Her journey has also taken her beyond the screen, and in 2023 she performed at the Edinburgh Fringe festival with fellow TikTok stars. \"I've got a whole new respect for comedians after doing that,\" she says. \"With content, if people don't like it, they scroll away, but if you bomb on stage, the whole room is looking at you like, 'That's terrible'\".With visibility comes scrutiny, and Sarel says it's not always easy dealing with the darker side of social media. \"The hate is always louder than the love,\" she says. \"Five years ago, I'd clap back in the comments, but I'm 31 now and I'm too tired for that so I just block it out and ignore it.\" Because she started sharing later in life, Sarel is still figuring out how much of herself to put online. \"I go off how I feel in the moment, and my audience respects that,\" she says. \"I started off like I was just talking to friends, but now I protect parts of my life I don't want everyone's opinion on.\" While social media is full of people turning major life events into months-long content strategies, Sarel isn't interested in that and even significant milestones tend to pass with little fanfare on her feed. \"I recently got married and I did two videos, then I was like, 'Let's talk about The Traitors.' I've got ADHD, so I move on quickly.\"Henry RowleyHenry RowleyThe 27-year-old was a marketing executive before finding fame on TikTokBest known for his \"husky posh girl\" sketches, Henry Rowley has become one of TikTok's sharpest comedy voices. The Leicester-born performer discovered his now signature characters while studying at Bristol University, where he found himself \"surrounded by a whole new world of posh\" and he couldn't resist turning it into material.\"Some of those posh people were my friends and I found everything they said hilarious, so I started making videos about things they'd say on nights out.\"His sketches, which more recently include impressions of Harry Potter characters as if they were Scottish, has earned him more than a million followers on TikTok. He's also tried to carve a space in stand-up - a move he admits has been challenging. \"It's entirely different doing content and comedy on stage,\" he says. \"Stand-up takes a lot of work and before the Fringe and my tour, there were so many pubs and awful gigs where I did a 20-minute set to zero laughs. It's certainly humbling.\" Despite his rising profile, Rowley protects much of his life from the public eye. \"I mainly post characters and sketches so people who follow me don't know that much about me, which is really nice. I like having that balance,\" he says. His advice for other people starting out creating content is similar to what most of the nominees said: \"Don't try and go viral but instead focus on doing something you are genuinely interested in.\" Bemi OrojuogunBemi, known as Bus Aunty, is nominated for best video of the year which has been watched 49 million timesIf London has an unofficial ambassador for its buses, it might just be Bus Aunty. Often seen smiling beside a passing double-decker, she's turned her lifelong love of the capital's transport network into a viral celebration of city life.\"My love for buses comes from a long time ago, from the early 90s,\" she says. \"I have always taken a picture of myself with buses and one random day I chose to post one on TikTok and it went viral, and now here we are.\" One of her videos, which is nominated for best video of the year, has been viewed amost 50 million times and Bemi now has collaborations with Burberry and Ikea. The mental health nurse has become one of TikTok's most unexpected success stories and she admits \"it's slightly overwhelming that everyone recognises me\".\"I get recognised in the streets sometimes and people say, 'Oh, hello, Bus Aunty.' I never thought people would be stopping me in my wildest dreams and it's taken some getting used to.\" \"To be nominated is amazing,\" she says of her TikTok Awards nod. \"If I'm nominated, it means I deserve to be here, and I really do love buses and love London and hopefully that shows.\" She's also proud to represent a different side of the app's community. \"You're never too old,\" she says firmly. \"I would never have thought I could do TikTok and be nominated for awards, but here I am, having only posted for just over a year.\"Never give up on your dream because what I love about London has got me here.\"Jack Edwards Jack EdwardsIf TikTok has a resident librarian, it's Jack Edwards, who has built a devoted following by sharing his love of reading. But he says his journey into social media stardom began with rejection.\"It was lockdown and I was looking for a job in publishing and no-one wanted to hire me,\" he recalls. \"My inbox was snorkelling in a sea of rejection and every email started with the word unfortunately.\"So I started talking about the books I was reading on social media.\"What began as a side project quickly turned into a full-time career, and Edwards ended up leaving the job he'd eventually secured in publishing. He says his advice to would-be creators is finding what makes their content personal.\"You have so many interests,\" he explains. \"If you were to create a Venn diagram of them all, the crossover in the middle is what you should make content about. For me, the cross-section is books, travel and pop culture.\"Edwards adds that he's careful about how much of himself he reveals to his audience. \"I talk about the books and art I love, but never the people I love,\" he says. \"But of course when you talk about books, you end up talking about everything from trauma, to politics, to sexuality.\"That openness has seen him create a community that stretches far beyond the screen.\"People say, 'Hi' in the street and it's the best thing ever. We have a mini book club right there on the pavement, an instant Jane Austen love-fest, and I know it's so strange but honestly it's really special for me.\"Still, internet fame brings its odd moments. \"Sometimes you get a message saying, 'Oh, hi, I just saw you at the urinal,'\" he laughs. \"Being spotted in those kinds of places never gets normal.\"",

    "body": "A  fourth Metropolitan Police officer has been fired for gross misconduct following a BBC Panorama investigation.PC Jason Sinclair-Birt was secretly filmed \"boasting about and revelling in the use of force\" on a detainee.He was dismissed without notice, after the hearing found he had given a \"false account\" of the incident to the undercover reporter for \"comedic effect\".On Thursday, three other Met Police officers were dismissed after accelerated misconduct hearings following the investigation. Setting out the case, James Berry KC, representing the Met, said: \"The Panorama footage demonstrates PC Sinclair-Birt boasted about and revelled in the use of force, and what he was describing was an excessive use of force, on a detainee.\"In the undercover footage, played to the panel, Mr Sinclair-Birt was seen describing the arrest saying he \"whacked....the back of his legs trying to get him to drop to the floor\".He went on to say, \"there's definitely a little bit of red mist there\".The officer was seen smiling during the incident, which the Met said indicated a \"troubling lack of remorse or concern for a member of the public\".The hearing was told the conduct of the officer breached the Met's standards of professional behaviour and the conduct amounted to gross misconduct.Mr Sinclair-Birt denied the allegation against him, but accepted he made the comments which appeared in the programme.In his statement, he said the comments made to the undercover reporter were \"empty words and not a true account of the underlying incident\".He said he was \"embellishing the account of an actual stop and search and he was doing so for comedic effect\".The hearing was played body-worn footage from the stop and search which took place in July 2022, and showed Mr Sinclair-Birt did not use his baton during the incident.The panel was told Mr Sinclair-Birt used \"lawful and proportionate force\" throughout the arrest to get the detainee to sit down.Giving his decision Chair Commander Jason Prins said: \"The officer has chosen to share a false account which revelled in the use of force.He added: \"In my view the false account was meant to be taken at face value.\"Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the Met was \"grateful\" for Panorama's investigation but criticised the BBC for waiting too long to disclose unaired footage of the officers. Sir Mark said it was \"extremely frustrating\" that the delays had resulted in adjournment applications and \"unnecessary complications\". Friday's scheduled hearing for Sgt Clayton Robinson will now take place on 28 October. Three others have been adjourned to a later date. The misconduct process was launched after the Panorama programme was aired on 1 October. An undercover BBC reporter heard officers at Charing Cross police station threatening to shoot immigrants, dismissing claims of rape, and using excessive force on detainees. On Thursday, Sgt Joe McIlvenny, PC Philip Neilson and PC Martin Borg faced expedited misconduct hearings over the footage. All three denied allegations of gross misconduct but accepted they made the comments aired in the programme.Chair of the panel, Cdr Jason Prins, described the conduct of the officers as a \"disgrace\".Ten former and current police officers at Charing Cross station are facing accelerated misconduct hearings over footage of the investigation.

    "body": "Manhunt after jailed Epping hotel asylum seeker mistakenly released4 hours agoAndré Rhoden-Paul, Shivani Chaudhari and Ellena CruseVideo appears to show mistakenly released hotel asylum seeker in ChelmsfordPolice have launched a manhunt after a former asylum seeker who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl was mistakenly released from prison.Ethiopian national Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, was jailed for 12 months over the attack in Epping, Essex, last month. Prison sources said Kebatu was meant to be sent to an immigration detention centre from HMP Chelmsford ahead of a planned deportation. An investigation has been launched by the Prison Service, and an officer has been removed from discharging duties while it takes place.Essex Police said \"fast-paced inquiries\" showed that he boarded a London-bound train at Chelmsford station. Justice Secretary David Lammy said he was \"appalled\" and \"livid on behalf of the public that Kebatu is at large\". Speaking to the media, Lammy said Essex Police, the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police were working together on the case.\"Let's be clear Kebatu committed a nasty sexual assault involving a young child and a woman,\" he said. \"And for those reasons this of course is very serious.\"He added he has asked for a \"full and immediate investigation\" into the release of Kebatu, who he described as a \"dangerous individual\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Kebatu \"must be caught and deported for his crimes\".Essex PoliceKebatu was sentenced to 12 months in prisonA Prison Service spokesperson said: \"We are urgently working with police to return an offender to custody following a release in error at HMP Chelmsford.\"Public protection is our top priority, and we have launched an investigation into this incident.\"A spokesperson for Essex Police said at 12:57 it was informed by the prison services about \"an error\" to do with \"the release of an individual\". \"As a result of that, we have launched a search operation to locate them and are working closely with partner agencies,\" they added.\"These fast-paced inquiries have shown that the man boarded a London-bound train at Chelmsford Railway Station at 12:41.\"We understand the concern the public would have regarding this situation and can assure you we have officers working to urgently locate and detain him.\"Stuart Woodward/BBCEssex Police said the man had boarded a train heading into London at 12:41Kebatu's arrest had sparked protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, where he had been living.In September, Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu tried to kiss the teenage girl on a bench and made numerous sexually explicit comments on 7 July. The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her. He also sexually assaulted a woman who had offered to help him create a CV to find work. During the trial, Kebatu gave his date of birth as December 1986, making him 38, but court records suggested he was 41.In September, after being found guilty of five offences, he was sentenced to 12 months and given a five-year sexual harm prevention order, which banned him from approaching or contacting any female. He was also made to sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10  years.The court heard it was his \"firm wish\" to be deported.Watch: Bodycam footage shows Hadush Kebatu's arrestChelmsford's Liberal Democrat MP Marie Goldman called for a rapid public inquiry into how the mistaken release, first reported by The Sun, happened. \"This is utterly unacceptable and has potentially put my constituents in danger,\" she said. \"I expect answers from the Prison Service.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the \"entire system is collapsing under Labour\". \"Conservatives voted against Labour's prisoner release program because it was putting predators back on our streets,\" she said on X. \"But this man has only just been convicted. A level of incompetence that beggars belief.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"He is now walking the streets of Essex. Britain is broken.\"A report from His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service said 262 prisoners in England and Wales were released in error between April 2024 and March 2025, up from 115 in the previous 12 months.More on this story",

From the Epstein Files to the cost of living, Greene has been vocal in her criticism of the current administration.  It’s notable because MTG has been one of Trump’s most loyal allies and a powerful leader of the MAGA movement, and also because her interventions have been influential. \nSarah, Anthony and Marianna look back at Marjorie Taylor Greene’s rise and why she has been such an influential figure within Donald Trump’s MAGA base. \nAnd, Anthony’s in Tennessee for a special election where a House seat is being contested. We assess the Democratic party’s chances of winning this traditional Republican seat.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

    "body": "Second MP quits new left-wing Your Party group8 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterGetty ImagesA second MP has announced he is leaving Your Party, a new left-wing group set up by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former Labour MP Zarah Sultana.In a statement on social media, Iqbal Mohamed did not say why he was leaving but made reference to \"false allegations and smears made against me\".The Dewsbury and Batley MP said British politics needed \"a genuine, inclusive force for positive change\" and expressed the hope that Your Party could fulfil that role.Your Party has been approached for a comment.Mohamed's departure comes a week after Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain said he would be \"stepping away\" from Your Party, citing a \"toxic\" culture towards \"Muslim men\".Sultana announced in July that she was leaving Labour to set up a new party with Corbyn, saying it was time to challenge the \"broken\" Westminster system. However since then the group has been mired in factional in-fighting including a row over the handling of £800,000 of donations. Mohamed made reference to the internal tensions, saying in a statement: \"The many false allegations and smears made against me and others, and reported as fact without evidence, have been surprising and disappointing.\"However, I am confident that my colleagues and I have acted professionally, patiently, and in good faith throughout.\"He thanked those who had supported Your Party and wished them \"success in their future endeavours\".He said he would continue working with colleagues in the Independent Alliance, a grouping in Parliament made up of Corbyn and four other independent pro-Gaza MPs who were elected for the first time in the 2024 general election. Your Party, which is yet to form an official parliamentary group, is due to have its first conference on 29 November in Liverpool, where delegates will pick an official name and leadership model. Sultana is hosting what is being billed as \"Zarah's eve of conference Your Party rally\" before the event kicks off.The group had hoped to gain support from those on the left unhappy with the Labour government. However, it has lost ground in recent months to the Green Party, which has surged in the polls and gained tens of thousands of new members following the election of left-wing activist Zack Polanski as it leader.",

    "body": "7 hours agoKatie Razzall,Culture and Media Editor and George Bowden,Culture reporterA member of the BBC's board has resigned over what he says are \"governance issues\" at the top of the corporation.Shumeet Banerji also said in a letter that he was \"not consulted\" about the events leading up to the departures of the director general, Tim Davie, and BBC News chief executive, Deborah Turness.Banerji confirmed his resignation on Friday, the BBC said in a statement.BBC News has approached Banerji for comment.The BBC's two top executives resigned earlier in November as a result of the fallout over a Panorama episode that edited together parts of a 2021 speech by US President Donald Trump.Since then, concerns have been raised in some quarters about how the BBC board operates. The board is responsible for oversight and strategy of the corporation.In blaming governance issues, Banerji appears to have made a direct criticism of chairman Samir Shah and other members of the board.Banerji's resignation comes at a difficult time for the BBC, with Shah and board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson due to give evidence to the Culture Media and Sport Committee of MPs on Monday afternoon.Questions have already been raised in Parliament about political appointees on the BBC board (there are five including Shah and Gibb).They will likely be asked about claims, first made in a leaked document, that the BBC has \"systemic issues\" relating to coverage around, for example, the Israel-Gaza conflict and coverage of sex and gender. That was rejected by Turness and Davie.Written by Michael Prescott, who was previously an independent external advisor to the BBC's Editorial Standards Committee, the document was published by the Telegraph newspaper and also flagged the Panorama edit.The corporation has since acknowledged the edit gave \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" on the day of the riot at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021.In his speech on 6 January 2021, Trump said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, Trump said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme, Trump: A Second Chance?, the edited clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Trump has threatened to sue over the programme, saying it defamed him. While the BBC has apologised, it has refused the president's demand for financial compensation.In his role on the board, Banerji was \"responsible for upholding and protecting the independence of the BBC by acting in the public interest and exercising independent judgement\", according to the corporation's website.Banerji, a non-executive board member since 2022, is the founder of an advisory and investment firm that specialises in technology companies. He previously led Booz & Company, a management consultancy firm.The 12-member board of the BBC is responsible for ensuring it delivers on its public service mission and it sets the strategic direction of the corporation, which is largely funded by licence-fee payers.Non-executive members hold the BBC's executive management to account. The board is chaired by Shah, a former documentary maker.A BBC spokesperson said: \"Shumeet Banerji today notified the BBC Board of his resignation. Mr Banerji's term on the Board as a non-executive director was due to end at the end of December and we thank him for his service.\"The search for a replacement is already well under way and we will update further in due course.\"",

    "body": "47 minutes agoSeveral of Saturday's papers lead with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's \"agonising choice\", as the Daily Mail writes, over whether to accept a US-backed peace deal with Russia. \"Trump turns the screw\" is the Mail's headline, which reports that Ukraine has been told it has until Thursday to accept the \"humiliating peace deal\". Zelensky warns his country is facing a choice between \"losing US support or forfeiting its dignity\" over the peace deal, according to the Financial Times. European allies are caught \"off-guard\" by the plan, which was drafted by aides of the US and Russian presidents, and say it amounts to \"capitulation\" to Moscow's demands. Zelensky says he will not reject the initiative \"out of hand\", but will \"offer alternatives\" in dialogue with Washington.In an address to the country, the Ukrainian president says his country faces its \"most difficult moment in history\", the Independent leads. Elsewhere, the paper reports on a \"remarkable\" 19-wicket first day of the Ashes in Perth, in which captain Ben Stokes led a \"ferocious fightback against Australia\". Trump confirms the Thursday deadline for Ukraine to respond to the peace plan, but the White House denies reports that the US could \"cut off\" intelligence sharing if Zelensky rejects it, the Times reports. European leaders, alongside the UK, are working to \"strengthen\" the deal, \"amid concern that Ukraine would be at risk of further attacks if it weakened its armed forces\". The Daily Mirror leads on the jailing for 10-and-a half years of an \"ally\" of Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, for accepting pro-Russia bribes. Former Reform UK in Wales leader Nathan Gill, whom the paper describes as a \"former party bigwig\", took up to £40,000 from tycoon Oleg Voloshyn for \"making pro-Russian speeches\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is urging Farage to \"root out links between Reform UK and Russia\" following the conviction of Gill, the Guardian reports. The paper says the government believes Reform UK is \"vulnerable\" to criticism that Farage and his allies have been \"too pro-Russia\". Police have said there was no link to Farage in their investigation into Gill.The Conservative Party would retain just 14 seats if an election was called now, according to internal party polling leaked to the Telegraph. An insider tells the paper that the party faces an \"existential threat\" from Reform UK, which the poll forecasts would win a 46-seat majority. Another source says the Tories are at risk of being \"consigned to the history books\". Challenges facing the Labour Party are the focus for the i Weekend, which reports that the PM is \"losing control\" of his party's MPs ahead of the Budget. Some Labour MPs have become \"a bit feral\" over uncertainty about Sir Keir's leadership, according to ex-advisers to Downing Street. Backbenchers and ministers are urging more help for \"hard-up people\" amid the \"cost of living crunch\". Sarah Ferguson is \"considering offers\" for a \"tell-all TV interview\", the first since her ex-husband Andrew Mountbatten Windsor relinquished his titles over links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Sun reports. Some US networks are \"willing to pay six-figure sums to secure the chat\" with the former Duchess of York. MPs are considering whether to establish an \"injury-in-service medal\" for police officers who are forced to quit after sustaining injuries during active duty, the Daily Express reports. Finally, the Daily Star leads on a boss who has mandated his staff to take time off to see their children's Christmas events - including pantos. \"Oh, yes he did,\" the paper writes.

    "body": "A grizzly bear is on the loose after attacking a school group in Canada, leaving 11 people injured, two critically.The incident happened on Thursday afternoon on a walking trail in the town of Bella Coola, in the province of British Columbia (BC). Residents have been warned to remain indoors while armed officers try to track down the animal. Four of the injured remain in hospital as of Friday afternoon, BC's Health Services Authority has said.A male teacher \"got the whole brunt of it\" and some children were hit with bear spray as the adults tried to fend off the animal, Veronica Schooner, a parent, told the Canadian Press.Ms Schooner said her 10-year-old son was part of the school group, though he was not attacked. \"He said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,\" she said, adding that \"he even felt its fur\".In a statement to the BBC, British Columbia Emergency Health Services said two people were critically injured, two more were seriously hurt, and seven others were treated at the scene.Patients had to be transported to a nearby airport so they could be airlifted to the closest hospital, officials said. The group were from Acwsalcta School, which is run by the indigenous Nuxalk Nation, in the town located 700km (435 miles) north-west of Vancouver. \"Officers are armed\" the Nation wrote on Facebook. \"Remain indoors and off the highway.\" \"It's hard to know what to say during this very difficult time. We are so grateful for our team and our students.\" The Nation's officials have temporarily shut the school, offering counselling services.",

    "body": "7 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterSir Keir Starmer has said it will take time to turn the country around, telling voters to judge him at the next general election.The prime minister told the BBC his government had made \"good steps\", particularly on the cost-of-living, but \"we need to do more\".It comes after a dismal few weeks for the PM, who has faced growing criticism and speculation he could face a leadership challenge.The government is also facing a difficult Budget next week, when the chancellor is widely expected to increase taxes.In an interview with the BBC's Chris Mason in Johannesburg, South Africa, where the PM is attending the G20 summit of world leaders, Sir Keir was challenged over why some opinion polls suggest he is the most unpopular prime minister since modern polling began.\"We won an election last year on the manifesto that said we would change the country after 14 years of failure,\" he said.\"I always said that would take time because you can't turn around 14 years of failure in just 12 months or 16 months. \"I'm very conscious that we have to deliver on three things above all else. The first is making sure people feel better off, and that's bearing down on the cost-of-living, making sure the public services are better, in particular the NHS, which is why we put record investment in the NHS, and making sure people feel more safe and secure. \"And I have no doubt that I will rightly be judged against that at the next election.\"Sir Keir has insisted he will lead Labour into the next general election, which is not due until 2029, although he could choose to call one earlier.Last week, allies of the prime minister told journalists that he would fight any attempts by Labour MPs to remove him, with Health Secretary Wes Streeting among those named as plotting a leadership challenge.However, the attempt to strengthen Sir Keir's position appeared to backfire as it brought talk of threats to his leadership into the open and sparked further criticism of the PM.Streeting denied he was planning to challenge Sir Keir and hit out at a \"toxic\" culture within No 10, although he said he did not think the PM was behind the briefings.Sir Keir has insisted the attacks against Streeting had not come from Downing Street.Meanwhile, the PM has faced claims from the the Conservatives his government's Budget is already unravelling, after the chancellor backed away from raising income tax rates - a move which would break an election pledge. Asked if he was frustrated the achievements of his government were being \"drowned out\", Sir Keir told the BBC: \"Every minute that is spent talking about anything other than cost-of-living is a wasted minute in my book.\"The next major test for Sir Keir will come in May, when Labour are braced for major losses in Scottish, Welsh and English local elections.However, with the prospect of a tricky Budget next week, there has been speculation a leadership challenge could come sooner.Anyone mounting a leadership bid would need the backing of at least 80 Labour MPs.Only a small number of Labour MPs have publicly called for Sir Keir to be replaced but many more have raised concerns about his leadership privately.On Friday, Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome, who is on the left of the party, joined Labour backbencher Clive Lewis in calling for a new leader.\"Even if Keir Starmer had a radical change of direction, I don't think people would believe him. And I don't think people around him would allow that to happen,\" she said in an interview with former Labour candidate Ali Milani.\"So I think there has to be a change in leadership, a change in personnel, of the people in Number 10, and a completely different direction for the party.\"Earlier this week Rachael Maskell, who was recently readmitted to Labour's parliamentary party after a four-month suspension for leading a rebellion over proposed welfare cuts, suggested the PM should consider his position if next week's Budget does not deliver.\"Ultimately, the prime minister needs to look in the mirror and say 'Do I have the skills at this particular time in our history to lead the Labour Party?',\" the Labour MP for York Central told LBC.Challenged over her comments and whether he was the right man to lead the country, Sir Keir said he had proven his doubters wrong in the past by changing the Labour Party and winning a landslide election victory last year.\"Now people will say to me, 'It's not possible to change the country for the better.' I say it is,\" he told the BBC.\"I'm optimistic about the future of our country and I know that we can turn it around after 14 years of failure under the Conservatives.\"",

    "body": "While cleaning out their late mother's California attic last Christmas, three brothers made a life-changing discovery under a pile of faded newspapers: one of the first Superman comics ever made. An original copy of the June 1939 first edition on the Man of Steel's adventures, it was in a remarkably pristine condition.Now it has become the highest-priced comic book ever sold, fetching $9.12m (£7m) at auction.  Texas-based Heritage Auctions, which hosted Thursday's sale, called it the \"pinnacle of comic collecting\".The brothers found six comic books, including Superman #1, in the attic underneath a stack of newspapers inside a cardboard box and surrounded by cobwebs in 2024, Heritage said in a press release. They waited a few months before contacting the auction house, but once they did, Heritage Auctions vice-president Lon Allen visited them in San Francisco within days, according to the auction house. The brothers, who have chosen to withhold their names, are \"in their 50s and 60s, and their mom had always told them she had an expensive comics collection but never showed them\", Mr Allen said in Heritage's press release. \"It's a twist on the old 'Mom threw away my comics' story.\"Their mother had held on to the comic books since she and her brother bought them between the Great Depression and the beginning of World War Two, Heritage said.Mr Allen added that the cool northern California climate was perfect for preserving old paper. \"If it had been in an attic here in Texas, it would have been ruined,\" he said.That helped CGC, a large third-party comics grading service, give this copy of Superman #1 a 9.0 rating on a 10-point scale, topping the previous record of 8.5. And at its sale price of over $9m, including buyer's premium, Superman #1 easily beat the previous highest-priced comic book ever sold by $3m. Action Comics No. 1, the 1938 work that first introduced Superman, sold for $6m last year.The youngest brother said in Heritage's press release that the box had remained forgotten in the back of attic. \"As the years unfolded, life brought about a series of losses and changes,\" he said. \"The demands of everyday survival took centre stage, and the box of comics, once set aside with care and intention, was forgotten. Until last Christmas.\"He added: \"This isn't simply a story about old paper and ink. This was never just about a collectible. \"This is a testament to memory, family and the unexpected ways the past finds its way back to us.\"",

    "body": "23 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondentgettyThe \"swarm\" of tens of thousands of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini earlier this year was triggered by molten rock pumping through an underground channel over three months, scientists have discovered.They used physics and artificial intelligence to work out exactly what caused the more than 25,000 earthquakes, which travelled about 20km (12 miles) horizontally through the Earth's crust. They used each of the tremors as virtual sensors, then used artificial intelligence to analyse patterns associated with them.One of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, said combining physics and machine learning in this way could help forecast volcanic eruptions.What happened in Santorini?The seismic activity started to stir beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in January 2025. The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt.Many tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956.The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm.The team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor.The researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors. Lead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something.\"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"Does this mean the Santorini unrest is over?For now, the researchers say, it appears to be over.\"The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,\" explained Dr Hicks. \"We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust.\"Volcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that.And these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe.\"Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,\" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, \"that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause\".",

At least 10 students were injured in a stampede as they tried to leave Dhaka University on Friday.\"We have never experienced an earthquake this powerful in the last five years,\" said the country's environmental adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan.At least three people were killed when a railing and debris fell from a five-storey building in Dhaka's Armanitola area, deputy police commissioner Mallik Ahsan Uddin Sami said.Nitai Chandra De Sarkar, director of the department's monitoring division, said 461 people have been reported injured across the country, including 252 in the Gazipur district, north of Dhaka.Sarker told the BBC: \"Our main task at the moment is to assess casualties and damage. We are not yet seeing the challenge of rescue from the rubble or debris management at that level.\"Bengali Sadman Sakib told Reuters news agency: \"I have never felt such tremor in my 30 years of life. We were at the office when the furniture started shaking.\"We rushed down the stairs on the street and saw other people on the road already.\"A student called Abdullah, who was sleeping at the time of the earthquake, told Reuters the \"whole building was shaking\".Abdul Goni/Anadolu via Getty ImagesTremors were felt in eastern Indian states bordering Bangladesh, but there were no reports of major damage.The earthquake caused Ireland's second cricket test match in Bangladesh to stop temporarily.Coaches and players not involved gathered at the boundary, while those in the stands took shelter. The game was stopped for three minutes but play soon resumed.Ireland's head coach Heinrich Malan said: \"I've been involved in a couple of earthquakes from my time living in New Zealand.\"It's never a nice feeling and you're trying to understand what is happening in the moment around you, but also the bigger impacts about where the earthquake struck.\"Everything stood still for a couple of minutes and we got back to business, but we're thinking of everyone and hoping there wasn't too much damage done.\"",

    "body": "Luke Littler won his first match as world number one to progress at the Players Championship Finals, while Gian van Veen produced a second stunning comeback victory against Luke Humphries in the space of a month.Less than a month after upsetting Humphries in the final of the European Championship, Van Veen fought back from three legs down to defeat the defending champion 6-5 in Minehead.Humphries flew out of the traps with checkouts of 145, 40 and 83, but Van Veen came roaring back with finishes of 161 and 81 on bullseye.The former world number one steadied himself before losing throw at 4-4, before two Van Veen misses allowed Humphries to set up a deciding leg.Van Veen's hard work looked to be in vain as he missed five match darts, but Humphries was equally wasteful and fell to a fourth consecutive loss to the Dutchman.It has not been the best month for Humphries, who earlier this month surrendered his world number one crown to Littler when he lost to 'The Nuke' in the Grand Slam of Darts final.Meanwhile, Littler breezed into the second round with a 6-1 victory against Jeffrey de Graaf.After being introduced to the crowd as world number one for the first time in his career, Littler averaged 104.46 to continue his hunt for a first Players Championship title.\"It felt absolutely amazing, probably one of the best feelings I've had, to be world champion and world number one at the same time - but there is more to come,\" Littler told ITV Sport.\"This is the title I haven't won yet. Last year I came up short against Luke Humphries so I want to tick this one off.\"The 18-year-old will face Ross Smith in the second round after the Englishman saw off Ryan Meikle 6-1.Top seed Gerwyn Price was not at his best against Max Hopp - missing six darts when trying to take a 5-2 lead - but the German failed to capitalise and Price won 6-2.Stephen Bunting notched a routine 6-2 victory over Ritchie Edhouse, before Nathan Aspinall dispatched Karel Sedlacek 6-3.Four-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld limped out with a 6-3 defeat by Krzysztof Ratajski.Rob Cross, Dave Chisnall and Jonny Clayton were all beaten in the afternoon session, with James Hurrell defeating former finalist Clayton with a 99.2 average.World number six James Wade progressed with a comfortable 6-3 win over Mickey Mansell.",

    "body": "3 hours agoGuy DelauneyBalkans correspondentSerbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, has described an allegation that he was involved in \"sniper tourism\" during the siege of Sarajevo as a \"lie\".It follows a complaint submitted to Italian prosecutors by a Croatian journalist, who claimed that video from the 1990s and subsequent testimony by Bosnian officials showed that Vucic was a \"war volunteer\" with Bosnian-Serb forces at positions overlooking Sarajevo.Speaking at a UK-Western Balkans business conference in Belgrade, Vucic said he had \"never killed anyone, wounded anyone, or done anything similar\". He added that he had \"never held a sniper rifle in my life\".Pictures purporting to show him with such a weapon actually show him carrying a \"camera tripod\", he said.He said the Croatian journalist was trying to \"present me as a monster, as an inhuman, as someone who not only has no emotions, but is a cold-blooded murderer\".More than 11,000 people died during the brutal four-year siege of Sarejevo. Yugoslavia was torn apart by war and the city was surrounded by Serb forces and subjected to constant shelling and sniper fire.Italian prosecutors opened an investigation earlier this month into allegations that wealthy foreigners had paid to shoot at civilians during the siege of Sarajevo. That followed a complaint by an Italian writer who had seen the 2022 Slovenian documentary film, Sarajevo Safari, which was the source of the allegations.Italians and others are alleged by writer Ezio Gavazzeni to have paid large sums to go on \"sniper safaris\" and shoot at civilians in the besieged city of Sarajevo during the war in the early 1990s.The claims by Croatian journalist Domagoj Margetic that Vucic had volunteered for a Bosnian Serb militia at a location above Sarajevo had earlier also been strongly denied by  Vucic's spokesperson Suzana Vasiljevic.She said in comments carried by the Times newspaper that the allegations were \"a textbook case of malicious disinformation, purpose-built to erode the institutional credibility of the Republic of Serbia and its president. This narrative is devoid of factual grounding and is operationally crafted to generate reputational damage.\"At the time Vucic had been working as a journalist and translator in nearby Pale \"without any contact with military structures or operational activities\", she said.She added: \"President Vucic did not participate in combat activities, did not use weapons, and had no role in any wartime operations.\"Similar allegations about \"human hunters\" from abroad have been made several times over the years. However, the chief prosecutor at the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals in The Hague has told the BBC that his organisation has no information about the allegations. Bosnia's war crimes prosecutor received a complaint in 2022, but has not issued any indictment. UK special forces troops who served in Sarajevo during the siege have told the BBC the allegations are an \"urban myth\".",

    "body": "'Prolific' rapist who drugged women gets life termJust nowMetropolitan PoliceChao Xu is believed to have sexually assaulted more women and police are urging them to come forwardA serial rapist thought to be \"one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time\" who drugged, raped and secretly filmed his victims has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 14 years.Chao Xu, a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to 24 sexual offences, including sexual assault, voyeurism and upskirting against six women between November 2021 and June 2025.Sentencing Xu at Woolwich Crown Court, Judge Christopher Grout described him as a \"sexual predator\" and \"an incredibly dangerous man\".One of the women he targeted told the court that she would \"never be able to forget\" what Xu did to her. Police are appealing for any more of his victims to come forward.Detectives believe Xu hosted networking events at his flat in south-east London where he spiked drinks and raped some of the women who attended. They found videos on his devices in which he had recorded himself raping women who seemed incapacitated or unconscious.He set up secret cameras in an air-freshener and in a speaker to film people showering, using the toilet and getting changed.Police found that he had made \"compilations\" from his voyeuristic activities, editing together recordings of him raping women who were incapacitated.'Out of control'One victim told the court: \"I don't think I will ever be the same person again.\"I am afraid that I will never be able to forget what that man did to me and how he stole the person I was.\"I fear that I may have introduced Xu to other women who may have suffered the same fate as me. I carry that too.\"I felt out of control and so very alone. I have been told that the drugs he used on me are for animals.\"She described how despite being drugged she was conscious enough to know what was happening to her.\"The terrifying thing had been that I couldn't open my eyes and mouth. \"Nor could I move my body. I felt everything that he did, pulling my dress off and touching me intimately. I was horrified.\"I could just see through my eyes every now and then that he had his phone out. I just couldn't understand why he was doing that to me.\"He was supposed to be a friend.\"",

    "body": "50 minutes agoChris Mason,Political editor and Kate Whannel,Political reporterHouse of CommonsChancellor Rachel Reeves has decided against raising income tax rates at the Budget later this month.In recent weeks, Reeves had given strong indications she would increase the tax - a move that would have broken Labour's election manifesto promise not to raise \"the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax\".However, as first reported in the Financial Times, the chancellor has decided against taking the step, partly due to better-than-expected economic forecasts.Instead of raising income tax rates, the chancellor could opt to freeze or lower income tax thresholds, the salary levels at which the various rates kick in.Other taxes could also be raised and government sources maintain they are still having to make what they call \"tough choices\".They also stress that the move was not related to the turbulence in recent days relating to the prime minister's future.Ahead of every Budget, the chancellor submits their plans to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which then make forecasts on whether the government will spend more money than it raises and whether the economy will grow or shrink.A proposal to increase income tax rates was sent to the OBR as an option earlier this month to be costed, to help fill what was then a £30bn gap in the public finances, mainly caused by a downgrade to productivity.Newer assessments from the OBR appear to have increased the projected strength of wages and tax receipts in the coming years and offset several billion pounds of that gap, taking it closer to £20bn.In addition to the more positive forecasts, it also the case that many Labour MPs were nervous about breaking an election promise, something that would have influenced the chancellor's decision.Government borrowing costs initially rose in reaction to the reports but fell back after further reports that the financial hole would not be as big as first thought.Chancellors never comment publicly on what will be in their Budgets but do prepare the ground - also known as \"pitch rolling\" - for any big changes that might be coming.And in the months running up to this year's financial statement, Labour ministers have repeatedly given strong indications that income tax rates would go up. In October, the prime minister declined to repeat his previous promises not to increase key taxes, despite being asked to do so by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at Prime Minister's Questions. Earlier this month, Reeves took the unusual step of making a pre-Budget speech to warn about the need for \"necessary choices\" and said everyone would have to \"contribute\". And on Monday, she told BBC Radio 5 live: \"It would, of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.\"If the chancellor has decided not to increase income tax rates, she will have to explore other ways to raise money, in order to meet her self-imposed rules on debt and borrowing while filling a hole in the public finances of around £20bn. She could still opt to extend a freeze on income tax and National Insurance (NI) thresholds. The freeze was introduced in April 2023 and was due to expire in 2028.  An extension of the freeze would not break the strict letter of the manifesto promise but would mean income tax bills go up for some, as more people would be pulled above the income threshold at which point they either start paying tax and NI or qualify for higher tax rates. It would also mean Reeves reversing her stance from last year's Budget, when she told MPs: \"I have come to the conclusion that extending the threshold freeze would hurt working people. It would take more money out of their payslips.\"\"From 2028-29, personal tax thresholds will be uprated in line with inflation once again.\"The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates extending the freeze by two years could raise £8.3bn a year and would mean someone on the minimum wage would be liable to pay income tax if they worked just 18 hours a week. Another option would be to lower the thresholds which would raise more money than simply extending the freeze. There have been reports the Treasury is also considering other measures including a new tax on electric vehicles and higher taxes on gambling companies. In its 2024 general election manifesto, Labour promised that it would \"not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, or VAT\".Breaking the manifesto promise would mean difficult questions for Labour ministers and MPs ahead of elections in Scotland, Wales and England. At the start of the month, the party's newly-elected deputy leader Lucy Powell, said: \"It is really important we stand by the promises that we were elected on and that we do what we said we would do.\"Health Secretary Wes Streeting said it was \"really important that we keep our promises and that we stand by our manifesto\".He added that talk about tax rises demonstrated how \"challenging\" the situation in public finances was, but that it was \"wise to stop speculating\"  and \"wait for the Budget\".Kemi Badenoch said: \"It's good if they aren't going to increase income taxes, but the truth is they shouldn't be increasing any taxes at all.\"I've never seen a government do this in the run up to a budget. I have never seen this level of chaos, this level of irresponsibility.\"\"Reeves must guarantee no new taxes on work, businesses, homes or pensions - and she should go further by abolishing stamp duty.\"Liberal Democrat Business spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: \"The chancellor gave a press conference to trail her income tax hikes. \"She must come before the British public today, unroll that particular pitch and come clean on what on earth is going on at the Treasury.\"The SNP social justice secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said the UK government was in \"complete disarray\".A Downing Street spokesman did not comment on whether income tax would rise but said: \"The chancellor was very clear about addressing the challenges this country faces and her priorities in addressing those challenges – all of that stands.\"One of the objectives of the budget is to build more resilient public finances with the headroom to withstand global turbulence and to give businesses the confidence to invest.\"",

    "body": "TikTok star HSTikkyTokky handed suspended sentence36 minutes agoChristian Fuller,South East and Jadzia Samuel,South EastGetty ImagesHSTikkyTokky, real name Harrison Sullivan, has a large following on social mediaTikTok influencer HSTikkyTokky has been sentenced for crashing a McLaren supercar and then spending nearly a year on the run from police.The 24-year-old, whose name is Harrison Sullivan, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving without insurance.Sullivan had been wanted by Surrey Police in connection with the crash in Virginia Water in March last year. He failed to attend court in November and later posted social media videos from Qatar, Dubai, Thailand and Spain, but was arrested in October.At Staines Magistrates' Court, Sullivan was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to undertake 300 hours of unpaid work.He was also sentenced to a three-month curfew and ordered to be electronically monitored, complete an extended driving test after two years and undertake 30 days of rehabilitation.The judge described Sullivan's actions as a \"deliberate decision to ignore the rules of the road\".However, she added that she would not hand out a harsher sentence in order to set an example to his large social media following.In a letter to the court, Sullivan said he was \"ashamed\" of his actions.\"I understand that if I am acting in a dangerous way, this could influence others to do the same,\" he said.\"Spreading a positive message and helping people less fortunate than myself, that's what makes me the happiest.\"Surrey PoliceSullivan was driving a purple McLaren on the A30 when it crashed, the court heardSullivan was driving a purple McLaren at more than 71mph on the single-carriageway A30, which has a 40mph speed limit, when it crashed with another vehicle, the court heard.He has amassed more than a million followers across all social media platforms.His content often shows his lavish lifestyle, with him on nights out with young revellers.Witnesses to the crash said Sullivan was \"in a supercar going extremely fast\", with one stating that he was travelling \"at least 100mph or more\" before the collision.Sullivan was extradited from Spain to the UK after being arrested on unrelated matters, the court was told.A fresh hearing will take place in January next year to decide how much Sullivan must pay to Surrey Police and the Crown Prosecution Service for the additional costs involved in pursuing him abroad.The prosecution has applied for £18,049.47 to be paid to Surrey Police for a chartered flight to bring Sullivan back to the UK.Sullivan was set to appear in a Louis Theroux documentary for Netflix exploring the impact of online misogyny on young boys.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoSimon JackBusiness EditorGetty ImagesUS investment group RedBird Capital has pulled out of a deal to buy the Daily and Sunday Telegraph for £500m.RedBird had a previous attempt to buy the Telegraph rebuffed by politicians as it was majority-funded by Abu Dhabi's IMI group - which is owned in turn by the Abu Dhabi royal family.A law change meant that foreign sovereign wealth funds could take a maximum stake of 15% in newspapers or periodicals.The new bid complied with that rule, but it is understood that the government intended to submit the deal to regulatory review.A spokesman for the group said: \"RedBird has today withdrawn its bid for the Telegraph Media Group.\"We remain fully confident that the Telegraph and its world-class team have a bright future ahead of them and we will work hard to help secure a solution which is in the best interests of employees and readers.\"Sources close to Redbird insisted that they were confident that the bid would have passed a government review process, but cited negative articles toward the bid from the current Telegraph newsroom as a factor in shelving their interest.RedBird itself has faced questions over the extent of investment it has received from China and Gulf based investors.An IMI Group spokesperson said its \"priority has been to end the uncertainty and secure the Telegraph's long-term success\" and that it remained in contact with \"interested parties\" on a deal.It said it remained committed to completing a sale, while co-operating with the government and regulators. RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale had planned to expand the Telegraph's reach and subscriber base in the US, believing there to be a gap in the market.Among other investments, RedBird Capital owns the Italian football team AC Milan.The Daily Telegraph has been in limbo for over two years, when the Redbird IMI consortium paid off the debts of the Telegraph's previous owners, the Barclay family, hoping to take eventual ownership of the newspapers.",

This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

But not Gavin and Stacey, she said.The King also met TikToker Lewis Leigh, whose parents Neil and Kerry Anne from Merthyr Tydfil said they were feeling \"really proud\" of their son.\"We are so proud that he will be recognised for some of the hard work he's done with cancer awareness and school visits,\" said Neil.Watch: Gun salutes in Green Park and Tower of London mark King's birthdayAndrew Lewis, head teacher at Gwaunfarren Primary School said pupils were \"super excited\" to see the visit. \"We broke the news at the start of the week.

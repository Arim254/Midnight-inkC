    "body": "Russia has tested the nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, Moscow's top general has said.\"We have launched a multi-hour flight of a nuclear-powered missile and it covered a 14,000km (8,700-mile) distance, which is not the limit,\" Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov told President Vladimir Putin in a televised meeting.The low-flying experimental weapon, first announced in 2018, has been hailed as having a potentially unlimited range and the ability to evade missile defences.Western experts have previously cast doubt over missile's strategic value and Russian claims of having successfully tested it.Putin said a \"final successful test\" of the weapon had been held in 2023, but the claim could not be independently verified. Of at least 13 known tests, only two had partial success since 2016, according to an arms control campaign group.Gen Gerasimov said the missile was in the air for 15 hours during the test on 21 October. He said the missile's vertical and horizontal manoevreing were tested and were found to be up to specification, according to Russia's Tass news agency.\"Therefore, it demonstrated high capabilities to bypass missile and air defence systems,\" Tass reported Gen Gerasimov as saying.The missile's utility has been the subject of intense debate in military and defences circles since it was first announced in 2018.A 2021 report by the US Air Force's National Air and Space Intelligence Center concluded: \"A nuclear-powered cruise missile would give Russia a unique weapon with intercontinental range capability.\"However, as the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) noted the same year, Russia faces significant challenges in making the weapon viable.\"Its entry into Russia's inventory arguably hinges not only on overcoming the considerable technical challenge of ensuring the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit,\" IISS analysts wrote.\"There have been numerous flight-test failures, and an accident resulting in several deaths.\"A Russian military journal quoted in the IISS report claims the missile has a range of between 10,000 and 20,000km, allowing \"the missile to be based anywhere in Russia and still be able to reach targets in the continental US\".The same journal also says the missile can fly as low as 50 to 100 metres above ground, making it difficult for air defences to intercept.The missile, code-named Skyfall by Nato, is thought to be powered by a nuclear reactor, which is supposed to activate after solid fuel rocket boosters have launched it into the air.An investigation by news agency Reuters last year identified a facility 475km (295 miles) north of Moscow as the likely launch site of the weapon.Using satellite imagery from August 2024, analyst Decker Eveleth told Reuters he had identified nine horizontal launch pads under construction at the site.",

    "body": "June Lockhart, best known for her roles in TV shows Lassie and Lost in Space, has died aged 100. The veteran actress died of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica on Thursday, a family spokesman told US media.Lockhart first shot to prominence on Broadway in the 1940s, picking up a newcomer Tony Award for her role in For Love or Money, before transitioning into film and TV. The daughter of famed character actors Kathleen and Gene Lockhart, her standout performance was as mother Ruth Martin in the TV series Lassie, for which she received an Emmy nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role in a drama series.Born in New York City on 25 June 1925, Lockhart made her screen debut aged 13 in the 1938 film A Christmas Carol alongside her parents.She then took up a number of supporting roles through the 1940s, before being the top-billed star of the film She-Wolf of LondonOn Broadway, her performance in For Love or Money was described by the New York Times at the time as \"enchanting\".Her performance saw her receive a Tony Award, a Donaldson Award, a Theatre World Award and the Associated Press citation for Woman of the Year for Drama.From the late 1950s into the 1960s, her time was occupied by starring in 200 episodes of Lassie, after which she had guest appearances on The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Alfred Hitchcock Hour and Magnum P.I.Many remember her for her role in the science-fiction serial Lost in Space, in which she played the warm mother of space explorers from 1965 until 1968.In 2021, Lockhart made a cameo in a Netflix remake, providing the voice of Alpha Control.\"She was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,\" spokesman and friend of 40 years Lyle Gregory told US media.\"It was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.\"She is survived by her two daughters including Anne Lockhart, who is also an actress.",

    "body": "11 minutes agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterReutersThe US and China have agreed the framework of a potential trade deal that will be discussed when their respective leaders meet later this week, the US treasury secretary has said.Scott Bessent told the BBC's US news partner CBS that this included a \"final deal\" on TikTok's US operations and a deferral on China's tightened rare earth minerals controls.He also said he did not anticipate the 100% tariff on Chinese goods threatened by US President Donald Trump coming into force, while China will resume substantial soybean purchases from the US.Both nations are seeking to avoid further escalation in a trade war between the world's two largest economies.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to hold talks on Thursday in South Korea.Bessent met senior Chinese trade officials on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, which Trump is also attending as part of a tour of Asia. Beijing said they had \"constructive\" discussions.Bessent said the countries had \"reached a substantial framework for the two leaders\", adding: \"The tariffs will be averted.\"The Chinese government said in a statement that both negotiating teams \"reached a basic consensus on arrangements to address their respective concerns\".\"Both sides agreed to further finalise specific details,\" they added.Trump's tariff tacticsSince Trump re-entered the White House, he has imposed and threatened sweeping tariffs on imports from overseas on various countries, arguing that the policy would help boost US manufacturing and jobs. The introduction of tariffs has resulted in many countries, including the UK, agreeing new deals with the US.But the steepest levies he has threatened have been levelled at China. Beijing has hit back with measures of its own, though the two agreed to hold off implementing the levies while pursuing a trade deal.However, earlier this month Trump said he would impose an additional 100% tarriff on Chinese goods from November in response to China tightening restrictions on export of rare earths - materials essential to the production of many electronics. The US president accused Beijing of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\".China processes around 90% of the world's rare earths, which go into everything from solar panels to smartphones, making supply of them to US manufacturers a key bargaining chip.The last time Beijing tightened export controls - after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods early this year - there was an outcry from many US firms reliant on the materials.China will \"delay that for a year while they re-examine it\", Bessent told a different news show, This Week, on Sunday.Another issue of contention is soybeans, of which China is the world's biggest buyer. As the trade war began heating up, China halted all orders, hurting US farmers.Bessent hinted the boycott may soon be over but refused to give details.\"I'm actually a soybean farmer, so I have felt this pain too... I think we have addressed the farmers' concerns,\" he said on This Week.\"I believe when the announcement of the deal with China is made public that our soybean farmers will feel really good about what's going on for this season and the coming seasons for several years.\"TikTok deal done?Bessent also said a deal had been agreed on video-sharing platform TikTok's US arm, with Trump and Xi left to \"consummate that transaction on Thursday\".The US has sought to prise the app's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance over national security concerns.TikTok was previously told it had to sell its US operations or risk being shut down, but Trump has delayed implementing the ban four times to facilitate negotiations, and has extended the deadline again to December.The White House announced last month that US companies would control TikTok's algorithm and Americans would hold six of seven board seats for the app's US operations.While Trump initially called for TikTok to be banned during his first term, he has since changed course. He turned to the hugely popular platform to boost his support among young Americans during his successful 2024 presidential campaign.On Sunday, Washington also annouced that trade deals with Malaysia and Cambodia had been secured and framworks agreed with Thailand and Vietnam.",

    "body": "We will not 'be held to ransom' by striking doctors, says minister2 hours agoAmy WalkerBBCThe government will not \"be held to ransom\" by striking doctors, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said.A five-day walkout by resident doctors is due to take place between 14-19 November, in a long-running dispute over pay.Streeting told the BBC there was a deal available to increase the number of speciality training places and provide support for things like exam fees.But he said: \"I can't do that if I'm spending a quarter-of-a-billion pounds meeting the costs of strikes.\"The British Medical Association (BMA) has previously said disruption to patients was not something it took lightly but it could be avoided if the government accepted its proposals.In an interview on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Streeting said the strike action had \"little to no public support\", and would be \"inflicting more harm and delays to patients\".He added that the deal, which does not include negotiating on pay rises, remained on the table.But he told the programme: \"What we will not do, however, is be held to ransom and what I will not do is allow those costs of strikes to be inflicted on other NHS staff who are working constructively with us, or on patients in terms of the services that they receive.\"The strike - the 13th in the pay dispute since March 2023 - is expected to cause significant disruption, including in hospitals.The BMA and the government have been in dialogue throughout the summer and early autumn since the last walkout at the end of July, but talks broke down earlier this month.Streeting has maintained he would not negotiate on pay after resident doctors, the new name to junior doctors, received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years.Talks had instead focused on career progression, working conditions and out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees.But the union argues that resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account. They have also said they wanted the government to address what they say is a shortage of jobs after the second year of training when resident doctors move into speciality training.This year there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs at this stage, although some will have been doctors from abroad.Streeting said the current government offer, which would provide additional training places and help with out-of-pocket expenses, would \"be a win-win scenario where together we motor ahead with the progress we're making in the NHS\".The BMA has previously said in a statement that disruption to patients \"is not something we take lightly\" but added that it could be avoided if the government accepted its \"reasonable proposals for resolving these disputes\".Streeting also partly blamed previous industrial action for an increase in NHS waiting lists. Latest figures show about 6.26 million patients were waiting for treatments to be carried out at the end of August, up from 6.25 million patients at the end of July.\"We had industrial action by resident doctors, that had an impact and set us back, as I feared it would and said it would at the time,\" Streeting told the programme.\"We've also seen demand outstripping growth in activity.\" He added that he believed the NHS would \"begin to see improvement again on waiting lists in the coming months.\"",

    "body": "19 minutes agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterPA MediaHealth Secretary Wes Streeting has criticised Reform MP Sarah Pochin for what he called \"racist\" language after she complained about adverts being \"full of black people, full of Asian people\".The Runcorn and Helsby MP apologised for her remarks, which were made during a TalkTV phone-in on Saturday, saying they were \"phrased poorly\" but maintained that many adverts were \"unrepresentative of British society\".Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Streeting claimed Pochin had only said sorry \"because she's been caught and called out\".BBC News has contacted Reform to ask the party and Pochin for a response. Justice Secretary David Lammy called on the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to \"sack\" Pochin from the party for her \"mean, nasty and racist\" remarks.Lammy said he was \"disgusted\" by what she said, adding \"our country is so much better than this\".The Liberal Democrats have also called on Farage to suspend Pochin from the party.The row erupted after Pochin said she agreed with a caller on TalkTV  who complained about the \"demographics\" of advertising.Pochin said the viewer was \"absolutely right\" and \"it drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people\".She said \"it doesn't reflect our society\" and \"your average white person, average white family\" is not \"represented anymore\".Pochin blamed the situation on the \"woke liberati\" in the \"arty-farty world\".\"It might be fine inside the M25, but it's definitely not representative of the rest of the country,\" she said.In a social media post later on Saturday, Pochin said her comments \"were phrased poorly and I unreservedly apologise for any offence caused, which was not my intention\".She said she was intending to say the advertising industry had gone \"DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] mad\" and were now \"unrepresentative of British society as a whole\".In her statement, Pochin cited a Channel 4 study which found that the proportion of adverts featuring black people jumped after the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, from 37% in 2020 to 51% in 2022.\"Representation should reflect the diversity of modern Britain, but it should also be proportionate and inclusive of everyone,\" she said.On Sunday, Reform UK's head of policy Zia Yusuf said Pochin was \"right to apologise\" but said she was raising \"a very valid point we must be able to talk about\".Before Streeting's interview was broadcast, Yusuf told Sky News Pochin was \"a lovely person\" and her point had been \"statistically borne out by a Channel 4 study\".Streeting rejected her apology, saying she was \"only sorry because she was caught and called out and said the quiet bit out loud\".Asked about Pochin's comments, Streeting said: \"What she said was a disgrace, I think it was racist.\"What we have seen is a return of 1970s and 1980s-style racism I thought we had left in the history books. \"The only way we are going to defeat this racism is to call it out and confront it for what it is.\"He accused Reform of failing to speak for the whole country, saying: \"They think our flag only belongs to some of us who look like me, not all of us who built this country and built its success.\"Streeting also condemned Farage's lack of public comment about Pochin, accusing him of \"deafening silence\". Pochin was previously criticised by Yusuf, who was party chairman at the time, for suggesting a ban on the burka during a speech in Parliament.Asked about her comments, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said he would not \"call her racist\" and said \"there are legitimate concerns the public have about mass migration that need to be addressed\".\"It's certainly not language that I would use and I don't think politicians should speak in those terms,\" he added.The Liberal Democrats have called on Farage to withdraw the whip from Pochin over her comments and called criticised Philp for \"refusing to call out blatant racism for what it is\". Party spokesman Max Wilkinson said: \"Nigel Farage keeps insisting that racism has no place in his party. \"Now is his chance to prove it - he must withdraw the whip or concede that Reform tolerates blatant racism.\"",

    "body": "Two arrested over theft of jewels at Louvre museum in Paris2 hours agoJake LaphamWatch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleTwo suspects have been arrested over the theft of precious crown jewels from Paris's Louvre museum, French media say.The Paris prosecutor's office said one of the men had been taken into custody as he was preparing to take a flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum last Sunday, when four thieves wielding power tools broke into the building in broad daylight.France's justice minister has conceded security protocols \"failed\", leaving the country with a \"terrible image\".The Paris prosecutor's office said in a statement that the arrests had been made on Saturday evening, without specifying how many people had been taken into custody.One of the suspects was preparing to travel to Algeria, police sources have told French media, while it is understood the other was going to Mali.Specialist police can detain and question them for up to 96 hours.According to reports in French media on Sunday, DNA found at the scene of the robbery led to the identification of one of the suspects. The gang left behind a number of items, including gloves and a high-vis jacket. It has previously been reported that they dropped a crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III.The Paris prosecutor criticised the \"premature disclosure\" of information related to the case, adding that it hindered efforts to recover the jewels and find the thieves.The thieves reportedly arrived at 09:30 (08:30 GMT), shortly after the museum opened to visitors.The suspects arrived with a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Pictures from the scene showed the ladder leading up to a first-floor window.Two of the thieves entered by cutting through the window with power tools.They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the premises, and cut through the glass of two display cases containing jewels.A preliminary report has revealed that one in three rooms in the area of the museum raided had no CCTV cameras, according to French media.French police say the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38.The museum's director told French senators this week that the only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where they broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to Gallery of Apollo.CCTV around the perimeter was also weak and \"ageing\", Laurence des Cars said, meaning that staff failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumA tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen Experts have also expressed concern that the jewels may have already been broken up into hundreds of pieces.Gold and silver can be melted down and the gems can be cut up into smaller stones that will be virtually impossible to track back to the robbery, Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told the BBC. Security measures have since been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.",

This means Axel's take on using make up to create glamorous creatures and creepy monsters is perfect for this time of year.There’s something special about Halloween that allows people to let their guard down and fully express themselves, Axel says. \"Nobody really cares what you’re doing because everyone’s crazy and weird looking.”BBC Bitesize asked Axel to show us how to create three seriously spooky glow-ups.How to paint a frightening Frankenstein’s monster headImage gallerySkip image galleryImage source, Axel A D BrownImage caption, Step 1Start with a clean, moisturised face.

Axel says this really brings a look to life.Prosthetics for beginnersAdding prosthetics to a more basic makeup look can really up the fear-factor.  Axel suggests starting off with things that are very easy to buy.“ and cotton wool can go a long way.”They suggest applying a layer of the latex, adding some cotton wool which should stick to it but still be mouldable, then add colour with makeup: “You can make scars from that, gashes or boils. You can really do a lot.”From fake blood to fashionSince appearing on Glow Up, Axel has been busy on a variety of big projects including a gory horror film. As the lead makeup artist they designed a rig of tubes, hidden under prosthetic skin, so when characters were \"attacked\", fake blood could spurt out of their fake wounds.Axel has also been working on makeup for the catwalk show of fashion designer, Jean Louie Castillo. This also has the spook factor Axel says. \"He [Jean Louie] loves to have special effects makeup creating ghouls that walk the runway. It's very gothic, very edgy, and right up my street.”Whether you're welcoming trick or treaters on your street, or off out to a ghoulish party, BBC Bitesize hopes you find the perfect inspiration to get your spook on this Halloween.All episodes of Series 1 to 7 of Glow Up are available on BBC iPlayerThis article was published in October 2025",

    "body": "17 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsWatch: Dr Xand and Dr Chris on working with their 'annoying' twinA giant mug of instant black coffee and no food is not what you'd expect the host of a wellness podcast to have for breakfast.Yet it's what Dr Chris van Tulleken, who hosts the BBC's What's Up Docs alongside identical twin brother Dr Xand confesses to having.\"I'm approaching middle age so don't want to eat all day. My way of not eating all day is not eating breakfast,\" he says. It's this kind of honesty about not leading the perfect life and struggling with the stuff they know they should do but still don't, that makes them so relatable.The brothers are both medical doctors who've become household names through their TV and radio work - they present children's series Operation Ouch! and Dr Xand is one of BBC's Morning Live resident experts while Dr Chris is well known for his bestselling book Ultra-Processed People. On the podcast, they often disagree with each other over competing claims about health and wellbeing, much like they do in real life. Xand laughs after Chris says it's a hard job working \"with a brother like Xand who is so intensely annoying\".But really the brothers love working together and Chris admits that they started the podcast \"quite selfishly as we were just trying to answer our own questions\". \"But it turns out our problems are similar to everyone else's.\"They say the podcast has changed their lives for the better and share what they have changed about their behaviour over the course of more than 30 episodes.1. Don't obsess over eight hours sleep Getty ImagesLike most of us, the brothers assumed eight hours was the gold standard for sleep and anything less was a failure. Now, they're far less dogmatic. The brothers say a healthy range of sleep can be anywhere between six and 10 hours.\"There's so much anxiety around getting eight hours but some of the most important things in my life, like raising kids, I've done sleep deprived,\" says Chris.Realising that everything from winning wars to completing exams were often done with very little sleep, made them understand that sleep deprivation can sharpen your focus in the short term.Xand says this helped him \"shed all that anxiety\" around optimal sleeping patterns and times.\"It no longer dominates my life and I think about it a lot less.\" He also feels a lot more comfortable taking naps when needed and says he will sometimes \"have a 20 minute sleep if I'm exhausted\". Am I getting enough sleep?2. Pause before saying yes or noGetty ImagesThe pair both find saying \"no\" difficult and Xand says it can feel \"almost physically painful.\" They have now learnt the \"power of the pause\". If something does not require an immediate decision, they now ask for more time to think about it so they don't feel pressured into saying yes.Chris says this has helped him have difficult conversations he may otherwise have put off. However, he admits he's still figuring out how to be more forceful. \"I know I should do, but somehow I'm not and I know I need to focus on that.\" The podcast episode on this topic also taught them that they needed to work out what their values are and then weigh up whether requests fitted in with those. For Xand, his priority was spending more time with his wife and two sons. He has since managed to say no to a number of things that he would have otherwise gone along with for an easy life. \"I recently said no to a very big and important work thing even though there was a lot of pressure on me to do it, but it didn't fit with my other commitments and what I wanted to do.\"Should you say 'no' more often?3. Brush your teeth mindfullyHow to brush your teethOne of the most practical tips that has stuck with the brothers is how they brush their teeth. The small act has become a mindful task and Xand explains he's totally changed the way he brushes.\"My wife, Dolly, hasn't complained about my bad breath since the episode.\"I use brushes for flossing, hold my toothbrush at a different angle and I don't look at my phone while brushing.\" While Chris is shocked that his brother ever used his phone while brushing his teeth, he agrees with how powerful the changes have been. \"It's about the angle of the brush, being more gentle and having a better picture of what you're trying to achieve - you want to clean every surface of every tooth.\"How can I freshen my breath?4. Willpower doesn't existGetty ImagesMany people believe that struggling with diet, exercise or breaking habits is down to personal weakness, and Xand shares those feelings. \"I feel lazy and inadequate most of the time.\"I go to Manchester every week and I usually arrive late after a long train journey and I order a takeaway and do no exercise then I beat myself up about it.\" Their expert guest on this podcast episode, psychologist Kimberley Wilson, helped Xand understand that \"there's no such thing as willpower\".Willpower is not this magic thing inside you, instead your ability to stick to something is \"about the way you've arranged the world around you,\" he says.For example, by planning ahead and thinking about what you'll have for dinner, you can more easily ditch the takeaway and eat something healthy. Since the episode, Xand has managed to increase how much exercise he is doing, but still doesn't enjoy it. \"I just get on the exercise bike and have those negative thoughts while I do my workout,\" he says. Another simple change he's made is taking a bag of apples with him on his regular commute between London and Manchester, rather than buying unhealthy snacks on the train.Chris realised willpower wasn't about increasing your tolerance to distress and suffering, but simply being more organised.\"I've started batch-cooking which now releases time for me to do things like read with my daughter.\" How important is willpower?For all the changes they've embraced, the brothers are the first to admit they don't follow every bit of expert advice.Take sunscreen, for example. \"A dermatologist gave us really good advice,\" Dr Chris says, \"but there's something about the sun that feels so powerful. Academically, we know sun exposure is bad and causes cancer but we still find ourselves drawn to it.\" That tension - between what we know and what we do - is at the heart of their podcast. If there's one thing the doctors hope listeners take away from the show, it's that struggling with health isn't a personal failure.\"So much of your health and well-being isn't your fault,\" says Dr Xand. \"There are loads of forces trying to take your money, attention and time away from the things that matter. What we're trying to do is sweep that out of the way, help you identify your values and align your life with them.\"Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "Donald Trump has claimed to have ended another war, this time between Thailand and Cambodia, following deadly controntations at their shared border in July.The US president is in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, where he signed a peace accord between the two countries.Both have agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed region, and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it - but the underlying issues remain fundamentally unresolved. So what does the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord\", as Trump has called it, actually amount to? The BBC's Tessa Wong has this analysis.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAleks PhillipsSSGGeorgian security service footage shows armed soldiers detaining three individualsThree Chinese nationals have been arrested in Georgia on suspicion of attempting to illegally purchase 2kg of uranium.Lasha Maghradze, deputy head of the nation's State Security Service (SSG), told a news briefing the group planned to pay $400,000 (£300,570) for the nuclear material in the capital, Tblisi, before transporting it to China via Russia.The alleged plot was unearthed by intelligence agents while one member of the group was attempting to buy the radioactive substance on the black market, he said.The three pleaded not guilty at a court in Tblisi and have been placed in custody to prevent them fleeing the country, according to public broadcaster Georgia Today.They face up to five years in prison under a provision of Georgia's criminal code banning the purchasing of nuclear material.Mr Maghradze told reporters the operation was being co-ordinated by other members of the group in China.SSG footage shows armed soldiers swooping on a car and detaining three individuals.It also shows two glass jars containing a yellow substance in a car boot, which tests identified as uranium. SSGAuthorities found two jars containing uranium in a car bootIt is unclear what isotope of uranium the men are alleged to have sought - though all can emit harmful radiation - and their intended purpose for it.As a former Soviet nation, Georgia had stores of nuclear materials following the bloc's collapse in 1991.The security of those materials has been an ongoing concern, with several serious incidents of uranium being illicitly sold in the years since.In July, the SSG arrested two people - one Georgian and one Turkish national - for attempting to trade $3m worth of uranium.",

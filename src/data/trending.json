    "description": "US President Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertise",
    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring former President Ronald Reagan.In a post on social media on Saturday, Trump called the advert a \"fraud\" and lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship. \"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,\" he wrote.After Trump on Thursday withdrew from trade talks with Canada, the Ontario premier said he would take down the advert. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause his province's anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the US, telling reporters that he made the decision after discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney \"so that trade talks can resume\". He also said it would still run over the weekend, including during games for the World Series, which features the Toronto Blue Jays against the Los Angeles Dodgers.US-Canada trade minister Dominic LeBlanc responded to the tariff increase, saying: \"We stand ready to build on the progress made in constructive discussions with American counterparts over the course of recent weeks.\"We will remain focused on achieving results that benefit workers and families in both the United States and Canada, and that progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the US administration - which is the responsibility of the federal government.\"Canada is the only G7 country that has not reached a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to charge steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.The US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.In his post, sent while he was traveling to Asia, Trump seemed to say he was adding 10 percentage points to those taxes.Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, and Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing.The advert, which was sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".The video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use it.In his post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said that the advert should have been pulled down earlier.\"Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,\" he wrote, while flying to Malaysia.Ford had previously pledged to run the Reagan advert in every Republican-led district in the US.Both Trump and Carney will be attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Malaysia, but Trump told reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One that he does not have any \"intention\" of meeting with his Canadian counterpart during the trip. In his post, Trump also accused Canada of attempting to manipulate an upcoming US Supreme Court case which could end his entire tariff regime. The case, to be heard by the highest US court next month, will determine whether the tariffs are constitutional. On Thursday, Trump posted that the advert was designed to \"interfere\" with \"THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE EVER\".Responding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, said in a statement to the BBC.The Reagan ad is not the only way that Ontario – home of the Toronto Blue Jays – is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.In a video posted on Friday, Ford and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series.Both men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers win.\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.In response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.They ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\"",

This means Axel's take on using make up to create glamorous creatures and creepy monsters is perfect for this time of year.There’s something special about Halloween that allows people to let their guard down and fully express themselves, Axel says. \"Nobody really cares what you’re doing because everyone’s crazy and weird looking.”BBC Bitesize asked Axel to show us how to create three seriously spooky glow-ups.How to paint a frightening Frankenstein’s monster headImage gallerySkip image galleryImage source, Axel A D BrownImage caption, Step 1Start with a clean, moisturised face.

Axel says this really brings a look to life.Prosthetics for beginnersAdding prosthetics to a more basic makeup look can really up the fear-factor.  Axel suggests starting off with things that are very easy to buy.“ and cotton wool can go a long way.”They suggest applying a layer of the latex, adding some cotton wool which should stick to it but still be mouldable, then add colour with makeup: “You can make scars from that, gashes or boils. You can really do a lot.”From fake blood to fashionSince appearing on Glow Up, Axel has been busy on a variety of big projects including a gory horror film. As the lead makeup artist they designed a rig of tubes, hidden under prosthetic skin, so when characters were \"attacked\", fake blood could spurt out of their fake wounds.Axel has also been working on makeup for the catwalk show of fashion designer, Jean Louie Castillo. This also has the spook factor Axel says. \"He [Jean Louie] loves to have special effects makeup creating ghouls that walk the runway. It's very gothic, very edgy, and right up my street.”Whether you're welcoming trick or treaters on your street, or off out to a ghoulish party, BBC Bitesize hopes you find the perfect inspiration to get your spook on this Halloween.All episodes of Series 1 to 7 of Glow Up are available on BBC iPlayerThis article was published in October 2025",

    "body": "3 days agoHsin-Yi LoSouth EastBears 'enjoy life to the full' after major rescueTwo bears rescued from \"deplorable conditions\" in Armenia by an East Sussex charity have been making the most of their new lives in a bear sanctuary.Giant Siberian bear Max and Syrian bear Minnie were living in a bus depot for the entertainment of travellers until they were saved in 2018. The rescue operation was carried out by International Animal Rescue (IAR), based in Uckfield, and the Foundation for the Preservation of Wildlife and Cultural Assets in Armenia.Alan Knight, IAR president, told the BBC it was \"heart-warming\" to see how healthy and playful Max and Minnie were \"after years of cruelty and neglect\". \"They are seizing a second chance to enjoy life to the full,\" he added.International Animal RescueMax had to be anaesthetised with a blow dart before the rescue crew cut through the bars of the cage using an angle grinderThe IAR said it took a year to persuade the bears' captor to agree to their release. Mr Knight said the pair had been kept in a cage that had been welded shut for more than 10 years.\"Being kept in such a small cage and knee deep in excrement, we couldn't get into the cage to rescue them,\" he said.International Animal RescueKeepers say Minnie enjoys applesAs Max weighed 500kg (1,102 lb) he had to be moved in a horse trailer while Minnie was transported on a deep bed of straw in a transport crate.Mr Knight said Max had to be anaesthetised with a blow dart before emergency services cut through the bars of the cage using angle grinders.\"The bears were kept in deplorable conditions and we were desperate to set them free,\" said Mr Knight.International Animal RescueKeepers say Max is \"playful\" and \"keeps everyone entertained\"The charity said Max and Minnie have learnt to forage for food hidden in their enclosure in the wildlife rescue centre in Urtsadzor, and are responding to natural bear instincts, including going into hibernation.It adds the bears are regularly treated with fruits, vegetables, fish and meat. The keepers say Max is the \"playful one\", enjoying tree-climbing, tossing logs and balls into the pool and \"keeping everyone entertained\". Meanwhile, Minnie leaves the hard work of shaking apples out of the wobble tree to Max, while waiting patiently to retrieve her share of the fallen fruit.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "The best time to turn on the heating – according to you5 hours agoEmer Moreau and Connie BowkerAbbi LilyAbbi, who makes personal finance content on social media, says she and her partner delay turning the heating on, to save moneyThere are few things British people love more than talking about the weather, and as winter approaches, this can often take the form of: \"Have you turned the heating on yet?\"You may get different answers depending on where in the country you are - the northern and western parts of the UK are generally colder and wetter than the east and south. But temperatures across the country are due to drop this weekend. And on Sunday the clocks go back, marking an official end to British Summer Time - and the return to darker evenings as winter draws in.So will you wait until a particular date to reach for the thermostat? Or until the temperature drops below a certain point?'We hold off for as long as possible'Abbi Lily, who makes personal finance content under the moniker abbitalksmoney, says she and her partner try to \"wait until the absolute last minute\" before turning the heating on, in order to save money.They're currently using blankets and jumpers to stay warm \"so we can hold off as long as possible\", but they don't have a hard and fast rule about when the heating goes on.When she spoke to the BBC earlier this week, Abbi said it was still quite mild where she lives near Bournemouth.\"I'm wearing shorts today!\" she said.The Energy Saving Trust recommends setting the thermostat to anywhere between 18C and 21C for most people.The World Health Organisation (WHO) also recommends 18C for \"healthy and well-dressed people\". For older people, children and people with illnesses or disabilities, the WHO recommends 20C.Some people might keep a closer eye on the outside temperature, instead of their thermostat. Simon King, the BBC's lead weather presenter, says 15C tends to be the magic number. \"If the temperature is regularly below this for a few days or more, that is when people tend to switch their heating on.\"Temperatures across the UK are expected to fall this weekend as colder air from the Arctic spreads in, he adds.Cold arctic air will affect all of the UK this weekendRather than monitoring the temperature too closely, Gemma Bird from Essex waits until a certain date to turn the heating on.\"Growing up, my mum would only let us turn on the heating on 1 November,\" says Gemma, who shares money-saving household tips on Instagram.\"I remember thinking I'd never be like that, but obviously with the cost of everything now, I say: 'Is it 1 November? No? Put an extra blanket on.'\" Indeed, for many households, the question of when the heating goes on is about money, not health or comfort.'Our Aga is like having a permanent fire in the house'Aimee Blakey lives with her husband Sean and their son in a detached 1980s house in Wiltshire. The couple both come from farming backgrounds, she says, where they were taught: \"If you're cold, you put a jumper on. If you're really cold, put a dressing gown on.\"Aimee had always wanted an Aga, but buying a new one was too expensive when they started renovating two years ago. They were able to get a second-hand one, which they're now \"obsessed with\".Aimee BlakeyAimee and Sean had a second-hand Aga installed in their home last yearAn Aga is an iron cooking range which absorbs heat and then releases it slowly, so the cooker stays warm even when it's not in use. Agas originally ran on slow-burning coal, but today's models are powered by gas, electricity or biofuel. They can be expensive to run but, for Aimee and Sean, it saves them money on heating costs.\"It's like having a fire permanently in the house,\" she says. They first used the Aga on 1 October, but haven't switched their oil boiler on yet.Aimee says she was worried about the cost of running the Aga when it was installed a year ago, but it's currently costing them less than the £100 a month they had budgeted for oil.\"Because it's oil we can fill it up at any time. We filled it up during the summer when it was cheaper.\"'In the US, we turn on the heating when it's cold. Over here, it's a hot topic!'American-born Olivia Carney lives in Greater Manchester with her British husband. She says she's amused by the \"unspoken competition of who can turn it on the latest\".\"In the US we kind of just turned it on whenever it was cold,\" Olivia, 33, says. But in the UK, \"it's a hot topic in the office\".\"There seems to be a clear divide of people waiting until the absolute last minute or people who are just like, 'Yeah, no, I'm not gonna be cold in my own house.'\"Olivia first turned the heating on in mid-October, with the thermostat set to 18C \"so when it warms up to that it turns off\".Olivia CarneyOlivia Carney finds the British obsession with the heating funnyCaitlin Robinson, who studies energy and infrastructure-based inequality at the University of Bristol, says bills are still much higher than they were before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, leading to a spike in the cost of gas and electricity.Dr Robinson says it can be \"tricky to give advice\" on lowering energy bills because most people are \"sensible\" and \"savvy\" anyway, especially if they're on a low income.Her research indicates that it's not just low-income households that are making considerable cutbacks on their heating, as evidenced through the \"record levels of energy debt\" in Britain.People struggling to pay their bills can experience heavy stress, Dr Robinson says.Mental health can also suffer if people aren't having people around to the house because they can't heat it, leading them to become socially isolated. Privacy, too, can be in short supply if families are only heating one or two rooms in a house and people have little space to themselves.Gemma, who works from home, wears tights under her clothes and swears by her electric blanket. \"I can turn [the heating] on if I have to, but obviously there are loads of people who can't, which is awful.\" More on this story",

    "body": "2 hours agoReutersDonald Trump arrives in Kuala Lumpur as he kicks off a tour of Asia.US President Donald Trump has arrived in Asia for a whirlwind week of diplomacy, which includes a much-anticipated meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.Top of the agenda will be trade – an area where tensions between the world's two biggest economies have once again been ramping up.Trump landed in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, as a summit for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, begins on Sunday. He will then visit Japan and finally South Korea, where the White House says he will meet Xi.  So what are the wins Trump and other leaders are hoping for, and what are the pitfalls? Our correspondents explain what you should know about the week ahead.For Trump, China is the key By Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondentInking new trade deals that provide opportunities to American businesses while keeping the tariff revenue flowing into the US Treasury is sure to be a central focus of Trump's Asia trip.While there are multiple players in the global trade dance, the key to Trump's success or failure is China. And Trump's scheduled meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of Apec – the first since 2019 – could set the course for US-China relations for the rest of Trump's second term in office.As the US president has acknowledged, draconian tariffs on Chinese imports are unsustainable. And while he has not explicitly said so, an escalating economic war with America's largest trading partner would have devastating consequences – for the US, for China and for the rest of the world.The steep tumbles in the major US stock indexes every time China and the US appear at an impasse underlines this reality.When he heads back to America next week, Trump is sure to be pleased if he is able to finalise a deal with South Korea and secure new Japanese investment in US manufacturing.But his top priority is sure to be convincing Xi to resume purchases of American agricultural exports, loosen recent restrictions on foreign access to Chinese rare earth materials, give US companies greater access to the Chinese market and avoid a full-blown trade war.For Trump, as the saying goes, that's the whole ballgame.Xi's long gameBy Laura Bicker, China correspondentWhen Chinese leader Xi Jinping meets Trump on 30 October in South Korea, he wants to be the tougher negotiator.That is why he has been leveraging China's stranglehold on rare earths, the minerals without which you cannot make semiconductors, weapons systems, cars or even smartphones. It's a US weakness, and China is exploiting it – just like it is hurting American farmers, and Trump's rural vote base, by not buying their soybeans.Xi has also learned lessons from Trump 1.0 and this time, Beijing, it appears, is willing to embrace the pain of tariffs. For one, the US, which once took in a fifth of Chinese exports, is no longer such a crucial market.Getty ImagesTrump's tariffs on imports to the US will be at the top of the agenda in every meeting this week Still Xi has a balance to strike, between an economic battle with the US, and his struggle with domestic challenges. And Washington knows about Xi's troubles: high youth unemployment, a real estate crisis, mounting local government debt and a population unwilling to spend.Analysts believe China may offer to do a deal if Trump agrees to start exporting advanced AI chips or pull back on more military support for Taiwan.But getting there won't be easy. One big difference is that it often seems like Trump is willing to roll a dice and gamble – but Xi is playing a much longer game.So the question may be: can Trump wait it out?A starring role in 'peace'By Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondentThe US president appears interested in one thing only during his visit to Malaysia: playing the starring role in a ceremony arranged specially for him, at which Thailand and Cambodia will sign some kind of peace accord.Differences between the two countries over their border remain unresolved, but, under pressure to come up with something, they have made progress in agreeing to demilitarise the border.Neither can afford to disappoint President Trump. Back in July, when they were still bombing and shelling each other, his threat to end tariff talks forced them into an immediate ceasefire.Other Asean member states will hope for Trump's mere presence, brief though it is, to normalise relations with the US. They have had a tumultuous year in which their export-dependent economies were badly shaken by his tariff war. Exports from the region to the US have doubled since Trump's last visit to the Asean summit in 2017.Once Trump leaves, the other leaders can settle down to normal business – the quiet, incremental diplomacy which advances the plodding progress of integration among them.Also on the agenda is a conflict that doesn't have Trump's attention - the civil war in Myanmar, which has haunted every Asean gathering since it was triggered by a brutal coup in 2021.Ink on paper, please By Suranjana Tewari, Asia business correspondent Asia's manufacturing powerhouses, which make up much of the world's output, will be looking for respite from Trump's tariffs.Some have agreed deals, while others are still stuck in talks – but none have signed an agreement.So ink on paper, or at least promising talks, would be welcome.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump and Xi during the latter's visit to the US in 2017Take China. The meeting between Trump and Xi signals progress, but the two leaders have a lot to unpick, from levies and export controls, to the source of it all: rivalry between the world's two biggest economies as they compete for an edge in AI and advanced tech.Any ease in those tensions would bring relief to other countries in the region who have been caught in the middle. South East Asia may be the most trapped – it is deeply woven into US supply chains in electronics, for example, yet heavily reliant on Chinese demand.Exports to the US have doubled over the past decade, but tariffs of 10% to 40% would pummel manufacturers in Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. It could also hurt US chipmakers like Micron Technology, which operates plants in Malaysia. The country exported around $10bn worth of semiconductors to the US last year, roughly a fifth of total US chip imports.Wealthy economies like Japan and South Korea face a different dilemma. Although close allies of the US, they are in for an unpredictable time – and will want to lock in tariff terms and investments. Automakers in both countries, which see the US as a key market, are already struggling to navigate the chaos.An early test for Japan's new PM By Shaimaa Khalil, Japan correspondent Trump has described Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, as a woman with great \"strength and wisdom\".This week, her ability to forge a stable, working relationship with him will be an early test of her leadership - and of Japan's place in a shifting world order.In her first speech in parliament, she pledged to raise Japan's defence budget, signalling her intent to shoulder more of the security burden with Washington. Trump has spoken of this before and is expected to press Tokyo to contribute more to US troop deployments - Japan hosts the largest number of American forces abroad, about 53,000 personnel.AFP via Getty ImagesJapan's new PM Sanae TakaichiBoth sides also want to finalise a tariff deal negotiated by her predecessor. Particularly beneficial to Japan's auto giants - Toyota, Honda and Nissan - it cuts US import duties on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, potentially making them more competitive against Chinese rivals.By retaining Ryosei Akazawa as chief tariff negotiator, Takaichi is betting on continuity.In return, Japan has pledged to invest $550bn in the US to strengthen supply chains in pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Trump has also said Japan will increase purchases of US farm products, including rice, a move welcomed in Washington but unsettling for Japanese farmers.Takaichi's ties to the late former PM Shinzo Abe, who shared a close rapport with Trump, could also work in her favour. Abe famously used rounds of golf at Mar-a-Lago to earn Trump's trust – it's the kind of personal diplomacy Takaichi may seek to emulate.Talking tariffs as Kim Jong Un loomsBy Jake Kwon, Seoul correspondent For South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the pressing issue is Trump's tariffs.But that thunder was briefly stolen by rampant speculation that Trump might visit the border to see North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Back in August, Lee dedicated most of his time in the Oval Office to flatter Trump as a \"peacemaker\". Trump responded with enthusiasm to the prospect of sitting down with Kim, who he hasn't seen since 2019. Kim said last month that he still remembers Trump \"fondly\".Analysts believe Kim is hoping to legitimise his nuclear weapons programme with another summit with the US president. There is no indication that a meeting is in the works. Either way, Lee has a trade deal to negotiate. Talks to lower US duties on South Korean exports from 25% to 15% have stalled, despite multiple trips by Seoul officials to Washington. The sticking point is Trump's insistence that Seoul invest $350bn upfront in the US – roughly a fifth of South Korea's economy, such a huge investment could create a financial crisis, Seoul fears.But in recent days, Korean officials have voiced hope, speaking of tangible progress. And they will be hoping for a signed deal by the end of Wednesday's summit between Trump and Lee.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe bosses of Britain's biggest supermarkets have warned food prices could rise even further if higher taxes are imposed on the sector.Grocers including Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons signed a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her Budget next month, along with Lidl, Aldi, Iceland, Waitrose and M&S.They claimed households would \"inevitably feel the impact\" of any potential tax increases on the industry, such as higher business rates for supermarkets.The Treasury said tackling food price inflation was a \"priority\" and said it was lowering business rates for \"butchers, bakers and other shops\".In their letter to the Chancellor, supermarket bosses said if the industry was to face higher taxes, \"our ability to deliver value for our customers will become even more challenging and it will be households who inevitably feel the impact\".\"Given the costs currently falling on the industry, including from the last Budget, high food inflation is likely to persist into 2026,\" they warned.\"This is not something that we would want to see prolonged by any measure in the Budget.\"Ahead of the chancellor's Autumn Budget next month, speculation is growing over her tax and spending policies.She is widely expected to increase taxes following gloomy economic forecasts and a series of U-turns on cuts to welfare spending, which have made it more difficult for her to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules.After announcing tax rises of £40bn in her previous Budget in November, which included a hike in the amount employers are required to pay in National Insurance Contributions, Reeves said she was \"not coming back\" for more tax rises.But economists at the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have calculated a shortfall of £22bn in the public finances and suggested Reeves will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes.The think tank cited rising borrowing costs for the government, weaker growth forecasts, and spending commitments made since the spring as reasons for the tight position.Many industries in the run-up to the Budget often call on and lobby their views and position to the government, but rising food prices are once again putting pressure on people's finances.The cost of many staples has spiked compared with butter prices up by 19% and milk over 12% along with chocolate and coffee rising 15%, according to the Office for National Statistics.While higher taxes and minimum wage bills have hit supermarkets, food inflation has surged in part due to poor harvests globally, with disease and droughts affecting yields. Escalating trade tensions also have an impact.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which represents the UK's major supermarkets, said retailers were \"doing everything possible to keep food prices affordable\".\"But it's an uphill battle,\" she claimed, \"with over £7bn in additional costs in 2025 alone,\" citing higher taxes.The boss of Tesco, Ken Murphy, has previously said that \"enough is enough\" on business taxes.The UK's largest supermarket said the higher National Insurance rate had cost it £235m this year, however, Tesco has upgraded its earnings outlook for the year, with expectations of full-year profits of between £2.9bn and £3.1bn.Lidl revealed this week that its profits had surged threefold. Sales jumped by 7.9% as pre-tax profits hit £156.8m in the year to 28 February, up from £43.6m a year earlier.The chancellor has previously said she is planning \"targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges\" in her budget, though on Friday she refused to rule out raising income tax, amid speculation she is considering breaking a key Labour election pledge.Business ratesSupermarket bosses highlighted that part of the government's business rates reforms posed a problem for the industry, in particular the so-called business rates surtax, which is being levied on all large commercial premises.Business rates are a tax on non-domestic properties such as shops, pubs and offices.In last year's Budget, the government announced its intention to introduce two lower figures used to calculate such rates for retail, hospitality and leisure properties with rateable values below £500,000.Meanwhile, firms with properties with rateable values at and above £500,000 will pay a higher amount, which the government says will include the majority of large distribution warehouses, such as those used by online retail giants Amazon.It is expected that the chancellor will confirm the rates businesses will have to pay at next month's Budget, along with further details, which will come into force in April 2026.But the UK's supermarkets have argued large retail premises were a \"tiny proportion of all stores, yet account for a third of retail's total business rates\".They urged the chancellor to \"ensure that the proposed changes to business rates result in a significant reduction to the industry's rates burden\".\"The chancellor has rightly made tackling inflation her top priority, and with food inflation stubbornly high, ensuring retail's rates burden doesn't rise further would be one of the simplest ways to help,\" said Ms Dickinson.The Treasury said that business rates would be adjusted to reflect changes in the overall value of the tax base, \"so that the system continues to raise the same amount of revenue in real terms\".\"If the total value of rateable properties increases, the tax rate will generally fall,\" it added. \"This means that even if a specific property's RV goes up, its bill could still decrease if the reduction in the tax rate is large enough to offset the increase in value.\"Ultimately, what businesses pay after a revaluation depends on both the new RVs and the adjusted tax rate.\"",

    "body": "Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto and catcher Will Smith starred as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-1 to draw level at 1-1 in the best-of-seven World Series.Japanese right-hander Yamamoto needed only 105 pitches to record his second successive complete game of the postseason.Meanwhile, Smith led the Dodgers' offence with three runs batted in (RBI) as the Blue Jays had a night to forget.In contrast to the free-scoring opener, game two was a pitching duel for long stretches at Toronto's Rogers Centre.The Dodgers went ahead in the top of the first inning when Smith drove in Freddie Freeman, but were tied down after that by Blue Jays starting pitcher Kevin Gausman, who retired the next 17 Dodgers hitters he faced without allowing a baserunner.Though the Canadian side drew level in the bottom of the third inning when Alejandro Kirk's sacrifice fly scored George Springer, the game remained deadlocked until the top of the seventh when Smith and Max Muncy both lifted Gausman over the left-field fence with solo home runs to give the 2024 champions a two-run cushion.The Blue Jays fell apart in the top of the eighth as, with the bases loaded, the Dodgers scored on a wild pitch, before Smith recorded his third RBI of the evening to make it 5-1.And while the Dodgers' bullpen had taken a beating in game one, Yamamoto was able to give his relievers a night off as he pitched all nine innings without any late scares.The series now switches to Los Angeles for the next three games, with game three at Dodger Stadium on Monday evening.Game 1: Blue Jays 11-4 DodgersGame 2: Blue Jays 1-5 DodgersGame 3 (in LA): Monday, 27 OctoberGame 4 (in LA): Tuesday, 28 OctoberGame 5 (in LA): Wednesday, 29 OctoberGame 6* (in Toronto): Friday, 31 OctoberGame 7* (in Toronto): Saturday, 1 November*if required.

    "body": "How the nation lost its appetite for Pizza Hut 5 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterBBCPizza Hut was once a go-to for families and friends to tuck into its all-you-can eat buffet, unlimited salad bar, and self-serve ice-cream with all the toppings.But fewer diners are \"hitting the Hut\" these days and it is closing half its UK restaurants after being bought out of administration for the second time this year.\"We used to go to Pizza Hut when I was a child,\" says Prudence, when the BBC asked shoppers in London why they thought the chain was struggling. \"It was like a family thing, you'd go on a Sunday - make a day of it.\" But now aged 24 she says \"it's not a thing anymore\".For 23-year-old Martina Debnatch it is some of the very things Pizza Hut has been known and loved for since it opened in the UK in the 1970s that are now not-so-hot.\"The way they do their buffet and their salad bar, it feels like they are cheapening on their quality and have lower standards...They're giving away so much food and you're like 'How?'\"'It feels like they are cheapening on their quality and have lower standards,' says 23-year-old Martina DebnatchAs food prices have soared, Pizza Hut's all-you-can-eat model has become very expensive to run. As have its 132 restaurants which are being sliced to 64.The business, like many others, has also seen its costs increase. In April this year, staffing costs jumped due to rises in minimum wages (which went up nearly 7% this year, to £12.21 for employees aged 21 and over) as well as an increase in employer national insurance contributions.Chris, 36, and Joanne, 29 say they used to go to Pizza Hut for a date \"every now and then\", but now they order in a Domino's and think Pizza Hut is \"very overpriced\".Chris, 36, and Joanne, 29, say they used to go to Pizza Hut for a date 'every now and then' but say it's now 'very overpriced' Depending on your order, Pizza Hut and Domino's prices are similar, says Giulia Crouch, food expert and author of The Happiest Diet in the World.While Pizza Hut does offer takeaway and deliveries through Ubers Eats, Deliveroo and Just Eat, it is losing out to big rivals which solely cater to this market.\"Domino's has managed to dominate the takeaway pizza sector thanks to aggressive marketing and constantly running deals that make consumers feel like they're getting a bargain, when in reality the original prices are quite high,\" says Ms Crouch.But for Chris and Joanne it is worth it to get their date night delivered to their door.\"We definitely eat at home now more than we eat out,\" says Joanne, echoing recent statistics that show a drop in people going to casual and fast-food restaurants. John Keeble/Getty ImagesCasual and fast-food restaurants saw a 6% drop in customers over the summer Over the summer, casual and fast-food restaurants saw a 6% drop in customers compared to last summer.There is also another rival to restaurant and takeaway pizzas: the cook-at-home oven pizza.Will Hawkley, head of leisure and hospitality at KPMG, points out that not only have supermarkets been offering high-quality oven-ready pizzas for years - some are even selling home-pizza ovens.\"Lifestyle changes are also playing a factor in the success of fast-food chains,\" says Mr Hawkley.The rising popularity of high protein diets has boosted sales at chicken shops, while hitting sales of carb-heavy pizza, he adds.As people go out to eat less frequently they may look for a more a premium experience and Pizza Hut's American-diner style with booth seating and red and white checked plastic table cloths can feel more retro than upmarket.The \"explosion of high-quality pizzerias\" over the last 10 to 15 years, such as Franco Manca, has \"fundamentally changed the public's perception of what good pizza is,\" says Ms Crouch.\"A light, fresh, easy-to-digest product with a few choice toppings, not the massively greasy, heavy and overloaded pizzas of the past. That, I think, is what's caused Pizza Hut's downfall,\" she says.\"Why would anyone spend £17.99 on a small, substandard, disappointing pizza from a chain when you can get a beautiful, masterfully-made Margherita for under a tenner at one of the many authentic Italian pizzerias around the country? \"It's a no-brainer.\"Dan PuddleDan Puddle says his pizza van can offer cheaper, premium pizza because his costs are lowDan Puddle, who owns Smokey Deez, a small mobile pizza van based in Suffolk says: \"It's not that people have fallen out of love with pizza - they just want better pizza for their money.\"Dan says his flexible operation can offer premium pizza at accessible prices, and that Pizza Hut struggled because it could not keep up with new customer habits.At Pizzarova, a small independent chain based in Bristol, owner Jack Lander says the pizza market is broadening but Pizza Hut has failed to offer anything new.\"You now have slice concepts, London pizza, new haven, sourdough, Neapolitan, Detroit - it's a heavenly minefield for a pizza-loving consumer to explore.\"Jack says Pizza Hut \"needs to reinvent itself\" as younger people don't have any sense of nostalgia or loyalty to the brand.Jack LanderJack Lander owns an independent pizza chain in BristolOver time, Pizza Hut's market has been sliced up and distributed to its trendier, more nimble rivals. To maintain its expensive staffing and restaurants, it would have to increase costs - which KPMG's Mr Hawkley says is difficult at a time when household budgets are shrinking.Nicolas Burquier, Pizza Hut's managing director of international markets, said the buyout aimed \"to safeguard our guest experience and protect jobs where possible\". He said its immediate priority was to continue operating at the remaining 64 restaurants and 343 delivery sites and to support colleagues through the transition.But with so much money going in to running its restaurants, it likely can't afford to invest too much in its delivery service because the sector is \"complex and partnering with existing delivery apps comes at a cost\", Mr Hawkley says .But, he adds, cutting its costs by leaving oversaturated towns and city centres could be a good way to adapt.More weekend picks",

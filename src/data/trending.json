    "body": "6 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterGetty ImagesLily Allen, pictured in June, details the breakdown of her marriage on her new album West End GirlSinger Lily Allen has announced she will perform her new album in its entirety when she tours the UK in March 2026.West End Girl has become one of the most talked about albums of the year since its release last Friday, due to its candid lyrics.The album details some of the events that led to the breakdown of her marriage to US actor David Harbour, best known for appearing in Stranger Things. The tour will stop in Glasgow, Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, Manchester, Nottingham, Cambridge, Bristol and Cardiff, before concluding with two nights at the London Palladium. Allen last toured between 2018 and 2019, following the release of her fourth studio album No Shame. She has only made occasional live appearances since then, such as appearing in Glastonbury sets by Olivia Rodrigo and Shy FX. However, in the intervening years, Allen has also become a successful stage actress, starring in the first production of 2:22 - A Ghost Story when it opened in the West End shortly after the pandemic.This period is what inspired the title of the album, West End Girl, and Allen appears to sing about how being cast the play sparked the chain of events that led to her separation from Harbour.In interviews, Allen has stressed the lyrics aren't necessarily the gospel truth - because she \"wasn't sure what was real, and what was in my head\" as she processed the end of the relationship.The album's lyrics, as well as interviews she gave at the time, suggest that Harbour was surprised and envious that Allen had secured a leading West End role without having to audition, and that his \"demeanour started to change\" after she was cast.She sings that starring in 2:22 led to a distance developing between the couple, both literally and metaphorically, which resulted in Harbour suggesting an open relationship.Getty ImagesLily Allen (right) joined Olivia Rodrigo at Glastonbury in 2022,  and again at the O2 Arena last yearAllen sings on the record about how this led to an \"arrangement\" with Harbour where he could be with other women, but the rules were \"there had to be payment, it had to be with strangers\".But, before long, Allen hears of a relationship her husband appears to have with \"Madeline\" - a pseudonym - which falls outside their arrangement. Harbour has not publicly commented on the content of the album. However, he appears to still have a relationship with Allen and her children, and was seen taking her daughters to a theme park last weekend.All 14 songs on West End Girl were written by Allen, mainly in collaboration with her musical director Blue May.Allen has suggested that some of the songs are written \"in character\", saying that the lyrics \"could be considered autofiction\" - a genre that combines autobiography and fiction.She rose to fame in 2006 with her debut album Alright, Still, and had number one hits including Smile, The Fear, and her cover of Keane's Somewhere Only We Know, which was featured in a John Lewis advert.She had two number one albums in the UK, It's Not Me It's You and Sheezus, while her 2018 record No Shame was nominated for the Mercury Prize.She released a candid memoir, My Thoughts Exactly, in the same year, but took a break from music shortly afterwards, and began dating Harbour in 2019.The singer will perform West End Girl in the order the songs appear on the record for her tour in March.Tickets for the tour, which launches in March 2026, go on sale on 7 November.

The BBC has approached Paris Match for a response.Prince William and Catherine are known to want to create as private a family life as possible for their three children, and to protect them from media intrusion.\"Their Royal Highnesses The Prince and Princess of Wales, have been successful in legal proceedings brought in France against the owner of Paris Match, which published a grossly intrusive article and long-lens paparazzi photographs of their private family holiday in the Alps in April,\" the Kensington Palace spokesperson said on Thursday.\"The ruling affirms that, notwithstanding their public duties as members of The Royal Family, Their Royal Highnesses and their children are entitled to respect for their private lives and family time, without unlawful interference and intrusion.\"The Prince and Princess of Wales are committed to protecting their private family time and ensuring that their children can grow up without undue scrutiny and interference.\"They will not hesitate to take such action as is necessary to enforce those boundaries.\"It is understood that the summary proceedings were issued on 28 April, just shy of two weeks after the article was published, with an oral hearing held in June.Further developments are understood to have taken place in September, with an interim order issued by the president of the first chamber of the Nanterre Court which was sealed into a final order on 14 October.The court is understood to have ruled that the magazine had infringed the privacy and image rights of Prince William, Catherine and their children, with Paris Match ordered to pay the couple's legal costs in France and print a judicial notice acknowledging the breach.",

    "body": "50 minutes agoImran Rahman-JonesTechnology reporterThe UK's media regulator has criticised O2 for raising its prices by more than it promised customers when they took out their phone contracts.Ofcom said it was \"disappointed\" with the firm, and said it was going against \"the spirit of our rules\" around being transparent to customers about price rises.In January, new rules were brought in to stop phone and broadband companies raising prices in the middle of a contract without warning.O2 said it has not gone against the regulation and that Ofcom's rules \"do not prevent companies from increasing annual price changes – for example, to invest in improving networks\".The company said it spends £700m a year on improving infrastructure and customers can leave their contracts without a penalty.But consumer expert Martin Lewis said he was \"up in arms\" over the move, which was \"making a mockery of Ofcom\". He said on The Martin Lewis Podcast he believed this would lead to other companies following suit.\"O2 customers' prices are going up - but likely it means the door is open for all of us to now see prices by more than we were told when we signed up,\" he said.O2 told its customers they had 30 days to leave their contracts without any termination charges - though if their plan included a handset, they would still have to pay that off in full.But Mr Lewis said older and vulnerable customers tend not to switch and may miss the 30-day window, as the price rises do not come in until April 2026.On Wednesday, O2 emailed its customers to say it would be increasing the price of their contracts by £2.50 a month from April.It had previously advertised that monthly prices would only go up by £1.80.\"Today, we've written to the major mobile companies reminding them of their obligations to treat customers fairly,\" Ofcom said.\"We encourage any customer who wants to avoid these price rises to exercise their right to exit without penalty and sign up to a new deal.\"Ofcom's rules were brought in to protect consumers and stop unexpected price rises occurring in the middle of a contract.They stated companies had to tell customers how much their bill would rise by \"in pounds and pence\" before they signed up.At the time, Ofcom's director for networks and communication, Natalie Black CBE, said: \"Our new rules mean there will be no nasty surprises, and customers will know how much they will be paying and when, through clear labelling.\"But the rules only banned price hikes linked to inflation.O2's price increase is a flat fee rather than a percentage of the monthly bill.Telecoms analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight said \"O2 is pushing the boundaries\" of the regulation.\"This is extremely unfortunate, given that the mobile operator should be focused on retaining customers in a cut-throat market,\" he'd told BBC News.Meanwhile Tom MacInnes, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said it showed Ofcom's actions \"haven't gone far enough\".\"The regulator needs to wake up and make these essential markets work for everyone,\" he said.\"Ofcom needs to go back to the drawing board and bring forward plans to stamp out mid-contract price rises once and for all.\"Mr Lewis also said he had written a letter about this addressed to the chancellor, the technology secretary and the head of Ofcom.BBC News has contacted them for comment.Ofcom did not comment on Mr Lewis' letter.Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at Uswitch, said while the regulator's latest telecoms complaints figures were \"at some of the lowest levels ever\", service issues were still the main driver of complaints about mobile and broadband providers.\"Against the backdrop of increasing annual price rises, providers need to recognise their responsibility to deliver corresponding improvements in service and value,\" he said. \"For consumers, this data is a timely reminder to compare deals regularly and switch if their provider isn't sufficiently meeting their needs.\"",

    "body": "Israel has received via the Red Cross in Gaza two coffins which the Palestinian armed group Hamas says contain the bodies of deceased hostages, according to the Israeli prime minister's office.Israeli forces will now transfer the bodies to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.Hamas's armed wing announced earlier that it had recovered the bodies of Israeli hostages Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch.On Tuesday, the Israeli government accused Hamas of violating the Gaza ceasefire deal after the group handed over a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza.It said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, a hostage whose body had been recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023.The Israeli military also released footage filmed by a drone that showed Hamas members removing a body bag containing the remains from a building in Gaza City, reburying it, and then staging the discovery in front of Red Cross staff.The Red Cross said its staff were unaware that the body bag had been moved before their arrival and that the staged recovery was \"unacceptable\".Hamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".Hours later, the Israeli government accused Hamas of another ceasefire violation, saying the group's fighters had killed an Israeli soldier in an attack in an area of southern Gaza.Hamas claimed it was not involved in the incident in the Rafah area, but Israel's prime minister ordered a wave of air strikes across Gaza on Tuesday night in response. The Israeli military said it attacked \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\".Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 104 Palestinians were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, making it the deadliest day since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.US President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire agreement, which his administration brokered along with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, but he added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.Under the deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Eleven of the 13 dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, in which more than 68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry.",

There's a no-fly zone for drones and the road has been closed by the Refood bioenergy site.\"Curtis Borkowski, who works on a building site nearby, said he had seen the helicopter going towards Bentley around ten minutes before learning of the crash.\"As it flew over Doncaster, the engine sounded really bad,\" he said.Lee Needham, who lives in the area, said the crash site was close to houses, train tracks, industrial units and electrical pylons.\"Whoever was piloting the helicopter more than likely saved numerous lives,\" he said.Related internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoCharlotte EdwardsBusiness reporterVirgin Trains has moved closer to being able to run rail services through the Channel Tunnel after the regulator approved its application to share a depot with Eurostar.The decision by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) means Eurostar's monopoly on passenger services is set to be broken for the first time since the tunnel opened in 1994.Temple Mills railway storehouse in east London is the only depot in the UK able to accommodate the larger trains used in continental Europe and which is already linked to the cross-Channel line.Virgin aims to start running services from 2030. Eurostar said it was reviewing the decision and \"considering our next steps to ensure we can continue to grow\".\"Our priority is to deliver for passengers the benefits of the investments in a new fleet, jobs, and depot facilities that we recently announced,\" a Eurostar spokesperson said.Previously, the ORR had said the Temple Mills depot had enough space to either house an expanded Eurostar fleet or accommodate a rival company's trains – but not both.The regulator said a number of steps needed to be taken before new international services could run. Virgin needs to enter into a commercial agreement with Eurostar, will have to secure finance, access to track and stations, and have to get safety approvals from UK and EU authorities.But the ORR said its decision unlocked plans for around £700m of investment and could create 400 new jobs, describing it as \"a win for passengers, customer choice, and economic growth\".Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, said: \"The ORR's decision is the right one for consumers – it's time to end this 30-year monopoly and bring some Virgin magic to the cross-Channel route.\"Rail Minister Lord Hendy said he was \"incredibly pleased\" with the ORR's decision and called it a \"significant step forward\".\"Allowing Virgin Trains to share this vital facility will give passengers greater choice, better value and improve connectivity for millions, as well as drive innovation, lower fares and promote greener connections with Europe,\" he said.Martin Jones, deputy director of Access and International at the ORR, said: \"While there is still some way to go before the first new services can run, we stand ready to work with Virgin Trains as their plans develop.\"Several firms had wanted to start operating services between London and mainland Europe, including Spanish start-up Evolyn, Richard Branson's Virgin and a partnership between Gemini Trains and Uber.The ORR only approved Virgin's application on Thursday and rejected applications from Evolyn, Gemini and Trenitalia.Virgin said it planned to launch rail services from London St Pancras to Europe from 2030.This will include services to Paris Gare du Nord, Brussels-Midi and Amsterdam Centraal, with future plans to expand further across France, and into Germany and Switzerland.The plans would mean Virgin Trains returning to the rails for the first time since 2019, when the company lost its contract to Avanti West Coast.Virgin Trains had operated a service running from London Euston via Birmingham and Manchester to Scotland for 22 years before it was disqualified from bidding for the franchise.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondent in LeidenReutersInitial exit polls had put D66 Leader Rob Jetten (left) in the lead, while Geert Wilders' Freedom Party has lost groundRob Jetten's centrist-liberal party D66 are in a neck-and-neck race with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders in the Dutch election, according to almost complete results.With almost 99% of votes counted, both D66 and Wilders' Freedom Party were  heading for 26 seats in the 150-member parliament, a projection from Dutch news agency ANP said on Thursday.Initial exit polls had put Jetten in the lead. \"Millions of Dutch people have turned a page; they've said goodbye to a politics of negativity,\" he told supporters.A downbeat Wilders had earlier conceded the result was not what he wanted, having lost 11 seats, but said he had still achieved his second best result ever.But as the final results trickled in on Thursday, the race became so close that the lead flipped between the two frontrunners. Then, the last preliminary results came in from the capital Amsterdam and Rob Jetten's liberals moved significantly ahead by more than 15,000 votes.Both parties were below 17% of the national vote, and three other parties were not far behind, including the conservative-liberal VVD on 22 seats, followed by the left-wing GreenLeft-Labour party and the Christian Democrats.Wilders led the polls throughout the election campaign, but after he pulled the plug on his own coalition in June in a row over asylum and migration, all the mainstream leaders made clear they did not wish to work with him again.He admits he has little hope of forming a government himself, but said on X on Thursday that if his party did top the vote he should have the first try. Even without a clear-cut victory, Jetten - who staged a remarkable campaign - would stand a stronger chance of leading the next administration.Only a few weeks ago, the polls put D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - on just 12 seats.But the photogenic, 38-year-old liberal leader capitalised on polished performances in a succession of TV debates and interviews. The fact that he also competed in a TV quiz show called The Smartest Person in the weeks leading to the vote only added to his public profile.EPARob Jetten, 38, led a highly polished campaign and outperformed his rivals in TV debatesJetten was careful not to claim victory on Wednesday night, despite the party mood among his supporters.The conservative liberal VVD of Dilan Yesilgöz was also heading for a successful night in third place and her party would be a good fit for any potential Jetten-led coalition.Going into Wednesday's election, voters knew the result would be on a knife-edge, as five parties were in the running to win. Wilders' PVV Freedom Party won 37 seats in November 2023, but many of those voters will have been put off by the realisation he would struggle to find parties to work with him again.It took seven months for Wilders to reach a deal with coalition partners in 2024, only to bring down the government 11 months later. Rob Jetten made clear he was looking for a broad-based coalition that was both \"stable and ambitious\", and he pointed out it was unprecedented for the winning party to score fewer than 30 seats in parliament.He named the Labour-GreenLeft party of former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans as one potential coalition partner, along with Yesilgöz's conservative-liberal VVD and the revitalised Christian Democrats.That may not be easy as Yesilgöz has vowed not to work with the left. Another option is JA21, a populist right-wing party with 9 MPs, but that would leave him just short of the 76-seat majority he needs.SEM VAN DER WAL/ANP/AFPDilan Yesilgöz (R) also had a good election after good performances in TV debatesThe exit poll spelt bad news for Frans Timmermans, whose left-wing party had long been second in the polls and is now set to come fourth. \"Better times lie ahead,\" he promised his supporters late on Wednesday. \"Of course I'm hugely disappointed,\" he added, and announced he was stepping down and taking responsibility for the result.Timmermans and Wilders are both in their early 60s and entered politics at the same time, and there is now a sense that Dutch voters are prepared to try something new.Wilders, however, said he was going nowhere: \"You won't be rid of me until I'm 80.\" He remained bullish about his Freedom Party's performance: \"I would naturally rather have seen more seats... but we have still had our second best result.\"Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam said Wilders' party had lost the support of many of its moderate voters to other parties as well as many on the more radical side.But, he said, \"the losses could have been worse\", given that Wilders had himself broken up the last coalition and had campaigned less actively than his rivals.Anna Holligan/BBCSupporters of Jetten's centrist liberals were overjoyed with the surprise resultThere was palpable excitement as D66 supporters gathered for the results at a music venue in Leiden, a university city between Amsterdam and The Hague. As the exit polls became clear, the words \"yes, we can\" were voiced repeatedly as a kind of party mantra in the hall.Taking to the stage, the man now tipped to be the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch history told supporters \"we did it - the best result D66 has ever achieved\".\"We also know that millions of Dutch people voted for other parties, and I also feel a very heavy responsibility for [all of them],\" said Rob Jetten. \"We will do all we can in the coming years to show all the Dutch people that politics and government can be there for them again so they can think big again and act big again so the Netherlands can move forward.\"This election was partly fought on migration and overcrowded asylum centres, but the biggest issue for voters was the chronic housing shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Jetten's party has said it will build 10 cities as part of its plan to tackle the crisis.\"It was a campaign of optimism, it shows the Dutch are tired of two years of standstill, we recognise big challenges and we want progress on those,\" said D66 supporter Eline. \"It shows the Dutch are craving a prime minister who is able to unite the country and tackle the major challenges our country and the world are facing.\"Another potential coalition partner for the liberals is the Christian Democrats, who only two years ago looked down and out with just a handful of seats. Now they are projected to win 18. \"What a fantastic result - two years ago we could not have dared to dream of this,\" CDA leader Henri Bontenbal told supporters as they chanted his name.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe UK's winter flu season has begun five weeks earlier than usual, health officials are warning.The UK Health Security Agency said cases were rising quickly among children and young people – and warned the virus would soon start to spread across older age groups.The organisation urged people eligible for the flu vaccine to come forward to get protected.But they said it was too early to say how difficult and serious this year's flu season would be.Two of the worst winter flu seasons of the past decade have been seen in the last three years, something partly attributed to the bounce-back of the virus after Covid restrictions and when immunity has been low.Last year nearly 8,000 people died from flu and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths.UKHSA flu lead Dr Suzanna McDonald said: \"We are worried that flu has started to circulate a little bit earlier than usual.\"It's a very serious disease. It's not just a nasty cold. \"We have started to see early activity, particularly in young adults, mainly sort of university age students, and also with school-aged children. \"We would expect in the coming weeks that this will start to spread throughout the community and this is something that we will monitor very closely.\"Dr Alex Allen, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, urged all eligible people to come forward for vaccination.Everyone aged 65 and over, pregnant women and those with certain long-term health conditions can get a free flu jab on the NHS.\"If you're eligible for a vaccine it is because you are at greater risk of severe illness – every year we see many thousands end up in hospital and far too many deaths from flu. \"It's crucial that everyone eligible books their appointment as soon as possible. The vaccine is our best defence.\"He also reminded parents of under 16-year-olds to return consent forms to school so their children can get vaccinated, or if they are aged two and three to arrange a vaccine via their GP.\"The nasal spray vaccine can help stop your child from getting very unwell and reduce the risk of passing flu to vulnerable family members.\"Anyone with flu or Covid symptoms – including high temperature, cough, and feeling tired or achy – should minimise contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable. \"If you need to go out with symptoms, consider wearing a face covering, wash hands regularly and ensure indoor spaces are well ventilated,\" he added. Meanwhile, UKHSA said Covid cases were decreasing and the virus was now at baseline levels.",

    "body": "16 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC News ShutterstockWhen now 16-year-old Helen got her first period, it was her dad who helped her with it as he was the parent who happened to be at home. Chatting about periods with young people can be awkward, even more so if you don't experience them yourself, but Helen says her dad had always spoken openly about what to expect which made that first time much easier.Dads \"can't tell you how it actually feels or how it can affect your life sometimes, but they can still provide advice and talk about it,\" she says.Yet talking about periods can still feel like uncomfortable for many and even today, it's often left to mothers to handle.Helen's father John Adams is one of a growing number of dads who are challenging the unfounded stigma.John was a stay-at-home parent when his two daughters - now 16 and 12 - were younger, and said some parents he'd spoken to felt too uncomfortable to talk to their kids about periods.\"They were waiting for them to learn about it at school, but I don't believe it's just a teacher's job to talk about this.\"John spoke to both daughters about what they might experience, the level of pain they could be in and the various sanitary product options.\"Men maybe blunder in but they go in without that baggage and just sort of talk about things practically,\" he tells BBC Radio 5 Live's Time of the Month. John, who now works in education, admits he's no expert but he spoke to his wife and mother about it and used books and online resources to guide him.'You can't hide from it'For him, periods are a matter of health, not embarrassment and while the idea of dads discussing menstruation still divides opinion, John says it's important to \"be there and approachable for your children\".As a widowed father, Roy had no choice. He has been raising his daughter alone after his wife died from cancer.He started talking about periods when she was nine, by going through some books with her about what to expect.  \"Initially the colour drained from her face, but we spoke about it openly.\"Later, he showed his daughter a pad and demonstrated how she should stick it onto her pants and suggested she have a test drive of one.\"Things are scary when you don't know what's going on. \"I'm preparing my daughter for life and part of that is periods, sex, boyfriends, relationships. It's all difficult but you can't hide from it.\"For many women, the memory of their first period is far less open. Hannah Routledge, who works for the not-for-profit group Hey Girls, which works to stop period poverty, remembers hers with discomfort. \"I started my periods really young. I was only 10,\" she says. \"I went to a school that had no provision, no bins even.\"Hannah RoutledgeHannah Routledge says Pads for Dads offers resources and guidance to help fathers talk about periodsHey Girls launched its Pads for Dads campaign in 2019, offering free guidance and resources to help fathers have those early talks.\"It was designed to break the stigma around periods for dads and parents in general,\" she explains. \"Don't wait for a big conversation, it's about having lots of smaller ones, making sure you've got products in the house and just being supportive.\"Hannah says it's also essential parents talk to their sons about periods to make them aware. Dr Nighat Arif, a GP who specialises in women's health, started talking to her six-year-old son when he found one of her tampons in the bathroom.\"I said 'This is something that mummy uses because she bleeds'\".  Initially, this made him anxious, but she told him it was normal and happened to all women every month.Hannah says attitudes are changing fast and has even noticed a shift in her own dad who would have once avoided period conversations but now \"if his granddaughters needed something or wanted to have that conversation, I think he'd be much more open\". Reducing workplace stigmaConsultant gynaecologist Dr Christine Ekechi, who works in the NHS, says there's often a double standard when it comes to parents talking to their children about puberty.\"There are so many single mothers with sons and we don't tell them they cannot talk to their sons about puberty and adolescence and about protective sex.\"So why do we still have this hang up if it's the other way around?\"An increase in openness at home also has wider effects and Dr Ekechi believes informed fathers make better colleagues and leaders too.This can help reduce period stigma in the workplace and improve menstrual equity at work. Above all though, \"it's a fantastic way to improve a bond between a father and a daughter,\" she says.",

    "body": "4 hours agoLaura BickerChina correspondent Watch: US and China's different reports of their trade meetingUS President Donald Trump came away from his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping full of bombastic optimism. He called it a \"great success\" and rated it 12, on a scale of 1 to 10. China was less enthusiastic. Beijing's initial statement sounds like an instruction manual, with Xi urging teams on both sides to \"follow up as soon as possible\".Trump is after a deal that could happen \"pretty soon\", while Beijing, it appears, wants to keep talking because it's playing the long game.  There was a more detailed second Chinese statement that echoed what Trump had said on board Air Force One.Among other things, the US would lower tariffs on Chinese imports, and China would suspend controls on the export of rare earths - critical minerals without which you cannot make smartphones, electric cars and, perhaps more crucially, military equipment.There is no deal yet, and negotiators on both sides have already been talking for months to iron out the details. But Thursday's agreement is still a breakthrough. It steadies what has become a rocky relationship between the world's two biggest economies and it assures global markets. But it is only a temporary truce. It doesn't solve the differences at the heart of such a competitive relationship. \"The US and China are going in different directions,\" says Kelly Ann Shaw, who was an economic adviser to Trump in his first term.\"It's really about managing the breakup in a way that does a limited amount of damage, that preserves US interests, and I think from China's perspective, preserves their own interests. But this is not a relationship that is necessarily going to improve dramatically anytime soon.\"'Struggle, but don't break'There is an art to doing a deal with Trump.It involves flattery - and most countries have tried it, including on his trip to Asia so far. South Korea gave him an enormous golden crown, while Japan's prime minister  nominated him for a Nobel Peace prize.But the Chinese leader offered only a meeting at a South Korean air base, where he and Trump would cross paths - as one flew in to the country, and the other departed.  It didn't feel out of step with China's guarded but defiant response from the start of Trump's trade war. Just days after the American president increased tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing retaliated with its own levies.Chinese officials told the world that there would be no winners in a trade war. Like Trump, Xi too believed he had the upper hand - and he seemed to have a plan. He decided to use the country's economic weight - as the world's factory, as a massive market for its goods - to push back. Unlike Trump, he does not need to worry about elections or a worried vote base. That doesn't mean that Xi faces no pressures - he certainly does. He needs China's economy to grow, and create jobs and wealth so the Chinese Communist Party's power is not challenged by instability or discontent.

Beijing would \"fight until the bitter end\" was the message from various ministries.  \"China's main principle is struggle, but don't break,\" says Keyu Jin, author of The New China Playbook.\"And it has escalated to de-escalate, which is a very new tactic.\"Xi had a planThat is, China hit Trump where it hurt. For the first time, it limited exports of rare earths to the US - and China processes around 90% of the world's rare earth metals.\"The nuance often missed in the rare earths debate is that China has an overwhelming position over the most strategic bit of the rare earth supply chain -  the heavy rare earths used in advanced defence systems,\" says Jason Bedford, macroeconomics expert and investment analyst. \"That advantage is far harder to dislodge than other parts of the rare earths industry.\" So getting China to relax those export controls became a priority for Washington - and that was a key bit of leverage for Xi when he sat down with Trump.China had also stopped buying US soybeans, which was aimed at farmers in Republican states - Trump's base. Reports this week say Beijing has already started buying soybeans from the US again. \"If the US thinks that it can dominate China, it can suppress China, I think has proven to be wrong,\" Ms Jin says. \"This is really signalling to the world, especially the United States, that China needs to be respected, that it will not kowtow or give too many political or economic concessions.\"Getty ImagesUS soybean farmers have been impacted by China's decision to stop buying the productTrump's team has found itself dealing with a stronger China compared to his first term. Beijing has learnt lessons, too. It spent the last four years finding new trade partners and relying less on US exports - nearly a fifth of Chinese exports once went to the US but in the first half of this year that figure dropped to 11%.Xi showed up in South Korea - after officially confirming the meeting with Trump just the day before - to take part in political theatre that seemed to underline a position of strength. As usual, he was in front of Trump for the handshake. He stood unblinking as Trump leaned forward to whisper in his ear - the kind of ad lib moment China abhors.At the end of the meeting, Trump ushered Xi to his waiting car where the Chinese leader was immediately surrounded by his security team. The US president was then forced to wander off camera to find his vehicle alone.And yet, there are many positives to take away from this superpower summit - the first of  Trump's second term in office.\"China wants to be in a position of strength when it comes to negotiations, but it won't break the relationship, because that is in nobody's interest, including China's,\" Ms Jin says. For starters, businesses, the markets and other countries caught in between the rivals will welcome the calm. But observers are not sure it will last. \"I think over the medium to long-term, the US and China have very serious differences, and I would not be surprised to see some more destabilisation in the next three to six months,\" says Ms Shaw.Has Trump got the bigger, better deal with China he always wanted? Not yet.Even if he does get a deal, and the two sides put ink on paper, Beijing has now shown that it is not willing to bend to Washington - and that it is more resilient.The rivalry between the two sides is likely to continue, if or even when there is ever a done deal.",

    "body": "Trump hails 'amazing' meeting with China's Xi but no formal trade deal agreed 11 minutes agoLaura Bicker,China correspondent , Anthony Zurcher,North America correspondent and Flora DruryUS President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have met for the first time in six years - raising hopes for a de-escalation of tensions between the world's two biggest economies.Trump described the talks, held in South Korea, as \"amazing\", while Beijing said they had reached a consensus to resolve \"major trade issues\".Relations have been tense since Trump began imposing new tariffs on China, prompting retaliation from Beijing. The two agreed to a truce in May, but tensions remained high.Thursday's talks did not lead to a formal agreement but the announcements suggest they are closer to a deal - the details of which have long been subject to behind-the-scenes negotiations.Trade deals normally take years to negotiate. Countries around the world have been thrown into resolving differences with Trump within a matter of months, after he imposed sweeping tariffs - or import taxes - on some of his top trade partners. Some of those key trading partners are in Asia, where Trump has spent the last several days.Tariff 'truce' and movement on rare earthsChina has agreed to suspend export control measures it had placed on rare earths, crucial for the production of everything from smartphones to fighter jets. This has been seen as a key win for Trump from his meeting with Xi.A jubilant Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he had also got China to start immediately buying a \"tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products\". Retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans by Beijing had effectively halted imports from the US, harming US farmers - who constitute a key voting block for Trump.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later told Fox Business that China had agreed to buy 12 million metric tonnes of soybeans this season, and would follow that up with a minimum of 25 million tonnes per year for the next three years.In the immediate aftermath of the meeting, the US also said it would drop part of the tariffs it has levied on Beijing over the flow of ingredients used in making fentanyl to the US. Trump has imposed severe tariffs on China, as well as Canada and Mexico, for their perceived failure to clamp down on the flow of that drug.Xi and Trump find temporary truce as China plays longer gameWhat tariffs has Trump announced and why?The president of the US-China Business Council welcomed the news on tariffs and rare earths, describing these as the most significant outcome of the talks.Sean Stein told the BBC: \"You could say that this is a truce, that we are now locked in place on tariffs and we don't have to worry every 90 days where other it's going to roll over\".Speaking to Business Today from Beijing, Mr Stein said this \"gives business plenty of time to work on the Chinese and the US administration to make sure that they're focused on some of the long-standing issues that have troubled the trade relationship between the two countries.\"However, it seems other tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, will remain in place, meaning that goods arriving in the US from China are still being taxed at a rate of over 40% for US importers.More positively for Beijing, it will now be able to speak to Jensen Huang, the head of US tech firm Nvidia - according to Trump. Nvidia is at the heart of the two countries' fight over AI chips: China wants high-end chips but the US wants to limit China's access, citing national security.Beijing has also extended an invitation to Trump to visit China in April - yet another sign of thawing relations.There was, however, no mention of a breakthrough on TikTok. The US has sought to take the video-sharing app's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance for national security reasons. Beijing said afterwards it would continue to work to resolve the issues.China more measured, talking of 'good start'The meeting also showed the gulf between the two leaders' approaches.Xi was self-contained, and said only what he had prepared. He entered the meeting knowing he had a strong hand. China had learned from Trump's first term, leveraging its chokehold on rare earths, and diversifying its trade partners so it is less reliant on the US.Afterwards, he was far more measured in his language than Trump. The two sides would be working on delivering outcomes that will serve as a \"reassuring pill\" for both countries' economies, he said.Trump was - as always - more ad-lib. But the US president was also noticeably more tense than he had been for the rest of his whirlwind trip to South East Asia - a reflection of the high stakes in Thursday's meeting.The glamour and pageantry on show since he arrived at his first stop in Malaysia just five days ago was also absent.Gone were the gold-laden palaces of the sort he was welcomed to in Japan on Tuesday. Instead, a building at an airport, lying behind barbed wire and security checkpoints.The military bands which welcomed Trump to South Korea on Wednesday were nowhere to be seen.Instead, the only sign something important was going on inside was the heavy police and media presence.But despite the quieter public face, what was happening inside was arguably the most significant hour and 20 minutes of the trip.Henry Wang, a former adviser to China's State Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Trump and Xi's talks \"went very well\".It may not have been a trade deal, but a \"framework and structure has been laid\", he added - calling it \"a good start\".Additional reporting by Jonathan JosephsWatch: US and China's different reports of their trade meeting",

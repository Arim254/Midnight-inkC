    "body": "Will the start of 2026 see a change of fortune for BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton, whose title hopes are fading fast?After Sutton made a strong start to the season, AI has taken charge of the predictions title race, clinching another win last week.\"It's been a bad start to the new year for me, with AI top of the table,\" Sutton said.\"I also lost to my daugher Sophia at cards over Christmas. We played rummy and I think she was cheating - a lot like AI, she was definitely getting some help from somewhere.\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.For week 20, he takes on singer-songwriter Andrew Cushin, who is a Newcastle fan.Cushin's second album, Love Is For Everyone, was released last year and reached the top 40. He has toured arenas in Europe and the United States with Louis Tomlinson and also played a sold-out hometown gig at Newcastle's City Hall in October 2025.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, Andrew CushinImage caption, Cushin has been championed by Pete Doherty and Noel Gallagher, who produced and played guitar on his track 'Where's My Family Gone'Alan Shearer was one of Cushin's first heroes, but his idol as a kid was a Toon player who stopped goals, rather than scored them.\"I first went to St James' when I was very young, but my first proper memory was against Stoke in 2008,\" he explained. \"We were 2-0 up at half-time, and I remember being on the concourse at half-time and thinking how great it was to be a Newcastle supporter.\"That didn't last long - we ended up throwing the game away, conceding a couple of late goals and drawing 2-2 - but it was watching Shay Given pull off some big saves that day which made me want to be a keeper.\"Everyone else looked the same, wearing the same shirts, and it was just that one player, the goalkeeper, standing out. You are the last line of defence and you can be the hero, and I always liked that gamble - if it went wrong it was my fault, or I could be the reason why we get the points.\"I was quite keen on that, and then I suppose that transitioned into me being a musician, where it is my name on the poster. I guess I've always liked the attention!\"Cushin's career between the sticks saw him play in the youth team for non-league Newcastle Benfield, but he has had to hang up his gloves to focus on playing the guitar.\"It was a sad day when I had to stop playing, but it came after I'd spent some time in the studio with Noel Gallagher, and I realised I couldn't afford to carry on as a keeper and risk breaking my fingers,\" he added.\"So I always say it was Shay who inspired me to put the gloves on, and Noel who told me to take them off again!\"Chris Sutton and Andrew Cushin were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.Premier League predictionsSaturday, 3 JanuaryVilla Park, 12:30 GMTNottingham Forest did not have a very good Christmas, losing three games in a row.Sean Dyche's side had plenty of possession against Everton on Tuesday but did not create many chances, and were picked off. That was a bit of a surprise, because of the Toffees' lack of firepower.Forest are lucky West Ham have been so bad, because that is the only reason they still have a bit of breathing space above the bottom three.They travel to play the Hammers on Tuesday, so they may prioritise that game and rest players here - it is that time of year where every squad is stretched.This game is more about how Aston Villa respond to their defeat at Arsenal, because they took a bit of a pasting.I don't think this will be easy for Villa, but I am expecting them to bounce back and win a tight game.I've seen that AI goes for a 2-1 scoreline most of the time and I won't be doing that for every game this week, but I do think that's how this one will end up.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Andrew's prediction: I don't think Villa will fall away after losing to Arsenal. It's sad to see the demise of Forest, who have not been the same side this season, and I can see Villa steamrollering them here. 3-1AI's prediction: 2-1Amex Stadium, 15:00I keep backing Brighton to win and keep a clean sheet, which is part of the reason my predictions have been going so badly - they are on a six-game winless run.Burnley's wait for a victory has gone on a lot longer, and they have taken only two points from their past 10 games.I keep saying the Clarets have been competitive, but that is not going to keep them up. Their points tally is what matters, and that means they are bang in trouble.Despite their poor run, I still see the Seagulls as being able to cause anyone problems.They pushed Arsenal close last week and I always think they have a goal in them but, more importantly in terms of how this game might go, they are usually pretty reliable at home.Villa are the only team to have won at the Amex Stadium this season, and I don't see Scott Parker's side getting anything at all on the south coast.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Andrew's prediction: Burnley gave us a good game the other night and this will be close too, but Brighton will have a little bit too much for them. I love Brighton's Yankuba Minteh - he's a brilliant player, and I wish we had never let him leave. 1-0AI's prediction: 3-0Molineux, 15:00Wolves' performance in their draw with Manchester United underlined what I already thought.Yes, they have lost a couple of key players in Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri, but they have still got enough in their squad to have done far better than they have done this season.This is a massive week for West Ham, with their relegation rivals Nottingham Forest up next after this game.The Hammers are looking pretty desperate but their recent away record actually is not too bad - they were well beaten at Manchester City but, before then, they drew three in a row at Bournemouth, Manchester United and Brighton.They probably feel under less pressure when they are on the road, but I am still reluctant to back them to win anywhere at the moment.I feel the same way about Wolves, who have now gone half the season without a victory. Let's call this one a draw.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Andrew's prediction: Wolves surely can't go the whole season without winning a game - a win has got to come from somewhere. With West Ham struggling too, Wolves will probably fancy this a bit, but it's a must-win game for the Hammers too. 0-1AI's prediction: 1-1Vitality Stadium, 17:30I covered Bournemouth's 2-2 draw with Chelsea on Tuesday, and the Cherries really impressed me.Andoni Iraola's side have gone 10 games without a win, but they have drawn four of their past five matches and they carried a real threat against the Blues.Their goals came from a couple of long throws but they did look dangerous in open play and, with the way Iraola plays, this is not going to be easy for Arsenal.Gunners boss Mikel Arteta will know that already after Bournemouth did the double over his side last season, but he and his players must be full of confidence after the way they despatched Villa last time out.To beat Villa was a huge result and to produce that performance to go with it was Arsenal really flexing their muscles.It said to everyone 'we are the team to beat' and you have to think they will back it up by beating Bournemouth as well.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Andrew's prediction: Arsenal ended 2025 really well with that win over Villa and the pressure is off them a little bit after City dropped points against Sunderland.I actually think it's more dangerous for them that they have got a bit of breathing space now, rather than thinking they have to win every week, because that is when mistakes could happen - but, the form Bournemouth are in, I can't see them stopping Arsenal. 1-3AI's prediction: 1-3Sunday, 4 JanuaryElland Road, 12:30I am loving Daniel Farke's Leeds United more and more, every passing week. They showed incredible guts to go to Anfield on Thursday and get a point, and they almost took all three.Dominic Calvert-Lewin will start this game after being rested until the last 20 minutes against Liverpool, and he can cause Manchester United all sorts of problems.Seeing Calvert-Lewin start among the substitutes raised a few eyebrows because of the run of scoring he is on, but that is the difficulty managers have at this time of year, when games come thick and fast.I know I go against Manchester United a lot with my predictions, but I am still waiting for them to prove me wrong.They have done all right recently, but nothing more. They have only lost two of their past 13 games, which is decent, but they have drawn five times in that run and, when I watch them, they are just not very exciting.In fact, they are dull. Their fans used to sing 'glory glory Man United' but now they are more likely to sing 'boring boring Man United', when I expected a bit more from them this season.You certainly wouldn't accuse Leeds United of being boring at the moment.Maybe the way they will come at Manchester United will suit the visitors, but Ruben Amorim's side seem to lack leadership when Bruno Fernandes is missing, and I am going to back Leeds United instead.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Andrew's prediction: I am going to go for a bit of an upset here. There is obviously a big rivalry between the two teams so Elland Road will be bouncing, and Leeds have been really good recently. 1-0AI's prediction: 1-2Hill Dickinson Stadium, 15:00Everton have had a great season so far. Beating Forest was an important result for them, because the six teams immediately above them all dropped points.They are now in eighth place and, with another home league game against Wolves to come after this one, their fans must be thinking this week is a real opportunity to climb higher.It won't be easy against Brentford, however. Keith Andrews' side took seven points out of a possible nine over Christmas, and are also in the top half of the table.I actually think the Bees are a better team when Jordan Henderson isn't playing - Andrews left him out of their wins over Bournemouth and Wolves and they seem to have a bit more energy without him in the team.Whether Henderson plays or not, I just can't see a lot of goals here - one will probably be enough to win it.Brentford are very effective on the counter-attack and are certainly capable of getting a result, but I am going to back Everton to edge it.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Andrew's prediction: This is your 1-1 draw of the week, isn't it? I was talking about these games with my mates and with this one they are eighth and ninth in the table, only a point apart. There will be very little to separate them on the pitch, either. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-1Craven Cottage, 15:00Fulham did really well over Christmas, especially when you consider they have lost key players to the African Cup of Nations.Liverpool must be massively disappointed with their display and result against Leeds, after the upturn in their performances in the past couple of weeks.Like a lot of teams, Arne Slot's side are maybe short of energy at such a busy time of year, and are lacking the spark they need.They lost here last season, and Fulham will fancy a repeat result. I'm not sure about that, but I do think Marco Silva's side will get something from the game.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Andrew's prediction: This should be a great game. Fulham are in good form and they will have a real go at Liverpool. 2-2AI's prediction: 0-2St James' Park, 15:00Crystal Palace are another team I've been wrong about a lot recently - they are on a dismal run, with only one point from their past four games.I should have thought about it more when I was making my predictions because they are badly missing the firepower of Ismaila Sarr, who is away at Afcon with Senegal.Brennan Johnson will add some fresh legs to the Eagles attack, but I actually think Newcastle will run away with this one.I always fancy Newcastle at home to score and also to run over teams, but this season they have sometimes struggled to put games to bed.I am backing them to do all of the above this time, however. Eddie Howe's side smashed Palace 5-0 last season, and this should be another convincing win.Sutton's prediction: 3-0Andrew's prediction: Palace are a tricky team, but with it being at St James' Park I don't see us getting turned over there. We've been decent at home but then we have also thrown away a lot of points from winning positions, so I am hoping we see it out this time.Joelinton being back could make the difference there because he is such a presence in midfield - I said it a few weeks ago when he got injured that I thought we'd lost our nastiness when he wasn't in the team. We need a run of results in 2026 to get up the table so hopefully that starts here. 2-0AI's prediction: 2-0Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 15:00I'm not sure if Sunderland will have anything left in the tank after their efforts against Manchester City on Thursday.It was another example of why they have done so well - they defended brilliantly, but they were dangerous when they got the ball and they could have beaten City too.Mind you, Tottenham are so drab at the moment that it probably won't matter too much if the Black Cats are low on energy.Sunderland are always so well organised at the back, while I don't think Spurs, in an attacking sense, have really clicked this season.Tottenham will be exhausted as well, so I don't see many goals in this one - in fact, I don't see any at all.A goalless draw is unlikely to cheer the Spurs supporters up much, either.I know they love getting angry, but they are a fanbase who don't actually seem to know what they want - is it a manager who delivers attractive attacking football, or someone who can set up a team to keep a clean sheet every week?Sutton's prediction: 0-0Andrew's prediction: I thought there would be a drop-off from Sunderland when they lost so many players to the Africa Cup of Nations, but that hasn't happened - they put in a great performance against City. I don't think they get a win here, but I don't think they lose either - they have got a habit of not getting beaten this season, which is frustrating!Tottenham were really flat against Brentford so they might respond a bit here, but I still see this ending up as another draw. 1-1AI's prediction: 3-1Etihad Stadium, 17:30Chelsea were really not that bad under Enzo Maresca - fifth in the Premier League, into the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup and still well placed in the Champions League.His departure was clearly down to a breakdown of his relationship with the club's hierarchy, rather than results.Maresca did not feel he had the control he wanted, and I get why he was unhappy. As Pat Nevin said on BBC Radio 5 Live, maybe Chelsea need a puppet as their next manager, who will do as he is told.I really liked Maresca. I know some Chelsea fans found his style of play last season boring, and a bit predictable, but they ended up in the top four last year and of course they became world champions as well.Their performances in the big games this season have been pretty good, too, but this time, as well as being without Maresca, they are also missing Moises Caicedo - who is suspended after his booking against Bournemouth. He will be a big, big loss.Chelsea have got enough other talent to still go and get a result at Etihad Stadium, but I don't think they will.I am expecting City to find their shooting boots again after they were shut out by Sunderland, especially if they can find a long throw.Chelsea could not deal with Antoine Semenyo's deliveries when they played Bournemouth on Tuesday.A lot has been made of how young Chelsea's defence is, but that's not actually the case.When you look through their team, they are not inexperienced. They will need to do far better against a City side that could be too sharp and streetwise for them, but their age is not an excuse.Sutton's prediction: 3-1Andrew's prediction: City will want to put things right after being held by Sunderland. They might have to be patient here, and I can see it being 1-1 after half an hour... but they will win in the end. 3-1AI's prediction: 2-1How did Sutton do last time?There were a few surprise results in week 19, which took in the final games of 2025 on Tuesday, 30 December and the first matches of 2026 on New Year's Day.Chris and his guest, singer-songwriter and Sunderland fan Tom A Smith, both got three correct results with no exact scores for a total of 30 points - although Smith was right about one of the 'shocks' when he backed the Black Cats to hold Manchester City.The BBC readers only managed two correct results but they did get one exact score - Crystal Palace's 1-1 draw with Fulham - giving them 50 points.It was AI who took the weekly win thanks to four correct results and two exact scores, which saw it end up with 100 points.",

The incident was reported at 15:10 GMT on Friday, resulting in a major search involving a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.Amanda White/BBCCrews at the scene in Withernsea, where a cordon is in placeA police spokesperson said: \"Residents will continue to see an increased police presence in and around the area as the search continues.\"We continue to ask that people avoid the area to allow emergency services to work efficiently and safely.\"The search was paused at about 00:30 on Saturday morning, and resumed at first light.

    "body": "The government has launched a recruitment drive for thousands of new magistrates  to volunteer in England and Wales as part of its efforts to grapple with the crown court backlog.The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said more than 2,000 magistrates have been trained since 2022 and the latest call aims to boost that number by another 2,000 within the next financial year.Justice Secretary David Lammy said magistrates served \"a vital role\" in the court system and \"we need more people of every age and background to volunteer\".In December, Lammy announced sweeping reforms to the criminal courts, including removing juries from a number of trials in England and Wales to speed up the justice process.Latest figures showed more than 79,600 criminal cases were caught in the courts backlog in England and Wales - a record high since early 2023 and is projected to hit 100,000 by 2028, according to the MoJ.The delays mean that for some serious crimes charged in 2026, victims and suspects could be left waiting years for justice as they are unlikely to see the case come to trial before 2030.Lammy praised magistrates as \"everyday heroes\" who hear thousands of cases across every jurisdiction.\"Volunteering to become a magistrate can make a real difference to your life and the lives of others - that's why I'm calling on the public to apply and play your part,\" he added.The Magistrates' Association described the push as a \"big vote of confidence\" in magistrates, but called for more resources for the courts, including trained legal advisers and repairs for crumbling court buildings.Shadow justice minister Kieran Mullan said while the recruitment drive was welcome, the move \"cannot paper over the failings of a justice secretary and Labour government that has consistently failed to deliver meaningful reform\".All magistrates are expected to volunteer at least 13 days a year to hear cases.Magistrates are wanted across criminal, youth, and civil and family proceedings, and have specialist legal advisers to support them to deal with a range of cases.Latest figures show 57% of magistrates are female and 14% come from an ethnic minority background, with London having the highest proportion of 31%, according to the MoJ.",

Nights will become much colder though, with temperatures possibly dropping to minus double digits on Saturday night in a few locations in Scotland and northern England.",

I've done something nobody else has done - and that feels special,\" she said.Maisy said that later this year she would use facilities at Silverstone, the legendary home of the British Grand Prix and MotoGP events, to develop her driving skills in cars.The aim was to impress the F1 Academy with her performance data and, if she succeeded, it could see her achieving her academy goal in 2027, she explained.Maisy Creed RacingFemale drivers are few and far between at the higher end of the sportMaisy began her racing adventures with indoor karting at the age of eight, later than most drivers who rise in the outdoors version of the sport.Her dad, Adam, said he was very proud of his daughter's achievements so far - and knew she could succeed in her goals despite the fact it was \"a massively male-dominated sport\".\"For girls to come into that sport and excel, it's unbelievably difficult,\" Mr Creed said.Maisy agreed and said there was unfortunately still a lot of sexism faced by females in the sport.\"There's a few girls that I'm quite close with, and we all experience it,\" she said.\"It's just really annoying to deal with because I don't understand why they [males] find it so unbelievable, and they really just don't want to be beaten by me.\"'Passion and desire'Maisy said she realised she was \"fairly unusual\".\"I'm one of a tiny handful of girls on the whole planet that can actually compete at the top level against the boys and actually be at the front,\" she said.However, Maisy added that she believed she was on track for further success in 2026 and beyond.\"I have the passion and desire to reach for the very top of this amazing sport that I love,\" she smiled.\"I can't wait to experience the journey over the next five years.\"More stories like thisRelated internet links",

    "body": "A coroner has warned that further babies could die unless the government introduces regulation of non-therapeutic male circumcision following the death of a six-month-old boy in west London.Non-therapeutic circumcision is the removal of the foreskin of male babies and young children for religious or cultural reasons, rather than medical reasons.Mohamed Abdisamad was circumcised on 12 February 2023, by a circumciser who had been recommended to his parents and requested by them to perform the procedure on their son, the West London Coroner's report said.The baby began showing symptoms of illness three to four days later and was taken to hospital on 19 February and died the same day.He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital by ambulance where he went into cardiorespiratory arrest and was pronounced dead at 23:55 GMT.A jury inquest which concluded on 8 October 2025 found the medical cause of death to be an \"invasive streptococcus pyogenes infection following male circumcision\".Assistant coroner Anton van Dellen wrote a prevention of future deaths report in which he called for action over the lack of safety and regulatory measures surrounding non-therapeutic male circumcisions.\"During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern,\" Dr van Dellen wrote in the report dated December 28 2025.\"In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.\"The coroner said there are no national safeguards governing non-therapeutic male circumcision, with no requirements for training, accreditation or registration of those carrying out the procedure, and no rules on record keeping, infection control or aftercare.He also pointed to the lack of a system for obtaining consent prior to the procedure being carried out.The report is being sent to the Department of Health and Social Care, and to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.They have 56 days from the date of the report being issued to respond, the coroner said.Copies of the report are also being sent to Mohamed's mother and father, his maternal grandmother, his uncle, and the London Ambulance Service.",

    "body": "'Living a nightmare': Families of teens missing after ski resort fire desperate for news14 hours agoAleks PhillipsSuppliedThe families of teenagers missing after a fire at a bar in a Swiss ski resort are facing an agonising wait for news and appealing for information about their loved ones online.The fire in Crans-Montana was likely caused by sparklers placed on bottles of champagne that came \"too close to the ceiling\", Swiss officials told a news conference on Friday.An investigation into the fire will focus on the materials used at the site, the bar's fire safety measures, its capacity and the number of people inside at the time, Valais Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said.Swiss authorities have said it could take days if not weeks to identify the victims of the fire, which killed 40 people and injured another 119. Officials said 113 of the injured had been identified, with authorities still working to identify the other six.In the meantime, families and friends have been taking to social media to appeal for information about their loved ones who were at the bar that night.What we know so farSparklers on champagne bottles likely cause of fireWatch as partygoers try to put out flamesLaetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookSwiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, is among the missingThe whereabouts of Swiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, are currently unknown, his mother Laetitia said.\"I must find my son... it's been 30 hours since [he] disappeared,\" she told the BBC, adding that she wanted his photo \"to be everywhere so that, just in case, someone recognises him, they can call me\".Ms Brodard said that she and Arthur's father had been checking hospitals in Lausanne and Bern, but could not find him, earlier telling local newspaper Le Temps that she was \"living a nightmare.\"Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"SUPPLIEDAchille Barosi was described by his aunt as an avid painterAnother missing Italian national is Achille Osvaldo Giovanni Barosi, 16, who entered the bar at 01:30 local time on New Year's Day to retrieve his jacket and phone. His family have not heard from him since.\"We don't know if he's still alive,\" his aunt Francesca told the BBC World Service's OS programme.She described her nephew, who is enrolled in an art school in Milan, as a beautiful boy and an excellent painter.\"We just want to find him, and that's it.\"The Italian foreign ministry has said six of its citizens remain missing.Italian Golf FederationJunior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, was last heard from around midnight on New Year's Eve, according to his fatherAmong them is Emanuele Galeppini, a 16-year-old junior golfer, originally from Genoa but now living in Dubai.The Italian Golf Federation has said he is dead, without mentioning the fire, paying tribute to a \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father, Edoardo, is quoted by Italian TV channel TG24 as saying his son was at the bar and was last heard from around midnight. An Italian foreign ministry spokesperson has told the BBC that it was not confirming the death yet.Giovanni Tamburi, 16, is also among the missing. His mother, Carla Masiello, from Bologna, told La Repubblica that he had been on holiday with his father but had gone out with friends and ended up at La Constellation.\"A close friend of his told me they ran away after the fire broke out and that he had [his phone] with him, but then at a certain point he couldn't see him anymore,\" she told the newspaper, adding he had been wearing a gold chain with a small Madonna around his neck.Tania Causio, one of his teachers at Porta Saragozza High School, told La Repubblica: \"I've always been struck by his kindness and smile, coupled with great maturity. Every time I walk into class, he asks if I want him to go get me a coffee.\"Lisa Pralong Elisabeth/FacebookFamily of Emilie Pralong face an \"agonising\" wait for information on the 22-year-oldAlso reported missing by family members is Emilie Pralong, 22, who is thought to have been at Le Constellation with several friends who may also be missing.Her grandfather, Pierre, described an \"agonising\" wait for information, telling French broadcaster BFMTV: \"We always hope - we are full of hope. It helps to overcome whatever the hardship.\"While he expressed optimism that she may turn up relatively unharmed in hospital, he said: \"We have to be ready to accept a more difficult situation. We mustn't dream, we have to be realistic in the face of a tragedy like this.\"SuppliedDual national Alice Kallergis was also at the bar on New Year's EveAlice Kallergis, who holds dual Greek and Swiss nationality but lives permanently in Switzerland, was also at the bar on New Year's Eve, according to sources and reports in Greek media.Her brother has posted an appeal on Instagram, saying the family has had \"no news\" regarding the 15-year-old or the three friends she was with and who are also reported missing.Greek consular authorities say they are continuing to monitor the situation closely.Additional reporting by Nikos Papanikolaou and Isabella Bull",

    "body": "1 hour agoClaire KeenanWatch: Earthquake interrupts Mexico's president during press conferenceAt least two people have died after a powerful earthquake hit southern and central Mexico on Friday.The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the south-western state of Guerrero, which suffered moderate damage.A 50-year-old woman died in Guerrero, the state's governor Evelyn Salgado said, while Clara Brugada, Mexico City's mayor, confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man and said 12 others had been injured in the capital. Mexico is situated in one of the world's most seismically active areas, sitting at the meeting point of four tectonic plates.Late on Friday night, Brugada said power has been restored to \"98% of the failures reported\" in Mexico City.Two structures were being evaluated for risk of collapse, she said, while 34 buildings and five homes were being inspected as a preventative measure.Damage assessments are under way in Mexico City after roads and hospitals were impacted, according to news agency Reuters, while authorities noted various landslides on highways around the Guerrero state. Mexico's seismological service had registered 420 aftershocks by midday local time (18:00 GMT).President Claudia Sheinbaum was holding her first press conference of the year when the earthquake struck.  In a video capturing the moment, Sheinbaum can be heard saying \"it's shaking\" as an earthquake alert system rings in the background. She then tells the media to \"all get out calmly\". Additional footage shows buildings shaking in Mexico City and cars trembling in Acapulco.Getty ImagesThe inside of a house damaged by the quake in San Marcos, Guerrero state, MexicoAfter hearing the Mexican Seismic Alert System early on Friday, residents and tourists rushed into the streets of Mexico City and Acapulco.The seismic system was put into place following the deadly 1985 earthquake that claimed more than 10,000 lives.In 2017, a 7.1 magnitude quake killed more than 200 people and toppled dozens of buildings in Mexico City.",

    "body": "4 days agoJonathan GeddesGlasgow and West reporterBBCDr Tori Herridge visited Kelvingrove Park to witness the skatepark excavation, When archaeologists began work on the site of Scotland's first skatepark last August, there was one prominent question being asked - when had the ground actually been filled in?It was a mystery solved through research, hard work - and a chocolate wrapper more than 40 years old.A team from the University of Glasgow team worked with volunteers and students to excavate the former Kelvin Wheelies park in Kelvingrove Park.Now the work on the skatepark will feature in an episode of the BBC's Digging For Britain programme, due to air 7 January.The skatepark opened in May 1978 and featured bowls, a slalom run and a half-pipe, all with names like Jaws, Torpedo and Bazooka.At the time it was considered state of the art and hosted events like the Scottish Skateboarding Championship, but several years later the site was out of commission, after a decline in popularity, concern about maintenance costs and safety risks.Exactly when it closed was a matter of debate, though.Speaking to Digging For Britain host Dr Tori Herridge, Dr Kenny Brophy of the university of Glasgow explained that while it was known that the skatepark was out of use by the early 1980s, an exact date had not been confirmed.He said: \"Even the smallest bit of evidence could help us say when this was backfilled, because there is actually no record of when this happened. Everyone is saying was it 1982 or 1983 or 1984, but no-one remembers exactly when. \"It's amazing how quickly people forget - archaeology can bring those memories back.\"Iain UrquhartThe skatepark was popular in the late 70s, but fell out of fashion a few years laterThe team, which included a number of modern skaters who use the current park at Kelvingrove - yards away from the original site - then got to work, using the same techniques that would be used on sites hundreds or thousands of years old.They analysed soil and rubble within the original slalom they discovered, while on another section members of the team discovered two white lines - which they eventually guessed was a way of telling skaters where to aim for when performing a trick.Skaters young and old gathered to appreciate the discovery - one younger skater said hearing about the old park was like \"hearing fairytales\" and like nothing she had ever skated on before.Another called the find interesting because skateboarding has changed so much, meaning parks like the 1970s one no longer exist.See Scotland's first skatepark in its 80s heydayFor Jamie Blair, who owns Glasgow skateboarding shop Clan Skates, the excavation brought back many memories.He was a member of the Kelvingrove skateboard team, and as a teenager would perform tricks and flips on a regular basis at the Kelvin Wheelies.     \"It was a great shame that this park got filled in, it broke a lot of skateboarders' hearts,\" he told Dr Herridge.\"It was good to roll back, and see it, and it was fun trying to find things you remembered from the past – 'oh, this is where that was…'  \"My other reaction was 'jeez, am I that old?' - I was literally digging up the bones of my childhood! But skateboarding is alive and well, so it's all good.\"The best before date of a chocolate biscuit provided evidence for when the park had closedHowever, it was later in the dig that the team were finally able to establish a more definitive date for when exactly the skatepark had closed.The solution involved Scottish football great Denis Law, and a couple of popular chocolate brands.\"In terms of dating some of the material, we have been quite lucky,\" says Kieran Manchip, a project officer with Archaeology Scotland. \"We were able to find sweetie wrappers that had best before dates on them. So we have a six pack of Penguin biscuits  and on the rear side it says 14 March 1983, and we found a lovely Twix wrapper at the bottom of the rubble. \"It says 21 May 1983, so we know the site was backfilled by May 1983.\"We found a hologram sticker or poster of Denis Law wearing a Man Utd shirt, which can be dated to the early 70s (Law left Manchester United in 1973).\"The processes are the same with archaeology – you can apply them to any time in the human past.\"Part of the original skatepark was unearthed during the digDr Brophy hopes the work on the skatepark site will help ensure it is remembered by future generations. In Jamie Blair's case, the excavation brought the past flooding back.\"I remember the laughs you had, your friends, your teammates. We were just crazy for skateboarding.\"",

    "body": "Two people including a three-year-old child have been killed and around 28 others injured in a Russian strike on Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. A multi-storey residential apartment block was almost completely destroyed in the dual missile attack on Friday afternoon, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called \"heinous\". Russia's Defence Ministry denied reports of an attack, suggesting the blast had been caused by Ukrainian ammunition detonating.The strike comes ahead of crunch talks on a US-brokered peace plan in Kyiv on Saturday.Zelensky says around 15 countries are expected to attend the talks, along with representatives from the EU and Nato, with a US delegation joining the meeting via video link. Leaders of the so-called coalition of the willing are then set to meet in France on 6 January.Officials in Kharkiv said the bodies of a woman and a three-year-old child were found in the rubble, with preliminary information suggesting the pair may have been a mother and son. \"Unfortunately, this is how the Russians treat life and people – they continue killing, despite all efforts by the world, and especially by the United States, in the diplomatic process,\" Zelensky wrote on X.Of the 28 injured, which included a six-month-old baby, 16 have been taken to hospital. A search and rescue operation is ongoing, with more than 80 volunteers working at the scene, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov.The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Telegram that its armed forces \"neither planned nor launched attacks using missile weapons or aircraft weapons within the city of Kharkiv\".It added that footage from before the attack showed \"heavy smoke of unknown origin\", which it cited as evidence of ammunition detonated by Ukrainian armed forces.The ministry also alleged that the reports were seeking to distract attention from a New Year's Eve strike on a hotel in a Russian-held part of the southern Kherson region of Ukraine.Russia has accused Ukraine of killing at least 27 people and injuring more than 30 others in the drone strike on a New Year's party in the village of Khorly on the Black Sea.The BBC has not been able to independently verify either these claims or the number of casualties.Ukraine told the BBC it would not directly respond to sources of information such as claims from governors of occupied regions.It added that it adhered to the norms of international humanitarian law and conducted strikes exclusively against military targets.Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened an investigation into the attack, while the Russian foreign ministry accused Zelensky of \"seeking to intimidate the populations of the reunited Russian regions, who have forever linked their fates with Russia through referendums\".",

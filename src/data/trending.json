A spokesperson said: \"Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels – and we will continue to do so.\"We will not comment on specific operational planning or give a running commentary on live maritime activity.\"It is understood US military aircraft landed at small civilian airports in Wick in Caithness and Benbecula in the Western Isles during the operation on 7 January.The MoD did confirm at the time that the Royal Navy tanker RFA Tideforce and RAF surveillance aircraft supported American personnel.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterScott Adams, the US cartoonist who wrote and illustrated the comic strip Dilbert, has died of cancer at the age of 68.His ex-wife Shelly Miles announced his death on Tuesday during a live stream of his podcast, Real Coffee with Scott Adams.The satirical cartoon strip - about a competent but frustrated engineer and his dysfunctional workplace environment - was first published in 1989, and went on to feature in more than 2,000 newspapers in 65 countries.The character also later appeared in books, an animated TV series and video game. But in 2023, his comic strip was cancelled by newspapers including the Washington Post after Adams was accused of making racist comments about black people.Adams called black Americans a \"hate group\" and suggested white Americans \"get the hell away from black people,\" in response to a conservative organisation's poll purporting to show that many African-Americans do not think it is OK to be white.He later defended his comments and said that he had been using hyperbole to make a point, adding that he disavowed racists and that media reports had ignored the context of his comments.US President Donald Trump paid tribute to Adams on Truth Social, following news of his death: \"Sadly, the Great Influencer, Scott Adams, has passed away. He was a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so. \"He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease,\" Trump wrote.A tearful Shelly told listeners at the start of Adams's latest podcast on Tuesday: \"He's not with us anymore.\"She then read out a posthumous message from Adams: \"I had an amazing life, I gave it everything I had.\"If I got any benefits from my work, I'm asking that you pay it forward as best as you can. That's the legacy I want.\"Be useful, and please know I loved you all to the very end.\"In his later career, Adams - also a trained hypnotist - wrote self-help books including How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, Win Bigly, Loserthink and Reframe Your Brain.He had been receiving end-of-life care at his home after the prostate cancer, which he first revealed he had in May 2025, spread to his bones.On 1 January this year, he told listeners that the chances of him making a recovery were unlikely. \"I'll give you any updates if that changes, but it won't,\" he said.\"So there's no chance that I'll get my feeling back in my legs, and I've got some ongoing heart failure, which is making it difficult to breathe sometimes during the day.\"However, you should prepare yourself that January will probably be a month of transition, one way or another.\"",

He was on sole watch duty on the bridge at the time.\"Ultimately, he did nothing, absolutely nothing, to avoid the collision.\"PA MediaSolong crew member Mark Angelo Pernia is missing, presumed dead, after the collisionThe Portuguese-flagged Solong had been making its way south from the Scottish port of Grangemouth to Rotterdam in the Netherlands.Little said the ship should have gone to the east to avoid other vessels at anchor waiting to enter the Humber Estuary.\"The course taken led to the fatality that this case is all about,\" the prosecutor added.When he came ashore at Grimsby Dock, Motin told police he had sighted the ship and went to switch to manual control, but it did not work and he had panicked and crashed into the ship, the jury heard.Little said that the defendant did not alert his own crew or the Stena Immaculate before the collision.In a WhatsApp conversation with his wife, Motin said: \"There has been a disaster and I will be found guilty.\"When asked about the message in a police interview, he said he meant he would be found guilty under maritime navigation rules.After he was charged with manslaughter, the captain said: \"I didn't do it deliberately.\"The trial continues.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devices.Related internet links",

    "body": "5 hours agoNeil HendersonBBC News, Stratford Magistrates' CourtBBCFrom left to right: Kristofer Deichler, Jatinder Kamra, and Sukhraj SinghThree men have been found guilty of harassing a BBC journalist who presented the podcast series and documentary A Very British Cult.Kristofer Deichler, 47, Jatinder Kamra, 46 and Sukhraj Singh, 39, were all convicted at Stratford Magistrates' Court of harassment without violence.All three are members of Lighthouse, which was investigated for the 2023 documentary and podcast fronted by BBC journalist Catrin Nye.The programmes raised concerns about the group and reported allegations about the way its leadership treated people who tried to leave it.A district judge sitting at Stratford Magistrates Court heard how the men held demonstrations outside the BBC and on three occasions turned up to Nye's home, claiming to be delivering a Bible and a letter.Prosecutor Simren Singh said the group's complaints about Nye's programme-making had begun before the episodes were even released.Judge Susan Holdham heard how attempts by the programme-makers to obtain an interview with the Lighthouse leader, Paul Waugh, had either been met with silence or demands for several hours of live primetime television.The court heard how the men turned up at BBC presenter Catrin Nye's home After the broadcast, Lighthouse staged demonstrations outside the BBC's offices in central London. The group's members held up placards accusing both the corporation and Nye of shielding child abusers and racists.The court was also shown a video featuring group members chanting: \"Stop paedophilia at the BBC.\"Lighthouse followers were seen shouting at BBC staff, accusing them of being \"complicit\" and asking \"don't you have any shame?\"The prosecutor told the judge that while these protests were lawful, the men \"crossed the line\" when they began visiting Nye's home in the summer of 2024.It was then that protests became illegal, he said, telling the court it was \"revenge\" for her journalism.It emerged in court that Lighthouse had hired a private investigator to trace Nye's home address.Members of the group then travelled to her house. They rang the doorbell and recorded themselves on their phones apparently trying to deliver a Bible and a letter.Three men charged with harassment of BBC presenterWhen there was no response they posted leaflets to neighbours and staged a demonstration nearby.They returned several days later, at 08:00, waiting until Nye's partner had left the house with their two small children before calling again. Nye, who was in the house with a security guard, didn't answer the door.The men claimed they had been attempting to produce their own documentary in response to A Very British Cult and said they had been acting as \"citizen journalists\".They described the group's relationship with the BBC and Nye as a \"David versus Goliath\" struggle.\"The purpose was doorstepping,\" Sukhraj Singh told the judge. \"The purpose was to interview any of her team. We wanted justice, compensation, reform and truth.\"He told the court he had joined Lighthouse as a mentor and then became an associate partner in 2010.After the programme's broadcast, he said many of his clients had cut their ties with him, leaving him without an income. He said he was currently living on benefits.Asked what justice would look like, he replied: \"Justice would be for the BBC to apologise and broadcast the facts to the audience.\"Instead of posting the letter and Bible through the letterbox, the court heard the men instead left an unsigned note saying they would \"be back\".Police have released footage showing Kristofer Deichler and Jatinder Kamra outside Nye's homeEarlier in the trial, both Nye and her partner gave evidence from behind a screen about the effects the visits had on them and their children.Nye said Lighthouse had been given \"multiple opportunities and deadline extensions to involve themselves in the production of the programme, and these were not responded to\".She added: \"Terrifying people in their neighbourhood and terrifying their children is not how you respond to an organisation.\"They distributed leaflets with my name and picture on it, said the most awful things possible, saying that I destroyed businesses and protected child abusers.\"The couple installed a Ring doorbell and CCTV in their house and Nye told the court how she became unwilling to leave home with her children, even for short trips. She was reduced to a \"paranoid\" state, the court heard.The case, which was initially scheduled to last four days, instead involved hearings staggered over several months.The defendants at first said they were ill. Proceedings were then further delayed when the men lost their legal representation in a dispute with their original solicitors.Finding all three men guilty, the judge said the visits to the journalist's house \"were intimidatory as well as retaliatory\" and that their conduct amounted to harassment.The three men were bailed and will be sentenced on 2 February.A BBC spokesperson welcomed the verdicts, adding: \"A free and independent press is fundamental to a democratic society, and it is essential that journalists are able to carry out their work without intimidation, harassment or abuse.\"We stand firmly behind our reporter and our journalists' right to report freely in the public interest.\"",

    "body": "Two women have accused the Spanish singer Julio Iglesias of sexually assaulting them while they were working for him and allege that he \"normalised abuse\" in a coercive, threatening and violent environment.The allegations, made in reports by Spanish news site elDiario.es and US outlet Univision, are being investigated by Spain's judiciary.The singer employed the two women at his properties in Punta Cana, in the Dominican Republic, and Lyford Cay, in the Bahamas. According to their testimonies, the sexual assaults took place in 2021.Iglesias, who is 82, has been a household name in Spain since the 1960s and has sold millions of records worldwide.According to elDiario.es and Univision, Iglesias and his lawyer did not respond to repeated requests for a response to the allegations ahead of their publication. However, a woman identified as a manager of one of the singer's Caribbean properties said the claims were \"nonsense\".The BBC has attempted to contact Iglesias's representatives for comment, but has not yet received a response.One of the women interviewed, a domestic worker whose name was changed to Rebeca in the reports, said he would regularly call her to his room at the end of the day and would touch her inappropriately with his fingers without consent.\"He used me almost every night,\" she said. \"I felt like an object, like a slave.\"Rebeca, who is Dominican and was 22 when the alleged events described took place, also alleged that Iglesias had forced her to take part in threesomes with another female member of staff. She also described the singer slapping her in the face and grabbing her genitals.The other woman, a Venezuelan physical therapist named as Laura in the article, said Iglesias had touched her breasts and kissed her on the mouth against her will. She added that he constantly threatened to fire her, controlled how much food she ate and asked her about when her period was due.\"He always said I was fat and had to lose weight,\" Laura said, describing a working environment of \"normalised abuse\".Although she said she had frequently rejected his sexual advances, \"there were girls who couldn't say no. And he did what he wanted with them\".elDiario.es and Univision, which investigated the case together over a period of three years, state that the allegations are backed up by documentary evidence, including photographs, phone records, text messages and medical reports. Their reports cite other former employees of Iglesias who describe a threatening, highly stressful atmosphere for those working for him.It has emerged that Rebeca and Laura filed a legal complaint on 5 January against Iglesias for sexual assault and human trafficking before the national court, which investigates crimes allegedly committed beyond Spain's borders.An old friend of Iglesias, Jaime Peñafiel, labelled the accusations \"absolute lies\". Another ally, the journalist Miguel Ángel Pastor, said he had never heard \"any suggestion that he might have committed this kind of act\".However, the equality minister in Spain's Socialist-led government, Ana Redondo, said she hoped the case would be investigated \"all the way\".\"When there is no consent there is assault,\" she posted on social media.Ione Belarra, leader of the far-left Podemos party, called for an end to \"the silence\" in cases of sexual assault by \"famous assailants who are protected by their money\".Last month, a woman filed a legal complaint alleging that Adolfo Suárez, a former prime minister who was revered for his role during Spain's transition to democracy, had sexually abused her from when she was 17 years old. Suárez, a conservative, died in 2014 and police are investigating. Jesús Villegas, a magistrate, said that the case against Suárez was unlikely to flourish and that it was politically motivated.The president of the Madrid region, the conservative Isabel Díaz Ayuso, has come out in support of the Spanish singer.\"The Madrid region will never contribute to the vilifying of artists and even less so to that of the most universal of all singers: Julio Iglesias,\" she posted on social media.Iglesias's biographer Ignacio Peyró and the author's publishing house, Libros del Asteroide, have also responded, saying they will update last year's biography to include the allegations. They have also expressed their \"support and solidarity for the victims\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoJoe Pike,Political correspondentandJoshua Nevett,Political reporterEPAPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is considering whether to join US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace for Gaza.The new body is part of the White House's 20-point plan to end the war between Israel and Hamas.It is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza, manage its reconstruction, and be made up of world leaders.UK diplomats are seeking more clarity from the US State Department on the role of the board and its members.The Sunday Times first reported that Sir Keir had been invited to join the board.Government sources told the BBC \"a formal invitation has not been received and the decision has not been made\".US media reports suggest Trump will announce the members of the board this week.Former UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair is expected to join a separate executive board alongside Trump's advisers Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff.In September the US said Sir Tony would be a member of the peace board, with the former Labour prime minister saying the American plans were \"the best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering\".But the exact details of his involvement were unclear after reports suggested some Middle Eastern states had objected to giving a role to Sir Tony, who deployed British forces as part of US-led military action in Iraq.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said the Gaza peace board was in the process of being formed.He said: \"Essentially, it's the most important leaders of the most important nations. You take the most important leaders and nations, that's who the Board of Peace is going to be.\"Trump said there was strong international interest in participating in the initiative, saying: \"Everybody wants to be on it.\"Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper was asked if Sir Keir had joined Trump's peace board in the House of Commons on Tuesday but did not respond directly to the question.\"We supported the 20-point plan to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza,\" Cooper said.\"That is still fragile and there's still a huge amount of work to do, including humanitarian surge and support, and including the decommissioning of weapons from Hamas.\"There's a huge amount of work still to do but it's really important that the whole international community comes together in order to support that.\"Sir Keir has cultivated a good relationship with Trump, despite their differences over the UK's decision to recognise the state of Palestine last year.The prime minister has been criticised for going abroad frequently but when speaking to Labour MPs on Monday, he defended his focus on foreign affairs and attempted to link it to his domestic policy agenda.\"The cost of living crisis will not be solved by isolationism,\" Starmer said.\"One thing that is crystal-clear is that we are moving into a world that is very different to the one most of us grew up in, and in a world this volatile you have to be on the pitch. \"You have to be in the room to tackle the issues working people care about.\"",

    "description": "The UK government has summoned the Iranian ambassador in response to the ongoing \"brutal\" killings of protesters in the country, the foreign secretary",
    "body": "The UK government has summoned the Iranian ambassador in response to the ongoing \"brutal\" killings of protesters in the country, the foreign secretary has said.Thousands of people are feared dead or have been detained after a crackdown on anti-government protesters across Iran in recent days.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper outlined \"the UK's total abhorrence of the killings, the violence, and the repression that we are seeing\" in a Commons statement, and said she feared the death toll may be significantly higher than reported so far.She also said the government would implement \"full and further sanctions\" against Iran targeting finance, energy, transport, software and other industries.The Foreign Office has not specifically set out what form the new sanctions will take or when they will be put in place.It is understood the meeting between Cooper and Iran's ambassador Seyed Ali Mousavi at the Foreign Office lasted just nine minutes.Speaking in the Commons earlier on Tuesday, Cooper said the government \"will work further with the EU and other partners to explore what additional measures might now be needed in response to developments\". Cooper, who spoke directly to the Iranian foreign minister on Monday to convey the UK's objections to the crackdown, said the decision to summon the ambassador on Tuesday came following \"horrific reports\" of violence overnight and to \"underline the gravity of the moment\". In a diplomatic offensive, several European countries - including France, Spain, Finland, Belgium and Germany - have also summoned Iranian ambassadors.Meanwhile, the US President Donald Trump is continuing to weigh up military intervention in the region after he introduced a 25% import tariff on countries doing business with Iran.The protests, which began in December, were initially driven by economic hardship and rising inflation, but have since broadened into more widespread anti-regime rallies.In response, Tehran's security forces have hit back with heavy force, with live ammunition being used against crowds and a wave of arrests being made.Last Thursday, Iranian authorities also imposed a near total internet blackout in an effort to suppress the unrest. As a result, Iranians have been almost completely cut off from the outside world. The country restricts international news organisations from operating there, hampering efforts to independently verify the number of people who have died during the protests.Iranian authorities have accused foreign government of fomenting the unrest and have condemned \"terrorist actions\", state media reported. But Cooper said Iran's leaders were \"peddling its manufactured narrative of foreign manipulation\".She added: \"The United Kingdom condemns in the strongest of terms the horrendous and brutal killing of Iranian protesters, and we demand that the Iranian authorities respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of their citizens.\"Cooper also said British officials were in contact with Iranian counterparts about UK nationals detained there.She confirmed a Foreign Office minister had met the family of Craig and Lindsay Foreman on Monday, a couple who were arrested and accused of espionage in Iran last January while on a motorcycle trip around the world.Last year, a major report by Parliament's intelligence and security committee found the UK faces a \"rising\" and unpredictable threat from Iran, and raised particular concern over \"sharp increase\" in physical threats against opponents of Iran's regime in the UK.At the time, the Iranian embassy in London \"wholly rejected\" the report's findings.In October, the UK, France and Germany activated a so-called \"snapback\" mechanism to reintroduce sweeping UN economic and military sanctions on Iran for failing to comply with restrictions on its nuclear industry.Cooper said the government had imposed over 220 sanctions on Iran since Labour came to power.But shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel called for more information about what new sanctions would be put in place, and asked why the Iranian ambassador was not summoned sooner.",

Natalee Hughes-Jones, prosecuting, said the BBC One programme was carrying out a renovation at a property in Yankee Street, Llanberis, in early December.She said the hired equipment had been left outside \"with surveillance\", when the theft happened.The hire company received a report from the tracker on 7 December, locating the mixer in a garage at Pugh's home, she said.Simon Sargent, defending, said Pugh had been out drinking and was on his way home when he noticed the mixer and the wheelbarrows by the side of the road.\"At no time was he aware the equipment was being used by the DIY SOS programme,\" the solicitor told the court.\"He pushed them home, a decision he deeply regrets.\"The public perceive he deliberately targeted DIY SOS, which isn't the case, and he's extremely embarrassed and apologises unreservedly.\"Sargent said his client was sorry, adding that the mixer and wheelbarrows were returned undamaged.But Mike Watling from the Probation Service told the court he was not sure this was an opportunistic theft.\"The route past this house was a long way home,\" he said. \"I don't believe his version of events - perhaps he was aware the equipment was there?\"There's much more to this than he's admitted to.\"Magistrates gave Pugh an 18-month community order, under which he must do 200 hours unpaid work, take part in 10 days of rehabilitation training and wear an alcohol tag for 60 days.He must also pay £85 costs and £114 surcharge.",

The number of injured civilians also increased sharply each year.The year's deadliest attack killed at least 38 civilians in the western city of Ternopil in November, it reported, including eight children.On Tuesday President Volodymyr Zelensky said overnight Russian strikes had killed four people in Kharkiv and left \"several hundred thousand households\" without power in and around Kyiv amid freezing temperatures.The total number of civilians killed and injured in 2025 represented a 31% increase on 2024, and 70% on 2023, according to the UN mission.It previously said at least 8,006 civilians were killed and 13,287 injured in the first 12 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.In November, it reported more than 14,534 civilians had been killed since the war began.The mission's chief Danielle Bell said 2025's figures represented \"a marked deterioration in the protection of civilians\".\"Our monitoring shows that this rise was driven not only by intensified hostilities along the frontline, but also by the expanded use of long-range weapons, which exposed civilians across the country to heightened risk.\"Separately, Zelensky said almost 300 drones, 18 ballistic missiles and seven cruise missiles had targeted cities across the country overnight, causing a major power outage in the Kyiv region.The city's mayor Vitali Klitschko said air defences were in operation during what the military said had been a missile attack. The CEO of energy company Yasno said the whole city had gone into \"emergency shutdowns\" as a result, while emergency workers sought to put out fires and reconnect supplies in sub-zero temperatures.The country's foreign minister accused Russia of deliberately targeting energy infrastructure to \"deprive people of power, water and heating\" and heating as they woke up to temperatures below -15C.Parts of the capital had already faced days without heating and electricity in freezing temperatures due to strikes last week.Zelensky said four people were killed in a missile strike \"without any military purpose whatsoever\" on a postal terminal in Korotych, Kharkiv.The north-eastern region's governor said 10 people had been injured, while Ukraine's foreign ministry said 30 people had been evacuated.Elsewhere, the governor of Donetsk Vadym Filashkin said two were killed in strikes across the eastern region, while officials in Odesa in southern Ukraine said six people were injured by strikes which damaged homes, energy facilities, a hospital and a kindergarten.Kyiv said it had also launched its own attack overnight on a drone manufacturing plant in Russia's western Rostov region. The army's general staff said explosions and a fire were recorded in the area.The latest attacks came two days after Russia's full-scale invasion hit its 1,418th day - the same length of the Soviet army's participation in World War Two.The EU's ambassador to Ukraine Katarina Matheronva wrote on social media: \"Back then, the USSR was attacked, fought back, and - thanks to massive Western support - ended the war victorious... Today, Putin chose this war. Planned it. Launched it. Owns it.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoKaty AustinTransport correspondentThe government is set to announce its intention to build a new rail link between Birmingham and Manchester, the BBC understands.Previous plans for the HS2 high-speed rail line had included a line between the two cities, but that part of the project was scrapped by Rishi Sunak's government.On Wednesday, the government is also expected to confirm proposals for new and improved rail links across the North of England in a scheme known as Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR).Little detail about a new Birmingham to Manchester route is anticipated, other than the intention to build it after NPR is completed, meaning it may not happen for decades.Plans to bring high-speed rail to the north of England were first put forward by former Conservative chancellor George Osborne in 2014.The existing West Coast main line is very crowded and ministers acknowledge the need to increase capacity at some point.  Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has supported the idea of an alternative new line between Birmingham and Manchester.A new rail line between Liverpool and Manchester is seen a central piece of the overall Northern Powerhouse rail project, which is aimed at cutting travel times between northern cities and towns as well as boosting the UK economy outside of London.But expected announcements from the current government were put on ice several times last year due to cost concerns.Insiders said an extended review process of the project was under way in a bid to avoid mistakes made with HS2, which has been dogged by problems and costly delays.HS2 is currently tens of billions of pounds over budget and around a decade behind schedule.Reports state that the now-shortened line between Birmingham and London could cost £81bn.Accounting for inflation, that would mean at least £100bn will be spent but only 135 miles of railway built.HS2 Ltd, the company created by the Department for Transport, has accepted it failed to keep overall costs under control and said delivery has not matched what it described as the unrealistic early expectations.The Conservatives said Labour had \"no ability to follow through on its promises\".Shadow Rail Minister Jerome Mayhew said: \"Labour have spent months talking up Northern Powerhouse Rail, yet today they've put back any plans to actually deliver it and rewritten timetables on the fly.\"Northern Powerhouse Rail could have been transformational, empowering regional growth and regeneration. \"Under Labour it risks becoming a permanent mirage that is endlessly redesigned, downgraded and never delivered.\"",

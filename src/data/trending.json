    "body": "5 hours agoCaroline HawleyDiplomatic CorrespondentTelegramFootage shared on social media showed protesters breaking the gate of the governor's office in FasaProtesters in Iran have tried to break into a local government building in the southern province of Fars, on a fourth day of demonstrations sparked by a currency collapse.Officials said three police officers were injured and four people arrested in the city of Fasa.Confrontations were also been reported in the western provinces of Hamedan and Lorestan.The authorities in the capital, Tehran, had declared Wednesday a bank holiday - in an apparent effort to quell the unrest.In video that emerged on social media and was verified by the BBC, a crowd is filmed breaking the gate of the governor's office in Fasa.Then, in another post, security men are seen shooting in response. Clouds of tear gas rise in front of shuttered shops.Across the country, schools, universities and public institutions were closed because of the last-minute public holiday announced by the Iranian government.It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran on Sunday - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "Three hikers, including a 19-year-old who fell approximately 500 feet (150m), have been found dead on Mt Baldy, a looming snow-capped mountain known to be one of the most dangerous to climb in Southern California.Rescue workers found Marcus Alexander Muench Casanova, 19, dead and discovered two other dead hikers during the search, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.The other two hikers were not hiking with the teenager, and it is not clear how long they had been deceased on the mountain.Casanova went hiking on 29 December with a friend who was able to call for help after the teen fell. The friend had to hike away from the fall site near the Devil's Backbone trail to an area with cell reception and provided their GPS location to rescue crews, authorities said. That companion was unharmed.Due to high winds, emergency crews were unable to complete a recovery operation by helicopter on Monday, but were able to recover the bodies on Tuesday.The sheriff's office said it had rescued five other hikers from the mountain in the previous five days.\"We are destroyed by the loss of our beloved Marcus,\" his family said in a statement on Wednesday. The statement described the California native as an \"avid sailor and outdoorsman\".Rising 10,064 feet (3068m) in the San Gabriel Mountains, Mt Baldy – officially known as Mt San Antonio – has become one of the deadliest peaks in the United States.More than 14 people have died on the mountain since 2020, including British actor Julian Sands in January 2023, although his remains were not found until five months later. More than 100 people have been rescued from the mountain since 2020.Proximity to Los Angeles means Mt Baldy attracts experienced and inexperienced climbers, and authorities urged people to stay off the mountain, especially during such unpredictable winter weather.\"It is one of the most dangerous trails we have here in our area,\" Jenny Smith, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, said of the Devil's Backbone trail during a news conference. \"We don't want novice hikers going up and hurting themselves.\"Southern California has been blanketed in rain and snow over the last week, but on 29 December, when the teen went hiking, the sun was shining, and the skies were blue with unusually clear visibility across the region.Mt Baldy was visible across Southern California, with breathtaking views from as far away as Catalina Island.The weather can change quickly on Mt Baldy, and conditions can be treacherous with snow and ice. Climbers venturing along the Devil's Backbone trail are advised to carry crampons and ice axes.Trails on the mountain have been temporarily closed until the new year following the deaths and the repeated rescue responses.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterDowning StreetPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has promised to \"defeat the decline and division offered by others\" in his new year message, as he insisted 2026 would see people feel \"positive change\" in their lives.He acknowledged \"things have been tough in Britain for a while\" but said the public should now start to see improvements including lower bills, more police on the streets and new health hubs.It has been a difficult year for the PM, who has been battling slowing economic growth, poor poll ratings and speculation he could face a leadership challenge.In her own new year message, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said 2025 had seen \"no growth, higher taxes and record unemployment\".However, she added that Britain was \"not destined for decline\" and her party's plan would \"back business and fix our economy so we can fund our armed forces, police, schools, NHS and build something that we feel proud of\".Sir Keir said he shared \"the frustration about the pace of change\" but \"the challenges we face were decades in the making, and renewal is not an overnight job\".He added: \"By staying the course, we will defeat the decline and division offered by others.\"The PM promised that over the next year \"things start to feel easier\", pointing to frozen rail fares, prescription charges and fuel duty, as well as increases to the minimum wage.\"In 2026, the choices we've made will mean more people will begin to feel positive change in your bills, your communities and your health service,\" he said.\"But even more people will feel once again a sense of hope, a belief that things can and will get better, feel that the promise of renewal can become a reality, and my government will make it that reality.\"The Liberal Democrats and Reform UK look forward to May's local elections in their new year messages.Both parties are hoping to make gains in the polls, which cover the Scottish parliament and the Welsh Senedd as well as thousands of council seats in England and a handful of directly elected mayoralties.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said his party could \"win again in 2026\" after \"our record-breaking success\" in the last local elections.He vowed to \"stop Trump's America becoming Farage's Britain\" and \"change our country for the better\".Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, whose party has been consistently leading in national opinion polls since the spring, said his party was offering \"hope\" and \"change\", as he predicted May would be \"the single most important set of elections between now and the next general election\".He said the country was getting \"gloomier\" and \"poorer\", with higher unemployment and debt \"running completely out of control\".Farage criticised both Labour and the Conservatives for not understanding the \"new world\" of cryptocurrencies, AI and digital assets, which he described as \"the technologies of growth\".In his new year message, SNP leader John Swinney said the last year had been \"difficult\" for some, with \"conflict and upheaval\" across the world. The first minister said he would be \"toasting Scotland's famous win against Denmark\" to qualify for the World Cup, as well as looking forward to the competition over the summer and the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.",

    "description": "Finnish police have detained a vessel sailing from Russia, which is suspected of damaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia ",
    "body": "Finnish police have detained a vessel sailing from Russia, which is suspected of damaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland.The cargo vessel, the Fitburg, was sailing from St Petersburg to the port of Haifa in Israel, under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.All 14 crew members were arrested after the cable owned by Finnish telecoms operator Elisa was damaged. The operator said in a statement that the damage had \"not affected the functionality of Elisa's services in any way\", and its services had been re-routed.The Baltic Sea has seen a series of incidents in recent years in which underwater cables have been damaged or completely cut.Many experts and political leaders have viewed the recent incidents as part of a \"hybrid war\" carried out by Russia against Western countries. The issue has come under increased focus since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Police said they were investigating \"aggravated disruption of telecommunications\" and \"aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage\".The detained crew members were Russian, Georgian, Kazakh and Azerbaijani, police added.Undersea cables carry crucial electricity and data between countries, and keep people connected to the internet.On Wednesday morning, the Finnish authorities sent a helicopter and a patrol ship to the area, where they found the vessel was dragging its anchor in the sea, Finland's coastguard said.They said they had \"launched operations this morning to investigate the suspected cable damage\" after telecoms provider Elisa detected a fault.Finnish police said the authorities had \"taken control of the vessel as part of a joint operation\".\"At this stage, the police are investigating the incident as aggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications,\" the police added.\"Finland is prepared for security challenges of various kinds, and we respond to them as necessary,\" Finnish President Alexander Stubb said in a statement on social media. At a press conference, police were asked by journalists if the cable was damaged on behalf of another country, local media reported.Police Chief Ilkka Koskimäki replied that \"the police or other authorities do not speculate on these matters. The police's job is to investigate what happened.\"Eight Nato countries, and Russia, border the Baltic Sea - Finland, Estonia, Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden.Estonia's government said a second telecoms cable connecting it to Finland also suffered an outage on Wednesday. The country's President Alar Karis said \"hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify\".The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen posted on X, adding that it was prepared to counter \"hybrid threats\".\"We're already talking about national security. Critical infrastructure is the front line,\" the Finnish MP Jarno Limnell commented on the incident, in a post on X.Nato has identified deep-sea cables as part of the world's critical infrastructure and previously warned that adversaries could exploit them through sabotage or hybrid warfare, threatening both civilian and military communications.\"Hybrid warfare\" includes underwater sabotage, anonymous cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, and non-military tactics to destabilise adversaries.In December 2024, Finnish police said they were investigating whether a Russian ship was involved in the sabotage of an electricity cable running between Finland and Estonia.A month earlier, the German government said damage to two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea looked like an act of sabotage. A cable between Finland and Germany was cut, as well as another cable between Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland Island. ",

Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped \"between a bench and a table\". He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, \"I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured. After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.Niels HonkoopNiels Honkoop (right) described the accident as \"chaos\"\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.Watch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu PicchuMore on this story",

    "body": "3 hours agoNick ThorpeCentral Europe correspondentBulgaria - the poorest country in the European Union - has become the 21st member of the eurozone - leapfrogging more obvious and prosperous candidates like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.For mostly urban, young and entrepreneurial Bulgarians, it's an optimistic and  potentially lucrative leap - the final move in a game which has brought Bulgaria into the European mainstream - from Nato and EU membership, to joining the Schengen zone, and now the euro.For the older, rural, more conservative parts of the population, the replacement of the Bulgarian lev by the euro provokes fear and resentment.The lev - meaning lion - has been the Bulgarian currency since 1881, but it has been pegged to other European currencies since 1997 - first the Deutschmark, then the euro.Opinion polls put Bulgaria's 6.5 million population more or less equally divided on the new currency, and political turmoil is not making the transition easy. Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov's coalition government lost a confidence vote on 11 December, after mass protests against the 2026 budget. Bulgaria has held seven elections in the past four years - an eighth looks likely early next year.\"I don't want the euro, and I don't like the way it has been imposed on us,\" Todor, 50, a small business owner in the central town of Gabrovo, at the foot of the Balkan mountains, told the BBC. \"If there were a referendum, I reckon 70% of the people would vote against it.\" A referendum on euro adoption was proposed by President Rumen Radev but rejected by the outgoing government. Todor's business, producing coloured plastics for the domestic market, had a bad  year because of high inflation, he said, and a fall in sales fuelled, he believed, by fear of the euro.Ognian Enev, 60, who owns a tea shop in central Sofia, was more enthusiastic. \"On the whole, it's a good thing. It's just a technical change. It doesn't bother me,\" he told the BBC. In any case, he pointed out, people who bought flats or cars until now have got used to prices marked in euros. The 1.2 million Bulgarians who live outside the country have also been sending money home for years in euros.Like many shopkeepers, Ognian has the new currency ready, in coins and small denomination notes, ready for the transition. Throughout January, you can pay in both lev and euros, but change is supposed to be in euros. From 1 February, it will no longer be permitted to pay in lev. He hopes joining the single currency will be good for trade - many of his flavoured and fruit teas come from sellers in the eurozone, while the more expensive, high-end teas are imported direct from China and Japan.Since August 2025, all shops in Bulgaria have been required by law to display prices in both currencies. Conveniently, €1 is worth about two lev (1.95583 to be exact). In response to public fears that prices will be rounded up, elaborate watchdogs have been created, to protect consumers. And some prices have been rounded down: the cost of public transport in the capital Sofia is due to fall slightly.The design on the reverse side of the new eurocoins was chosen to overcome worries that Bulgaria is losing its sovereignty. St Ivan of Rila is on the €1 coin, Paisius of Hilendar, an 18th Century monk and champion of the national revival, is on the €2 coin. The smaller denomination eurocents carry an image of the Madara rider, a symbol of early Bulgarian statehood, based on an 8th Century rock relief.Just how the new currency will impact Bulgaria as a whole, concerns everyone. The lessons from other countries offer two versions - the successful \"Baltic model\" followed by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which combined the euro with reforms to streamline administration, encourage investment and combat corruption. And the \"Italian model\", where years of stagnation followed.\"I'm afraid we'll be more like Italy,\" Ognian Enev predicted.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has made the first vetoes of legislation since retaking the White House nearly a year ago, setting up a potential showdown with US lawmakers.The two bills he vetoed passed Congress with bipartisan support, meaning lawmakers could muster enough votes to override him in the new year.A Trump ally, and well-known Republican, Representative Lauren Boebert, sponsored one of the bills, which was aimed at cutting the amounts that communities in her home state of Colorado are paying toward a new water pipeline.The other bill would have supported a flooding mitigation project for a Native American tribe in Florida that had sued to stop construction of \"Alligator Alcatraz\".In a message to Congress, Trump called the Colorado plan economically unviable.\"Enough is enough.  My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies,\" Trump said.He added the bill would have hurt repayments to the federal government for building the pipeline, which will bring fresh water to the eastern part of the state..Boebert, one of a handful of conservative lawmakers to break with Trump and push for the release of the Epstein files this winter, responded to the veto with a post on X, writing: \"This isn't over.\"\"I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation,\" she then said in a statement.Trump has also sparred with Colorado's political leaders over the imprisonment of Tina Peters, a 73-year-old county clerk who echoed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and was convicted by both the state and US government for election security-related offences.Trump, who pardoned Peters of her federal charges this month, has called on the Colorado's Democratic governor, Jared Polis, to release her. Polis has said it is up to the courts to decide her case, which has become a rallying cry for Trump's Make America Great Again wing of the Republican party.\"Free Tina Peters!\" Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday, and wrote about Colorado officials: \"I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell.\"The second bill he vetoed, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act, would have required the Interior Department to help the tribe in Florida prevent flooding in a part of their community that has vulnerable infrastructure.In his veto message, Trump wrote that the Miccosukee had conducted \"unauthorised\" development on the land in question.The White House also alleged the tribe \"actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.\"The Miccosukee tribe took legal action against the Trump administration's construction of an immigration detention centre in the Florida Everglades known as \"Alligator Alcatraz\".In court filings, the tribe had argued it was uniquely impacted by the construction of the site, and its construction posed environmental risks.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterYoung children from struggling families in some parts of England will be offered vaccinations at home to protect them from preventable diseases, the health secretary has said.The pilot scheme, announced on Thursday as part of a drive to increase vaccine uptake, will see health visitors trained to spend more time with small numbers of families who could fall through the cracks of the NHS.Wes Streeting told the BBC that children's healthcare had not been given the priority it deserved.The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said it was \"a national scandal\" that more than half a million children faced long waits to access health services in England.In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Streeting said he was \"shocked\" by what he described as a lack of focus on children's health when he was in opposition.\"As human beings, it is in our nature to prioritise children. You talk to the overwhelming majority of parents, good parents, they will take bullets for their children,\" the health secretary said.\"There is that kind of innate sense of 'I will do everything I can to protect my child'. I don't think that's reflected sufficiently in the state,\" he added.The pilot scheme was part of that aim, he said, targeting families who are not signed up to a GP surgery or face language barriers, travel costs or childcare issues which stop them getting to a doctor.Uptake of childhood vaccines has declined over the past 10 years - no jabs met the 95% coverage target for children aged five and below, according to the latest data.Twelve areas in London, the Midlands, the North East and Yorkshire, the North West, and South West will test the approach over the next year.The government said all other families should continue to have children vaccinated at their local surgery.Streeting said there had been a decline in the number of health visitors and community nursing over a number of years, and that government was developing a workforce plan to address recruitment.Health visitors are registered nurses or midwives who have additional training in community public health nursing. They work with families with a child aged five and under to identify health needs.In response to Streeting's comments, the Conservatives accused Labour of having \"no plan for children's health or the health service as a whole\". \"Labour are trying to distract from their dismal failures by pointing the finger at the last government,\" shadow health secretary Stuart Andrew said.Professor Steve Turner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, welcomed the plan and called on the health secretary to \"right the wrongs of the past\".Addressing NHS waiting times, he said it was now a \"matter of routine\" that children were not being seen by health professionals within the NHS's 18-week target, adding that he was \"particularly astounded\" that a quarter of children wait more than a year for community treatment, compared with just 1% of adults.\"Long waits for community and elective care are unacceptable at any age, but this is especially true for children where delays can cause irreversible and lifelong harm if care isn't provided during critical developmental windows,\" Prof Turner said.He added that the unequal treatment of adults and children \"must end\" by tackling obesity, protecting mental health, reducing exposure to nicotine and boosting vaccinations in children.Children up to the age of six across the UK are to be offered vaccine protection against chickenpox free on the NHS from January 2026.",

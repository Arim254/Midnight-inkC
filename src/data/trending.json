    "body": "Image caption, Why is the UK so cold now?Call it a cold snap or just typical British weather. One thing is certain, the weather outside is frightful, freezing, and just really cold.BBC Bitesize spoke to Dr Sylvia Knight, Head of Education at the Royal Meteorologist Society to answer all your cold weather questions.How cold does it have to be for snow?Image caption, The cold never bothered him anywayTo get snow, there has to be enough water vapour in the air to make clouds, and it must be cold enough (0°C) that snowflakes will form and not melt as they fall through the atmosphere to the ground.In the UK, we commonly get snow when the wind is blowing from the north or north east (for example, from the Arctic or Siberia). This air is then warmed from below as it approaches the UK, and rises further when it hits the coasts, hills and mountains.Once the air gets high enough, it cools again until it reaches the point where there is more condensation happening than evaporation - this makes clouds.As the UK is surrounded by sea, there is always plenty of moisture in the air for cloud to form.“It’s never too cold to snow in the UK,” says Dr Sylvia Knight, Head of Education at the Royal Meteorologist Society, “but it can be elsewhere in the world.”“It can be too cold for snow in the centre of large land masses, such as Eurasia, Antarctica or North America, where the wind has not encountered enough water that can easily evaporate.”Water vapour might be picked up over the oceans, such as the North Atlantic or Arctic ocean.“The rate of evaporation from lakes and rivers, which may be frozen, is far slower than from oceans,” Dr Sylvia says. “The oceans change temperature far more slowly than the land does, and so are a source of water vapour all year round compared to places where there is a lot of frozen water.”So, it's not too cold to snow in other places - it’s just too dry!How to tell between a common cold and the flu?Image caption, Should you starve a fever, feed a cold?While their symptoms are similar and they are both communicable viruses, colds and flu are quite different.Flu is characterised by a sudden fever, aches, pains and nausea, and avoiding rest can worsen symptoms and slow down recovery.Colds may make you feel lousy, but don’t always stop you from your day-to-day tasks and the symptoms should start to go away in the second week.You shouldn’t do is take antibiotics for either, as antibiotics fight against bacterial infections, they don’t treat viruses. It’s best to keep your fluids up for either, avoid sneezing on your hands, and eat if you can stomach it!Why don't gloves work on touch screens?Image caption, Woolly gloves are the enemyYou’re out playing in the snow and you need to check the Bitesize website - but oh no! Your woolly gloves act like a barrier between you and your phone screen. You can always get touch screen gloves - but how do they work?A capacitor is a device that has the ability to store electric charge.  Most phones and tablets have capacitive touchscreens - screens that have an insulator that is coated in a conductive material.Capacitors work by detecting anything that can store an electric charge. This includes you (think about when you rub your feet on the carpet and then get a static shock).When your finger comes into contact with a touchscreen, you create an electrical circuit between your body’s electrical field and the conductors in the screen. This ‘tells’ the conductors exactly where you’re touching.Touch screen gloves have conductive wire woven into the fingertips (usually copper yarn), which completes the circuit and allows the touch screen to detect your electrical field. Now you can stay warm and revise!Is it okay to wear a coat inside?Image caption, Staying warm this WinterSome people say you must take your coat off indoors, or you won’t feel the benefit when you go back outside. But is this true?When you wear a coat, you insulate yourself. This makes it harder for infrared radiation (heat) to escape from your body and be lost to the atmosphere. However, that coat also insulates you from heat coming in.“If you put a coat on when you’ve been inside for a while, you may get a bit warm, but you’ll be fine when you go outside and start slowly losing some of that extra warmth to the atmosphere,” says Dr Sylvia.However, she says you should take your coat off indoors for another reason. If you’ve been outside for a long time with your coat on, and are chilly when you come in, then the coat is also cold and will need to warm up. You’ll warm up far quicker without it on.How to stay safe while driving in icy conditions in the UK?Image caption, This icy barrier is no match for methanolUsing a de-icer is an important way to safe of the road. But how does it work?There are many different solutions of windscreen fluid, but the key ingredient to typical de-icer is methanol. This can be in bottle form so you can de-ice a windscreen manually, or in the washer system of the car itself.Methanol is a type of alcohol and is incredibly toxic to humans. It is diluted with water before it goes into the washer system, but it should definitely stay on the outside of the car and never be ingested.Methanol freezes way below sub-zero temperatures, and, when mixed with water, creates a solution which lowers the freezing point of moisture already on the windscreen. Using only water to de-ice the windscreen is counterproductive as there will just be more moisture on the screen to freeze again.Some cars have a washer system that heats the fluid before squirting it out. The methanol stops the warm water from freezing again on the windscreen. However, pouring boiling water over the windscreen can shatter the glass in cold conditions.Some people use vinegar or rubbing alcohol as an alternative to methanol solution, as they both have lower freezing point than water and are effective glass cleaners.The de-icer will always be more effective if you give the driver a hand in scraping their windows and windscreen first!Image caption, This gritter is the real winter soldierGrit saves the day, you might complain about getting stuck behind the winter service vehicles, but the school run would be an even bigger nightmare without them.While it’s called grit, most gritters actually use halite, also known as rock salt. But halite doesn’t actually melt snow the way heat does.Grit lowers the freezing point of moisture on the road surface, preventing snow from sticking in the first place.The moisture on the road mixes with the salt and creates a saline solution preventing snow or ice from building up.Technically you could use table salt to clear your driveway, but you’d have to get the timing and conditions right before too much ice builds up. Salting your drive before it’s too icy can help prevent slips and falls, but throwing salt at a pile of snow won’t work so well.Table salt is not exactly the same as halite - it’s refined for eating, so is treated to remove any impurities. Rock salt is already mined whole and does not undergo this process.This article was published in December 2019 and updated in November 2025",

    "body": "7 hours agoBBCThere will be \"boots on the ground\" in Ukraine after the war, heralds the i Paper as the UK and France pledge military bases \"to keep peace\" in the event of a deal to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has celebrated the commitment as a \"huge step forward\".The Times echoes the Metro with \"boots on the ground in Ukraine\" in its main headline. The paper carries quotes from PM Keir Starmer saying an end to the conflict with Russia is \"closer than ever\". A photo of a dancing President Trump is splashed across the front page. The president claims deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro copied his moves before he was seized, the paper notes. The Guardian says European leaders have \"dramatically rallied together\" in support of Denmark over Greenland, as the Trump administration underlines its interest in acquiring the Arctic territory. The paper also says British and French troops posted to Ukraine after any future peace deal would be \"unlikely to engage directly with Russian forces should Moscow relaunch an invasion\".The Independent also leads with the possibility of British troops in Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, noting that US envoy Jared Kushner said Trump \"strongly, strongly, strongly\" supports the deal.The Sun leads with \"one for the road\" with the government set to propose tighter drink-driving limits in England and Wales, to bring them in line with Scotland. Lowering the threshold from its current 35mcg of alcohol per 100ml of breath to 22mcg would be the first change to the limit since 1967, the paper notes.\"Drink-drive changes to kill off rural pubs\" declares the Daily Telegraph. It says Labour is planning to cut the alcohol limit \"after raising taxes and minimum wage\". Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for the West Midlands Police Chief to resign following the banning of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a Birmingham football match.The Daily Mirror takes a different tack to the Telegraph, calling government plans to tighten alcohol limits part of a \"drive to safety\". The changes will \"cut crashes and save lives\", it says. Also on the Mirror's front, ex-Little Mix star Jesy Nelson's call for expanded testing of babies for a rare muscle condition has been praised by Health Secretary Wes Streeting.Following a car crash in which one teen died and another survived, police mixed up the fates of the two boys telling the wrong family about the death in a \"blunder to defy belief\", the Daily Mail writes. South Yorkshire Police realised their error when the badly injured survivor woke up and told them his name.Venezuela's oil output now faces collapse, the Financial Times says, as the US naval blockade \"chokes exports\". Two businessmen involved in the Wirecard fraud scandal have been handed the longest prison sentences connected to the case - one for 10 years and another for six and a half years.It is \"Groky horror show\" for Metro, after two cabinet ministers have become victims of deepfake sexualised images on X. Ofcom has said it is having \"urgent talks\" with the platform on the basis of \"serious concerns\".For the Daily Star \"Kaleb's true grit\" leads as Jeremy Clarkson's \"pal\" is \"on snow patrol\". The paper also hints at a \"secret Traitor exclusive\". The \"major snow storm blast\" approaching Britain also tops the Daily Express. Storm Goretti is a rare \"multi-hazard\" event of that will lash the nation with wind, snow and rain. Also on the front, there is \"fury over PM's plan to unpick our Brexit\", the paper declares.Related Internet Links",

Sarah's body was found later that evening, with police still searching for Grace.As Humberside Police released more details, James Dick OBE - the King's representative for the county - said: \"I am investigating the most appropriate way to recognise Mark Ratcliffe's selfless act of bravery\".Phillip Norton/BBCPolice continue their efforts to try to locate Grace Keeling Dick, the lord-lieutenant for the East Riding of Yorkshire, added: \"It is a very tragic situation where three people have lost their lives.\"My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of those involved and also to the community of Withernsea, which is feeling such a tragic loss.\"His office would be \"contacting people involved in the awards process to understand which award is the most appropriate\", he added.Mark was from Withernsea while Sarah and Grace were from Nottinghamshire, police said.Paying tribute, Mark's family previously described him as a \"true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".On Tuesday, Ch Insp Tom Stevens gave further details of the circumstances of the deaths.He said: \"From trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses who were in the area at the time, it is understood that Grace and her friend were on the steps near to the rocks when Grace is believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave.\"Grace's mum, Sarah, and three other members of the public who were nearby at the time, including Mark, immediately entered the water in an effort to save Grace.\"'Finding Grace is priority' Stevens said that two of those three who also entered the water in an attempt to assist with the rescue managed to exit safely.He added: \"Our priority now is to find Grace, and we are doing everything we can to locate her. This includes extensive searches along the shoreline and drone searches from Withernsea to Easington directed by our specialist search teams.\"Stevens said its underwater search unit had also been deployed and officers had consulted with an oceanographer.Both families continue to be supported by officers, Stevens said.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "19 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterSinger and actress Ashley Tisdale has spoken out about being \"brought to tears\" by being a member of a \"toxic mom group\", which she ultimately decided to leave.The US actress rose to fame as a child star on the Disney Channel and later appeared in the High School Musical films as Sharpay Evans.The 40-year-old has previously discussed the benefits of having support from a \"village of moms\" following the birth of her first daughter in 2021.But she said the changing dynamic of the group, which reportedly includes several other celebrities, ended up reminding her of high school cliques and left her feeling \"frozen out\" at a vulnerable time.The star, who has two young daughters with husband Christopher French, made the comments in an article for the Cut, which was adapted from her own blog post on the subject.She said the response to her blog about how \"mom groups can turn toxic\" had made her phone \"blow up like no other\" topic, with messages from women who had experienced similar things.In her case, the singer said she had noticed that some mothers in the group had started socialising without her, and had felt a \"growing distance\" from them at events they did attend together.\"I was starting to feel frozen out of the group,\" she said, \"noticing every way that they seemed to exclude me.\"Tisdale said it reminded her of an earlier stage of the group's friendship, when she had \"picked up on hints of a weird dynamic\" involving \"another mom who often wasn't included\".\"It seemed that this group had a pattern of leaving someone out,\" Tisdale reflected. \"And that someone had become me.\"She added that the interactions \"took me back to an unpleasant but familiar feeling I thought I'd left behind years ago\" that maybe she was not \"cool enough\".Tisdale ultimately decided to cut ties with the group and said she sent a message to the other members explaining: \"This is too high school for me and I don't want to take part in it anymore.\"She said her message \"didn't exactly go over well\", but noted that some of the mothers did then try to \"smooth things over\".She added: \"To be clear, I have never considered the moms to be bad people (maybe one) but I do think our group dynamic stopped being healthy and positive - for me anyway.\"The actress discouraged readers from trying to guess exactly who she was referring to in the post, adding: \"Whatever you think is true isn't even close.\"She added that the feedback she's had from other women on the subject has shown \"I'm far from the only mother who's been brought to tears by members of a group that's supposed to lift everyone up\".As a singer, Tisdale released three studio albums, while her acting credits also include the Scary Movie and Bring It On franchises.",

    "body": "5 hours agoChris GrahamGetty ImagesAmes was jailed in April 1994 after he admitted selling secret information to the Soviet Union and later RussiaAldrich Ames, a CIA officer who became one of America's most damaging double agents, has died aged 84. The former counterintelligence officer, who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, died on Monday at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland, CBS News, the BBC's media partner in the US, reported.Ames was jailed on 28 April 1994 after he admitted to selling secret information to the Soviet Union and later Russia.He compromised more than 100 clandestine operations and divulged the identities of more than 30 agents spying for the West - leading to the deaths of at least 10 CIA intelligence assets. Seeking money to pay debts, Ames said he began providing the KGB with the names of CIA spies in April 1985, receiving an initial payment of $50,000.Known to the KGB by his code name, Kolokol (The Bell), Ames went on to identify virtually all of the CIA's spies in the Soviet Union, for which he was well rewarded. \"To my enduring surprise, the KGB replied that it had set aside for me $2 million in gratitude for the information,\" he said in an eight-page statement he read to the court.Over the course of nine years, Ames admitted receiving a total of about $2.5 million from the Soviet Union for his betrayal of the US.The cash fuelled a lavish lifestyle, with Ames splashing out on a new Jaguar car, foreign holidays and a $540,000 house - despite never having a salary of more than $70,000 a year.Ames's 31-year career at the CIA began when his father, an analyst at the CIA, helped him land a job there after dropping out of college in 1962.He married his first wife, fellow CIA agent Nancy Segebarth, in 1969, before being sent to Turkey as a counterintelligence officer to recruit foreign agents. Three years later, he was brought back to the US, where his problems with alcohol began to emerge and his marriage began to collapse.  Despite several security violations over the years, including leaving a briefcase full of classified information on a subway, Ames was then sent to Mexico City in 1981. Sygma via Getty ImagesAmes' second wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Dupuy, was charged as his accompliceThere he met his second wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Dupuy, a cultural attaché at the Colombian embassy and a CIA asset who would later be charged as his accomplice.Returning to the US in 1983, Ames became head of the CIA's Soviet counterintelligence department - despite continuing concerns over his drinking. While his career was soaring, his personal life was spiralling. As well as paying monthly support to his first wife, he was also funding Rosario's lifestyle, including her love of shopping.It was his escalating debts that led him to selling the wealth of secrets that he had access to.  \"It was about the money, and I don't think he ever really tried to lead anybody to believe it was anything more than that,\" FBI agent Leslie G Wiser, who was involved in the investigation that led to Ames's arrest, told the BBC's Witness History in 2015.His treachery began in 1985 when he gave the Soviets the names of a few KGB officers secretly working for the FBI in exchange for $50,000.His espionage continued for the following nine years, until his arrest on 21 February 1994, after a mole hunt that had started closing in the year before. Ames cooperated with the authorities in exchange for a plea deal that secured a lenient sentence for Rosario, who admitted she had known about the money and his meetings with the Soviets. She was released after five years.The CIA director at the time, R. James Woolsey, described Ames as \"a malignant betrayer of his country\". Woolsey said the agents Ames betrayed died because a \"murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar\".",

    "body": "21 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaThe US military action in Venezuela was the right thing to do \"morally\", Kemi Badenoch has said.The Conservative leader told the BBC that while she did not understand the legal basis for Donald Trump's operation to remove President Nicolás Maduro from the country, he was overseeing a \"brutal regime\" and she was \"glad he's gone\".However, she added that the move did \"raise serious questions about the rules-based order\".The UK government has so far avoided criticising the US move or saying whether it breached international law, instead arguing that Maduro was an \"illegitimate president\".However, some Labour MPs and opposition parties including the Liberal Democrats, Green Party and SNP have called on the government to condemn Trump's actions and brand them illegal.Badenoch told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the US action was \"extraordinary\" but she understood why it was taken.\"Where the legal certainty is not yet clear, morally, I do think it was the right thing to do,\" she said.The Tory leader, who spent her childhood in Nigeria before moving back to the UK at the age of 16, added: \"I grew up under a military dictatorship, so I know what it's like to have someone like Maduro in charge.\"However, she said it was right to tell Trump not to intervene in Greenland because \"there is a big difference between democratic states\" and the \"gangster state in Venezuela\".\"What happens in Greenland is up to Denmark and the people of Greenland,\" she added.In recent days Trump has repeated his threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory which has a strategic location and is rich in minerals - arguing it is vital for US national security.The UK has issued a joint statement with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark insisting it is for Denmark and Greenland alone to decide on matters concerning the territory's future.Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Breakfast the UK's approach to Greenland was different to Venezuela as Denmark was a member of the Nato military alliance and it was not in the UK's national security interests to question the territory's future.Streeting also defended the prime minister's response to the developments in Venezuela, arguing he was acting in the UK's national interest, as well as the \"best interests of the people of Venezuela\".\"I appreciate there are others who have been more strident and have been more critical of the United States,\" he said.\"The prime minister has a different responsibility, and he is choosing his words carefully and wisely to try and influence how events unfold from here on.\"Critics of the government's approach, including Labour MP Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, have argued the US action risks emboldening Russia and China and that the UK should be clear the operation breached international law.In a statement in the House of Commons on Monday evening, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she had reminded her US counterpart Marco Rubio of his obligations under international law.However, she reiterated the prime minister's position that it is for the US to set out the legal basis for its actions.Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife were seized from Caracas on Saturday in an operation by US forces which also saw strikes on military bases in the country.The pair have been taken to New York where they have been charged with weapon and drug offences, accused of enriching themselves from a violent crime ring smuggling cocaine to the US.Maduro has long rejected the allegations as a pretext to force him from power and both have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.Trump has vowed to \"run the country\" until there is a \"proper\" transition of power, with Venezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as interim president.",

    "body": "Is AI taking the fun out of fantasy football?22 hours agoJack GrayandYasmin Malik,BBC NewsbeatPA WireAI tools offer \"expert management\" that could help you top your mini-leagueFor years, fantasy football has given every armchair manager the space to back up claims they \"could do a better job\" than the real thing.Whether you're competing against workmates, family members or strangers, the ability to pull together your own dream team is irresistible to millions of football fans.The competitive pastime has spawned a whole industry of content creators offering weekly tips for anyone looking to gain an edge as they sift through stats and manage transfers.Recently, more players have been turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for advice - but not everyone agrees they have a place in the virtual dugout.Ryan JordanContent creator Ryan Jordan posts fantasy football tips and advice to TikTokFantasy Premier League (FPL) is the UK's most popular fantasy league, and claims to have more than 11 million players taking part.Users select squads of 15 footballers, who each earn points based on their weekly on-pitch performance. The catch? A £100m budget, constant price changes, and a strict limit on how many players you're allowed from each side. Content creator Ryan Jordan, who posts fantasy football tips and advice to his 15,000 followers on TikTok, says FPL makes the real-life game \"more engaging to watch\".The Bristol City fan says it encourages him to pay attention to teams he might not usually follow, and makes \"every match really matter\".  \"So even a team lower in the table that you might not want to watch on TV each week, you'll watch it because you've a player from their team in your FPL team,\" he says.\"It brings the community together to watch a lot more.\"Fantasy Football HubFantasy Football Hub gives players advice, including possible transfersRyan tells BBC Newsbeat he uses Fantasy Football Hub, an app which offers AI tools, including one that rates a manager's squad. He says it gives advice on transfers, predicts how many points a certain player will achieve each week, and when it's best to play or bench them.Fantasy Football Hub's founder Will Thomas told Newsbeat the app has attracted about 793,000 members since it launched in 2019, with about 59,000 of those paying a subscription to access AI features.Of those paid members, he said, about 28,000 signed up in 2025, with about 381,000 joining as free members.Fantasy Football Fix, another popular app, told Newsbeat it had also seen user numbers climb.It now has 690,000 members overall, up from about half a million in 2022.The company believes one of its key features, an AI-powered chatbot the company says is trained on \"FPL-specific\" data, has contributed to the increase.Newsbeat understands the Premier League is set to add features to its official Companion app, which uses Microsoft's Copilot, to help users pick fantasy teams and strategies later in the season. But do AI tools actually do what they claim?Ryan says he mostly finds Fantasy Football Hub reliable. \"A lot of the time, some of the players they put in there are spot-on,\" he says.\"I'm not going to lie, there are some times I see a player and I think: 'What's he doing in there?'\"In groups dedicated to fantasy football on Reddit and other platforms, some users argue that the subscription apps don't provide insights or data which players can't get elsewhere. And one of the biggest complaints is that they remove the elements of gut instinct and luck that keep people hooked on fantasy leagues.Ryan says he understands why some people are against AI use, but he sees it as similar to getting advice from YouTube or podcasts.\"At the end of the day, I think people should play FPL in whatever way they enjoy most,\" he says.\"AI tools don't replace skill, they just support decision-making.\"Villa fan Jake reckons AI should stay on the benchTwo-thirds of FPL players who replied to a survey from Virgin Media O2 published in August said they were planning to use AI this season.However, many respondents told the company it \"takes the fun out of the game\" and others felt it was \"outright cheating\".It's a view that Newsbeat encountered among fans travelling for the Aston Villa v Manchester United match in Birmingham last month.Supporters told us they felt puzzled by others using AI to help them pick their squads.When we spoke to Jake Thomas O'Donnell, a long-time FPL player, in Birmingham city centre, he was also unimpressed.\"I think AI ruins the banter a little bit,\" the Aston Villa fan said.\"People that use AI have no clue what they're doing and automatically become these great people.\"It should be done by the person.\"Other players we spoke to say they weren't too fussed about it - and some didn't even know AI was used by others. 'I don't really see it spoiling the game'Dani GonçalvesDani Gonçalves co-created Aerial Fantasy which follows the Women's Super LeagueDani Gonçalves is a co-creator of Aerial Fantasy, one of several unofficial fantasy games developed for the Women's Super League after England's Lionesses won the 2022 Euros.It opened the 2025-26 season with more than 30,000 users.Dani argues there is little difference between following advice from an AI chatbot and a fantasy football \"expert\", such as a podcaster.\"People have always been trying to game the system and figure out a way to get the edge,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"I don't really see it spoiling the game.\"Dani admits there is a risk that widespread AI use could lead to lots of similar-looking teams as \"everyone's using the same data\".But she says those running fantasy leagues can use incentives to encourage players away from obvious or popular picks.Aerial Fantasy, for example, offers \"visionary points\", or bonuses, boosting rewards for those who choose lesser-picked squad members.Dani says there can also be a benefit for players who do enjoy the old-fashioned method of trawling stats and spreadsheets to optimise their teams.\"Some players really enjoy digging through all the data and finding that gem, and obviously using AI does make that faster,\" she says.\"They're almost more engaged than the person who is rolling the dice and just picking a random person.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this ",

    "body": "Poor decisions in extending prison lease, MPs say6 hours agoGeorge ThorpeDevonPA MediaThe Public Accounts Committee said \"poor commercial decisions\" were made when HMP Dartmoor's lease was signedA £4m-a-year lease for a prison that has been empty for 18 months has been a \"needless waste of taxpayers' money\", a report from MPs found.The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the lease for HMP Dartmoor was signed by HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) in March 2022 despite it being known the site had high levels of radon gas two years earlier.The prison in Princetown, Devon, was closed in July 2024 after the government found levels of the radioactive gas were up to 10 times higher than the safe limit.PAC said it did not accept HMPPS' excuse that the lease needed to be signed due to a prison capacity crisis.'Absolute disgrace'In its report, PAC said the lease - which cannot be terminated until at least 2033 - was signed without further comprehensive radon testing being carried out.The report said a reduction to the annual rent or safeguards to mitigate the financial risks of increased radon levels were not negotiated and \"poor commercial decisions\" were made when the lease was signed.PAC said improvement costs until the lease ends would cost £68m and neither the MoJ or HMPPS had clear plans for the prison's future.It added MoJ and HMPPS were now less than certain reopening the site represented best value for money.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, PAC's chairman, said the issue was an \"absolute disgrace, from top to bottom\".\"Dartmoor appears to the Committee a perfect example of a department reaching for a solution, any solution, in a blind panic and under pressure,\" he added.\"This is, obviously, not how policy should be delivered.\"PAC said once a plan for the prison had been decided, MoJ and HMPPS officials should assess whether they continued to spend money on the unoccupied site or consider negotiating an early exit from the lease.It has also asked HMPPS to set out what it had learnt for the future from the \"failures of its decision-making and contract management\".A MoJ spokesperson said: \"This government inherited a crisis in our prisons system, where prisons were on the brink of collapse, threatening a total collapse in law and order.\"This government is addressing the prisons crisis through building 14,000 new prison places, and the Sentencing Bill which will deliver punishment that works.\"The MoJ previously said the closure was temporary and the site had been made safe, adding it was working with specialist radon gas experts to \"investigate whether we can reopen the prison safely\".More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "4 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorThe UK and its European neighbours confront two case studies, simultaneously, in how the continent is attempting, with varying degrees of success, to bind the United States into its future.Firstly, there is Ukraine and then there is Greenland.And all this at a time of deep scepticism in Washington about Europe: its importance, its outlook and its willingness to pull its weight to defend itself.The futures of Ukraine and Greenland, both in the headlines at the same time, are the latest example of the mesmerising, head-spinning unpredictability of President Trump.Privately, senior figures in London have a knowing look when the wild uncertainty of the White House crops up in conversation.Every day is a rollercoaster, with little sense of where tomorrow or next week's twist might take them, take us.This week's developments are particularly hard to read because outwardly they point in different directions.Seven European leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, issued a joint public statement emphasising, albeit in diplomatic language, their shared view that Washington's designs on Greenland are as absurd as they are counterproductive.We are on the same side, is the thrust of their message, and this is a waste of your energy because Greenland's future is for Greenlanders to decide.But boy they know too they should take President Trump seriously.And then there is Ukraine. European diplomats believe they have persuaded America to commit to being a significant part of securing a long term peace in Ukraine – something Europe has long regarded as a prerequisite to a sustainable settlement for Kyiv, but which Washington has long resisted.Now, sources tell me, they are cautiously optimistic they have the White House on board: the presence of President Trump's envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, in Paris, at the gathering of what is known as the Coalition of the Willing was unprecedented and seen as a key indicator of a shift from Washington.The accompanying document alongside the talks, while lacking in detail, spells out the anticipated role of America, and crucially, the UK and others.The first component of what is described as \"robust security guarantees for a solid and lasting peace in Ukraine\" is a \"US led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism\".I am told this would make use of America's advanced capabilities in what is described in military circles as \"ISR\" – intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. This means drones and satellites among other things. In other words: the advanced tools of modern warfare.Precisely what America's involvement could amount to, particularly if Ukraine was targeted by Russia again, isn't clear but Ukraine and European capitals do see this latest development as a significant step forward.Of course, a huge caveat remains: can peace be secured in the first place and would Ukraine be willing to give up on any of its territory? These are two massive and not yet answered questions.Then, for the UK and others, there is the prospect of troops on the ground in Ukraine. That is a profound commitment, provoking its own big, unanswered questions: how many and for how long? Can this maintain popular support? And with what consequences for the military and for defence budgets?Make no mistake this is a promise with implicit longevity attached: beyond this prime minister, beyond this government, beyond this American president.That is what the reality of European security is expected to look like in the years, decades ahead.\"A secure Ukraine is a secure Europe and a secure Europe is a secure UK,\" is how one Whitehall figure put it to me.Expect that to be a key part of the message in the months to come.Into the longer term, the UK and its neighbours will ponder how reliable or otherwise America will be: is the Trumpian era a blip or a waymarker towards an ongoing, unpredictable future?Oh, and what will the White House be saying on Greenland and Ukraine next week, next month, next year?",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Francesca Jones is ranked 72 in the worldBritain's Francesca Jones said she had \"no idea what just happened\" after fighting through injury to reach the Auckland Classic quarter-finals.Jones registered the biggest win of her career on Monday with a three-set victory over world number 15 Emma Navarro.It looked as though the 25-year-old was feeling the after-effects when she went a set and a break down against Austrian qualifier Sinja Kraus, having twice called for the physiotherapist.However, she regrouped and won 12 of the next 14 games to triumph 1-6 6-4 6-1.\"I'm actually really relieved that's over,\" Jones told Sky Sport in New Zealand.\"When you play someone like Emma in the first round and you get through that, physically and mentally it's tough to pick yourself back up, especially in these conditions.\"I'm glad I got through that.\"British number three Jones broke into the top 100 last year, having won two WTA 125 titles - the rung below the main tour.She was previously told by doctors she would not play tennis professionally, having been born with a rare genetic condition.Jones has Ectrodactyly Ectodermal Dysplasia (EEC), which means she has three fingers and a thumb on each hand, three toes on her right foot and four toes on her left.Jones struggled with the hot conditions in Auckland but battled back well, saving nine of the 13 break points she faced to advance in just over two hours.\"She was unplayable the first set and a half and I found it really tough to get used to playing in the day compared to the night. It's a lot quicker,\" Jones added.Jones will play Chinese seventh seed Wang Xinyu for a place in the last four.Elsewhere, Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek helped Poland reach the quarter-finals of the United Cup mixed team competition.World number two Swiatek was a swift 6-3 6-2 winner over Suzan Lamens of the Netherlands after Hubert Hurkacz beat Tallon Griekspoor 6-3 7-6 (7-4).Poland will face hosts Australia on Friday.",

    "body": "19 hours agoAlice Cuddy,reporting from Cúcuta, on the Colombia-Venezuela borderandVanessa Buschschlüter,Latin America editor, BBC News OnlineReutersPolice guarded the National Assembly where Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in MondayAt least 14 members of the press were detained in Venezuela on Monday as they were covering the aftermath of the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro by US forces. The union representing media workers in Venezuela said all but one of those detained were employed by foreign news organisations and were released later on Monday, with one reporter deported. Foreign news media have long faced restrictions in Venezuela, with very few being granted visas to work in the country. Their detention came as Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as the interim president and shortly after she said that she was willing to co-operate with the Trump administration, which has said it would \"run\"  Venezuela.The union said the media workers were detained by Venezuelan security forces at the National Assembly and its environs, and in the neighbourhood of Altamira - all in the capital, Caracas.At least two of them were seized by agents working for Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency, while others were detained by Venezuela's intelligence service.They said they had their equipment searched, their phones checked and their social media posts and messages read, the union statement added. A Colombian and a Spanish reporter were also detained at Venezuela's border with Colombia near Cúcuta.The two reporters were held for hours incommunicado before being released back into Colombia, the statement said. The union called the incidents \"alarming\" and called for the release of 23 media workers who remain in detention in the country. The repression has not been confined to media workers.One community leader in the neighbourhood of Petare, in Caracas, told BBC Mundo that there were \"hooded men with guns patrolling, checking people's WhatsApp statuses\".Caracas resident José, 60, said that people were not able to talk freely about what was happening, with a heavy police and military presence on the streets, as well as pro-Maduro armed groups, known as \"colectivos\", wearing masks.A 33-year-old masseuse, who did not want to be named, said there was \"so much fear in the streets and in our homes\".Members of the government appeared keen to show that the security forces were visible in communities, with the Interior Minister, Diosdado Cabello, posting a photo of himself on Monday night posing with armed police.Their presence has struck fear in people critical of the government. One woman described how there are \"military people on every corner and groups of armed civilians supporting the government who are causing fear among the population\".Another person who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC that \"the regime is not allowing news to come out of here.\" They added that \"there are uniformed personnel on the streets stopping people and checking their phones\".Instagram/@Minsjustice_VEInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello (shown right-of-centre wearing a black cap with red writing) posted this photo on InstagramThe journalist detentions come at a volatile time in Venezuela, where just days ago the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife were seized by US forces in a pre-dawn raid in which dozens of his bodyguards and security detail were killed.While the seizure prompted celebrations among Venezuelans who oppose Maduro and who have left the country, there were no public displays of joy in Venezuela.Opposition Venezuelans have long denounced the repression they face if they speak out against the Maduro government. More than 2,000 people were arrested during protests in the wake of the 2024 presidential election.The government-dominated electoral council declared Maduro the winner of that election but voting tallies collected by the opposition and verified by independent media suggest that it was won by the opposition candidate. In the crackdown which followed the election, members of the security forces checked people's phone for messages critical of Maduro, prompting many Venezuelans to erase their social media accounts and message history. Many of those arrested at the time were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences after being sentenced for \"treason\".According to pressure group Foro Penal, there are more than 800 political prisoners being held in Venezuela as of 5 January.",

    "body": "15 hours agoChloe AslettYorkshireBBCThe incident occurred on the road between Dinnington and TodwickA police force has admitted mixing up the identities of an 18-year-old killed in a car crash with another teenager who survived the collision.South Yorkshire Police said officers had wrongly told relatives of Trevor Wynn, 17, that he had died in the crash near Rotherham in December.Meanwhile, the force incorrectly identified Joshua Johnson, 18, as having survived the collision, which also resulted in the death of a 17-year-old girl.Assistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) since identifying the error, adding that he was aware of \"the additional trauma this may cause\".Police were called to Todwick Road between Dinnington and Todwick in the early hours of 13 December after a silver Toyota Corolla crashed off the road.At the time the force said a 17-year-old girl, who was driving, and a 17-year-old boy had been pronounced dead at the scene, while an 18-year-old male had been taken to hospital with serious injuries.Wynn's family were subsequently told he had died while it was believed that Johnson was the male in hospital receiving treatment.However, in a statement issued on Tuesday, the force said \"concerns\" had been raised about the identities of those killed.A spokesperson said \"information came to light\" on Sunday which prompted \"further formal identification processes, including forensics, to be undertaken\" and resulted in the mistake being identified.South Yorkshire PoliceAssistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the IOPCMcFarlane said he had since offered to meet with both sets of parents to discuss the matter.He said: \"This has obviously come as a huge shock to everyone and we recognise the additional trauma this may cause. \"We are supporting Trevor and all the families through this and have engaged specialist agencies to help provide that support. \"I have also offered to meet with both sets of parents as I am sure they will have many questions, most of which we are not able to answer yet but we are absolutely committed to understanding how this happened so it cannot happen again.\"He said South Yorkshire Police would fully cooperate with any subsequent investigation by the police watchdog.Wynn was not named publicly by police at the time of the crash, but was widely identified on social media and in local news outlets as having died in the collision.The 17-year-old girl has not been formally named.An 18-year-old who was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and a 19-year-old arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in connection with the crash both remain on bail pending further enquiries.The IOPC said it was assessing the referral to determine whether an investigation was required.More on this storyRelated internet links",

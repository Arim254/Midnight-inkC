This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "2 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesThe new statue was unveiled in Leicester Square on MondayRenée Zellweger has called a new statue of Bridget Jones \"adorable,\" adding: \"I think she's much cuter than me.\"The actress was speaking to BBC News as a new statue celebrating the character she played for more than 20 years was unveiled in London's Leicester Square on Monday.Bridget Jones was created in 1996 by the author Helen Fielding, and first adapted for the big screen in 2001. The fourth film came out earlier this year.Speaking at the unveiling, Fielding refused to rule out taking her story further, saying you should \"never say never\".Zellweger added that everyone can relate to Bridget, which explains her huge appeal.\"[It's her] vulnerability, her humanness,\" she said. \"We recognise ourselves in her, we recognise ourselves in her struggles.\"It makes it OK for the rest of us to be authentically who we are. Imperfect.\"AlamyThe character of Bridget Jones went straight to many women's hearts, who took comfort in her trials and tribulations.From her embarrassing work mishaps, to her infamous granny pants, Bridget spoke to a generation who saw themselves in her - and has recently won over a whole new set of younger fans too.The fourth film in the franchise, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, was released in February, and sees Bridget living as a single mother and tackling modern dating.It received mixed reviews, but earned the best box office opening ever for a romantic comedy in the UK and Ireland, according to Universal.The film was billed as the final one in the series - but speaking to BBC News at the statue unveiling, two superfans, Faye and Wayne, said they were sure there would be a sequel.\"There were so many things that were left unresolved at the end of the last film,\" said Faye.\"Her character keeps evolving. I want to be with Bridget Jones all the way to the nursing home,\" added Wayne.Watch: Moment Bridget Jones statue is unveiled in LondonWhen asked about the possibility of a new chapter in Bridget Jones' story, Fielding said: \"Never say never. Stories come to you as a writer. So if a story came to me that I thought was true and interesting and new then I would write it.\"Some think the floundering and flawed heroine, who's fixated with her weight and relationship status, is not the best role model.And Fielding herself has previously admitted some parts of the story have not aged well.\"Bridget Jones's Diary couldn't be written now, set now, because all those men in the office would be sacked,\" she said last year. \"It was a really different time.\"But speaking on Monday, she said she hoped the wider message of the book would continue to chime for readers.\"I think to have the comfort of seeing a character that you can relate to, because they are real and human and emotionally honest, it's like having the friend you can be honest with,\" she said.The statue is the first to celebrate a rom com on Leicester Square's Scenes in the Square trail.The Scenes in the Square trail originally launched in 2020 with the introduction of eight sculptures featuring Laurel and Hardy, Mary Poppins, Batman, Bugs Bunny, Don Lockwood, Paddington Bear, Mr Bean and Wonder Woman.Since then, statues of Harry Potter, the Iron Throne from Game of Thrones, Clifford the Big Red Dog and Indiana Jones have been added.",

    "body": "49 minutes agoPA MediaUncollected rubbish in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham in MayAgency refuse workers brought in to cover for Birmingham's long-running bin strike have voted to take industrial action themselves over claims of bullying and harassment.Hundreds of members of Unite in Birmingham have been on all-out strike since March in a dispute over pay and jobs.Now, Unite claim a growing number of agency staff were refusing to cross the picket lines of the striking workers because of \"unsustainable workloads\" and a bullying workplace culture at the council's refuse department. On Monday, agency staff voted to join official picket lines, from 1 December. Birmingham City Council denies the Unite claims about the department.Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"This is a real escalation in the dispute with agency workers now joining picket lines due to the terrible way they have been treated by Job and Talent and Birmingham council.\"Birmingham City Council previously denied the allegations and said it did not \"condone any actions which are contrary to legislation and good employment practice.\"Unite union members in the city began a full walkout seven months ago, and in September voted to extend their action until March.Last month, the union accused senior council managers of threatening to blacklist agency staff who refuse to cross the striking bin workers' picket line.Footage was shared showing a manager from Job and Talent telling staff that council chiefs will ban them from jobs.More on this story",

    "body": "2 hours agoJoe TidyCyber correspondent, BBC World ServiceA British man who hacked high profile Twitter - now known as X - accounts as part of a Bitcoin scam has been ordered to hand over £4.1m in stolen cryptocurrency.Joseph O'Connor, from Liverpool, hijacked more than 130 accounts in July 2020, including those of Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Elon Musk.The 26-year-old fled to Spain where his mother lives before being arrested and extradited to the US for trial.He was sentenced to five years for cyber crimes but now must hand over a haul of crypto he gathered through various hacks and scams.O'Connor, who went by the alias PlugwalkJoe, carried out the so-called \"giveaway scam\" with other young men and teenagers - breaking into Twitter's internal systems and taking over high profile accounts.Three other hackers have been charged over the scam, with US teenager Graham Clark pleading guilty to his part in the deception in 2021.The hackers gained access to the accounts by first convincing a small number of Twitter employees to hand over their internal login details - which eventually granted them access to the social media site's administrative tools.They used social engineering tricks to get access to the powerful internal control panel at the site.Once inside the Twitter accounts of famous individuals, they pretended to be the celebrities and tweeted asking followers to send Bitcoin to various digital wallets promising to double their money.As a result of the fraud, an estimated 350 million Twitter users viewed suspicious tweets from official accounts of some of the platform's biggest users, including Apple, Uber, Kanye West and Bill Gates.Thousands were duped into believing that a crypto giveaway was real.Between 15 and 16 July 2020, 426 transfers were made to the scammers of various amounts from people hoping to double their money.A total of over 12.86 BTC was stolen which at the time was worth around $110,000 (£83,500). It is now worth $1.2m.The UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said investigators believed more crypto linked to O'Connor was obtained through criminal hacks he carried out with other teenagers and young people he met whilst playing Call of Duty online.The CPS has recovered 42 Bitcoin and other digital currency in total from him.Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS Proceeds of Crime Division, said O'Connor \"targeted well known individuals and used their accounts to scam people out of their crypto assets and money\".\"Even when someone is not convicted in the UK, we are still able to ensure they do not benefit from their criminality,\" he said.",

    "body": "Formula 1 tech used to rev-up train wi-fi speeds in new pilot16 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGWRSome of the Great Western Railway fleet will use a hybrid system including low earth orbit satellites in space to create a more-reliable wi-fi connectionA new UK-first pilot scheme is aiming to create fast and more reliable train wi-fi, using technology originally developed for Formula 1 cars.It will see a train in the Great Western Railway fleet use a hybrid system of both signals from mobile phone masts on the ground and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites in space to create a more reliable connection.The scheme has been developed by British tech company Motion Applied, in partnership with the transport body for Cornwall, Devon, Plymouth, Somerset and Torbay, Peninsula Transport.The pilot will last for 60 days onboard GWR's Intercity Express Train which runs in the South West region, having started in mid-November.In a recent study by networking testing firm Ookla, the UK ranked 16th out of 18 major European and Asian countries for train wi-fi speed, with average download speeds at just 1.09 megabits per second, compared to Sweden's 64.58.Nick Fry, chairman of Motion Applied, formerly part of McLaren Group, said the issues faced in connecting to the internet from a fast moving train had \"many parallels with motorsport\".He added that by using technology originally developed for F1 cars, trains should be able to switch between ground and space-based networks such as LEO satellites to \"reliably connect\" without drop outs.In the 2025 spending review, the Department of Transport secured £41m to introduce low earth orbit satellite connectivity on all mainline trains by 2030.'A step in the right direction'Councillor Dan Rogerson, from the Peninsula Transport board, called the pilot a \"major milestone\" in its plans to modernise transport infrastructure across the South West and South Wales.\"It's not just about passenger wi-fi,\" he said. \"This is about a whole new digital backbone for our transport networks\".Bruce Williamson from the campaign group Railfuture told the BBC the scheme appeared to be \"really good news\".\"We're all increasingly connected these days, and wi-fi has become more and more of an essential service for travellers. I'm not going to hold my breath, but this is a step in the right direction.\"In May, South Western Railway launched its own, separate, \"superfast\" wi-fi rollout for its trains between Earlsfield and Basingstoke, using trackside poles and antennas to create a bespoke 5G rail network.",

    "body": "5 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem and Raffi Berg,LondonThe UN Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution backing Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza.The text, submitted by the US, would give a mandate for the deployment of an International Stabilization Force (ISF) and to set up transitional governance there.The US says multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute to the ISF, though it is unclear whether it would be required to ensure Hamas disarms or function as a peacekeeping force.Its formation is a central plank of Trump's 20-point plan which last month brought a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in their two-year war.The draft also raises the possibility of a Palestinian state - something Israel strongly opposes.There have been intense negotiations over the draft text of the resolution, with Washington warning that any vote against it could lead to a return to fighting with Israel.As well as authorising an ISF, which it says would work with Israel and Egypt - Gaza's southern neighbour - the draft also calls for creation of a newly trained Palestinian police in Gaza. Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.According to reports on the latest draft, part of the ISF's role would be to work on the \"permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups\" – including Hamas – as well as protecting civilians and humanitarian aid routes.This would require Hamas to hand over its weapons - something it is meant to do under Trump's peace plan. But in a statement published overnight, Hamas called the draft resolution \"dangerous\" and an \"attempt to subject the Gaza Strip to international authority\".It said Palestinian factions rejected any clause relating to the disarmament of Gaza or harming \"the Palestinian people's right to resistance\".The statement also rejected any foreign military presence inside the Gaza Strip, saying it would constitute a violation of Palestinian sovereignty.The draft goes on to endorse the formation of a Board of Peace, expected to be headed by President Trump, to oversee a body of Palestinian technocrats that will temporarily administer Gaza and take charge of its redevelopment.Following pressure from key Arab states, the latest text mentions a possible future Palestinian state, though without calling for one as the goal.Even so, the inclusion of such a reference drew sharp reaction from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after allies in his governing coalition criticised the draft, including threatening to leave the government if Netanyahu did not push back.\"Regarding a Palestinian state,\" he said on Sunday, \"our opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory west of the Jordan [River], this opposition is existing, valid, and has not changed one bit.\"Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas which had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "A court in Singapore has sentenced an Australian man to nine days in prison for grabbing Hollywood star Ariana Grande at a movie premiere.Johnson Wen, 26, was found guilty of being a public nuisance over the high-profile incident last Thursday at the Asia premiere for Wicked: For Good. Videos posted on social media show Wen jumping the barriers, charging at a visibly shocked Grande and grabbing her shoulders while jumping up and down.The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, where many called for the arrest and deportation of Wen, who has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events.Several accused him of \"re-traumatising\" Grande. The pop star turned actress has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.In Wen's trial on Monday, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the movie premiere twice, Singaporean media reports.Moments after he grabbed Grande, her co-star Cynthia Erivo forcibly pried him off and security staff escorted him out.He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and this time pinned him down.Wen later posted videos of the incident on his social media accounts thanking Grande and stating that he was \"free\".Police in Singapore arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance. Wen pleaded guilty.Prosecutors sought a week's jail for Wen, arguing that he was a \"serial intruder\" who publicised his behaviour to gain popularity online.Wen has posted videos of himself disrupting concerts by Katy Perry and The Weeknd, and invading the pitch at various sporting events. Australian media have reported he is banned from some stadiums and has incurred large fines.Wen, who was not represented in the Singapore court, told the judge in mitigation that he would \"not do it again\".Under Singapore's laws against public nuisance, Wen could have been jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,000 (£1,167; $1,537), or both.Grande has not commented on the case, while continuing to appear in public at events in Los Angeles over the weekend.But two days after the incident, Erivo appeared to allude to it when she spoke about her relationship with Grande while making the movie, saying: \"We have come through some stuff in our lives, our daily workings... even this last week, let's be honest.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoCurtis LancasterSouth of EnglandNetflixRumi, Zoey and Mira are Huntr/x - the K-pop trio who also try and save the world from demonsA school has banned the singing of songs from hit Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters over concerns they are not in keeping with its \"Christian ethos\". Lilliput Church of England Infant School in Poole, Dorset, sent a message to parents on Friday saying some members of the community are \"deeply uncomfortable\" with references to demons. It said this was because they \"associate them with spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness\". In an update on Monday, acting head teacher Lloyd Allington said he had since received feedback from parents, highlighting positive messages from the songs, but said the school was seeking to support those who found the themes \"challenging\".KPop Demon Hunters became Netflix's most viewed film ever in August and follows the adventures of fictional K-pop girl band Huntr/x as its three members use their music and fighting skills to protect humans from demons.It also features a rival group made up of five demons called the Saja Boys, whose song lyrics cover themes including temptation and seduction. In the initial message sent to parents, the school asked them to encourage their children \"not to sing these songs at school out of respect for those who find the themes at odds with their faith\".But one parent told the BBC: \"I thought it was ridiculous. My daughter is very into K-pop and her and all of her little friends love it.\"Getty ImagesThe school's head teacher told parents references to demons can feel \"deeply uncomfortable\" to ChristiansHe said they did performances at after-school clubs.\"It's just a harmless, a nice little thing for them to do to get their confidence up,\" he said.He describes himself as an atheist and said it felt like \"a bit of an imposition and probably a bit unfair and silly\".He said nothing like this had happened before and praised the school in general, but felt it had been put under pressure to make the change.In Monday's update, acting head Mr Allington said the school had received feedback from parents who said songs - such as 10-week UK number one single Golden - had helped their children learn about teamwork, courage and kindness.He continued: \"While we fully respect your right to make choices about the content your child engages with at home, we also want to be mindful of the diversity of beliefs within our school community.\"For some Christians, references to demons can feel deeply uncomfortable because they associate them with spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness.\"He added: \"We are not asking parents to tell their children that there is anything wrong with enjoying the film or its songs if it aligns with your own views and beliefs...\"Our role will simply be to help children understand that some of their peers may hold different views and to explore how we can respect and support those peers in upholding their faith.\"More on this story",

    "body": "Vital supplies of US liquefied natural gas are due to start flowing into war-ravaged Ukraine this winter via a pipeline across the Balkans.The deal was announced after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Athens on Sunday. Greece is working to increase the flow of American LNG to its terminals to \"replace Russian gas in the region\", Mitsotakis said recently.The European Commission plans to ban all imports of Russian gas to EU member states by the end of 2027, arguing revenue from such sales funds Russia's war in Ukraine.In Ukraine, which experiences freezing winters, there are fears of an energy crisis as Russia attacks energy facilities.Zelensky is currently in France, where he President Emmanuel Macron signed a letter of intent to buy up to 100 Rafale jets.Fighting continued overnight, with six people reportedly killed in Russian attacks in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Donetsk regions of Ukraine.Russia's military said it had taken control of three more Ukrainian villages - one each in the Kharkiv, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions.None of the reports could be independently verified.Speaking earlier in Athens, Zelensky was quoted as saying that deliveries of US LNG would begin in January.\"We rebuild each time the Russians destroy but this truly requires time, much effort, equipment and, regarding gas... imports to compensate for the destruction by the Russians of our own production,\" he said.\"Greece is becoming an energy security provider for your homeland,\" Mitsotakis told the Ukrainian president.Zelensky said Kyiv had allocated funds for gas imports from European partners and banks under European Commission guarantees, as well as from Ukrainian banks, to help cover imports through to March at a cost of nearly €2bn (£1.8bn; $2.3bn), according to news agency Reuters.Since 2015, when it stopped buying Russian gas directly, Ukraine has been receiving supplies from various EU states.The Soviet-era Trans-Balkan pipeline links Ukraine to LNG terminals in Greece via Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria.The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has issued a formal warning, saying \"the approaching winter poses new risks for Ukrainians... as intensified attacks on energy networks undermine efforts to maintain warmth in homes, schools and health centres\".The letter signed by Zelensky and Macron while visiting the Villacoublay air base near Paris sets out possible future contracts for Ukraine to acquire Rafale fighter jets \"with their associated weapons\".The letter, which is not a purchase and sales contract, also sets out deals for SAMP-T air defence systems, radar systems and drones.On an visit to Sweden last month, Zelensky signed a letter of intent to buy between 100 and 150 Gripen fighter jets.In France, Zelensky also went to Mont Valerien, to the west of Paris, to visit the nascent headquarters of a planned multinational force.The force, which was proposed by the UK and France, may one day help oversee a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire.Tens of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured, and millions of civilians have fled their homes, since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory and has been making slow advances along the front line as the Ukrainian military grapples with manpower shortages.Fighting has centred on the town of Pokrovsk, a logistical hub in Donetsk region, where hundreds of Russian troops recently broke through.Ukraine's ongoing refugee crisis took another turn this month when German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged Zelensky to take action after a surge in the number of young Ukrainian men arriving in Germany and other EU states as refugees.EU states recorded 79,205 new Ukrainian refugees in September, the highest monthly number in nearly two years.In its report, the EU's statistical agency pointed to Ukraine's decision in August to allow men aged 18 to 22 the right to cross the border freely. At the time of the invasion, martial law dictated that men aged between 18 and 60 – even those not eligible for conscription, which is currently in place for those aged between 25 and 60 – were not permitted to leave the country.Germany, the EU's biggest country, now hosts the most Ukrainian refugees - currently 1.2 million people or 28.3% of the bloc's total.",

    "body": "Will the government's new asylum plans work?9 hours agoJoe PikePolitics investigations correspondentPA MediaHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood was at BBC Broadcasting House on Sunday for an interview with Laura KuenssbergTen weeks ago Sir Keir Starmer sent Shabana Mahmood to run the Home Office precisely so that she would be radical in overhauling the UK's immigration system.Mahmood's torrent of new policy announcements in recent days are certainly bold - from limiting refugees to temporary stays, to overhauling human rights law to help increase deportations, and threatening countries with visa bans unless they accept the return of criminals and illegal immigrants.But the plans are controversial too. The Refugee Council, which supports asylum-seekers, says making refugee status temporary is both \"highly impractical\" as well as \"inhumane\".Will Labour MPs vote for it?The home secretary's team are delighted at the newspaper headlines and TV coverage their announcements have secured in recent days, yet they know that was the easy bit.Persuading Labour MPs from all wings of the party to vote en masse for the plans is a far bigger challenge.Backbench frustration over winter fuel payments and welfare reform led to embarrassing government U-turns. Will restive Labour MPs try to shift government policy yet again?That may depend on whether a politician's constituency is under threat from Reform UK and Conservatives on the right, or the Liberal Democrats and Greens on the left.Some ministers are already raising concerns about Mahmood's proposals in private, and sceptical MPs have started to speak out in public.Rachael Maskell, a prominent critic of the government's botched welfare reforms, told me many of her colleagues are \"seriously concerned\". She said the government is going in \"completely the wrong direction\" on immigration and its plans to change how human rights law is applied in the UK are a \"step too far\".Another sceptical Labour MP, Brian Leishman, told me he had \"big reservations\" about the proposals, and cautioned ministers against \"trying to copy Farage and Reform who only want to demonise people\".Fast-track deportations to be announced as part of asylum reformsIllegal migration tearing UK apart, Mahmood saysUK set to limit refugees to temporary staysTo minimise the prospect of parliamentary opposition, Mahmood has been meeting groups of Labour MPs in recent weeks to make what her allies call \"the persuasive moral case for reform\".But privately they concede that it will be a difficult balance. Partly because many in Labour are uncomfortable with both these policies and the accompanying rhetoric.Both the Conservatives and Reform can sense those tensions and both are trying to capitalise on them.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage even put out a statement to say something he knows Labour MPs won't like - \"The home secretary sounds like a Reform supporter\".Farage and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch both doubt these plans will even get through the Commons.Will the proposals work?The government is billing these changes as the most significant reforms to the asylum system since World War Two.Oxford University's Migration Observatory says Mahmood's overhaul will make the UK's immigration system amongst the strictest countries in Europe. But that doesn't mean the number of small boat arrivals will come down.\"This won't be the silver bullet and I think the government recognises that\", argues Dr Peter Walsh, a senior researcher at the organisation.\"It is taking a broader approach, focusing on enforcement and return deals. Will people know about restrictions enough to deter them? We will have to wait and see.\"Reducing \"pull\" factors and making the UK less attractive to migrants is a massive long-term battle.In this fight the government is up against sophisticated people-smuggling gangs who have shown they can adapt fast.The home secretary will be hoping her \"throw the kitchen sink at it\" approach gradually reduces arrivals and increases deportations.Mahmood believes community cohesion across the country depends on it.But so does her future and that of her government.",

    "body": "43 minutes agoHelen SullivanWhite House: Epstein story 'a manufactured hoax'US President Donald Trump has urged lawmakers in his own party to vote to release files relating to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Trump wrote on Sunday night that Republicans in the House of Representatives should do so \"because we have nothing to hide\".It is a striking reversal for Trump after weeks of saying the clamour for a vote on the release was a Democratic-driven distraction.There has been a slow drip feed of documents concerning the disgraced financier by House Democrats, some of which reference Trump, who has always denied any link to Epstein's sex abuse and trafficking.But details of his and other prominent figures' past relationship with Epstein have fuelled speculation and led to a public spat with one of Trump's staunchest supporters.Potentially dozens of Republicans have now signalled they are willing to break ranks and vote in favour of a bill that would compel the US government to publish all its documents on Epstein.Supporters of the bill appear to have enough votes for it to pass the House this week, though it is unclear whether it would pass in the Senate, the other chamber of the US Congress.Epstein, a financier, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019, in what a coroner later ruled a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking, having previously been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.The two criminal investigations into Epstein amassed a vast trove of documents including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items confiscated from raids of his various properties. The material that has not yet been made public is often referred to as the Epstein files.Since returning to the White House, Trump has dismissed the need to release more documents, despite this being a key demand of many of his supporters and some of his key allies.He recently called it a Democrat-led \"hoax\" to \"deflect\" attention away from his party's work.\"I DON'T CARE!,\" he wrote on his Truth social platform, urging Republicans to \"get BACK ON POINT\".Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson made a similar point on Sunday, saying calls to release the files were the \"entire game plan\" for opposition Democrats. Trump was historically photographed at social gatherings with Epstein, but has repeatedly said he severed contact with the financier years before Epstein's 2008 conviction, and was unaware of his criminal activity.The US president's change of position on the matter comes after Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email exchanges.They included correspondence between Epstein and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. Some of those exchanges make references to Trump. In one email, sent in 2011, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.\"The White House said on Wednesday that the victim referenced in the email was prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.Giuffre, who died in April, has said that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse and there is no implication of any wrongdoing by Trump in the emails.Hours after the release, House Republicans published a far larger tranche of 20,000 files to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to \"cherry-pick\" documents in an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander\" Trump.Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Glenn Grothman, a Republican congressman on the House Oversight Committee, attempted to explain Trump's change of mind. He suggested the president felt that an ongoing \"systematic release of files\" by the committee would only fuel further speculation and distract from other topics such as Trump's budgetary plans. Trump viewed it as easier to simply \"let the press go nuts for a couple of days\" over the files, Grothman suggested.Both Democrats and some Republicans have been backing legislation to release all the documents. Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a co-sponsor of the bill, telling ABC News on Sunday that as many as 100 Republicans could vote in favour.Known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the bill aims to force the justice department to release all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials linked to the paedophile.Trump would also have to sign off on the release of the documents if it passes both legislative chambers.Watch: How much do Americans care about the Epstein story?In a letter addressed to Congress, Epstein survivors and Giuffre's family called for US lawmakers to vote in favour of releasing the files.\"Remember that your primary duty is to your constituents. Look into the eyes of your children, your sisters, your mothers, and your aunts,\" the letter reads.\"Imagine if they had been preyed upon. Imagine if you yourself were a survivor. What would you want for them? What would you want for yourself? When you vote, we will remember your decision at the ballot box.\"Trump's handling of the issue has led in recent days to a public feud with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, traditionally one of his fiercest proponents.The US president attacked her on Friday, calling her \"wacky\" and a \"traitor\", and suggesting that she should be unseated in next year's elections.Greene in turn questioned whether Trump was still putting \"America First\" and said he was \"making an example\" of her to scare other Republicans away from voting in favour of the bill.Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice has confirmed it will investigate Epstein's alleged links to major banks and several prominent Democrats, including former President Clinton. Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes.The names of Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and a prominent Democratic donor, and Summers, Clinton's treasury secretary, both appeared in the most recent release. Summers has previously expressed regret over being in contact with Epstein following his conviction, while Hoffman has said the extent of his involvement with the broker was to fundraise for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liverpool have been missing Alexander-Arnold's ability on the ball this seasonByFootball tactics correspondentAfter winning the Premier League fairly comfortably last season, Liverpool reinforced their squad with some of Europe's most impressive talent.Arne Slot's Reds spent about £416.2m on summer signings, the most spent by any club in a window, bringing the likes of Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike to Anfield.But, despite sitting third in the table, Liverpool have lost three matches in a row in all competitions and host Manchester United on Sunday with a few questions being asked about them.New signings need time to gel but the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid may have had a larger impact on Liverpool's squad as a whole than first thought.Despite being questioned for his defensive ability at times, the 27-year-old scored 18 goals and contributed 64 assists in his time at the club - but his absence is being felt for less obvious reasons.Here we analyse what Liverpool are missing this season in Alexander-Arnold's absence.Reds struggling against high defensive blockThe Premier League is home to some of the best executed defensive set-ups in the world whether that is in the form of physical high-presses or stubborn and compact blocks.Bypassing a high press can be done in two ways: by playing through the pressure or by going long and playing over the pressure.Against a good press or a higher defensive block, Liverpool have struggled to get the ball up the pitch as effectively as they did last season.This can partly be explained by Alexander-Arnold's on-ball quality and using an example against Spurs last season helps illustrate the point.Image source, BBC SportImage caption, Alexander-Arnold's ability to play with his weak foot was a huge asset to LiverpoolThroughout the game, Spurs applied a high press looking to win the ball early. The right-back's body was angled in field and, with Son Heung-min closing Alexander-Arnold down quickly, access to players in the wide areas was cut off.A massively underrated part of Trent's game, and one that Liverpool miss greatly, is his ability to play with his weak foot. In this scenario, Trent was able to use his left foot to accurately sweep a pass into the unmarked Alexis Mac Allister.A hallmark of Liverpool's build-up last season was in finding the midfielders centrally who were often staggered. In this example, Ryan Gravenberch has left the centre of the pitch to move into the right flank dragging his marker with him. Mac Allister comes over and Dominik Szoboszlai arrives to form a sort of zig-zag-like shape.This staggered positioning allowed Liverpool to bounce passes around late-arriving pressure between the midfielders and full-backs with minimal touches used getting up the pitch.Bradley less accomplished with weaker footIn the defeat by Chelsea, Slot opted for Conor Bradley at right-back, who found himself in a very similar situation as Alexander-Arnold did against Spurs; Alejandro Garnacho pressed high, Bradley was facing in-field, and access to the wide areas was cut off.Bradley, similar to his right-back rival Jeremie Frimpong, is less accomplished on his weak foot and as a result was unable to build up play centrally in these scenarios.With a pass on into the midfield, Bradley instead played with his right foot back to Ibrahima Konate. This restarted the build-up with the same problems needing to be tackled from the beginning.Image source, BBC SportImage caption, Bradley has the option to play a ball into Dominik Szoboszlai in midfield...Image source, BBC SportImage caption, ...but instead chooses to pass it back to defender Ibrahima KonateWirtz dropping deeper than at LeverkusenShort build-up is clearly an issue that requires addressing and compromises have had to be made in getting the ball up to the attackers. One way in which Liverpool have done this has been in using Wirtz deeper.The German midfielder's biggest strengths lie in the final third but given his excellent technical quality, particularly his passing, Wirtz is dropping deeper in order to get on the ball, before helping bring it up the pitch.For Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen, Wirtz would often stand on the left flank waiting for the ball to be brought up the pitch by team-mates before getting involved. Comparing where he's receiving passes this season to last season highlights a stark difference.In the short term this is a sensible solution given Wirtz's qualities and Liverpool's weaknesses but it fails to maximise Wirtz's individual attacking game.Image source, BBC SportImage caption, Florian Wirtz is dropping deeper in order to get on the ball, before helping bring it up the pitch.Long build-up and switches of playAside from short build-up and technical quality, long passes and switches are tools teams need to bypass a press or to disrupt the shape of the opposition's defensive block.Liverpool played 3.4 switches of play per 90 minutes last season and this is down to 1.3 per 90 minutes this season. This decrease is partially explained by Trent leaving with the English full-back able to play crossfield passes reliably and with both feet, often finding the left winger.Tactically, this forced a deeper defending side to have to shuffle across the pitch. Switching the play quickly allows the players receiving the ball to exploit the spaces that appear in the opponent's now less-compact shape.In terms of long passing, Virgil van Dijk possesses a great long diagonal pass that has found Mohamed Salah isolated on the right wing numerous times over the last few years to similar effect. However, the rest of Liverpool's current crop of defenders don't tend to play as long very often.Alexander-Arnold played 11.3 long passes per 90 minutes last season with a 42.1% pass accuracy. In the league this season, Bradley and Frimpong by comparison have only played 3.7 and 1.1 long passes per 90 minutes with a 16.1% and 0% pass accuracy respectively.Image source, BBC SportImage caption, Virgil van Dijk is still playing long, direct switches of play when Liverpool's opponents aren't yet in a set defensive shapeSalah playing with back to goalMedia caption, Why it's going wrong down the right for Salah and LiverpoolThe players at a coach's disposal dictate what tactics become viable and, without Alexander-Arnold, skipping short build-up to find Liverpool's quick attackers in space is less of a possibility.Isak and Salah are both players who thrive when attacking at speed, facing defenders, in space. With this option not being opted for as much, their strengths aren't being platformed as often as they could be.Slower build-up results in attacking situations against deeper, more compact defences as there is more time for the defending side to get back into their desired shape. It has also meant Salah has found himself playing with his back to goal both centrally and out wide more often.For as great a player as Salah has been, he struggles more when defenders apply close pressure on his back, preventing him from turning to face the goal. His options become more limited and he tends to pass it back when this scenario arises.Image source, BBC SportHow can United take advantage?Slot's men face Ruben Amorim's Manchester United and if United are to get anything from the game, they will need to look to take advantage of some of Liverpool's recent frailties.Amorim has on occasion asked his team to defend in a 5-4-1 shape out of possession, moving away from his normal 5-2-3 and, if chosen, this alternative approach is likely to pose Liverpool more questions.By defending deeper and blocking the centre of the pitch well, a larger percentage of the possession for Liverpool will be with the central defenders who are less apt in breaking down a stubborn shape. This may force Wirtz deeper, out of zones he may be more destructive in.The reluctance for Liverpool to play switches of play will make it harder for them to break down a 5-4-1 shape that has good coverage across the width of the pitch to begin with too.Finally, a shape that aims to reduce space the likes of Isak and Salah can run into is naturally a smart plan to counter two of Liverpool's most impressive players, especially if it is paired by proactive, aggressive defending from United's left wingback.",

    "body": "'I felt really lonely': Joe Swash on being a young dad12 hours agoShola LeeBBC NewsBBC Studios/Eddie Hutton-MillsIn his new documentary, Joe Swash meets young fathers like Wyatt, who is 18\"I remember just feeling so scared and vulnerable,\" says actor and TV presenter Joe Swash of becoming a father in his twenties.Swash found out he was going to be a dad at the age of 24. He says it was a life-changing experience he felt \"grossly underprepared\" for, adding that \"there was no one really for me to talk to\".The presenter says his and his former partner's conversations with midwives were \"rightly\" centred on the mum-to-be, but he felt lonely and no one had asked him how he was doing. There were no father-and-child support groups and having lost his own father aged 11, Swash felt he had no positive male role models to turn to.He worried about small things like how to change a nappy or how hot his baby's bottle had to be, and felt everyone was \"looking down\" at him for being a young dad.It was this feeling of being \"completely unsupported\" as a young father that he explores in the BBC documentary Joe Swash: Forgotten Young Dads.In the film, the former EastEnders star meets four young fathers and explores some of the problems they face, from social stereotypes to a lack of parental support services.Last year, dads were an average of 34 years old when their child was born, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. The fathers in the BBC documentary, meanwhile, are all 18 to 22.Kevin Stoodley is founder of North East Young Dads and Lads (NEYDL), a charity that provides parenting and community support for young fathers.Stoodley says that in his 27 years as a community youth worker, he has \"never encountered a community as stigmatised\" as young dads.'Absent dads'Swash says that as a young dad, he \"really struggled\" with judgement from others and felt that people viewed him as \"irresponsible\".He adds that young dads often get a \"bad reputation\" and are characterised as \"absent\".\"I'd love to find out how many of them 'absent dads' are absent because they wanted to be, or because they were so vulnerable, scared and frightened that they had nowhere to go and had no support,\" he explains.Swash says society needs to \"readjust\" how it sees young dads. Stoodley agrees, saying that young fathers have historically been wrongfully \"perceived as being feckless, disinterested and in some cases, a risk to their children\".He adds that some of the young dads he's met face judgement from their own communities and are \"told that they've ruined their life\".'Alpha male'BBC Studios/Eddie Hutton-MillsSwash urges young dads to speak to each other and met four young  men navigating parenthood during his documentaryFor Swash, having positive male role models is key in supporting young dads.After his father died, Swash says he was \"craving, as a young man, just to have a male role model put their arm around me and look after me - whether that was a negative role model or a positive role model, I was just desperate to have some role model\".\"If all we're seeing is negative role models being put on social media and on TV, you can be mistaken in thinking that's the sort of man you want to be\", he adds.Swash explains: \"We can all get in fights down the streets and go on boys' holidays, but not everyone can change a nappy and love and nurture and cherish a child and for me, that's an alpha male.\"Stoodley says having positive male role models is \"super important\" in helping young fathers navigate their new roles.The founder says NEYDL also looks to address toxic masculinity and steer young men on the path of being a good role model.Recently, Stephen Graham, who starred in Adolescence, which explored toxic masculinity, announced a new book calling for fathers to have more open conversations with their sons.'Fall through the net'Swash says the lack of support available for young dads is \"pretty unbelievable\".In the course of making the documentary, Swash notes that he and the team struggled to find support services for young men and he says there should be a service available to all young fathers.Services that do exist, like NEYDL, provide parenting and community support to young dads. However, Stoodley says there needs to be more national investment.Swash adds that support can mean simple things like having more nappy-changing stations in men's toilets, or bigger shifts: \"Fundamentally, I think society has got to change the way they look at young dads and young families.\"\"I felt really lonely,\" Swash adds of his own experiences as a young dad.Swash, a parent to six children, says he's \"proud\" to have been a young dad and loves his kids \"with a passion\". However, he acknowledges a lot of young men are \"not as lucky\" as him and encourages young dads to have conversations with each other and to \"not suffer in silence\".You can watch Joe Swash: Forgotten Young Dads on Monday 20 October at 20:00 BST on BBC Three, and on BBC iPlayer.More weekend picks",

    "body": "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the US of committing \"murder\" following a strike carried out on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September. In a social media post, Petro accused the US of violating his country's sovereignty and killing a Colombian fisherman.Posting on X, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck. He added: \"We await explanations from the US government.\"It comes after President Donald Trump said the US had struck a \"drug-carrying submarine\" on Thursday, killing two people.Writing on social media, Trump said US intelligence confirmed the vessel was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The attack is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. It is the first time survivors have been reported.Writing about an earlier attack in September, Pedro wrote on X on Saturday that: \"US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters.\"Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing. The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.\"Alejandro Carranza was reportedly killed on 15 September when US forces allegedly fired on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean.Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday that the submarine targeted in the latest attack was \"built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs\". \"This was not an innocent group of people. I don't know too many people who have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded submarine,\" he said, adding that no US military personnel had been injured. The US president also said two people who survived would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.They were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.Narco-subs have become a popular way to transport drugs as they can go largely undetected, and can be sunk after delivery. They are often homemade and constructed using fibreglass and plywood. The US, as well as other coastal nations, have previously intercepted some of these subs.",

    "body": "2 hours agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThe Metropolitan Police said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection.\"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made,\" the force said on Sunday.Ms Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year, said she was among the girls and young women sexually exploited by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy circle.Prince Andrew has not commented on the reports, but consistently denies all allegations against him. Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment.Ms Giuffre also claimed that she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London, in 2001.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges related to Epstein, her former boyfriend.According to the Mail on Sunday, Andrew asked his police protection officer to investigate her just before the newspaper published a photo of Ms Giuffre's first meeting with the prince in February 2011.The paper alleged that he gave the officer her date of birth and confidential social security number.The Sunday Telegraph also claimed that Andrew \"sought to dig up dirt\" on Ms Giuffre.Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, called it \"deeply concerning\", adding that if true, \"it's absolutely not the way that close protection officers should be used\".On Friday, Andrew announced that he was voluntarily handing back his titles and giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.He will cease to be the Duke of York, a title received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.The prince had already ceased to be a \"working royal\" and had lost the use of his HRH title and no longer appeared at official royal events. His role now will be even more diminished.Prince Andrew email to Epstein does not suggest he broke off friendship - Emily MaitlisEmily Maitlis, who conducted the now-infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 with the prince, said the move had been \"a long time coming\", adding: \"Six years has been quite a long time to wait for this.\"In the interview, the prince claimed he had severed all ties with Epstein in 2010 during a visit to his New York home. Speaking on Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, Maitlis said she felt \"quite sick\" when emails emerged that had been sent in February 2011 from the prince to Epstein, suggesting their friendship had not ended.She had questioned Andrew on his decision to \"spend four days - four nights - in a convicted paedophile's home\" to end their friendship, to which he had responded he had a tendency to be \"too honourable\".The February 2011 emails including one from the prince that read: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!\", suggesting he had stayed in touch with him. \"The tenor of it, the idea not just that he was saying we're in this together, but signing off 'let's play some more soon', does not suggest that he had ever finished that friendship, that he had ever broken off with Epstein,\" Maitlis said.\"You're left really questioning, why he said that, whether the conversation ever existed, and how much more there is in that interview that we have to now go back and question,\" the journalist added.Andrew has faced a series of scandals over recent years, including making an out-of-court settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him.A posthumous memoir by Ms Giuffre to be released next week is likely to cast further attention on the prince's involvement with her and Epstein. On Friday evening, Ms Giuffre's brother Sky Roberts told BBC Newsnight his sister would have been \"very proud\" of the latest development regarding Prince Andrew's titles, but that he would like the King to go a step further and remove the title of prince.\"I think anybody that was implicated... should have some sort of responsibility and accountability for these survivors,\" he said.",

    "body": "1 hour agoIan Aikman andRachel HaganHostages and Missing Families ForumRonen Engel was killed on 7 October, the Israeli military saidThe daughter of one of the latest dead hostages to be returned to Israel from Gaza has said her father is \"finally home\".Ronen Engel's daughter, Mika, wrote on Instagram: \"It's not what we hoped, it's not what we wished for him, but it's finally here.\"The remains of Mr Engel, 54, a photographer, and 30-year-old Thai farm worker Sonthaya Akrasri were the latest to be returned by Hamas on Saturday. Both were killed during the 7 October 2023 attack and their bodies were taken to Gaza, the IDF said. They are the 11th and 12th of 28 dead hostages to be returned under the ceasefire deal.Mr Engel's wife, Karina Engel-Bart, and their teenage daughters were also taken hostage but were released in November 2023 during a truce between Israel and Hamas. The following month, the IDF confirmed that Mr Engel had been killed in captivity.Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that Mr Engel was remembered by loved ones as a man with \"hands of gold and the soul of an artist\".He was a photographer and volunteer ambulance driver for Israel's emergency service Magen David Adom.The second dead hostage returned was identified by Israel on Sunday as Sonthaya Akrasri, a Thai agricultural worker who was killed on 7 October while living at Kibbutz Be'eri. Thailand's foreign ministry announced his death in May 2024.He was the father of a seven-year-old daughter and had planned to return to Thailand to open his own farm, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.Hostages and Missing Families ForumThe delay in the return of the dead hostages has caused outrage in Israel, as the terms of last week's ceasefire deal stipulated the release from Gaza of all hostages - living and dead. Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the remaining bodies under the rubble in Gaza.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has ordered the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to remain closed until further notice, and said its reopening would be considered based on the return of the final hostage remains and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.The Rafah crossing is vital for Palestinians who need medical assistance to leave, and for thousands of others to return.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".But the US has downplayed suggestions that the delay amounts to a breach of the ceasefire deal, which President Donald Trump claimed as a major victory on a visit to Israel and Egypt last week.The text of the deal has not been published, but a leaked version that was seen in Israeli media appeared to account for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult, as air strikes on Gaza have reduced many buildings to rubble, and Israel does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into the territory.UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. ReutersHamas says it has been working to recover the remains of dead hostages beneath the rubble left by Israeli attacks on the Gaza StripAlso as part of the deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. The bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.Separately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire. The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza. There are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report as \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editor andJosh MartinBusiness reporterAll 1,287 Betfred shops could disappear from the UK High Street if Chancellor Rachel Reeves hikes taxes on gambling firms, the company's co-founder and chairman has told the BBC.Fred Done, who set up Betfred in 1967 with his brother, said a closure of that size would put 7,500 jobs at risk.The billionaire businessman said tax rises were the \"biggest threat\" to the industry in his 57 years. It echoes similar warnings from other gambling brands.Increasing taxes on betting firms in the Budget has been suggested to the chancellor. She recently told ITV: \"I do think there is a case for gambling firms paying more… they should pay their fair share of taxes and we will make sure that happens.\"Reeves has been encouraged by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to increase taxes on the gambling sector and use the revenue from that to reduce child poverty.The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank estimated over the summer that additional taxes on the industry, as high as 50%, could raise £3.2bn.At the time the Betting and Gaming Council, which represents gambling companies, called Brown's plan \"economically reckless\", saying it would push gamblers into the black market.Betting companies have resisted calls for taxes to rise. Up to 200 William Hill retail outlets could close if the industry faces higher taxes, its owner Evoke said earlier this month.Betfred's Mr Done said that if taxes on UK gambling companies increased he would also feel compelled to close his High Street shops. \"It [tax] doesn't even need to go up to 50%. If it went up to anywhere like 40% or even 35% there is no profit in the business. We would have to close it down. I'm talking job losses. We're talking probably 7,500,\" he said.He said 300 of his shops were \"currently losing money\" and claimed a 5% increase on gambling taxes would raise that number to 430.\"Once the [UK] industry is closed down, it's gone. People will still bet, but they'll bet offshore with it. There's plenty of bookmakers offshore who happen to take the bets, who don't pay anything to this country,\" he said.Punters' winnings from gambling are not taxed in the UK, nor is VAT charged on bets. However, the gambling industry pays extra taxes, including:a tax of 21% on online casino gaming stakesduty of 20% on slots and gaming machinesgeneral betting duty on sports fixtures of 15% general betting duty on horseracing of 15%Mr Done said recent increases in employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and the minimum wage had already added £20m to his company's costs.He agreed that, like with banking or buying clothes, customers are increasingly going online, making it inevitable to close betting shops.Rival firm Paddy Power on Thursday said it would close 57 shops across the UK and Republic of Ireland, citing increasing cost pressures and challenging market conditions.\"Slowly it will go online, but we're talking, without tax increases, we've still got probably 20 years of life on the High Street,\" said Mr Done. \"And you know, the UK High Street is being decimated with closures.\"In its most recent annual results, Betfred took in nearly £1bn of revenue, but made an operating profit of just £500,000 after a series of writedowns on its assets.The family-owned company has bases in the UK, Gibraltar, the US and South Africa, with investment in both online gambling and High Street sports betting.Critics point to the social and financial harm caused by gambling. Office for Health Improvement and Disparities research from 2023 estimated the excess costs of harmful gambling to be between £1bn and £1.77bn.Prof Ashwin Kumar, director of research and policy at the IPPR, said higher taxes were needed on the industry, particularly for online betting, to reflect the negative consequences gambling has on some people.\"We know that most of the profits made by gambling companies come from a very small number of gamblers, many of whom are at risk of serious harm. And so we think that the duties should be higher, just like tobacco and alcohol.\"Charity GambleAware, which supports people with gambling addiction, said \"further regulation\" was needed on advertising to help protect children and young people, as well as to raise awareness about the risks.But Mr Done argues that UK-based, High Street betting shops provide better safeguards for people with gambling problems, as well as tax revenues, than online and offshore rivals.As to whether he thinks his appeal to keep taxes as they are will win over the chancellor, Mr Done said \"we're 10 to one against\", which suggests it's odds on that many betting shops will close.A HM Treasury spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on speculation around future changes to tax policy.\"",

    "body": "Housing designed to combat loneliness wins top architecture award3 days agoIan YoungsCulture reporterPhilip Vile/RibaA modern answer to the traditional almshouse, designed to combat loneliness, has won a prestigious architecture award for Britain's best new building.Appleby Blue Almshouse, which provides affordable flats for over-65s in Southwark, south London, has won this year's Royal Institute of British Architects' (Riba) Stirling Prize.The complex, in Bermondsey, has 59 flats plus communal facilities, including a roof garden, courtyard and community kitchen.The Stirling Prize judges said it \"sets an ambitious standard for social housing among older people\".Philip Vile/RibaArchitects Witherford Watson Mann have crafted \"high-quality\" and \"thoughtful\" spaces to create environments that truly care for their residents\", according to jury member Ingrid Schroder, director of the Architectural Association (AA) School of Architecture.Philip Vile/RibaThe building was praised for its \"generous\" homes, terracotta-paved hallways with benches and plants, and a water feature that gives the building the \"sense of a woodland oasis\".That all creates an \"aspirational living environment\" that stands \"in stark contrast to the institutional atmosphere often associated with older people's housing\", Riba said.Philip Vile/RibaThe Appleby Blue Almshouse was built on the site of an old care home by United St Saviour's Charity, which subsidises the flats for people on low incomes.Almshouses were traditionally built from the Middle Ages to provide charitable accommodation for people in need.Philip Vile/RibaAppleby Blue beat a range of other nominated buildings and architecture projects to this year's Stirling Prize, ranging from the restoration of the Big Ben tower in London to a new fashion college campus, a science laboratory and an \"inventive\" home extension.The other contenders were:House of CommonsRory GaylorThe Elizabeth TowerHastings HouseThe prize is given to the building judged to be \"the most significant of the year for the evolution of architecture and the built environment\", and is judged on criteria including design vision, innovation and originality.This is Witherford Watson Mann's second time as winning architects, 12 years after they were selected for their design for a groundbreaking modern holiday home inside the ancient Astley Castle in Warwickshire.The Elizabeth line - London's east-west train line - won the prestigious award last year.Other previous winners of the prize - first presented in 1996 - include Liverpool's Everyman Theatre, Hastings Pier and the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh.Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.",

We can finally make New York, and so many other plans a reality.\"When sharing the news with their 12-year-old son, Mr Bujupi said it had been \"one of the craziest moments\" trying to convince him that they had won.\"He thought it was a joke and it was only once I showed him the win on the lottery app that he was willing to believe us,\" he said.As well as New York, Mr Bujupi said he was planning a big present for his mother in Kosovo to \"make her life a little bit easier\".\"Being able to help my mum comfortably enjoy her older years means so much to us both,\" he added.The couple is also pondering a house move as well as helping their children with their future. Andy Carter, senior winners' advisor at The National Lottery, said: \"They've clearly got some amazing and memorable moments ahead and I hope they especially love taking a big bite of the Big Apple.\"Related stories",

    "body": "16 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterPrince Andrew's removal from the last vestiges of royal life has not only reshaped his future - it's sending ripples through his family too.His ex-wife has now lost her duchess title and will simply be known as Sarah Ferguson.Their daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, will continue to have the title of princess as scandal surrounds their parents.Prince Andrew lost use of his Duke of York title over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.So, what does life after the royal shake up look like for the women of the York Family?For Ferguson, 66, the change will be the most visible.For all these years, she has kept the courtesy royal divorcee title Sarah, Duchess of York. Now, she reverts to her maiden name of Ferguson.And while arguably we've always referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer said that will \"no doubt\" have an impact.\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title – even her Twitter bio is @SarahTheDuchess.\"But the loss of her title may impact her much less than the scandal she's facing separately about her own links with Epstein.Accuser's brother urges King to strip Andrew of prince titleSarah Ferguson dropped from multiple charities over Epstein emailAfter all those scandals, why did Andrew quit his titles now?Last month, several charities dropped her as patron or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\"I think as far as Sarah is concerned, her own recent controversy involving the email she is said to have sent Epstein is what has had the biggest impact for her of late,\" said royal commentator Victoria Murphy.\"Prior to that, she had sidestepped the firing line of the controversy around Epstein and I think may have continued to do so, albeit without calling herself Duchess of York, had that not happened.\"Away from her philanthropy, Ferguson also has various business ventures.And these, too, are more likely to be affected by the Epstein controversy than any change in title, says Murphy.\"I would say it's likely they will be impacted by the revelations of her own contact with Epstein, in the same way her charity work was and the fact that charities didn't want to be associated with her.\"But Ferguson has been a great survivor in royal circles. She's kept bouncing back.Even though she split from Prince Andrew more than three decades ago, she has remained his strong supporter and still lives in his Windsor estate.The Christmas before last, she was back in the royal fold, joining a royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham for the first time in decades, despite the fact that she and her ex-husband were not working royals or allowed to be part of official royal events.That ability to bounce back may help her this time too.\"She's the ultimate survivor and master of reinvention,\" said royal author Katie Nicholl.\"Not only has she been reaccepted by the public, but the late Queen Elizabeth II brought her back into the fold, and Charles is also very fond of her.\"Nicholl argues that over the years Ferguson has been through \"much worse\" and won't be too impacted by the loss of her title.\"Having been a royal outcast for all these decades, she's learnt not to attach too much weight to things like that.\"For the couple's two daughters, Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, there's no formal change.They will still be known as princesses, which they have been entitled to since birth.There is also no change to the line of succession.Andrew remains eighth in line to the crown, followed by his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, in ninth and twelfth place respectively.But in reality their positions are \"low down\" and will likely become much further down as time goes on, says Murphy.\"So practically, their positions have little meaning for the future,\" she says.King Charles III's closest family and line of successionBeatrice and Eugenie are also currently non-working royals, and while they do sometimes take on roles – Princess Eugenie was recently announced as a mentor for the King's Foundation's 35 under 35 network, for example - Murphy also says she \"can't see a world\" in which they would step up into royal duties in any official way.\"I don't think that was ever really on the cards, and I certainly don't see it as an option,\" she said.They have also benefited from all of the contacts their parents have made over the years, says Palmer. And while Andrew still remains a prince, losing the dukedom could have a knock-on impact there.Prince Andrew will also no longer join the King and the rest of the royal family at Christmas at Sandringham, but it's possible his daughters will still attend, says Palmer.\"As far as Beatrice and Eugenie go, I think there's an appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them, and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves,\" says Murphy.\"Their daughters are most unfortunate victims, they've had to suffer in silence and have been dignified in their silence,\" adds Nicholl.\"It can't be easy to see their parents dragged through something like this, and they remain very much loved nieces of the King. It wouldn't surprise me at all to see them at Christmas occasions in the future. They're largely untarnished.\"Ultimately, there seems to be little doubt that the person who will be most affected by all of this will be Prince Andrew himself.For a man who always liked the trappings of royalty, the pomp and the ceremony, the loss of his titles is deeply humiliating.So to not have those, on a personal level, will really matter.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterEd Miliband says 400,000 jobs is \"not a target, it's what we need\"The government has announced plans to train and recruit more workers for the UK's clean energy sector, promising to create 400,000 extra jobs by 2030.Plumbers, electricians and welders are among 31 priority occupations that are \"particularly in demand\", with employment in renewable, wind, solar and nuclear expected to double to 860,000 in five years, ministers have said.Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said thousands of jobs were needed to develop Britain's clean energy sector to \"get bills down for good\".Welcoming the proposals, Unite the union said: \"Well-paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition.\"As part of the government's strategy, five \"technical excellence colleges\" will be set up to train workers with clean energy skills, with £2.5m in funding going towards pilot schemes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire, and Pembrokeshire, according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).A new programme is to be launched to match veterans with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories and nuclear power stations, while oil and gas workers could benefit from up to £20m from the UK and Scottish governments for bespoke careers training in clean energy roles.PA MediaThe Siemens wind turbine factory in Hull, where thousands are employed, is \"booming\", a minister has saidThere would be also be tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed.He said 10,000 extra jobs would be needed to support the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk and described how the Siemen's wind turbine factory in Hull was \"booming\".Miliband also told the BBC he stood by his pledge to reduce energy bills by £300 by 2030, after bills went up by 2% for millions across the UK under Ofgem's latest price cap, which sets the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity for millions of househoulds in England, Scotland and Wales.The increase for October to the end of December means a household using a typical amount of energy will pay £1,755 a year, up £35 a year.In a statement, Miliband said the plan would bring \"a new generation of good industrial jobs\" to communities across the UK.\"Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.\"Thanks to this government's commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.\"According to DESNZ, jobs in the clean energy sector command average salaries of more than £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000.Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said: \"We're giving workers the skills needed to switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry, and will drive growth across the nation.\"Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country's future.\"Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, said the government's strategy could \"help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs\".\"Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future,\" she added.",

He attended the concert in Sheffield with his friend Mia Lloyd and his mother Sharon, as well as two of her friends. After being invited on to the stage, Mr Hatcher danced with the Roar and Firework star before Perry sang an off-the-cuff song about Monyash, Bakewell and Derbyshire.\"I'm sure she had no idea where it was but it was crazy that she name dropped the places,\" he said.Ben HatcherMr Hatcher went to the concert with his mother Sharon and his friend Mia LloydOn the experience itself, Mr Hatcher said: \"I think I foreshadowed it, me and my friend were screaming the entire time and she did look over a few times. \"We were just vibing and when she was choosing people to come on to the stage we were screaming and our seats were really good, we were directly in her eyesight.\"I was pointing at myself and I couldn't believe it when she picked me, it was so surreal.\"Making most of the opportunity, he managed to get a selfie with Perry as a memento.SuppliedMr Hatcher posed for a selfie with the pop star on stageMr Hatcher, a student of Chinese and economics at SOAS University of London, said he was recognised by other fans after his appearance on stage.\"There was this one nine-year-old girl in the car who rolled down the window after the show and screamed 'Ben you legend',\" he added.\"This has been an all-time high and my small claim to fame. People will get tired of hearing it but I won't get bored of talking about it.\"More on this story",

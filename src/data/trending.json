There are around 32,000 asylum seekers currently being housed in hotels. Adam and Chris discuss whether this will help with government’s pledge to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.\nAnd, there are fears of mass killings as Sudan’s civil war appears to have reached a significant turning point. More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 14 million have fled their homes.

Will Kamala Harris (and Donald Trump) run for president again?AmericastAvailable for over a yearIt’s just over a year since the 2024 presidential election but attention is already turning to 2028 with both candidates from last year’s race expressing a desire to run again. Kamala Harris told the BBC over the weekend that she “wasn’t done” with public service, while Donald Trump said on Monday morning that he’d “love” to stand again for a third term. We answer your questions on whether Donald Trump plans to override the constitution for a third term in office, and whether he’d have support of the American public.\nMeanwhile, the president is back in construction, this time building a new ballroom at the White House, which has involved demolishing the 103-year-old East Wing in the process. We answer your questions on whether Trump is allowed to demolish parts of the White House and who’s actually paying for the changes. \nAnd, after Kamala Harris’s interview with the BBC, Justin and Anthony take a bit of time off air to chat through some of the issues she spoke about with Laura Kuenssberg and the circumstances surrounding Joe Biden’s eventual decision to withdraw from the election. \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "13 minutes agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaLord Hermer was speaking to Parliament's Joint Committee on the National Security StrategyThe attorney general has blamed \"out of date\" legislation for the collapse of a case against two men accused of spying for China.Lord Hermer - who is the government's chief legal adviser - said if a new law had been in place at the time of the alleged offences he had \"no doubt\" the trial would have gone ahead.Prosecutors dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who both deny any wrongdoing, in September.Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry, an academic, were charged under the Official Secrets Act, legislation which dates back to 1911.The pair were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.Giving evidence to Parliament's Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, Lord Hermer said the Official Secrets Act \"wasn't fit for purpose\" and posed a \"very significant problem\" for the case.Under the legislation, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy.Lord Hermer said the collapsed of the case exemplified the \"difficulties\" the term \"enemy\" posed.However, he said new legislation which was passed in 2023, the National Security Act, removed this problem as it only required proof the information was being passed to a foreign power.\"Speaking frankly, I don't understand why it took Parliament so long to pass that [legislation],\" he told the committee.\"Had that act been in force at the relevant time to this case... I have no doubt that the prosecution would have proceeded to trial.\"Lord Hermer said there were lessons that could be learned from the collapse of the case but it was \"unwise\" to brand it \"farcical\" or \"a catastrophic failure\".He added that all sides had been \"working incredibly hard to try and get this prosecution over the line\". Director of public prosecutions Stephen Parkinson has said the case could not progress because the government's witness, deputy national security adviser Matt Collins, would not explicitly say China was an active threat to national security at the time of the alleged offences.Prosecutors believed his witness statements would not meet the requirement to prove China was an \"enemy\" under the Official Secrets Act, after a Court of Appeal ruling in another spying case in July 2024 clarified the law.Mr Collins told the committee on Monday he had been given legal advice that his evidence would be sufficient and was surprised when he learnt the case was being dropped.He insisted he outlined a range of threats China posed to the UK's national security in his witness statements, in line with the government's policy at the time of the alleged offences.The collapse of the case triggered a political row over who was to blame. The Conservatives have accused the Labour government of allowing the case to fail because it wanted to foster closer economic ties with Beijing.However, the government has maintained that no ministers or special advisers were involved in the decisions which led to the collapse of the case or the evidence provided, and that Mr Collins' evidence was based on the Conservative government's policy at the time.Ministers have insisted they are frustrated the case did not proceed.Lord Hermer told the committee allegations politicians had interfered in the case were \"baseless\" and \"disgraceful\".He argued it would have been inappropriate for him to interfere with the prosecution's decision and contrary to \"basic constitutional principle\".Senior minister Darren Jones, who gave evidence alongside Lord Hermer, also denied accusations of political interference in the case.\"I think at the administrative level, the independence of the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service], the role of ministers, the role of the attorney, that's all worked as it should do,\" he said.\"The root cause of the problem here is that the case in question was charged under very old legislation.\"Jones was also challenged by the committee over the government's approach to China and the perception that it was \"kowtowing\" to Beijing.He reject this, insisting the government does not \"shy away from the series of threats that China poses to the UK\".Jones sought to contrast Labour's position with that of the previous Conservative government, which he claimed \"was not to talk to China at all\".He added: \"It's right that we have a working relationship with the Chinese government and their officials, and it's right that we are robust in dealing with these issues.\"",

    "body": "Teenager guilty of murdering boy at NYE eventJust nowFamily handout / PA MediaHarry Pitman was stabbed once in the neck on 31 December 2023An teenager has been found guilty of murdering 16-year-old Harry Pitman, who was stabbed in the neck at a New Year's Eve event in north London. Areece Lloyd-Hall was convicted at the Old Bailey following a retrial after jurors in the first trial were unable to reach a verdict.Lloyd-Hall, from Westminster, was found guilty by a majority of 11 to one after almost eight hours of deliberation. He had already been convicted of possessing an offensive weapon.The fatal stabbing took place at Primrose Hill on 31 December 2023 after Harry accidentally bumped into another boy while \"play-fighting\" and practising high kicks, the jury was told.Prosecution barrister Jocelyn Ledward KC told jurors \"revelry turned to tragedy in the blink of an eye\".Harry and Lloyd-Hall were strangers who had each gone to watch the fireworks with separate groups of friends.Earlier that evening, Special Constable David Smith said Harry had seemed excitable and \"physically bounced\" up to him for a friendly chat before \"fist bumping\" another reveller nearby.PA MediaPolice officers were seen on Primrose Hill in the days following Harry's deathThe attack happened in front of a crowd gathered in the popular park to watch fireworks over the River Thames.Lloyd-Hall, now aged 18, pushed forward and lunged at Harry with a pointed dagger, metres from where uniformed police officers were stationed.In \"shocking\" mobile phone footage played in court, a knife sheath was seen to fly through the air during the fast-paced incident.Harry held his neck, his white T-shirt covered in blood, as he pushed through crowds calling to officers for \"help\".He collapsed and died minutes later, shortly before midnight.College student Lloyd-Hall, who was 16 at the time, claimed he thought he had only hit Harry with the sheath in an attempt to get Harry away from him.'Not my intention'He said: \"I did not want him to lose his life.\"I feel horrible for what I caused. It was not my intention.\"He said he ran off not realising what had happened because he was holding a knife and knew there were police officers nearby.Jurors were told Lloyd-Hall was suffering from cannabis-induced paranoia and may have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder triggered by witnessing the aftermath of an earlier stabbing and the loss of a friend to knife crime in June 2023.At the first trial in October last year, a jury found Lloyd-Hall guilty of possession of an offensive weapon but failed to agree on other charges, it can now be reported.There were gasps from Harry's family sitting in court as Lloyd-Hall was convicted of murder.The teenager will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 10 November.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesLizard Island is about 250km (155 miles) north of CairnsAn 80-year-old Australian woman has been found dead on a Great Barrier Reef island after being left behind by the cruise ship she was travelling on.The woman had been hiking on Lizard Island, 250km (155 miles) north of Cairns, with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer cruise ship on Saturday but is believed to have broken off from the group to have a rest.The ship left the island around sunset but returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing. A major search operation found her body on Sunday morning. No details have been released.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said it was investigating and would meet the ship's crew later this week.It is understood the woman, who has not been named, was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, with tickets costing in the tens of thousands of dollars for the journey.She had joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, before she decided she needed to rest, according to the Courier Mail newspaper.But she did not make it back to the ship, which then departed without her.Traci Ayris was sailing near the island last weekend and told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that she saw a helicopter using a spotlight to search a walking trail on the island at around midnight on Saturday. She said about seven people with torches went to the island to search but it was called off at around 03:00 on Sunday (18:00 GMT Saturday) with a helicopter returning on Sunday morning when the body was apparently found.\"We knew she was dead because they called everyone back from the search immediately,\" she told ABC.\"And no-one went to the spot that the chopper was hovering over until later that day when the police arrived.\"A spokesperson for Amsa said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 on Saturday by the ship's captain.The authority said it would work with other relevant agencies to investigate the case and that it takes the safety of passengers and crew onboard commercial vessels seriously.Ms Ayris also said the incident was clearly distressing for crew and passengers.\"It was very sad in this paradise to have this tragedy occur. It should have been a happy time for that lovely lady.\"A report into the \"sudden and non-suspicious death\" of the woman will be prepared for the coroner, Queensland police said.Coral ExpeditionsThe incident happened on the first stop of a 60-day trip around AustraliaCoral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield said staff had contacted the woman's family and were offering support over the \"tragic death\".\"While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman's family,\" Mr Fifield said.\"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is under way,\" he added.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.The vessel has continued its voyage to Darwin.Additional reporting by Tom McArthur",

    "body": "7 hours agoAbhishek DeyBBC News, DelhiAuthorities in Indian capital Delhi unsuccessfully carried out a cloud seeding trial, which is the science of altering clouds to make rains, to tackle the city's worsening air pollution on Tuesday. Cloud seeding is done by firing small particles - usually silver iodide - into clouds to produce rain. The technique is used around the world, but experts doubt its efficacy as a long-term air pollution control measure.A team of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur and the Delhi government carried out the trial over several neighbourhoods, as thick smog enveloped the city.   But the attempt - the first in 53 years - was \"not completely successful\" due to the lack of moisture in the air.Over the past two weeks, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) - which measures the level of PM 2.5 or fine particulate matter in the air that can clog lungs - has been hovering between 300 and 400, which is nearly 20 times the acceptable limit.On Tuesday, authorities used a Cessna aircraft to release fire flares containing silver iodide and sodium chloride into the atmosphere.In a statement, IIT Kanpur said that despite the lack of rain, there had been a measurable reduction in particulate matter because of Tuesday's experiment, \"indicating that even under limited moisture conditions, cloud seeding can contribute to improved air quality\". However, the institute's director Manindra Agarwal told BBC Hindi that this can't be a long-term fix for Delhi's perennial pollution problem. \"One measure of success is if it rains, which certainly did not happen,\" said Mr Agarwal. \"The moisture content in the clouds yesterday [Tuesday] was very low. We will continue our efforts in the near future.\"The trial is likely to be repeated in the coming weeks after the moisture levels in the clouds increases again, Delhi's Environment Minister Manjinder Sirsa told reporters. Delhi's first cloud-seeding experiment was carried out in 1957, followed by another attempt in 1972, according to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. While those experiments were aimed at drought management, this was the first indigenous effort at cloud seeding to control pollution, said Mr Agarwal.  The city had considered cloud seeding in 2023 as well, but the plan did not materialise due to pending court approvals. Back then, scientists had also highlighted how it was an expensive strategy with low success rates. Cloud seeding speeds up the condensation of moisture in clouds to create rain. The salt granules act as ice-nucleating particles, which enable ice crystals to form in the clouds. The moisture in the clouds then latches on to these ice crystals and condenses into rain.But the process doesn't always work and is dependent on the right amount of moisture and humidity in the clouds to allow for ice nuclei to form.There is not enough empirical evidence on how much the AQI can come down by cloud seeding, climate change and sustainability expert Abinash Mohanty told the BBC in 2023. \"We also don't know what its [cloud seeding] effects are because in the end you're trying to alter natural processes and that's bound to have limitations.\"Globally cloud seeding exercises have yielded mixed results.China has boasted about its success to manage rains before hosting the Olympics, with Beijing using rockets, cannons and drones to do cloud seeding. However, in the United Arab Emirates, questions over the technique were raised, following floods in Dubai last year.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "5 hours agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterHousebuilders have warned the government's budget watchdog that ministers' target of building 1.5 million homes in England by the end of the decade is too optimistic.The Home Builders Federation (HBF) has written to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to say that unless the government does something to boost affordability for first time buyers and cut taxes the target will be missed, as first reported in The Times. The letter is a blow to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of next month's Budget, given that a surge in new homes is central to the OBR's forecasts for economic growth.The government says it will \"leave no stone unturned\" to meet the 1.5 million new homes target for England.The chancellor has promised to \"defy\" gloomy forecasts for the UK economy after it emerged the government is facing a bigger-than-expected hole in the public finances.The OBR is expected to downgrade productivity  - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - when it delivers its final draft forecast to the Treasury on Friday, ahead of Reeves' Budget on 26 November.The chancellor will be hoping that the warning from housebuilders will not drag the OBR's outlook down even further. The watchdog's decision in March to including the government's planning reforms in its economic forecasts was a major boost to Reeves, as it increased growth forecasts by 0.2% of GDP.The OBR did not endorse the 1.5 million target - but it did say that changes such as mandatory local housing targets and building on green belt land could result in 1.3 million homes across the entire UK over the next five years. But the Home Builders Federation is warning that this is an \"extremely ambitious\" target without further changes to government policy.The HBF is keen to stress that it welcomes the government's planning reforms - but it fears that these alone are not enough to kick start building in a flat market.The organisation, which says its members are responsible for building 80% of new homes in England and Wales, says there has been no government help for first time-buyers since the Help to Buy scheme closed to new applications in 2022.It has also criticised increases to the \"landfill tax\", which aims to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill sites, which it claims will add £14,000 to the cost of building a new home.The introduction of a new building safety levy next year will also add costs, it says. HBF spokesman Steve Turner said: \"Whilst the planning reforms overseen by ministers last year are very positive, government also continues to oversee increases in policy costs and taxes on new homes making many sites unviable. \"We need to see a reversal of these additional burdens and action to support first-time buyers in a market that they are increasingly frozen out of. \"It is the first time in decades there is no government support scheme in place to help people buy a home and the suppressed level of effective demand is preventing builders investing in sites to build the homes the country needs.\"Earlier this month, the government announced plans to shake up the house-buying system to speed up sales and save first-time buyers money.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government said: \"We will leave no stone unturned to build the 1.5 million homes this country desperately needs and restore the dream of homeownership.\"On top of the major planning changes we have already introduced to get developers building and our huge £39bn investment in social and affordable housing, we are going further and faster to accelerate reforms and bring about the biggest era of housebuilding in our country's history.\"",

    "body": "48 minutes agoGeorge TorrDerbyDerbyshire PoliceHaybe Cabdiraxmaan Nur has been jailed for lifeAn asylum seeker who \"calmly\" walked into a bank and stabbed a man inside to death without provocation or motive has been jailed for life.Haybe Cabdiraxmaan Nur stabbed Gurvinder Johal, 37, through the heart in an attack caught on CCTV at a Lloyds Bank branch in St Peter's Street, Derby, just after 14:30 BST on 6 May. Mr Johal's family said Nur - who Derby Crown Court heard arrived on small boat in the UK after spending a few years in Europe - was a \"coward and demon\" who had robbed his three young children of their innocence.On Wednesday, Nur was jailed for at least 25 years.Family handoutGurvinder Johal's family described him as their \"light\" in a statement read to the courtThe court heard Nur, who arrived in the UK in October 2024, had previously spent time in Italy, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.Sentencing Nur, Judge Shaun Smith said: \"You murdered [Mr Johal] in broad daylight in front of members of the public.\"What you did, armed with a knife, was randomly select Mr Johal and plunge it into his chest - a man you never knew. It was a brutal and callous act.\"This was a real-life horror film for everyone connected to Mr Johal and those who witnessed this.\"Nur's asylum application was rejected by the Home Office in January 2025, and he was in the process of appealing against the decision when the murder took place, the court heard.Louis Mably KC, for the prosecution, read a victim impact statement written by Mr Johal's sister on behalf of the family.CCTV footage shows moments before and after bank murderIn it, she said: \"To us and to God, he was simply a good man, our Gurvinder, our light.\"This didn't just change our lives, they have been shattered... we are suffocated by a silence so loud it hurts.\"This is a life sentence of grief... [in Nur], we see nothing more than a coward and a demon.\"The person will never understand the pain and destruction they have caused - they are nothing.\"The light in our family has been extinguished... the deepest wound is the impact on the children, they had their innocence stolen.\"The statement continued and stated Mr Johal's children have said \"a monster took daddy away\".Mr Johal's family urged for Nur to serve his sentence in the UK, rather than being deported.A cordon was set up in Derby after the stabbingNur had no previous convictions in the UK, but was arrested in Derby on 13 December 2024 following an argument with a man. The court heard Nur \"ran into traffic\", headbutted a man and called English people \"white racists\".Nur, who the court was told had consumed three bottles of vodka and 10 beers on the day of the killing, had been in contact with a charity that helps migrants.In a number of calls which started in the morning and into the early afternoon, Nur was aggressive and made threats to take his own life and to kill other people.The court heard Nur \"felt like he was living like an animal\" and felt he was not being supported and had mental health issues.\"He was heard wailing and was warned about his behaviour,\" Mr Mably KC said.'Moment of confusion'He added: \"Nur got up and walked into the bank. What happened inside was seen by a number of customers and bank staff and captured on CCTV.\"He approached him, produced a knife and without warning or provocation and with no time to react, he stabbed him forcefully in the chest.\"No-one saw this stabbing until after it happened and there was a moment of confusion as to what had happened.\"The defendant himself simply turned around and calmly walked out of the bank. The calmness of his exit was noted by others in the bank and that added to the confusion as to what had happened.\"Mr Johal collapsed on to the ground with the knife still in his chest. Bank staff called 999. Despite attempts to revive him, Mr Johal was pronounced dead at the scene at 15:16.The court heard Nur was inside the bank for no more than 22 seconds.He arrived home just before 15:00, and paramedics arrived at his address following the calls he made to the migrant helpline and the threats to take his own life.He told them he was frustrated and now he had sobered up, he had no intention of taking his own life or hurting people.The court was told Nur was tracked down and arrested a few hours later, after police found him asleep on his bedroom floor.When he was taken into custody, the court heard Nur became abusive and, in Somali, said: \"What can they take from me... what can you change about me... you cannot change anything about me... you can kill me as normal... I did this intentionally.\"The court also heard of Nur's involvement with police forces across Europe.In May 2023, he received a suspended sentence for robbery in Italy, and was arrested for the theft of bicycles in Germany a month later. Police in Berlin were called out to a refugee centre, where Nur had threatened to take his own life.He then moved to the Netherlands, where it was reported there were three minor incidents of public disorder while drunk.Nur also spent time in Luxembourg, committing eight offences of stealing alcohol. The court heard Nur was so drunk that on many occasions when he was arrested, he could not be questioned.Bodycam footage shows moment bank murderer was arrestedJames Horne KC, mitigating, said Nur fled Somalia in 2016 after his wife was a victim of an honour killing, and was diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder.\"Despite his lack of memory, he sought to accept full responsibility,\" he said.The 47-year-old, previously of Western Road, Derby, pleaded guilty to one count of murder on 21 August.Sam Shallow, of the Crown Prosecution Service, called the murder an \"inexplicable crime\".\"Gurvinder Johal's sudden death as he went about his everyday business left a family in mourning and a community in shock,\" she said.\"Mr Johal was a complete stranger to the defendant and there was no reason for him to have been targeted in this way.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul Seddon,Political reporter and Chris Mason,Political editorWatch: Keir Starmer's two different answers to the same tax questionThe prime minister has declined to stand by his manifesto commitments not to raise key taxes at next month's Budget.Sir Keir Starmer did not repeat the promise not to raise income tax rates, VAT or National Insurance during Prime Minister's Questions.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch argued it showed tax rises are on the way, adding that Labour was \"too weak\" to control public spending instead.It comes amid increasing speculation that the chancellor could break Labour's manifesto pledges, as she seeks to raise billions of pounds to plug a Budget shortfall. Rachel Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes at the Budget on 26 November, after gloomy economic forecasts and a series of U-turns on welfare cuts made it harder for her to meet her own tax and spending rules.As recently as July, Sir Keir had insisted he stood by his manifesto tax promises, simply answering \"yes\" when asked by Badenoch at a previous PMQs session in July.By the end of last month, ministers said \"the manifesto stands today\".But asked the same question on Wednesday, the prime minister only replied that the government would \"lay out our plans\" at next month's Budget.Noting that after his previous answer, Sir Keir had sat down with a \"smug grin on his face\", Badenoch taunted: \"What's changed in the past four months?\"Speaking to reporters after PMQs, Sir Keir's spokeswoman also repeatedly declined to repeat the pledge, adding she could not \"pre-empt\" the Budget. Income tax argumentsLabour's 2024 election manifesto pledged not to raise the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or National Insurance - prompting a row last autumn when it announced a hike in the contributions paid by employers.It also promised not to raise Value Added Tax (VAT), a sales tax, although the manifesto did not specify whether this applied to the rates, or which products are subject to the charge.The chancellor has not ruled out continuing to freeze income tax thresholds beyond the 2028 date fixed by the last government, allowing more people to be dragged into higher bands as their wages rise over time.The manifesto pledges not to raise these taxes - the biggest revenue-raising options available to the Treasury - has considerably reduced Reeves's room for manoeuvre ahead of the 26 November Budget.Some senior Labour figures are privately suggesting to Reeves that now is the time in the Parliament to make the case for putting up income tax.They argue it is still years until the general election, it could raise a lot of money and, unlike more targeted tax rises such as last year's changes to inheritance tax on farmland, would not create a single noisy lobby group in opposition.But the idea leaves other Labour figures deeply nervous because it would amount to a spectacular breach of their pre-election promise, which ministers have repeated many times since. Some also worry it could depress the economy further at a time of weak economic growth. Brexit blame gameReeves announced tax rises worth £40bn a year at her first Budget last November, including hikes to National Insurance paid by employers, and insisted she would not have to repeat the move in subsequent years.But the chancellor recently admitted she is looking to raise taxes again in a bid to put the UK's finances on a firmer footing.It is understood the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is set to revise down its predictions for productivity of the UK economy, leading to a £20bn gap in meeting her tax and spending rules.Sir Keir told MPs the downgrade showed the \"true extent of the damage\" done to the economy by the Conservatives, citing \"austerity\", Brexit and the mini-Budget under Liz Truss in September 2022.Badenoch rejected this, and hit back that the prime minister was more prepared to \"dip into people's pockets\" than upset Labour MPs by cutting welfare spending.\"He is raising taxes because he is too weak to control spending. He's blaming us. He's blaming the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility),\" she added.\"Last week, they were blaming Brexit. Isn't the truth that with this prime minister, it's always someone else's fault?\" ",

    "body": "1 hour agoPeter Mwai, Merlyn Thomas and Matt MurphyBBC Verify    BBCWarning: This story contains graphic descriptions of executions.Fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have executed a number of unarmed people after capturing the Sudanese city of el-Fasher, new videos analysed by BBC Verify show.The RSF, which has engaged in a brutal war with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for more than two years, seized a key military base in the city over the weekend after an extended siege.Several videos have since emerged showing men wearing military fatigues with some wearing what appear to be RSF patches carrying out extreme acts of violence around el-Fasher. The UN's Sudan coordinator said it had received \"credible reports of summary executions\" in the city during an interview with the BBC on Wednesday.BBC Verify has approached the RSF for comment. Imran Abdullah, an adviser to the RSF, denied the group's fighters were targeting civilians in an interview with the BBC on Monday.Sudan has been ravaged by war since the conflict broke out in 2023, prompted by the collapse of the SAF and the RSF's fragile ruling coalition. More than 150,000 people have died across the country and about 12 million have fled their homes since then.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Denise Brown - the UN's Sudan coordinator - said she had received reports of executions against \"unarmed men in particular\" since the RSF entered the city. Killings of unarmed civilians or surrendering combatants is a war crime under the Geneva Convention.Most of the clips reviewed by BBC Verify are in dusty and sandy rural locations, making it hard to say where exactly they took place. However, we did geolocate one video showing the summary shooting of an unarmed man at a university building in el-Fasher.The clip showed the unarmed man sitting amid dozens of dead bodies in a hallway. As the video progressed, he was seen turning towards the camera which followed an armed man who was descending the stairs. The fighter then raised his rifle and fired a single shot knocking the unarmed man to the ground, where he lay motionless.A number of similarly distressing clips are circulating online, but are difficult to geolocate as they are recorded outside the city itself where there are very few visible landmarks. But BBC Verify has managed to place one of the fighters who appeared in multiple execution videos in the area around el-Fasher in recent days.The fighter, who goes by the name of Abu Lulu, has long had his activities with the RSF documented on a social media profile viewed by BBC Verify.A video which first appeared online over the weekend showed him amidst dead bodies in an area north-west of the city. Working with the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR), BBC Verify has been able to confirm the location of this footage, but it's difficult to say whether the dead in the clip are civilians or SAF troops killed in fighting due to the quality of the video.But Abu Lulu has also appeared in at least two videos which show him participating in the execution of unarmed men who are kneeling and under armed guard. Reverse image searches show all the videos have appeared online since the weekend.In one video he was seen addressing an injured man lying on the ground, berating him for not sharing information before threatening to rape him. The RSF fighter then shot the captive several times using an automatic rifle.A separate video shows Abu Lulu standing alongside several RSF troops carrying AK-style assault rifles and guarding a group of at least nine unarmed captives. After addressing the men, Abu Lulu aimed his rifle at the group and opened fire. In the aftermath the other armed men raised their arms and cheered.In another clip the fighter was seen standing alongside several other armed men with dozens of dead bodies visible in the background. Some of the fighters were wearing RSF style uniforms, one of which has a circular patch with a black line running around the circumference - consistent with the paramilitary's insignia.Fighters involved in shootings were wearing patches consistent with RSF insigniaIn August the RSF said it would investigate Abu Lulu after he was accused of executing a captive. A statement said \"if it is proven that the perpetrator is indeed a member of our ranks, he will be held accountable without delay\".The videos come after US-based researchers said that satellite images taken of el-Fasher since the city fell appear to show the aftermath of mass killings carried out in the streets of the city itself.Analysts with the Human Rights Laboratory at Yale University highlighted large \"clusters\" visible in the images, which they said were \"consistent with the size range of adult human bodies and are not present in previous imagery\".In the report issued on Monday, Yale said that its analysts' observations were \"consistent with reports of executions\" shared online and by the UN and human rights groups in recent days and also highlighted \"discoloration\" which the analysts said may be human blood.Without on-the-ground footage from that location, BBC Verify cannot independently confirm Yale's findings.Other satellite images viewed by BBC Verify appeared to show vehicles parked at each end of several streets. Yale analysts noted that their positioning appeared to suggest that the paramilitary was carrying out house-to-house clearance operations. In some areas, clusters that Yale identified as human bodies were seen near the vehicles.Sudan's military expels top UN food aid officials as conflict escalatesUN pleads for safe passage for civilians trapped in war-hit Sudan cityFear of mass killings as thousands trapped in besieged Sudan city taken by militia groupMichael Jones, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said the RSF has a track record of carrying out ethnically-based summary killings which could be partially attributed to the paramilitary's \"decentralised composition\".\"The bulk of the group's manpower comes from a messy confederation of rented militia, local allies and economic opportunists, who are often motivated by interests or grievances that pre-date the April 2023 conflict,\" he told BBC Verify.\"Although likely playing out under the umbrella of RSF policy, the violence can sometimes be decentralised, with perpetrators settling personal or communal vendettas, seizing assets or land, and participating in ethnic cleansing to consolidate their own political power.\"In recent months the SAF has made several major gains against the RSF, including recapturing the capital Khartoum, so that the army now controls most of the north and the east of the country.By contrast the RSF controls almost all of Darfur in the west and much of the neighbouring Kordofan region - the traditional base of its predecessor, the Janjaweed paramilitary which carried out ethnic killings in Darfur between 2003 and 2005. Many of those who fought with the Janjaweed are believed to have joined the RSF.Until now el-Fasher was the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by government forces and its allies. The RSF has previously said that it hopes to form a rival government in the city when it had assumed control there.Both sides have been accused of war crimes since the conflict began and in the closing days of President Joe Biden's administration the US said the RSF had carried out acts of genocide. BBC Verify has previously documented mass killings carried out by the RSF following the defection of a senior commander.Additional reporting by Kumar Malhotra, Benedict Garman, Richard Irvine-Brown, Daniele Palumbo, Paul Myers and Thomas Copeland.",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesGeert Wilders is facing a strong challenge from left-leader Frans Timmermans and liberal Rob JettenGeert Wilders' anti-Islam Freedom party is facing a tight race in Wednesday's Dutch election, and even if he wins the vote his hopes of forming a new government appear minimal.Wilders was the clear winner last time Dutch voters went to the polls in November 2023, but final opinion polls ahead of voting suggest a fall in his support.Dutch voters are grappling with a series of crises, from a chronic housing shortage to overcrowded asylum centres. The cost of living is rising with sky-high rents and healthcare costs.Unlike last time, Wilders' rivals are refusing to work with him after he brought down his own coalition government last June.Voting at most of the country's more than 10,000 polling stations continues until 21:00 (20:00 GMT) on Wednesday.Commentators believe it is more important who comes second in the vote than first, as it could decide who will form the next government.Even if Wilders' party comes top, the next Dutch government is more likely to come from the centre left or centre right.The race is wide open, and more than a third of Dutch voters were seen as undecided on the eve of the election.\"It's one of the most important elections, because people need to have their faith restored,\" says Sarah de Lange, professor of Dutch politics at Leiden University.As many as 15 parties are set to win a share of parliament's 150 seats, but opinion polls suggest four will stand out. Apart from Wilders' PVV, there is GreenLeft-Labour under ex-EU top official Frans Timmermans, Rob Jetten's liberal D66 and the centre-right Christian Democrats of Henri Bontenbal.For almost half of Dutch voters, the housing crisis is top priority, with a shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Housing has taken stage in the election, and although Wilders has blamed the crisis on migration, others point to a rise in single-person households and planning gridlock.Most of the parties have vowed to tackle the issue head-on. Frans Timmermans promises at least 100,000 new homes per year if his party takes office, while Rob Jetten of the liberals says the solution lies on building on 1% of agricultural land.Unemployment hit 4% last month, which is low in European terms but the highest rate for four years in the Netherlands. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose 8.8% over the past year, signalling growing anxiety among workers about job security.EPA/ShuttlestockLiberal-conservative leader Dilan Yesilgöz labels Wilders' party \"one man with a Twitter account\"Considered for so long the outsider of Dutch politics, Geert Wilders played a key role in the last government, both in setting it up and in bringing it down after only 11 months, in a row over immigration. His coalition partners refused to let him become prime minister, but having former spy chief Dick Schoof lead a technocrat cabinet was a workaround that ultimately failed.Former coalition partner Dilan Yesilgöz, the leader of the conservative-liberal VVD, told Wilders his \"party exists as one man with a Twitter account and nothing more\".Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesWilders' lead in the polls narrowed in the weeks leading up to the electionYesilgöz's jibe was not completely out of place as Wilders does not allow his PVV to have members. Yesilgöz's own VVD party is polling down in fifth place.Wilders was on the backfoot ahead of the vote, having to apologise to Frans Timmermans after two Freedom party MPs posted AI-generated images of the left-wing leader being led away in handcuffs.When Wilders won two years ago, Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam says he was able to harness the votes of more radical voters on the right who were worried about Islam and Eurosceptic along with less radical voters.\"People called him Milders, a milder version of himself,\" says Prof Rooduijn, who points out that Wilders then put on ice many of his anti-Islam policies to appear more palatable.Although Wilders no longer talks of banning mosques and the Koran, he sees Islam as \"the greatest existential threat to our freedom\", a view Prof Rooduijn describes as \"really a key element of his nativism - an exclusionary form of nationalism\".In one TV debate, Wilders said \"take a walk [in central Rotterdam] on shopping night on Saturday evening and it's like you're in Marrakesh; it's not the Netherlands any more\".Left-wing leader Timmermans has accused him of scapegoating an entire section of society: \"You're blaming Islam.\"But the risk Wilders faces now is of losing both the more radical voters, if they fail to turn out, and the less radical voters who could drift to other parties, including the anti-immigration Ja21.\"Right now I don't think it's very likely Wilders will be part of a government coalition,\" Prof Rooduijn believes.It can take weeks - if not months - for parties to form a coalition, but if the centre right takes power, Christian Democrat Henri Bontenbal could be in the frame to lead it.His CDA party has staged a remarkable comeback in that only two years ago they won just five seats.Bontenbal believes Dutch voters are looking now at a return to \"what I'll call 'boring politics'. The Netherlands is done with populism\".He has not had a great campaign, though. Days after he defended the right of religious schools to teach that homosexual relationships were wrong, he went back on himself and admitted he had made a mistake.",

    "body": "20 minutes agoDaniel Sandford,UK correspondent and Maia DaviesPA MediaHadush Kebatu was found guilty of two sexual assaults in Epping, where he had been living in a hotel housing migrantsA migrant sex offender mistakenly released from prison was given a £500 payment after threatening to disrupt his deportation from the UK to Ethiopia.Hadush Kebatu was jailed after sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman while living in an asylum hotel in Epping, Essex, but was mistakenly freed by prison staff on Friday. He was re-arrested after two days.  The Ethiopian was put on a flight on Tuesday night and landed the following morning, the Home Office said.The payment was made by the removal team as an alternative to a slower and more expensive process, Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said. He said Kebatu was \"forcibly deported\" and accompanied by five escorts on the flight.Paid removals are normal under the Facilitated Returns Scheme, with foreign nationals who agree to leave the UK being given £1,500.Downing Street said Kebatu had attempted to apply for the Facilitated Returns Scheme, but his bid was denied. He was turned down because the government wanted to remove him quickly and not pay him £1,500, the BBC understands. \"Forcible\" returns do not usually involve payments, but removal teams can decide to make a discretionary payment to ensure things go smoothly. In this case, after Kebatu threatened to disrupt the flight, there was concern that it would cost much more to re-book - running into several thousands of pounds - and it might have led to expensive legal action.Sources say the decision to make the payment to Kebatu was made by the removal team, not ministers.The payment avoided a \"slower, more expensive process for the taxpayer, which would have included detention, a new flight and potentially fighting subsequent legal claims,\" the prime minister's spokesman said. Kebatu arrived in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa early on Wednesday and was briefly held by officers at the airport before being released, Ethiopian police told the BBC.There was \"no legal basis for his continued detention\", Ethiopian Federal Police spokesman Jaylan Abde said.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the payment was an \"outrageous waste of taxpayers' money.\"\"Hadush Kebatu should have been deported immediately, not released and sent home with pocket money,\" she said. \"The Conservatives have a serious plan to leave the ECHR and deport all foreign criminals.\" The Liberal Democrats said the payment was \"outrageous\" and people would \"rightly be angry\".\"Public trust was completely trashed after Kebatu's wrongful release and now this,\" said the party's home affairs spokesperson Max Wilkinson.\"We need to fix our fundamentally broken immigration system.\"Reform UK described the payment as an \"insult of the highest order\".\"We have a government that's failing to keep its people safe, failing to lock up criminals, and wasting endless amounts of taxpayer money while doing so,\" head of policy Zia Yusuf said.Announcing Kebatu's removal earlier on Wednesday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"Last week's blunder should never have happened - and I share the public's anger that it did.\"\"I have pulled every lever to deport Mr Kebatu and remove him off British soil. I am pleased to confirm this vile child sex offender has been deported. Our streets are safer because of it,\" she added. On Friday, Kebatu was meant be taken from HMP Chelmsford to an immigration detention centre to be deported under an early removals scheme (ERS) for foreign national offenders.Instead, he was released in what Justice Secretary David Lammy previously described as apparent \"human error\".By the time Essex Police were made aware of the situation shortly before 13:00, he had approached members of the public in the city centre for assistance and boarded a train to London.He was arrested in north London on Sunday morning after a member of the public contacted the police to say they might have spotted him near Finsbury Park station.Home Office Minister of State Alex Norris told BBC Breakfast: \"We accept this was a blunder - we're really angry about it as I know the public are.\"He said \"immediate controls\" had been put in place in prisons to avoid a repeat of the incident - including more \"stringent\" checks when offenders leave prisons for deportation - and that an independent inquiry would identify lessons learned.The independent investigation will seek to establish how Kebatu was set free and whether staff had sufficient experience, training and technology.The inquiry chair, former Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Dame Lynne Owens, will also speak to Kebatu's victims and make recommendations to prevent further mistaken releases, which have risen in recent years.An urgent review has been ordered into the checks that take place when someone is released from prison. A prison officer has been suspended and no removals from HMP Chelmsford under the ERS will take place this week.Epping Forest's Conservative MP, Neil Hudson, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the community would be \"very relieved\" by Kebatu's removal.\"No one wants to see our hometown the lead story on the news,\" he said, adding that the local authority's legal challenge to block migrants from lodging at The Bell Hotel - where Kebatu had been staying - was ongoing.\"The events over the weekend... have really brought things to the surface again,\" he said. \"This is incredibly frustrating and the government must get a grip.\"Kebatu arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel on a small boat on 29 June, having travelled through Sudan, Libya, Italy and France.His arrest in July sparked a wave of protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, which was being used to accommodate asylum seekers including Kebatu.Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu had tried to kiss a teenage girl in the town centre, making sexually explicit comments to her.The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her and another woman.He denied the charges against him but was found guilty of five offences and sentenced to 12 months in custody, including the time he had already spent in jail awaiting his trial.A deportation order must be made when a foreign national is sentenced to 12 months or more in custody, under the UK Borders Act 2007.During Kebatu's trial, the court heard it was his \"firm wish\" to be deported.",

    "body": "5 hours agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentBBCThe recruitment website is jazzy, awash with pictures of happy young workers, and festooned with upbeat mini-slogans such as \"insane speed\", \"infinite curiosity\" and \"customer obsession\".Read a bit lower, and there are promises of perks galore: competitive compensation, free meals, free gym membership, free health and dental care and so on. But then comes the catch.Each job ad contains a warning: \"Please don't join if you're not excited about… working ~70 hrs/week in person with some of the most ambitious people in NYC.\"The website belongs to Rilla, a New York-based tech business which sells AI-based systems that allow employers to monitor sales representatives when they are out and about, interacting with clients.The company has become something of a poster child for a fast-paced workplace culture known as 996, also sometimes referred to as hustle culture or grindcore.In simple terms, it puts a premium on long working hours, typically 9am to 9pm, six days a week (hence \"996\").For most of us, that would be gruelling. But according to Will Gao, head of growth at Rilla, its 120 employees simply don't see it that way.\"We look for people who are like Olympian athletes, with characteristics of, you know, obsession, infinite ambition.\"It's people who want to do incredible things and have a lot of fun while doing so,\" he says.Will GaoWill Gao says the company Rilla looks for people \"like Olympian athletes\"He insists that while the hours are generally long, there's no rigid structure. \"If I'm like, 'Holy cow, I have a super idea I'm working on', then I'll just keep working until 2 or 3am, then I'll just roll in the next day at noon or something\", he explains.This kind of approach has become extremely popular in the technology sector over the past few years, and for good reason. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has been taking place at a breakneck pace, and companies around the world are now working flat-out to develop ways in which it can be exploited and monetised.Huge amounts of money are being ploughed into AI ventures, many of them start-ups. But for every ambitious company founder, the ever-present fear is that someone else will get there first. Speed is of the essence – and tech sector workers are under pressure to work harder, and longer, to get results quickly.'Slackers are not my brothers'The 996 culture first came to the fore in China a decade ago. It was embraced by tech companies and start-ups at a time when the country was increasingly focused on transforming itself from the world's workshop for cheap goods into a leader in advanced technologies.It had some powerful advocates. They included Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of the retail behemoth Alibaba.com.\"I personally think that being able to work 996 is a huge blessing\", he wrote in one blog post for employees.\"It's not just entrepreneurs; most successful or ambitious artists, scientists, athletes, officials, and politicians work 996 or more\", he said in another. \"It's not because they have extraordinary perseverance, but because they are deeply passionate about their chosen careers\", he added.Getty ImagesJack Ma, former chairman of the Alibaba Group, called the 966 trend a \"blessing\"Another enthusiast was Richard Liu, founder of the retail behemoth JD.com, who at one point railed against what he saw as the country's declining work ethic. \"Slackers are not my brothers!\", he wrote in a controversial email to staff in 2019.But such an attitude prompted a backlash, including a wave of online complaints that companies were ignoring labour laws and failing to pay overtime, while forcing employees to work excessive hours. By 2021 this chorus of disapproval had become too loud for the authorities to ignore – and prompted a legal crackdown.In China, 996 has not disappeared, but its advocates have generally been a lot quieter. A notable exception was Baidu's one-time head of public relations, Qu Jing, who posted a series of videos on social media in 2024, aggressively defending a hard-working culture. Her brusque dismissal of employees' wellbeing, with the comment \"I'm not your mother, I only care about results\" provoked outrage. She later apologised, but it ultimately cost Qu her job.Yet the culture still has fans elsewhere. Last year, Narayana Murthy, the founder of Indian software giant Infosys, spoke admiringly about China's use of 996. He remarked in a TV interview that \"no individual, no community, no country has ever come up without hard work\".The AI gold rushSo why has the US tech industry chosen to embrace the trend? A key factor appears to have been the headlong rush to develop ways of using AI.\"It's mainly AI companies,\" explains Adrian Kinnersley, who runs recruitment businesses in Europe and North America. \"It's those that have some funding from venture capitalists, that are in a race to develop their products and get them out to market before someone else beats them to it. That's led them into the idea that, if you work longer hours, you win the race.\"One of those AI start-ups is run by Magnus Müller, a young German-born entrepreneur. He co-founded Browser-Use, a business that is developing tools to help AI applications interact with web browsers. He lives in a \"hacker-house\", a shared living and workspace, where he and his colleagues continually swap ideas, and believes working long hours is just a fact of life.Magnus MüllerMagnus Müller lives in a \"hacker house\" - a shared home and workspace where he and his colleagues constantly exchange ideas\"I think it's hard, what we're trying to build. I think it's the problems we're trying to solve, giving AI these extra capabilities. It's super hard, and very competitive, and most often the returns come when you just immerse yourself very deeply into a problem… then suddenly fascinating things happen.\"Browser-Use currently has just seven staff, but it is recruiting more. Müller says he is looking for people with the same kind of mentality as himself. Anyone who wants to work a 40-hour week, he says, is unlikely to fit in.\"We really look for people who are just addicted, who love what they're doing\", he emphasises. \"It's like gaming, OK? It's like you're addicted to gaming… for us, it doesn't really feel like work. We just do what we love.\"Others disagree. Deedy Das is a partner at Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm which has a near 50-year record of investing in technology businesses. He thinks the most common mistake young entrepreneurs make is insisting their employees work 996-style hours.Deedy DasDeedy Das says working long hours does not mean staff are being productive or working efficiently\"I think the thing young founders get wrong is they view hours worked in and of itself as necessary and sufficient to think of themselves as productive. And that's where the fallacy lies\", he explains. \"Forcing your employees to come in, and hustle, is a downstream artefact of such a mindset.\"He thinks such an approach can alienate those with families, as well as experienced older workers who \"can actually work far less and achieve much more because they know what they're doing\". He adds that continual long hours will lead to long-term burnout.However, he concedes that for company founders themselves, with skin in the game and the potential to become very wealthy if their business succeeds, different rules apply.\"Frankly, I would be shocked if a founder wasn't working 70-80 hours per week. I can personally say… if I'm investing in an early-stage founder, if they're not working 70-80 hours a week, it's probably not a great investment.\"Academic and author on workplace culture, Tamara Myles, says hustle culture is unsustainable, especially if people feel compelled to be working at all times. But she concedes there are grey areas.More from InDepth\"The nuance here is that a lot of these tech companies that are living this 996 culture are actually not hiding it, they're advertising it. They're selling it as a badge of honour, almost,\" she says.But that doesn't mean everyone who agrees to work 996 actually wants to, she argues. \"You might be staying because the job market is tough right now, or you might be here for a visa, and you depend on it. So there might be power dynamics at play.\"Health risksYet those who do choose to burn the midnight oil could end up paying a heavy price.Concerns over the health impact of working long hours are certainly not new. In Japan, a country with a long-established hard-work culture, where so-called salarymen have notoriously supported the post-war economy with utter dedication to their employers, there is even a word for it: Karōshi.It means death through overwork, and refers principally to strokes and heart attacks suffered by people working very long hours. Karōjisatsu, meanwhile, refers to people taking or attempting to take their own lives due to workplace stress.Both are recognised in Japanese law, and families are in theory eligible for compensation from a government scheme, although in practice proving a death derives from overwork can be difficult.More broadly, analysis published in 2021 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) concluded that long working hours - defined as more than 55 hours per week - had led to 745,000 deaths worldwide from stroke and heart disease in 2016.It concluded that working 55 hours or more a week increased the risk of dying of heart disease by 17% compared to working 35-40 hours, and raised the risk of a stroke by 35%.The productivity thresholdThen, there's productivity - broadly speaking the amount that actually gets done for every hour worked. Studies have shown that as hours go up, productivity initially increases - but once a threshold is reached it starts to decline again as physical and mental exhaustion sets in. The 'sweet spot' is widely recognised to be around 40 hours per week.As one recent study put it: \"At around 40h per five-day work week, workers seem to be able to maintain productivity fairly well, but when individuals exceed this threshold and engage in longer work hours, their job performance gradually weakens because of increased fatigue and underprivileged health conditions.\"In other words, once this threshold is reached, the extra output from every hour worked starts to decline. Even so, there will always be a temptation for companies to employ fewer people and get them to work for longer. This is because each extra employee comes at a cost: they have to be recruited, trained if necessary, and paid.Getty ImagesOffice workers in the 1980s in Japan, where a culture of dedication to the employer has its own word, KarōshiBut research suggests this approach can backfire. According to Michigan State University, productivity can fall so sharply that \"an employee working 70 hours per week has almost no difference in output than an employee working 50 hours per week\".This isn't a new concept. A century ago, Henry Ford set an example that other major industrialists would follow, when he cut working hours for staff in his car factories and adopted a 40-hour, five-day week.100-hour weeksNevertheless, there are those who believe that British companies today could take a leaf out of the US tech sector's book.For example, the co-founder and former CEO of BrewDog, James Watt, posted a widely-shared video in which he said: \"I think the whole concept of work-life balance was invented by people who hate the work they do. So if you love what you do, you don't need work life balance, you need work-life integration.\"He subsequently pointed to a study by academics at King's College London that showed people in the UK are among the least likely to believe work should always come first. He said it showed the UK to be \"one of the world's least work-oriented countries\".In a BBC documentary in 2022, Watt himself was accused of inappropriate behaviour and abuse of power in the workplace. He apologised to anyone who felt uncomfortable because of his behaviour but hit out at \"false rumours and misinformation\". BrewDog's new chief executive James Taylor said last year the business is  \"well past\" its previous controversies.HBOHBO's TV drama Industry, written by two former investment bankers, highlights the tough work culture at some financial institutionsFor some in the UK, talk of 996 culture could feel rather familiar. Jobs at large corporate law firms here pay high salaries, but many demand long hours in return. According to a survey carried out last year by the website Legal Cheek, it is not uncommon for average working days to be 12 hours or more.Investment banking - the wheeling and dealing side of the financial industry, which looks after mergers, acquisitions and stock market launches - is also notorious for long hours. Industry sources suggest 65 to 70 hours a week are relatively common, and can extend up to 100 hours when a major deal is being finalised.'Working smarter'?Is it legal here? UK law, under the working time regulations, states that most employees should not have to work more than 48 hours a week on average. But people can choose to opt out and work longer if they choose. So provided the employee gives their consent, 996 is allowed.However Ben Wilmott, head of public policy at the human resources professionals' association CIPD, thinks it is wrong to believe that long hours lead to better performance.\"There doesn't seem to be any correlation at all between working long hours and productivity\", he says. \"There is quite good evidence which shows there's a risk of ill health if you work long hours… there's a higher risk of stroke and heart disease.\"So I think the focus should be on working smarter rather than longer… improving management capability, technology adoption, adoption of AI to improve productivity, rather than a focus on increasing working hours.\"Universal Images GroupSeeing exhausted 'salarymen' fast asleep on the Tokyo underground is not an uncommon sightSome campaigners believe the UK could actually benefit from a reduction in working hours, and the adoption of a four-day week.They point to the results of a pilot project carried out in 2022, in which 61 organisations agreed to cut working hours for all staff for six months without any reduction in pay.It concluded that this significantly reduced stress and illness in the workforce, and helped companies retain staff, without losing productivity.Recruitment expert Adrian Kinnersley believes the current enthusiasm for 996 remains largely confined to the technology sector, and for a good reason.\"Whether you need to work 80 hours a week is debatable, but I think you would struggle in the current environment to compete with a relaxed 35-hour week culture,\" he says.For Browser-Use founder Magnus Müller meanwhile, the hours he and his peers work in Silicon Valley are really nothing remarkable.\"I'm from a tiny village in south Germany\", he says. \"The farmers there, they get up at five every day and work more than 12 hours per day, seven days a week. And they don't take any holidays, or maybe just two to three days when they can get someone to take care of their cows.\"So I think there are so many industries where people have so much harder jobs, and struggle so much harder, and work so much harder. I would say it's more like kindergarten, what we are doing compared to them.\"Top image credit: Getty.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Team GB have sent 53 athletes to the Games with plenty of medal potential.Here is your guide to what is happening each day and who to look out for.All times GMT.Day three: Monday, 9 FebruaryMedals: FiveMedal events: Women's freestyle ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Men's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20); Women's speed skating 1000m (16:30-18:20); Men's ski jumping - normal hill (18:00-20:15); Women's snowboard big air (18:30-20:05).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)Newly crowned X Games champion Kirsty Muir, Team GB's youngest competitor at the last Winter Olympics, has reached the final for a second consecutive Games. The 21-year-old Scot returned from a torn ACL to win her first World Cup gold last year but would face high-class competition with the likes of reigning Olympic and world champion Mathilde Gremaud, China's superstar Eileen Gu and Italy's emerging 18-year-old talent Flora Tabanelli.Curling: Mixed doubles - semi-final (17:05-1900)Britain's former world champions Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds lost to Sweden at this stage four years ago, but have qualified for the final four in top spot, with eight wins and one defeat.Their opponents will be decided in the final round-robin matches on Monday morning.Victory would guarantee GB a first mixed doubles medal, but defeat would see them enter a bronze-medal match. Figure skating: Ice dance – rhythm dance (18:20-2200)Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson begin their campaign to win Britain's first figure skating medal since Dame Jayne Torvill and Sir Christopher Dean earned bronze in Lillehammer in 1994. The omens are good for the British pair – last year, they won GB's first figure skating World Championship medal in more than 40 years with bronze in Boston. Favourites are likely to be the USA's Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who have won the last three world titles. However, they will face a big challenge from new French pairing Guillaume Cizeron and Laurence Fournier Beaudry. Britain will also be represented by Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez.Snowboard: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)British teenager Mia Brookes will be hoping to land a big trick – and an Olympic medal – in this event, which involves breathtaking acrobatics and mind-boggling bravery as competitors launch themselves into the air from a huge ramp. Anna Gasser has won both previous Olympic big air titles and the 34-year-old Austrian is back for a crack at a hat-trick. Japan's quartet of talented riders will also be in the mix.Good to knowThe curling mixed doubles semi-finals take place at 17:05 – Britain's former world champions Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds lost to Sweden at this stage four years ago, and will be hoping to be in a position to make amends today.Alpine skiing slides into new territory with the debut of the men's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) and a Swiss clean sweep is not out of the question – their first, second and fourth-choice pairings took gold, silver and bronze at the 2025 World Championships in Austria.Day four: Tuesday, 10 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Mixed team short track relay (09:30-12:30); Men's and women's cross-country skiing sprint classic (08:15-12:50); Men's ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Women's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20), Men's biathlon 20km (12:30-14:30); Women's luge (16:00-18:50) Mixed doubles curling (17:05-19:25) Mixed team ski jumping (17:45-20:10).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)The USA's Alex Hall bids to retain his Olympic title. He will have extra motivation to do so in Italy as his mother comes from Bologna and he will have plenty of family in Livigno to cheer him on. Hall had to settle for bronze at last year's World Championships, won by Norway's Birk Ruud – who won Olympic big air gold at Beijing 2022.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hall spent a lot of time on European slopes during his childhoodAlpine skiing: Women's team combined (13:00) The women's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) makes its Olympic debut. Returning slalom legend Mikaela Shiffrin and USA downhill star Breezy Johnson won the maiden World Championship title in this event in early 2025 and will be the pair to beat here.Curling: Mixed doubles final (17:05-19:20)The mixed doubles is the only curling event in which Britain have never won a medal  – Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds will be hoping to be in a position to change that today. The pair were world champions in 2021 and runners-up last year but it's a tough field that includes reigning world and Olympic champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini, who are competing in front of their home crowd in Italy.Ice hockey: Women's preliminary round (19:10)The group A game between Canada and the USA is widely expected to be a dress rehearsal for next week's gold medal match given their dominance over the rest of the world. Six of the seven Olympic finals have been contested by the sides. Canada took gold in 2022 but the USA triumphed at last year's World Championship and have won the last six meetings.Good to knowMost athletes don't get the chance to compete in one home Olympics but short track skater Arianna Fontana is about to appear in two. She will compete at Milan-Cortina 20 years after making her debut as a 15-year-old in Turin. We should get our first glimpse of her in the women's 500m (09:30), where she is the two-time defending champion. She may also feature in the mixed team relay final (11:56) – another Olympic medal would be her 12th.Ilia Malinin starts his quest for Olympic gold in men's figure skating (17:30). The American has only just turned 21 but comes to these Games as a two-time world champion.The women's singles luge medals will be decided (17:34) – and the chances are that gold will go to Germany, who have won the last seven Olympic titles. Natalie Geisenberger, the winner of the last three and one of the most successful female Winter Olympians in history, has retired, paving the way for one of her compatriots, headed by reigning world champion Julia Taubitz.Day five: Wednesday, 11 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's moguls (10:00-14:15); Women's biathlon 15km (13:15-15:10); Men's speed skating 1000m (17:30-19:00); Luge doubles (16:30-19:40); Figure skating ice dance (18:30-22:15).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's super-G (10:30-12:50)Swiss speedster Marco Odermatt will be the man to beat if the 2025 season is anything to go by – the 28-year-old finished almost 300 points clear of his nearest rival Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria in the World Cup rankings and also claimed the World Championship title in February. Shocks do occur in this sport, however, like Ryan Cochran-Siegle's silver in Beijing four years ago. The American won't be a medal favourite in Milan but every time he's reached a World Cup podium it has been on Italian snow.Ice hockey: Men's preliminary round (15:40)  The opening game of the men's ice hockey is a high-profile clash between Finland and Slovakia, the 2022 gold and bronze medallists respectively. The return of NHL players to the Olympics for the first time since 2014 means team rosters will be stacked with world-class talent. Both sides will be vying to win Group B as that would mean they advance directly to the quarter-finals without having to contest an extra match in the play-off round.Luge: Men's & women's doubles (16:00)Officially, women's doubles is the only new luge event at these Olympics but technically men's doubles is one too, as it was previously open to both sexes, albeit it was always men who took part. The women's event might offer an opportunity for a rare non-German winner, with Austria's Selina Egle and Lara Kipp winning the last two world titles. In the men's doubles, Germany's Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win gold for a remarkable fourth consecutive Games. There are two runs in each event, with the women's second run at 17:53 and the men's second run at 18:44.Curling: Men's round robin (18:05-21:05)Britain's men, skipped by Bruce Mouat, had a phenomenal 2024-25 campaign, winning the world title and becoming the first rink ever to win four Grand Slam events in one season. Now they are targeting the Olympic title that has so far eluded them, although they came mightily close in 2022, losing to Sweden in the gold medal match. GB begin their campaign against China, who had to come through the last-chance qualifying competition in December.Figure skating: Ice dance – free dance (18:30-22:05)Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson have their eyes on the podium as the ice dance reaches its conclusion. Duos from the USA and France are likely to battle it out for gold and silver but Fear and Gibson, who won World Championship bronze last year, are hoping to become the first British figure skaters since Torvill and Dean in 1994 to earn an Olympic medal. Britain's Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez will also be competing.Good to knowUSA's Chloe Kim has overcome a recent injury to begin her quest for a third straight Olympic gold in the women's snowboard halfpipe, with qualification at 09:30.

Matt Weston dabbled with rugby and taekwondo before finding skeleton but could now become Britain's first male Olympic champion in the sport. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Weston was 15th on his Olympic debut in Beijing but has made huge progress sinceTwo-time reigning world champion Weston dominated at the World Cup this season, while team-mate Marcus Wyatt is also among the medal contenders at these Games.

Home hopes lie with all-rounder Sofia Goggia, while 34-year-old Swiss star Lara Gut-Behrami is seeking to retain her Olympic title before retiring from the sport. 2018 Olympic champion Ester Ledecka and returning legend Lindsey Vonn will be in the mix, as will newcomer Emma Aicher of Germany.Mexico's Sarah Schleper, soon to be 47, will be making all kinds of history as she competes in her seventh Winter Olympics. She'll be the oldest female alpine skier ever to compete at the Games, and the first woman to compete at three or more Winter Olympics for two different nations, having represented the USA from 1998 to 2010. Furthermore, her teenage son Lasse Federico Gaxiola has also been selected in alpine skiing, making them the first mother and son to compete at the same edition of an Olympic Winter Games.Snowboard: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)American Chloe Kim is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe. The 25-year-old American took two years off after winning gold in Beijing but picked up right where she left off on her return. She comes to Milan-Cortina as the reigning world champion and the favourite for gold, and says she's \"good to go\" despite dislocating her shoulder in early January.Short track: Women's 500m & men's 1000m (19:15-20:50)It could be a good day for hosts Italy. Veteran skater Arianna Fontana, competing in her sixth Olympics, is bidding for a third consecutive gold in the shortest of the short track distances. Anything can happen in the unpredictable sport of short track, which provided one of the all-time famous Winter Olympic moments when Australian Steven Bradbury took gold in the men's 1000m in 2002 after the other competitors wiped out. That final will also be held tonight and Italy have a live-wire contender in Pietro Sighel. Britain's Niall Treacy will be hoping to make an impression over his favoured distance.Good to knowWomen's curling gets under way, with Rebecca Morrison leading Great Britain's team, who start their campaign against China at 18:05.

Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno.Figure skating: Men – free skate (18:00-22:10)We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps.Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20)Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion?

The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian – Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 – so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held.

She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.Good to knowThe first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10).

The 38-year-old slalom specialist became the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold in 2022 and earlier this year he sealed the nation's best World Championship result by a male since 1934 by finishing sixth. However, he is not expected to reach the podium. Clement Noel of France is the defending Olympic champion, Switzerland's Loic Meillard the 2025 world champion and Henrik Kristoffersen is the most successful slalom skier ever produced by Norway, although Olympic gold has so far eluded him.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brookes first tried snowboarding aged only 18 monthsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Good to knowWomen's ice hockey reaches the semi-final stage (15:40 and 20:10).

The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Good to knowWomen's figure skating begins with the short programme (17:45). It should be an intriguing competition with the likes of three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto up against the returning Alysa Liu, who dethroned the Japanese skater at last year's World Championships, and her American team-mate, the rejuvenated Amber Glenn. Britain's Kristen Spours, who has overcome a serious back injury to make it to Milan, will also be competing.Curling round robin matches continue. Britain's women have a rest day, with the men up against Canada (18:05), the only country to have won the men's Olympic title more than once. However, the last time they earned gold was 2014.

Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.

Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m.Day 14: Friday, 20 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Good to knowIt's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05).Day 15: Saturday, 21 FebruaryMedals: 10Medal events: Men's team aerials (09:45-11:35); Men's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's cross-country 50km mass start (10:00-13:05); Mixed ski mountaineering relay (12:30-13:50); Women's biathlon 12.5km mass start (13:15-14:15); Men's and women's speed skating mass start (14:00-17:00); Women's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's two-woman bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's curling (1805-2135).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's ski cross final (09:00-12:35)Beijing champion Ryan Regez suffered a torn ACL followed by a loss of form but his world title win last year shows he is now back to his best. His biggest threat could be Canada's Reece Howden, who has won the World Cup title in both of the past two years.Bobsleigh: Two-woman heats three and four (18:00 & 20:03)Germany's Laura Nolte won this event in 2022 aged 23, becoming the youngest female pilot to take gold. Since then, she and brakewoman Deborah Levi have been a model of consistency on the World Cup circuit. The USA's Kaillie Humphries won this event in 2010 and 2014 and could run Nolte close.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Atkin was ninth in the event at Beijing 2022Curling: Men's gold-medal game (18:05-21:20)Britain's Team Mouat will be hoping to be involved as the men's curling reaches its conclusion. The quartet who competed in the 2022 final are all back in Milan-Cortina and determined to upgrade the silver they took home last time to gold, which would be Britain's first in Olympic men's curling since 1924. The bronze medal game in the women's curling starts at 13:05 GMT.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Can Britain's Zoe Atkin dethrone China's Eileen Gu as the Olympic champion? The US-born 21-year-old is the reigning world champion but will be up against a stacked field, likely to also include Li Fanghui, her biggest rival last season and the skier with whom she shared the overall 2024-25 World Cup title.Good to knowAs well as the conclusion of the two-woman event, the opening two heats of the four-man bobsleigh take place (09:00 and 10:57). Germany – particularly pilot Francesco Friedrich – have monopolised major titles in recent years but the British crew driven by Brad Hall also have podium aspirations.The most gruelling event in the Winter Olympics is cross country skiing's 50km mass start (10:00). The men's medals will be decided on Saturday and current world champion Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the red hot favourite. Team GB's Andrew Musgrave is competing in his fifth Winter Olympics.Day 16: Sunday, 22 FebruaryMedals: FourMedal events: Men's four-man bobsleigh (09:00-12:20); Women's cross-country 50km mass start (09:00-12:35); Women's curling (12:05-13:35); Men's ice hockey (12:40-15:40)Daily highlightsBobsleigh: Four-man heats three and four (09:00 & 11:12)History beckons for German great Francesco Friedrich on the final day of the Games. The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in BeijingCurling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.Good to knowWith all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held.Related topicsShort Track SkatingCurlingLugeSpeed SkatingWinter SportsNordic CombinedIce HockeyAlpine SkiingCross-Country SkiingBobsleighBiathlonSkeletonSnowboardingWinter OlympicsSki JumpingFreestyle SkiingFigure Skating",

    "body": "6 hours agoAlicia CurryGetty ImagesA new clearing-style system will be introduced to match young people who miss out on an apprenticeship with alternative placements, the government has said.Similar to university and college clearing - a process which matches students with institutions that have unfilled places - the online platform will provide information about available roles in their chosen area of interest.Ministers hope the pilot scheme will make apprenticeships easier to navigate and more appealing to young people weighing up their options. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said \"outdated assumptions about how to make it into a successful career\" have held young people back.He added: \"We're unlocking opportunities for young people across the country by making it easier and faster to get the skills that matter, so more young people can build a secure life for themselves.\"Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the scheme - being tested out this year - would \"give those who miss out on their top-choice apprenticeship a second chance by matching them with another opportunity in their area\".The new system, to be run in partnership with employers and mayoral strategic authorities, will also inform young people about potential earnings in the roles and long-term career prospects. It is part of government reforms aimed at delivering 50,000 more apprenticeships for young people, backed by £725m of funding.Ministers said the measures will play an integral role towards the government's ambition to get two-thirds of young people into higher-level learning or apprenticeships.A number of new placements will be announced by companies across the UK in National Apprenticeship Week, which starts on Monday.Among them is energy firm Centrica which has said it will create 500 new apprenticeships in 2026 as part of a two-year programme.

    "body": "5 hours agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterGetty ImagesSenior university leaders previously attended a briefing with MI5 to discuss what interference might look like on campusesUniversity bosses have been told by ministers to report threats of foreign interference directly to the government and security services.Skills Minister Jacqui Smith said UK universities had become \"a prime target for foreign states and hostile actors\".She said the government did \"not take this lightly\" and would spend £3m on measures including a new secure platform for vice-chancellors and designated security leaders at universities to report suspicious approaches or interference.It comes after senior leaders at 70 universities attended a briefing with MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum to discuss what interference might look like, such as censoring research and intimidating staff.The UK-China Transparency (UKCT) think tank said its survey of China studies academics had found reports of Chinese government officials warning lecturers to avoid discussing certain topics in their classes.Some academics also reported intimidation by visiting scholars or other Chinese officials, as well as by staff at Confucius Institutes.These institutes are partnership organisations linking Chinese and UK universities with a Chinese government agency which provides funding.They promote Chinese culture and language on UK campuses, but have been criticised over alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.The Chinese embassy in London at the time called the UKCT report's findings \"groundless and absurd\", adding that China respects freedom of speech in the UK and elsewhere.Laura Murphy, a professor of human rights and contemporary slavery, said at the time that the university had \"negotiated directly with a foreign intelligence service to trade my academic freedom for access to the Chinese student market\".Sheffield Hallam apologised to Murphy. The Chinese embassy criticised some of the university's work on Xinjiang as being \"seriously flawed\".Following the UK government's latest intervention urging universities to report any foreign interference, higher education regulator the Office for Students said it would work with the sector to address \"significant and growing threats\".Arif Ahmed, the regulator's director for freedom of speech, said: \"We've always been clear that universities must resist external state threats to academic freedom, and that suppression of research because of the disapproval of a foreign government is unacceptable in practically any circumstances.\"Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities, welcomed the idea of a single point of contact for reports, saying this would \"empower institutions to report and take action more swiftly and confidently, knowing there is support in place\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesTwo identical twins on trial for murder in France have confounded attempts to determine which one pulled the trigger because they have the same DNA, French media report.The 33-year-old brothers are among five defendants on trial near Paris, accused of a double murder and several subsequent attempted killings in 2020, according to reputable French newspaper Le Parisien.It reports that both are suspected of conspiring to plot the double murder, but that DNA on an assault rifle used in one of the later gun battles could only be from one twin.A police officer told the court that forensic experts were unable to tell which of the brothers had been conclusively implicated.\"Only their mother can tell them apart,\" one investigator is quoted as telling the court in Bobigny, north of the French capital.There is reportedly a tense atmosphere in the court where the trial is taking place. On Tuesday, both twins were said to have been expelled from the courtroom for refusing to stand up.Police believe they have taken advantage of their resemblance to cover their tracks. A senior officer quoted by Le Parisien said the pair frequently exchanged clothes, phones and identification documents.Identical twins develop from a single fertilised egg that splits during pregnancy. Because they originate from the same egg and sperm, they share exactly the same DNA, making forensic identification extremely difficult.With genetic data unable to distinguish between them, investigators relied on phone records, surveillance footage, wiretaps and efforts to corroborate their whereabouts and movements, according to Le Parisien.But the crucial question of who fired the recovered weapon remains an open one. The trial continues, with court due to reach a decision in late February.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCMonday's papers are dominated by news of the resignation of the prime minister's chief of staff. Morgan McSweeney said he did not oversee the vetting process for Lord Mandelson but wanted to take \"full responsibility\" for advising Sir Keir Starmer to appoint him, despite the peer's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein being publicly known about at the time. The Times says Sir Keir has \"sacrificed his closest political ally\" to \"appease Labour MPs and save his premiership\". The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.McSweeney's resignation comes after police launched an investigation into Lord Mandelson over alleged misconduct in a public office. Emails released as part of the Epstein files suggest the peer leaked sensitive government information to Epstein whilst a minister in the last Labour government. The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. The Daily Telegraph writes that Sir Keir will \"try to draw a line under the scandal\" by meeting Labour MPs on Monday. But columnist Tim Stanley warns that the PM \"must realise the scandal is all on him\".\"Blame me\" is the Daily Mirror's headline, referring to McSweeney's statement. But the paper notes that this is a \"Labour leadership crisis\", with pressure still on the prime minister despite his top aide's resignation. McSweeney had been \"widely credited with propelling the PM into Downing Street\" but was also a \"divisive figure among backbench MPs\", the Mirror says.Metro describes the prime minister as \"weakened\", reporting that his allies \"fear fresh challenges\" to his leadership.The Independent credits McSweeney with having \"masterminded\" Labour's 2024 general election victory. His resignation \"leaves the PM without his strategic right-hand man\" and is being perceived as a \"damage limitation exercise to protect the prime minister\", it says.\"Operation save Starmer\" is the i newspaper's take, writing that McSweeney was \"forced out to buy PM time\".\"So how long can Starmer cling on?\" asks the Daily Mail. The paper carries comments from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who accused the prime minister on social media of \"never\" taking responsibility for his \"terrible decisions\".The Daily Express asks whether Sir Keir's days are numbered, ahead of his expected \"showdown\" with Labour MPs on Monday.The Guardian also carries the story on its front page. In other political news, the paper reports that Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has been accused of \"pulling up the drawbridge\" on refugees from Labour peer Lord Dubs. Mahmood says more safe and legal routes for refugees will be opened once order and control have been restored to the UK borders, the paper writes.The Sun describes Sir Keir's premiership as \"in freefall\". But its lead story is on reports Andrew Mounbatten-Windsor shared confidential information with Epstein from his official work as trade envoy in 2010 and 2011. The former head of royal protection tells the paper \"if he has divulged information of national importance, that must be investigated as a criminal act.\" Andrew has been contacted for comment by the BBC but is yet to respond.The Financial Times describes McSweeney as a \"political protégé of Mandelson's\" and says the prime minister is \"looking isolated and vulnerable\".And the Daily Star heralds \"Madge's material goals\", as singer Madonna graced the touchline of her daughters' game for Tottenham's academy.

    "body": "7 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterGetty ImagesMorgan McSweeney has dramatically quit as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, after mounting scrutiny over his role in Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US.The PM's adviser had been coming under pressure after pushing for the former minister to be given the job, despite the peer's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein being publicly known about at the time.McSweeney said he did not oversee the vetting but wanted to take \"full responsibility\" for advising the prime minister to appoint him.It leaves Sir Keir battling to shore up his premiership as he continues to face anger from Labour MPs over his decision to hire the peer for the Washington role.Sir Keir sacked Lord Mandelson in September, after emails emerged showing he sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced charges for sex offences.But further revelations this week from the latest release of Epstein files in the US about his continued contact with the late disgraced financier after his conviction in 2008 have led to fresh fury within Labour over the decision to hand him the role.Emails suggesting the peer leaked sensitive government information to Epstein whilst a minister in the last Labour government have also prompted a police investigation into alleged misconduct in public office.Sir Keir has said Lord Mandelson's prior relationship was Epstein was flagged when he was vetted for the role, whilst insisting the former cabinet minister misled him about the depth of the relationship.But it has failed to contain the row over the decision, with a handful of Labour MPs now openly calling for Sir Keir to resign as party leader.York Central MP Rachael Maskell told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that the prime minister has a \"very tight timetable... to prove that he has got it in him to lead us forward\".Alloa and Grangemouth MP Brian Leishman called on Sir Keir to \"look at his own position\" and question whether he should \"resign for the good of the country and the Labour Party\".But others have thrown their support behind him.Karl Turner, Kingston upon Hull East MP, told BBC Radio 5 Live Sir Keir knew it was \"a catastrophic mistake\" to appoint Lord Mandelson and \"he wants to make good\". Rugby's MP John Slinger called for his party to \"rally behind the prime minister\", adding: \"We don't ditch a leader just because the going gets tough.\"Sir Keir will address Labour MPs in private on Monday evening, at the weekly Parliamentary Labour Party meeting, as he seeks to convince his backbenchers he can regain control.It was earlier suggested that he might publicly address the episode on Monday but this is not thought to be the case at this stage.It comes as the boss of the Fire Brigades Union, Steve Wright, became the first leader of one of Labour's 11 affiliated unions to call for the prime minister to go.McSweeney's departure is a big blow to Sir Keir, with the 48-year-old Irishman having masterminded his successful bid for the Labour leadership in 2020 and the party's campaign for the general election in 2024.His deputies Jill Cuthbertson and Vidhya Alakeson have been appointed acting chiefs of staff in the wake of his exit, Downing Street has confirmed.'Only honourable course'In a statement on Sunday, McSweeney said Lord Mandelson's appointment in December 2024 had been \"wrong\", adding he had \"damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself.\"\"When asked, I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice,\" he added.\"While I did not oversee the due diligence and vetting process, I believe that process must now be fundamentally overhauled.\"In the circumstances, the only honourable course is to step aside.\"It is understood that both the prime minister and McSweeney decided now was the right moment for him to leave. Sir Keir said it had been an \"honour\" to work with him, thanking him for \"turning our party around\" in the wake of its crushing defeat in the 2019 election. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said it was \"about time\" McSweeney resigned, but added the prime minister \"has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions\". The Lib Dems said Sir Keir \"can change his advisers all he likes, but the buck stops with him\", while Reform said Labour was \"just continuing the chaos we saw under the Tories\".Pay-off pleaThe statement from McSweeney came just hours after a key Starmer ally had dismissed calls from within Labour for Sir Keir to sack his adviser.Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden told Laura Kuenssberg it would not make \"any difference at all\" to the situation facing the government.He also called on Lord Mandelson to return or donate to charity the pay-off he received after his sacking as ambassador, thought to be up to £40,000.The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.Email exchanges in the latest US government release on Epstein include several from Lord Mandelson during his time as a cabinet minister in the Labour government of Gordon Brown.Among them is one that indicates Lord Mandelson gave Epstein advance notice of a €500bn bailout by the EU to save the Euro in 2010.Another suggests he forwarded the financier an internal No 10 memo in 2009 discussing potential government asset sales in the wake of the financial crash.Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. He has resigned as a member of the House of Lords, with the government pledging to introduce legislation required to strip him of his title. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesTrain drivers in Spain are due to begin a three-day nationwide strike on Monday in protest of what they say is a lack of safety guarantees on the country's rail system.The action follows two fatal train crashes in January, one in Adamuz in the country's southern region which killed 46 people, and the second just two days later near Barcelona where a train driver died and dozens were injured.The accidents have caused severe disruption for travellers and cast doubt on Spain's much-vaunted rail system.Semaf, the train drivers' union, are demanding the hiring of more staff and increased investment and maintenance in what it has described as \"the constant deterioration of the rail network\".Following the two collisions, subsequent safety checks also revealed faults and maintenance issues on a number of routes.Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is due to be grilled in parliament later this week about the failures in the rail system.A preliminary report by rail accident investigation commission CIAF has found that grooves found on the wheels of the derailed train and three earlier trains suggests that a fracture in the track occurred before the train went over it.Rail officials believe the wall collapsed as the train was passing, striking the driver's cab first and then causing considerable damage to the first carriage of the train in which most of the injured passengers were travelling.Semaf has previously said the collisions represent \"a turning point in demanding that all necessary actions be taken to guarantee the safety of railway operations\".The amount of investment the rail network receives has come under particular scrutiny. The Socialist-led government has sought to dismiss such queries, pointing out that €700m (£605m) has been invested in updating the Madrid-Andalusia line in recent years, with the stretch of track where the accident took place included in that renovation.\"We're not looking at a problem of lack of maintenance, we're not looking at a problem of obsolete [infrastructure], and we're not looking at a problem of lack of investment,\" said Transport Minister Óscar Puente.",

    "body": "12 hours agoAndy VerityGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have knowingly shared confidential information with Jeffrey Epstein from his official work as trade envoy in 2010 and 2011, according to material in the latest release of files in the US seen by the BBC.Emails from the recently-released batch of Epstein files show the former prince passing on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam and confidential details of investment opportunities.Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.The former Duke of York, who served as trade envoy between 2001 and 2011, has been contacted for comment but is yet to respond.Andrew has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct.The emails indicate that on 7 October 2010, Andrew sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong, where he was accompanied by business associates of Epstein.After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then-special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.US Department of JusticeAndrew told BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he last saw Epstein in New York in early December 2010 to tell the disgraced financier he was breaking off the friendship.However, on Christmas Eve that year, he emailed Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money.Sir Vince Cable, who was then business secretary, said: \"I was unaware of Andrew... sharing information about investment opportunities [in Afghanistan] before, this is the first I've heard of it.\"In a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew suggests Epstein might invest in a private equity firm he visited a week before.Official terms of reference for trade envoys state that they \"are not civil servants\", adding: \"However, the role of a Trade Envoy carries with it a duty of confidentiality in relation to information received. This may include sensitive, commercial, or political information shared about relevant markets/visits.\"This duty of confidentiality will continue to apply after the expiry of their term of office. In addition, the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1989 will apply.\"Andrew has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein.Buckingham Palace had announced in October that he would be moving from Royal Lodge, at the same time his title of prince was removed.The former prince left the property on Monday night and is currently living at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate while his new permanent home undergoes renovations.",

    "body": "10 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandSimon AtkinsonBBCMany of the victims had moved to New Zealand to work or study, and some were refugees who thought they had found safetyA white supremacist who killed 51 people at two New Zealand mosques will appear in court this week to try to withdraw his guilty plea.Australian Brenton Tarrant is serving a life sentence with no parole after admitting to murdering the 51 people and attempting to murder another 40 in the March 2019 attack on worshippers during Friday prayers in Christchurch.He initially denied the charges, but changed his plea a year after the attack.The 35-year-old, who also admitted one count of terrorism, has now launched an appeal, filed out of time, arguing he was incapable of making rational decisions at the time because of \"torturous and inhumane\" conditions in prison. He also wants to appeal against his sentence. The hearing at New Zealand's Court of Appeal in Wellington is scheduled to run all week, with Tarrant expected to give evidence via video link.The massacre at Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre - parts of which were live-streamed - led to stricter gun laws in New Zealand.'He wants to open traumas again'Victims and family members will be able to watch the hearing via a delayed broadcast.Among those planning to attend is Aya al-Umari, who lost her older brother Hussein in the attack on Al Noor mosque.\"I very distinctly remember that I left court after the sentencing thinking 'Right, the trauma chapter is now closed, time to heal, time to focus on your own mental well-being', but then it pops up again and again,\" al-Umari told the BBC.She said she was preparing for a tough week, seeing the man who murdered her brother on screen.\"It will be just an image that I am looking at, because he means absolutely nothing to me at this stage.\"I suspect one of his main motivations to do this is to open up traumas again and I won't let him succeed in doing that - he just wants his limelight and to be relevant again.\"Hussein al-Umari was awarded a New Zealand Bravery Star, for standing up to Tarrant.\"He took the right of life of my brother and 50 others, and then we're going to sit through now and talk about the legal arguments of his right to appeal,\" al-Umari  said. \"When you place those two together, they are morally not comparable.\"Family handoutAya al-Umari and her brother HusseinAt the time of the sentencing in August 2020, then Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern said life imprisonment without parole meant Tarrant would have \"no notoriety, no platform... and we have no cause to think about him, to see him or to hear from him again\".If the three appeal court judges decide he can withdraw his guilty plea, the case would potentially go to trial on all charges.If he is not allowed to retract his plea, there will be another hearing later in the year to consider his appeal against his sentence.Tarrant was born in New South Wales, Australia, but moved to New Zealand in 2017 - which, prosecutors said, was when he started planning his attacks against the Muslim community.He was active on fringe online forums and before the attack, he had posted a 74-page \"manifesto\" online.The massacre prompted New Zealand to pass stricter gun laws and buy back certain types of weapons from owners.Within a month of the shootings, the country's parliament had voted overwhelmingly to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms.The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme.",

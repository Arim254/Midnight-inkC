    "body": "29 minutes agoNick Eardley,Political Correspondent and Sima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondentAt least four prisoners released in error are still at large, the BBC has been told.These are among 262 prisoners in England and Wales mistakenly released in the year to March - up from 115 the previous year.The new information comes as the government is under increasing pressure after a number of high-profile cases of prisoners being wrongly released.An Algerian sex offender who was mistakenly released from prison was arrested by police on Friday.Brahim Kaddour-Cherif was one of two men separately released by mistake from the prison in the same week. Both are now back in custody, after William Smith handed himself in on Thursday.Their releases came after migrant sex offender Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford in Essex late last month.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"The vast majority of offenders released by mistake are quickly brought back to prison, and we will do everything we can to work with the police to capture the few still in the community.\"But there has been widespread criticism of the government's handling of the issue.The unaccounted prisoners reveal \"the incompetence of this government\", shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said.\"It shouldn't be left to reporters to uncover the facts. [Justice Secretary] David Lammy must finally come clean about how many prisoners have been accidentally released and how many are still at large.\"A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said \"every resource\" must go into finding the prisoners. \"This is a disgrace and an omnishambles. It shouldn't have to take the media to inform the public that prisoners are at large after accidental release,\" Jess Brown-Fuller said.In a statement, Lammy said: \"We inherited a prison system in crisis and I'm appalled at the rate of releases in error this is causing.\"I'm determined to grip this problem, but there is a mountain to climb which cannot be done overnight.\"That is why I have ordered new tough release checks, commissioned an independent investigation into systemic failures, and begun overhauling archaic paper-based systems still used in some prisons.\"In addition to the four mistakenly released, it has emerged another man is also at large after absconding from an open prison. Ola Abimbola, who is serving a 21-year sentence for offences including kidnap, GBH and possession of an offensive weapon in public, was moved to open conditions in September and absconded from HMP Ford on 10 October. The Ministry of Justice said: \"The small number of offenders eligible for moves to open prison face a strict, thorough risk assessment and anyone found breaching the rules can be immediately returned to a closed prison.\"Sussex Police said it was working to locate Abimbola, who was jailed in December 2018.People absconding from open prison is a separate issue to mistaken release.  Ministry of Justice and HM Prison and Probation Service data shows that in the 12 months to March 2025, 57 prisoners absconded from prisons in England and Wales - but that figure has been decreasing since 2020, when 143 people had absconded.The revelation that four prisoners are still at large after being wrongly released came just hours after Kaddour-Cherif was arrested.The Algerian national was spotted by a member of the public in the Finsbury Park area of London just on Friday morning.He was convicted of indecent exposure in November 2024, relating to an incident in March of that year.He was given an 18-month community order and placed on the sex offenders' register for five years.He had been let out of HMP Wandsworth in south London on 29 October, though police said they were not told until Tuesday.Kaddour-Cherif is understood to have entered the UK legally on a visitor's visa in 2019, but overstayed that and was in the initial stages of the deportation process.He was released the day after being found not guilty of breaching the sex offenders' register's requirements - but he was still facing other charges and should have remained in custody.The prison officers' representatives said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold him, and he was let go.It followed a series of prosecutions and court appearances dating back two years.William Smith, the second man released from HMP Wandsworth in the past week, handed himself back in on Thursday. He had been let go on Monday having been sentenced to prison earlier that day.Prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years. The population has continued to balloon, with the number of staff not keeping pace with the number of inmates.Only a hundred or so places were available in male prisons last summer. This triggered the government's emergency release scheme - where some inmates would be freed after serving 40% of their fixed term sentence, rather than the usual 50%. It was implemented to reduce overcrowding and already almost 40,000 inmates have been let out under the scheme.But this has also had repercussions on the number of mistaken releases.The government has pledged to build more prisons to ease overcrowding, with projections showing the prison population will continue to grow but this will take time.Additional reporting by George Wright",

    "body": "American delivery firms UPS and FedEx have temporarily grounded part of their fleets of cargo planes after a mid-take-off crash in Kentucky on Tuesday left at least 14 people dead.The UPS aircraft burst into flames shortly after take-off when it collided with neighbouring business premises, triggering a huge fire which gutted several buildings and closed Louisville International Airport.UPS said the decision to ground MD-11 models followed instructions from manufacturer Boeing, while rival delivery giant FedEx confirmed it would follow suit.Officials are yet to determine what caused the deadly crash.Hours before the fleet was grounded, officials confirmed that the death toll had risen to 14 after another body was found, with buildings caught up in the fire still being searched for more victims.\"We pray for each of the victims' families and pray that no additional victims are lost,\" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. In a statement, UPS said the decision to ground 9% of its fleet was out of an \"abundance of caution\".Boeing later said in a statement to Reuters that it recommended UPS and FedEx suspend use of the MD-11 plane.\"This recommendation was made in an abundance of caution and we will continue coordinating with the FAA on this matter,\" a Boeing spokesperson said.It is unclear to what extent delivery services will be impacted by the moves from UPS and FedEx, which are the world's largest cargo carriers.FedEx said it operated 28 MD-11s and Reuters quoted a UPS factsheet that said the firm had 27 in its fleet before the Kentucky crash.UPS said contingency plans were in place to continue service. A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"The model of aircraft involved in the crash was a MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000, while passenger service officially ended in 2014.According to the National Transportation and Safety Board, the left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take-off.The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a long flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMallory MoenchHostages and Missing Families ForumThe body has been identified as Lior RudaeffThe Israeli military says it has identified a body handed over from Gaza as that of Israeli-Argentinian Lior Rudaeff.The 61-year-old was killed while attempting to defend Nir Yitzhak kibbutz during the Hamas attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 and his body was taken to Gaza by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) armed group, the military said.PIJ said the body was found on Friday in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages and 23 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a ceasefire deal that started on 10 October. Four of the five dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis and one is Thai.Israel has criticised Hamas for not yet returning all the bodies. Hamas says it is hard to find them under rubble.PIJ is an armed group allied with Hamas. It took part in the 7 October attack and previously held some Israeli hostages. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a campaign group, welcomed the return.\"Lior's return provides some measure of comfort to a family that has lived with agonising uncertainty and doubt for over two years,\" it said in a statement. \"We will not rest until the last hostage is brought home.\"During the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel has also handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.MOHAMMED SABER/EPA/ShutterstockHamas's military wing stood guard as they searched for hostage bodies on 5 November The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel launched air strikes after accusing Hamas fighters of killing two of its soldiers on 19 October and of killing another soldier on 28 October. Hamas said it was unaware of clashes in the area of the first incident and had no connection to the second attack.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were abducted in the attack.At least 68,875 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, the health ministry reported.",

    "body": "7 hours agoGary O'Donoghue,Chief North America Correspondent, Washington and Rachel HaganDonald Trump has exempted Hungary from sanctions over its continued purchases of Russian oil and gas for one year, a White House official has confirmed to BBC News.Earlier, the US president said he would consider an opt-out for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a close Trump ally who has maintained good relations with Russia throughout the Ukraine war.Speaking on Friday during Orban's visit to the White House, Trump said an exemption was under consideration because \"it's very difficult for him [Orban] to get the oil and gas from other areas\". It comes after the US effectively blacklisted two of Russia's largest oil companies last month, threatening sanctions on those who buy from them.Following the meeting, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó wrote on X that the US had given Budapest \"a full and unlimited exemption from sanctions on oil and gas\". An official later told the BBC that that exemption was time-limited to one year.This decision by Trump marks a major victory for Orban, who had said the sanctions would ruin his country's economy. During the public part of the meeting, Trump sounded sympathetic to Hungary's position as a landlocked country, dependent on oil and gas from Russia, but stopped short of giving a specific guarantee. But subsequently it became clear that the US president had granted an exemption for one year - seemingly flying in the face of his determination just two weeks ago to penalise anyone who did business with Russia's energy companies. Hungary has agreed to buy several hundred millions of dollars of US natural gas as part of the arrangement, but it is a deal likely to go down badly in many European capitals, most of whom have long opposed Hungary's friendly stance towards Moscow. Orban has long been a close personal and political ally of the president, echoing much of Donald Trump's populist right wing rhetoric over immigration and social issues. That loyalty seems to have earned the Hungarian prime minister some special treatment at a time when he is facing difficult elections in the spring.Trump added that while Hungary faced unique logistical challenges, including access to a sea that could be used to drill oil, he was \"very disturbed\" by other European countries that, he said, continued to buy Russian commodities despite not being landlocked.Orban, who has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine, has defended his energy ties with Russia, saying on Friday that pipelines are neither \"ideological\" nor \"political\", but a \"physical reality\" due to the lack of ports.He has been using his country's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas as a means to maintain his good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform upon which he hopes to win re-election next April in Hungary. He has promised \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.Trump and Orban also discussed the war in Ukraine on Friday - their first formal meeting since Trump returned to power - including the possibility of holding talks with Putin.\"He [Orban] understands Putin and knows him very well... I think that Viktor feels we're going to get that war ended in the not-too-distant future\", Trump said.The Hungarian leader, meanwhile, claimed that only their two nations truly wanted peace in Ukraine. \"All the other governments prefer to continue the war because many of them think that Ukraine can win on the front line, which is a misunderstanding of the situation.\"Trump asked him: \"So you would say that Ukraine cannot win that war?\" To which Orban replied: \"You know, a miracle can happen.\"Aside from the issue of oil and gas sanctions, Hungary's export-driven car industry has been hit by Trump's tariffs on European goods, adding to an already weak economy. Despite frequent clashes with EU leaders over migration, democracy, and the rule of law, Trump urged Europe to \"respect this leader very, very strongly because he's been right on immigration.\"With additional reporting by Nick Thorpe",

Orban wants to keep buying it, but Trump wants countries to wean themselves off Russian energy and help put the brakes on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Will Trump choose to keep an old friend close, or put pressure on Putin? We speak to Nick Thorpe, the BBC’s correspondent in Budapest, who has covered Orban since the 1980s. \nProducer: Viv Jones \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nMix: Travis Evans  \nPhoto: U.S. President Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

    "body": "10 hours agoNoor Nanji & Emma SaundersCulture reportersBBCCat Burns, Joe Marler and Nick Mohammed have had their profiles boosted by the showSpoiler warning: This article reveals details from The Celebrity TraitorsBy now, you’ll probably know who’s won The Celebrity Traitors.But some of the other contestants could end up being the real winners from the hit TV series.Cat Burns, Joe Marler and Nick Mohammed have been widely tipped by industry experts as the names most likely to see the biggest career boost thanks to their appearance on the show.Compared with the likes of Sir Stephen Fry and Celia Imrie, they were relatively less well known when entering the castle.But all three have been \"magnificently entertaining\", and could find themselves facing a string of lucrative offers, TV reporter Siobhan Synnot tells BBC News.We've been looking at who the breakout stars of the series are - and what might lie ahead for them.Cat BurnsThe singer-songwriter, 25, sailed all the way to the final, her cool-as-a-cucumber persona making her a traitor to be reckoned with.Burns first got everyone talking during an early task involving a general knowledge quiz, in which she confessed she didn't know who Dame Judi Dench or Dame Helen Mirren were (although she later said she would have recognised their faces).Celebrity Traitors fans have enjoyed her quick thinking and acting ability, and she managed to slip under the radar for most of the game.In Thursday night's nail-biting finale, her luck ran out - as she was banished at the roundtable despite making a pinky promise with fellow traitor Alan Carr, who went on to win.But this is far from the last we've seen of Burns.Her second album, How To Be Human, has just entered the charts at number five - our colleague, music correspondent Mark Savage, said it showed a softer side to the Traitors star.She's all over social media (what are we supposed to do without those epic cloaked Cat-Alan videos now the show is over?)And last weekend, she even made a special performance on another prime-time BBC One show, Sunday night's Strictly results show.Culture journalist Natalie Jamieson says she hopes Burns can do \"whatever she wants next\".\"She's a brilliant singer-songwriter already, and no doubt has her own ambitions and career plans - but I'd bet there's still a degree of her being seen by some as 'just' a musician.\"None of us are just one thing, and if her success on Celebrity Traitors broadens the minds of any industry gatekeepers to open doors or create unexpected opportunities, or just ask if she wants to be in the room where something is happening, then Cat can choose if that's what she wants.\"Joe MarlerThe former rugby union star, 35, has won over a whole new audience beyond sport thanks to his bromance with comedian Joe Wilkinson, his super-sleuthing, balletic bridge balancing and all-round wit.Speaking about his faithful nemesis on Traitors Uncloaked, traitor Jonathan Ross said of Marler: \"I think this show will do him a lot of good because people will see just how funny he is and how smart he is and how likeable he is.\"And that was always there, but it was hidden behind that gruff man mountain exterior.\"Along with Wilkinson, Marler was the architect of the epic Big Dog theory involving Ross and Fry.And rather than fly under the radar, Marler took the risk of spouting his theories openly, and was arguably the most bullish at the roundtables, even managing to ruffle Carr's feathers.\"Joe Marler has undoubtedly become a breakout star of the show due to his authentic personality and deadpan humour,\" says entertainment reporter Indigo Stafford.\"He also seems to be one of the only faithfuls this season to actually have had a clue who the traitors might be, yet he cleverly managed to conceal how much of a threat he is to them in order to not get eliminated [until the very end].\"I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a huge career boost for him after he left the show.\"Marler signed up with talent agency M+C Saatchi earlier this year, and there are already rumours that he is set for more mainstream TV opportunities, which Stafford says would \"make sense\".\"Having retired from his impressive England rugby career, he will be looking to move on to the next big thing - the world of showbiz,\" she said.Meanwhile TV reporter Siobhan Synnot thinks Marler could be heading for next year's Strictly. We can see him doing the Viennese Waltz already.Nick MohammedThe comedian and actor has hugely grown his fan base during his appearance on Celebrity Traitors.He'd already starred in hit TV shows like Ted Lasso and Slow Horses, but despite that, not everyone knew who he was before the show.While big personalities like Carr and Ross may have immediately stolen the limelight, Nick has gained a cult following due to his whip-smart - and often, spot on - theories, his cool, calm demeanour, and the way he powered through the tasks like a man possessed.He attracted attention early on when helping Imrie secure the final shield in the first mission, protecting her from murder by digging up her grave.But it was his incredibly speedy puzzle skills in the Trojan Horse challenge that really caught the eye.\"Celebrity Traitors has introduced him to a whole new audience that are obsessed with his sharp observations and intelligent gameplay. Moving forward, I could totally imagine Nick hosting a new game show,\" says Stafford.Synnot agrees: \"Nick and his gift for unravelling puzzles may find himself inundated with quiz host offers.\"And what's in store for the others...Burns, Marler and Mohammed aren't the only ones who will see a huge boost from their time on the show.Since his spectacular win on Thursday, social media has blown up with speculation that Carr could be the next host of Strictly Come Dancing.The BBC has not commented. But just imagine that. Winning Celebrity Traitors, then landing one of the most coveted roles on British television.Synnot, for her part, suspects he could end up going in a more unexpected direction.\"Sweaty Alan Carr is a cert for Sure adverts,\" she says. If you know, you know.And what for Imrie, the beloved veteran actress who stole the show with her nervous fart in episode three?\"Maybe Pepto Bismol can make a deal for her,\" jokes Synnot.You heard it here first.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMadeline Halpert and Christal HayesNobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, has died aged 97. In one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 20th Century, he identified the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 alongside British scientist Francis Crick, setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology.But Watson's reputation and standing were badly hurt by his comments on race and sex. In a TV programme, he made claims about genes causing a difference in average IQ between black and white people.His death was confirmed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he worked and researched for decades, before having to resign as its chancellor over the comments.Watson shared the Nobel in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick for the DNA's double helix structure discovery.\"We have discovered the secret of life,\" they said at the time. By the early 2000s, he had been largely ostracised by the scientific community over his comments on race and gender.In 2007, the scientist told the Times newspaper that he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\", because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really\".He apologised \"unreservedly\", but nevertheless, the comments led to him losing his job as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.Additional comments he made in 2019 - when he once again suggested a link between race and intelligence - led to the lab stripping his honorary titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee.\"Dr Watson's statements are reprehensible, unsupported by science,\" the laboratory said in a statement at the time.DNA was discovered in 1869 but it took until 1943 for scientists to discover that it made up the genetic material in cells. Still, the structure of DNA remained a mystery. Working with images obtained by King's College researcher Rosalind Franklin, without her knowledge, Crick and Watson were able to construct a physical model of the molecule. Maurice Wilkins, who shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, had worked with Franklin to determine the DNA molecule's structure. Franklin, who died in 1958, is today recognised for the integral role she played in the scientific breakthrough of DNA research, despite her work largely being written out of the story at the time.Former colleagues have commented that Watson nurtured the careers of female scientists at Harvard in the 1950s and 60s, at a time when that was not the norm. However he also made disparaging comments about women in science, and wrote sexist remarks about Franklin, including commenting on her appearance, in his 1968 best-selling book, The Double Helix.Watson became the first living Nobel laureate to sell his gold medal, fetching $4.8m (£3.6m) at an auction in 2014, saying he was letting go of it because he felt ostracised by the scientific community after his controversial remarks.A Russian billionaire bought it for $4.8m and promptly gave it back to him.James Watson was born in Chicago in April 1928 to Jean and James, descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers.He won a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago at the age of 15.  There, he became interested in the new technique of diffraction, in which X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures.To pursue his research into DNA structures, he went to Cambridge University in England, where he met Crick, with whom he began constructing large-scale models of possible structures.Later, after his scientific discovery, Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard, where he became professor of biology. The couple had two sons - one of whom was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, further motivating Watson's research to learn more about DNA in the hope of possibly helping him.In 1968, he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an old institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes.",

    "body": "10 hours agoKirstie BrewerBBC News BBCTwo Kurdish men agreed to go undercover for the BBC and expose a network behind illegal High Street businesses because the criminals are causing harm to the reputation of Kurds in the UK, they say.The two, who we are calling Saman and Ali, are Kurdish reporters who have both lived legally in the UK for years.The BBC discovered that a Kurdish crime network was running mini-marts, barbershops and car washes the length of Britain, and wanted to find out more about how it operated and who was involved.Equipped with secret cameras, Saman and Ali posed as Kurdish asylum seekers with no right to work, looking to buy and run a mini-mart from which to sell illegal cigarettes and vapes.They were able to uncover how easy it is for someone in these circumstances to set up and run a business on the High Street in plain sight. Those involved, we discovered, pay Kurds who have UK citizenship to register the businesses in their names, helping fool the authorities.Saman and Ali also managed to secretly film one of those at the centre of the network, who claimed that he could erase government fines of up to £60,000 faced by those employing illegal workers.\"I wanted to play a role in uncovering these illegal activities [...] to say loudly that they don't represent us,\" says Saman, a former asylum seeker himself. Saman entered the country illegally, having fled Kurdistan  - a region that straddles the borders of Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria but which is not internationally recognised as a country - because his life was at risk.The reporters acknowledge that tensions over illegal immigration are high in the UK and say they have both been worried that the investigation could inflame hostilities.But Ali says that the illegal working \"damages the whole Kurdish community\" and he feels compelled to \"bring it [the criminal network] out into broad daylight\".Separately, Ali says he was concerned the coverage could be seized upon by the far-right.He says this particularly struck him when he realised that far-right activist Tommy Robinson's Unite the Kingdom march was taking place in London on one of the weekends he was working undercover for the BBC. Placards and flags could be seen at the rally, reading \"we want our country back\".Saman and Ali have both been monitoring social media reaction to the BBC investigation from inside the Kurdish community and say it has sparked intense anger for some. One Facebook comment they spotted said: \"How can we identify and find [the undercover reporters] to kill them like dogs!\"Another called for their families in Kurdistan to be slaughtered.They have also read accusations that they were spies for the British government, and traitors to fellow Kurds. \"We are not spies, and we have no intention of harming the Kurdish community,\" Saman says. \"Our goal is to expose those who have damaged its reputation. We are proud of our Kurdish identity and deeply concerned about the actions of such individuals.\"Watch: BBC's Ed Thomas confronts Surchi of the Top Store mini-mart in CreweAli says he has also come across positive reaction, praising and defending the reporters for exposing wrongdoing and criminality.He says some young Kurdish men come to the UK having heard they can make money by selling illegal cigarettes.Reacting to our investigation, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said on Tuesday that these kinds of networks \"create an incentive for people to come here illegally\". An \"urgent investigation\" has now been launched by the Home Office, it confirmed.Ali stresses that a small percentage of Kurds based in the UK are involved: \"Maybe a minority in the community are involved in this illicit business - damaging the whole community.\"It is difficult to establish the exact size of the UK's Kurdish population - official records tend to log nationality rather than ethnicity. The Kurdish Community Centre in Haringey, London, suggests there are a little more than 500,000.Young Kurdish men \"have heard that illegal cigarettes can make you money in the UK\", says AliMost of those seeking asylum say they are fleeing political persecution, according to Ibrahim Avicil from the Refugee Workers Cultural Association (RWCA), a charity that supports refugees and asylum seekers in the UK.This was the case for our undercover reporter Saman, who, when he first came to the UK, struggled for years. He says he had to live on less than £20 a week while his asylum claim was considered.Asylum seekers now receive about £49 a week - or £9.95 if they are in accommodation which provides meals, according to Home Office guidance.\"Realistically speaking, this isn't enough to maintain a dignified life,\" says Mr Avicil from the RWCA.Because asylum seekers are largely prevented from working, he feels many are open to being exploited and are effectively \"forced to work in the illegal market for as low as £3 per hour\".A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"We make no apology for not granting asylum seekers the right to work - doing so would create an incentive for people to come to the UK illegally.\"Asylum cases can take years to be resolved with nearly a third taking more than 12 months, according to government figures from the end of March this year.Saman says working illegally in a car wash, barbershop or mini-mart would have been very easy to do, but he told us he would never have done that.However, he says that those he met working in illegal mini-marts during his work with the BBC investigation seemed \"lost\", especially those whose asylum claim has been refused and who were in the appeals process.\"They used all their money to come to the UK, they had their asylum refused and now they've lost everything.\"Saman and Ali say illegal working \"damages the whole Kurdish community\"Ali agrees that these people seemed desperate.\"If [they] say you're not allowed to work - but also [you] don't get paid enough to survive - what are you supposed to do? Most people in this situation would do anything.\"But they also point out that there are people who they exposed in the criminal network that are not in need - they seem to be motivated by greed.Shaxawan - a Kurdish man exposed to be a key fixer in the network - drives a BMW, he points out.\"He just wants to get richer and richer. He is exploiting people put in a vulnerable position.\"Saman describes these people as \"shamelessly and ruthlessly\" exploiting the system, and says that \"many of these people are clever and find loopholes to deceive\" the authorities.But he is at pains to stress that there is nevertheless a sense of \"honour, kindness, and hospitality\" in the Kurdish community. He is worried that \"now the image of Kurds in Britain is changing and becoming negative\".He says: \"I want to show the true image of Kurds and make it clear that we are not involved in these illegal activities.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentGetty ImagesNearly five months after a plane crash in India which killed 260 people, the investigation has become mired in controversy – with the country's Supreme Court the latest to weigh in.Flight 171 was en route to London from Ahmedabad in western India on 12 June. It crashed into a building just 32 seconds after taking off.An interim report was released in July, but critics argue it unfairly focused on the actions of the pilots, diverting attention away from a possible fault with the aircraft.On Friday, a judge in India's Supreme Court insisted that nobody could blame the aircraft's captain.His comments came a week after the airline's boss insisted there was no problem with the aircraft.During a panel discussion at the Aviation India 2025 summit in New Delhi in late October, Air India's chief executive Campbell Wilson admitted that the accident had been \"absolutely devastating for the people involved, for the families of those involved, and the staff\".But he stressed that initial investigations by Indian officials, summed up in a preliminary report, had \"indicated that there was nothing wrong with the aircraft, the engines or the operation of the airline\".He added although Air India was working with investigators it was not involved directly.Because the accident happened in India, the investigation is being led by the country's Air Accident investigation Bureau (AAIB). However, because the aircraft and its engines were designed and built in America, US officials are also taking part.A month after the accident, the AAIB published a preliminary report. This is standard procedure in major accident investigations and is meant to provide a summary of the known facts at the time of publication.The report will typically draw on information gleaned from examination of the crash site, for example, as well as basic material downloaded from the flight data recorder. It will not normally make firm conclusions about the cause of the accident.However, the 15-page report into Air India 171 has proved controversial. This is largely due to the contents of two short paragraphs.First, it notes that seconds after takeoff, the fuel cutoff switches - normally used when starting the engines before a flight and shutting them down afterwards – had been moved from the \"run\" to the cutoff position.This would have deprived the engines of fuel, causing them to lose thrust rapidly. The switches were moved back to restart the engines, but too late to prevent the disaster.It then says: \"In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so.\"What the fuel switches would have looked like inside a Boeing 787 Dreamliner cockpitThat indirectly-reported exchange sparked intense speculation about the role of the two pilots, Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and his first officer Clive Kunder, who was flying the plane at the time.A former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, Robert Sumwalt, claimed the report showed \"this was not a problem with the airplane or the engines\".\"Did somebody deliberately shut down the fuel, or was it somehow or another a slip that they inadvertently shut off the fuel?\" he said during an interview with the US network CBS.Indian aviation safety consultant Capt. Mohan Ranganathan strongly implied that pilot suicide could have caused the accident, in an interview with the country's NDTV channel.\"I don't want to use the word. I've heard the pilot had some medical history and... it can happen,\" he said.Mike Andrews, a lawyer acting on behalf of victims' families, thinks the way in which information has been released has \"led people unfairly and inappropriately to blame those pilots without all the information\".\"An aircraft like this - that is so complex - has so many things that could go wrong,\" he explains.\"To seize upon those two very small, decontextualised pieces of information, and automatically blame pilots for suicide and mass murder... is unfair and wrong.\"What we know so far about Air India crash investigationThat view is echoed by Capt. Amit Singh, founder of the Safety Matters Foundation, an organisation based in India that works to promote a safety culture in aviation.He has produced a report which claims the available evidence \"strongly supports the theory of an electrical disturbance as the primary cause of the engine shutdown\" that led to the disaster.He believes an electrical fault may have caused the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), a computerised system which manages the engines, to trigger a shutdown by cutting off the fuel supply.Meanwhile the flight data recorder, he suggests, may have registered the command to shut off the fuel supply, rather than any physical movement of the cutoff switches in the cockpit.In other words, the switches themselves may not have been touched at all, until the pilots tried to restart the engines.Capt. Singh has also challenged the way in which the investigation has been carried out in India's Supreme Court.He told the BBC the way in which the preliminary report was framed was biased because it \"appears to suggest pilot error, without disclosing all the technical anomalies that occurred during the flight\".Meanwhile the Supreme Court itself has already commented on the issue.It has been considering a petition filed by Pushkarraj Sabharwal, the father of Capt. Sumeet Sabharwal. The 91-year-old has been seeking an independent judicial inquiry into the tragedy.\"It's extremely unfortunate, this crash, but you should not carry this burden that your son is being blamed. Nobody can blame him for anything,\" Justice Surya Kant told him.A further hearing is expected on 10 November.'Flat out wrong'The theory that an electrical fault could have caused the accident is supported by the US-based Foundation for Aviation Safety (FAS).Its founder is Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeing, who has previously been highly critical of safety standards at the US aerospace giant.He believes the preliminary report was \"woefully inadequate... embarrassingly inadequate\".His organisation has spent time examining reports of electrical issues on board 787s. They include water leaks into wiring bays, which have previously been noted by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Authority. Concerns have also been voiced in some other quarters.\"There were so many of what we consider electrical oddities on that plane, that for them to come out and to all intents and purposes direct the blame to the pilots without exhaustively going through and examining potential system failures, we just thought was flat out wrong,\" he says.He believes there was a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from the plane and on to the pilots.The FAS has called for wholesale reform of current international air accident investigation procedures, citing \"outdated protocols, conflicts of interest and systemic failures that endanger public trust and delay life-saving safety improvements\".'Keeping an open mind'Mary Schiavo, an attorney and former inspector general at the US Department of Transportation, disagrees that the pilots have been deliberately put under the spotlight.She thinks the preliminary report was flawed, but only because investigators were under intense pressure to provide information, with worldwide attention focused on them.\"I think they were just in a hurry, because this was a horrific accident and the whole world was watching. They were just in a hurry to push something out,\" she says.\"Then, in my opinion, the whole world jumped to conclusions and right away was saying, 'this is pilot suicide, this was intentional'.\"If they had to do it over again, I don't think they would have put those little snippets from the cockpit voice recording in,\" she says.Her own view is that \"a computer or mechanical failure... is the most likely scenario\".International rules for air accident investigations stipulate that a final report should appear within 12 months of the event, but this is not always adhered to. However, until it is published, the true causes of the accident will remain unknown.A former air accident investigator who spoke to the BBC emphasised the importance of \"keeping an open mind\", until the process has been completed.Boeing has always maintained that the 787 is a safe aircraft – and it does have a strong record.The company told the BBC it would defer to India's AAIB to provide information about the investigation.",

    "body": "4 hours agoIain Watson,Political correspondent and Patrick Cowling,Producer, BBC Radio 4's Immigration: the Danish WayPA MediaShabana Mahmood sent officials to Denmark to study its immigration systemThe Home Secretary is set to announce a major shake-up of the immigration and asylum system later this month, the BBC has learned.Shabana Mahmood will model some of her new measures on the Danish system - seen as one of the toughest in Europe.It is understood officials have been looking at Denmark's tighter rules on family reunion and restricting most refugees to a temporary stay in the country.Mahmood wants to reduce incentives that draw people to the UK, while making it easier to expel those with no right to be in the country.But some in her party are against going down the Danish route, with one left-wing Labour MP saying it was too \"hardcore\" and contained echoes of the far right.At the Labour conference in September, Mahmood promised to \"do whatever it takes\" to regain control of Britain's borders.She is impressed that Denmark has driven down the number of successful asylum claims to a 40-year low - with the exception of 2020, amid pandemic travel restrictions.The BBC has been told she dispatched senior Home Office officials to Copenhagen last month to study what lessons could be applied to the UK.In Denmark, refugees who have been personally targeted by a foreign regime are likely to be given protection.But most people who have been successfully granted asylum when fleeing conflicts are now only allowed to remain in the country on a temporary basis.When the Danish government decrees their home country is safe, they can be returned.For those who have been in Denmark for a longer period, the length of time necessary to acquire settlement rights has been extended and conditions - such as being in full-time employment - have been added.Denmark's tighter rules for family reunions have also attracted the interest of UK Home Office officials.If you are a refugee who has been given residency rights in Denmark, both you and your partner who is applying to join you in the country must be 24 or older.The Danish government says this is to guard against forced marriages.The partner in Denmark must not have claimed benefits for three years and also has to put up a financial guarantee - and both partners have to pass a Danish language test.Refugees who live in housing estates designated as \"parallel societies\" - that is where more than 50% of residents are from what the Danish government considers to be \"non-Western\" backgrounds - will not be eligible for family reunion at all.This law, which also allows the state to sell off or demolish those apartment blocks that fall under the \"parallel societies\" designation, has been controversial. Denmark's government said it was aimed at improving integration, while a senior adviser to the EU's top court described it earlier this year as discriminatory on the basis of ethnic origin.In September, the UK Home Office suspended new applications under the Refugee Family Reunion scheme, pending the drawing up of new rules.The pre-September scheme allowed spouses, partners and dependents under 18 to come to the UK without fulfilling the income and English-language tests that apply to other migrants.Mahmood is unlikely to go as far as Denmark when she announces the UK's replacement rules for family reunions, but it seems likely that she will take steps along a more restrictive route.Rasmus Stoklund says Denmark's biggest challenge is expelling foreign criminalsLast week, the BBC also made the journey to Denmark to find out how their immigration system operates.Mahmood's opposite number Rasmus Stoklund, Denmark's minister for Immigration and Integration, is a member of Labour's sister party the Social Democrats.He said \"We have tightened our laws in many ways. \"We return more people back home. We have made it quite difficult to have family reunification in Denmark.\"You will get expelled a lot easier if you commit crimes. And we have made different programmes to help people go back home voluntarily.\"There is no indication the UK government would follow the Danish example of offering substantial sums - as much as the equivalent of £24,000 - for asylum seekers to return their country of origin, including making a contribution to the cost of their children's education.But some of what Stoklund outlined is being closely scrutinised in the Home Office, the BBC understands.According to Stoklund, tighter immigration and integration is about protecting the societal nature of Denmark, which is a smaller country with a lower population than the UK.\"We expect people who come here to participate and contribute positively and if they don't, they aren't welcome,\" he said.In Denmark - as in the UK - there is a live political debate on whether the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) makes the expulsion of foreign criminals more difficult.Like the UK government, Stoklund does not want to leave the ECHR but believes changes could be made.The Danish government has launched a review into how this could be done and Stoklund agreed he could make common cause with his British counterparts.\"I think it's very positive every time I hear that other countries have the same concerns and are frustrated the same way as many of us in Denmark are.\"Mahmood is said to be keen to meet Stoklund at the earliest opportunity.Getty ImagesIda Auken says a tougher stance on immigration neutralises a toxic issueFor Labour ministers, there are political, as well as practical lessons, to learn from Denmark.In 2015, the country had a centre-left government in trouble and a right-wing populist party surging in the polls, with immigration increasingly worrying voters.There are parallels with the UK today, as Reform UK maintains its poll lead over Labour. Downing Street is interested in how a centre-left party managed to defeat the Danish People's Party, one-time allies of Nigel Farage's UKIP in the European Parliament, to return to power.Ida Auken, the Social Democrats' environment spokesperson, said adopting a tougher stance on immigration meant there was space to pursue progressive policies in other areas.\"For us, it was a licence to operate on the things we want to do,\" she said.\"We want have a workforce that are educated, that have a social security and we do want to do a green transition.\"And we would never have been able to do this unless we've had those strict migration policies.\"Some senior ministers in the UK are thought to find that argument persuasive.Getty ImagesUK officials have been spending time in CopenhagenCritics would point out that while there are similarities with the UK, the situation in Denmark is different.The country is not facing small boats arrivals from the North Sea or the Baltic.Danish is not as widely spoken as English, so language requirements likely discourage some potential refugees.And while the vast majority of Social Democrat parliamentarians were on board for more hardline policies, there is far more wariness amongst some Labour MPs.Off the record, some mainstream Labour MPs say they would oppose the transplantation of Danish policies to the UK.On the left of the party, former frontbencher Clive Lewis argued strongly against adopting the Danish system in an effort to outflank Reform UK.\"Denmark's Social Democrats have gone down, what I would call a hardcore approach to immigration,\" he said.\"They've adopted many of the talking points of what we would call the far right.\"Labour does need to win back some Reform-leaning voters but you can't do that at the cost of losing progressive votes.\"Nadia Whittome, Labour MP for Nottingham East and a member of Labour's Socialist Campaign Group, said it would be a \"dangerous path\" to take and that some of the Danish policies, especially those around \"parallel societies\", are \"undeniably racist\".\"I think this is a dead end - morally, politically and electorally,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Gareth Snell, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, said however he thought similar policies to Denmark are \"worth exploring\" and that his constituents do not trust the current system in the UK and think of it as \"inherently unfair\".He said that when asylum is provided to people who can later safely return to their home countries to help rebuild their communities, \"then we should support that\". Jo White, who leads a 50-strong group of Labour MPs in \"Red Wall\" seats in the Midlands and North of England, would also like to see ministers go further in a Danish direction.She argued that Labour would pay a heavy political price if it does not adopt policies such as requiring some asylum seekers to contribute to the cost of their stay.\"The consequences are that we go into a general election where Reform will be the biggest challenger in most Labour seats... and we will be annihilated.\"Immigration: the Danish Way will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 13:30 GMT on Sunday 9 November and is now available on BBC Sounds.",

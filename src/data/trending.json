    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge12 hours agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" that young Pakistani student admitted all those years ago. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"\"Don't you find it interesting,\" he asked, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a WhatsApp group that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has receivedBut Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "7 minutes agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterAndy Burnham has been blocked from standing as a candidate for an upcoming parliamentary by-election in Gorton and Denton by Labour's ruling body.As a directly elected mayor, Burnham had to get approval from Labour's national executive committee (NEC), after he applied to be a candidate on Saturday.Some NEC members were concerned about an expensive mayoral election to replace Burnham, and allies of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer feared he could mount a leadership challenge, should he return to Westminster.The move is likely to infuriate Labour MPs and some ministers who said local party members should have had the option of choosing the Greater Manchester mayor as the candidate.It is a big political gamble by allies of the prime minister and risks inflaming tensions within the party, which is consistently trailing Reform UK in national opinion polls.One senior Labour source who had been supportive of Burnham's candidacy said: \"They're gambling the PM's whole premiership on winning a very hard by-election without their best candidate. It is madness.\"The decision was made by 10 members of the NEC, including Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and the on Sunday morning.Earlier, she told the BBC allowing elected mayors to run as candidates in parliamentary by-elections had \"organisational implications\" for the party.Several Labour sources had said the NEC could block Burnham's application on the grounds that a mayoral election would be expensive for the party.It would also be costly for the taxpayer, with the last mayoral election costing around £4.7m.",

He is awaiting trial over a break-in at RAF Brize Norton last June. He denies the charges.All those involved will be arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass after refusing to leave.\"A number managed to get inside a staff entrance area of a prison building,\" the Met said.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that \"at no point was prison security compromised\" and called the action an \"escalation\" that was \"completely unacceptable\".\"While we support the right to peacefully protest, reports of trespassing and threats being made to staff and police officers are deeply concerning,\" they said.Prisoners for Palestine said Khalid has limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, a genetic condition, and was on an \"extremely dangerous\" thirst strike.Related storiesMore from the BBC",

    "body": "I jumped out of a plane at 5,000ft - what happened next changed my life forever5 hours agoRachael DavisPress AssociationCollect/PA Real LifeRob has \"absolutely no memory\" of the accidentAn RAF veteran has said his life changed forever after he fell nearly 1,000ft (304m) during a training session which went wrong.Rob Bugden, 40, jumped from a plane at 5,000ft (1,524m) in January 2016 as part of a parachuting exercise, when he collided mid-air with his teammate.The next thing he remembers is waking up in hospital to discover that the collision had caused him to plummet to the ground, and left him paralysed from the neck down.\"I have absolutely no memory of it, and you know what? I'm alright with that,\" said Rob, speaking 10 years after the accident.Rob, from the Vale of Glamorgan, joined the RAF in 2008 as a physical training instructor, before deciding to specialise as a parachute jumping instructor in 2015.The following year, he took part in a training jump in formation with six other parachutists. \"That day, I walked down the aircraft – it's the last time I'm ever going to walk, which is really weird when you think about it,\" he said.Collect/PA Real LifeRob was a parachute jumping instructor for the RAFHe said the jump initially went \"really well\" - \"[but] then I woke up in a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona\".Rob was told that during the dive, while in the sky at about 1,000ft, there was a collision.\"That collision breaks my neck,\" he said.\"The canopies collapse, and we fall roughly about 900ft. Fortunately for us, we landed on sand, and I, unfortunately, came off second best.\"The other man involved in the collision was Rob's friend. While Rob was knocked unconscious – \"which is quite lucky in lots of ways, probably may well have saved my life\" – his friend remained conscious but broke his tibia and fibula and tore his kidney.\"But more than that, he remembers everything,\" Rob said. He added there were some \"very talented gentlemen on the ground\", including UK special forces who were doing an exercise in the same place.After witnessing the collision, they went to help straight away.\"Without them, I don't think I'd be alive,\" Rob reflected.\"So thank you to all of them. It seems such a frivolous word, but yeah, what else can I say?\"RAF Benevolent Fund/PA Real LifeRob says he is \"so thankful\" to have wonderful family and friendsRob had several operations in the US including a tracheostomy, as he could not breathe by himself, a peg in his stomach to feed him, and a pacemaker fitted. He also had his eye socket put back together, and fixations in his neck.By this point Rob was completely paralysed but \"in and out of consciousness all the time\" due to heavy medication, so does not remember \"a great deal\". After around three weeks, he was brought back to the UK and admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where \"the long journey began\".It was here that Rob said the reality hit him that he \"couldn't move\".\"We were a bit of a mess,\" said Rob.He learned his spinal cord had been severely crushed and that he was quadriplegic.\"Basically, all four of my limbs don't work,\" he explained.It took Rob a long time to get his head around how different his life would be.But he added: \"I'm very stubborn. I think I'm always right, but actually, flipping that on its head, it also meant that I was not going to give up.\"Eventually, Rob was able to breathe by himself and then started getting some movement back in his shoulders. After a year he could feed himself.\"Even then, I was getting most on my T-shirt, but it didn't matter, because I was doing it myself,\" he said.The next step was limiting the amount of help he needed for things such as using the toilet, and after two years he was able to flip his catheter himself, which felt like a big step.'So thankful, so grateful'Today, Rob requires round-the-clock live-in care, but he is able to take part in hobbies such as going to the gym, hanging out with his dog Denzel, and going to the pub with his friends.Rob affectionately calls Denzel his \"lack of assistance dog, because he is useless\".\"If there's chicken around, that's it. He's not going to listen,\" he laughed.\"But actually, I'm completely and utterly lost without him. He's my best friend. He is my companion, he's my protector. He's allowed me to make new friends and get out and about.\"During his long recovery and beyond, Rob received support from the RAF Benevolent Fund, a charity which supports serving and former RAF personnel and their families.Rob had just bought his first flat before his accident but was not able to return there as he needed a specialised, adapted home, so the fund's housing trust bought and adapted a home for Rob.\"I've got full access to the house with wet rooms, I've got two hoists – one in my bedroom, one in my living room, so I can get on my sofa. And I live next door to a pub, which is very handy,\" he said. Rob has left the RAF and adapted to a completely different way of life, but said he was \"so thankful, so grateful\" to have a wonderful group of friends and family rallying around him to make sure he is never alone.More top stories",

    "body": "A new National Police Service (NPS) will free up local forces to tackle everyday crime by taking over responsibility for counter-terror, fraud and organised crime investigations, the home secretary has said.Shabana Mahmood told the BBC the NPS, which she has dubbed a \"British FBI\", was \"absolutely not\" about saving money but about designing a new policing model for England and Wales.It will bring the work of existing agencies such as the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional organised crime units under the same organisation, buying new technology such as facial recognition on behalf of all forces.Mahmood said the current policing system was \"broken\" and the new body will form part of a series of police reforms for England and Wales which she will unveil on Monday.Other reforms announced recently include:The number of police forces in England and Wales will be \"significantly\" cut from the current 43 to make way for 12 \"mega\" forcesEvery police officer in England and Wales will have to have a licence to practiceIncreased powers for ministers to intervene where police and fire chiefs are deemed to be failingThe NPS will cover England and Wales but be able to operate in the wider UK, setting standards and training. It will be led by a national police commissioner who will become the most senior police chief in the country.The Home Office said local police officers have been \"burdened\" with tackling major crimes without adequate training, leaving them unable to address everyday offences like shoplifting and anti-social behaviour.Mahmood told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg there was an \"epidemic of everyday crime\" such as phone thefts and shoplifting which often went \"unpunished\".\"What I'm trying to do is design a new model for policing in this country which means we can deal with all of that everyday crime, that it is punished, that communities can have confidence that those sorts of criminals will not be able to run amok and have a national police service which can go after international criminals and national criminals who don't respect borders,\" she said. Currently some national investigations are dealt with by local forces, with the Metropolitan Police responsible for counter-terror policing, the National Air Service run by West Yorkshire Police and National Roads Policing by Sussex Police.These would all be brought under the NPS, along with the work of the National Crime Agency (NCA).Intelligence and resources will be shared across different forces in stages to ensure the public receive the same level of security \"no matter where they live\", the Home Office said in a statement.It is not the first time police reforms have been described as a \"British FBI\". In 2006, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was nicknamed \"Britain's FBI\". The Coalition government later replaced this with the NCA, which was again dubbed \"Britain's FBI\".The Home Office says it will also look to hire new talent outside of the force for leadership roles. Although Mahmood said everyday crime is on the rise, overall crime - including more serious offences - has fallen.The government claims facial recognition has led to a rapid reduction in crime - reportedly leading to 1,700 arrests in the past two years - but campaigners have raised concerns over issues with bias and privacy.Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency, backed the new national force and said \"the overall policing system is out of date. Crime has changed, technology has changed, and how we respond needs to change\".He added: \"These are threats that affect us all locally, but need a national and international response.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the changes \"must not come at the expense of local community policing\".He said: \"More top-down reorganisation risks undermining efforts to catch criminals and it delivers no real improvement on the ground.\"The plans have drawn mixed reaction from senior figures in policing, with the Police Federation warning that \"fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities\".The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) also warned that the creation of regional forces would be expensive, time-consuming and risks separating police forces from their communities.In November, ministers announced plans to scrap police and crime commissioners in 2028 to save at least £100m and help fund neighbourhood policing.Mahmood is seeking to give home secretaries the power to sack police chiefs and she said it was important to have accountability because \"when something goes horribly wrong\" with policing every body looks at the home secretary.She said she would have sacked the former chief of West Midlands Police Craig Guildford, who initially refused to resign despite an outcry over the force's handling of a decision to ban Israeli football fans from attending a match.",

The building, named Taipei 101 for the number of its floors, stands at 508m (1,667ft) of steel, glass and concrete and is designed to resemble a stick of bamboo.Honnold is renowned for being the first person to climb El Capitan, the vertical granite cliff in California's Yosemite national park - also without ropes or safety gear. The climb was originally set to take place on Saturday but was delayed by wet weather.His ascent in Taiwan's capital was streamed live on Netflix, which said there would be a delay on the live feed should the worst happen. Honnold completed the climb in one hour and 31 minutes and celebrated the achievement with one word: \"Sick.\"His time more than halves the record of the only other person to scale the tower. Alain Robert, a Frenchman who called himself \"Spiderman\", made it to the top of Taipei 101 - at the time the world's tallest building - in four hours. He did so with ropes and a harness.RITCHIE B TONGO/EPA/ShutterstockGetty ImagesTaiwan's Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim congratulated Honnold on the ascent, writing on X: \"I admit I would probably feel sick, too, barely able to watch.\" Honnold was greeted at the top of the building by his wife, who expressed concern for the wind and heat as he climbed.But there was another distraction during his ascent.As Honnold reached the 89th floor, fans cheered and waved, face to face but for the window with the man clinging to the building.Video of the moment was shared by Honnold and Netflix on Instagram, showing the climber continuing undeterred.Honnold has made many extreme climbs during his career. A documentary about his ascent of the 3,000 foot (915m) El Capitan, titled Free Solo, won an Academy Award.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesPeople is Taipei watched Honnold climb the buildingGetty ImagesReutersThe building, named Taipei 101 for the number of its floors, stands at 508m (1,667ft)",

    "body": "2 hours agoThomas MackintoshWatch: Bereaved mothers' emotional plea for social media banTwo bereaved mothers fear any delay to bringing in a social media ban for young people could mean \"more and more children being harmed\".It comes days after the Lords voted in favour of banning under-16s from using social media services such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook in a move similar to one imposed by Australia last year.Esther Ghey and Ellen Roome told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that Ofcom, the regulator monitoring online safety laws, is not doing a good enough job to protect kids.Ofcom, which brought in new rules last year to protect children from seeing harmful or inappropriate content online, said it is \"under no illusion there is still much more to do\".In a heavy defeat for the government on Wednesday, House of Lords peers supported the cross-party move by 261 votes to 150 - a majority of 111.It means the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill will have to be considered by MPs in the Commons.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall has announced a three-month consultation to consider the advantages and disadvantages of a social media ban.It will include exploring possible overnight curfews and actions to prevent \"doom-scrolling\", and will report back to the government in the summer.PA MediaEsther Ghey's daughter Brianna Ghey was stabbed to death in 2023 by two teens who had viewed violent content onlineGhey - whose 16-year-old daughter Brianna Ghey was murdered in a park in February 2023 by two children who planned their crime on social media apps - said more needed to be done.\"Whilst we're waiting more and more children are being harmed\", Ghey said.\"I've spoken to you before about my story with Brianna and how much she suffered\".Brianna spent many hours on social media and her mother previously said her daughter wanted to be famous on TikTok.She believes this contributed to her isolation and problems with her mental health in the period running up to Brianna's death. \"The last two years of her life were absolutely full of suffering and it is such a waste,\" Ghey said.\"We know that every single day 500 children are being referred to mental health services and we know that 97% of 12-year-olds own smartphones so we need to do something now.\"Australia began forcing social media firms to block users aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms in December.It is a policy being closely watched by governments around the world - including in the UK.Australia's ban was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful online content and algorithms.Companies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online, but do not think a blanket ban is the answer, with some experts raising similar concerns.Ellen Roome is one of five British parents suing TikTok over their children's deathsEllen Roome - another bereaved mother whose son Julian \"Jools\" Sweeney died taking part in a social media challenge - joined parents who have lost children in circumstances relating to online safety at a meeting with the technology secretary on Tuesday.The 49-year-old from Gloucestershire told the BBC: \"How much longer are we going to let children have unregulated access?\"I think how much longer are we going to let children have unregulated access, they have got access to everything and I just really think it needs to go, this whole thing of waiting and seeing and waiting,\" Roome told the programme.\"I just fundamentally think if this was a product, it would be taken off the road, it would be fixed and handed back to them. Tell you what, take it away.\"Roome is part of a group of parents suing TikTok in the US state of Delaware.Ofcom said since its new powers came into force last summer, it has \"launched investigations into more than 90 platforms\" and \"issued several fines\".\"As a result of our action, age checks to protect children from pornography and other harmful material are now widespread, several high-risk sites are blocked, while child sexual abuse material is being tackled more effectively,\" an Ofcom spokesman said.\"This is an industry that's been unregulated and unaccountable for more than 20 years, and so while significant progress is being made, we're under no illusion that there is much still to do.\"We will continue to work with urgency to drive change so that children in the UK enjoy a safer life online, and we remain grateful for the support and insights we receive from victims, survivors and bereaved families.\"",

    "body": "47 minutes agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterBBC Studios AudioKemi Badenoch has led the Conservative Party since 2024Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said she initially joined the Conservatives for the \"party aspect of it - socialising, drinks, hanging out with other young people\".Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Badenoch said that after university all her friends had \"gone all over the world\" and she thought joining the party would be \"a fun thing to do\".She met her husband through her membership of the Conservatives and dedicated one of her record picks - Wet Wet Wet's Love is All Around - to him.The interview was recorded on 19 January, a week after three high-profile Conservatives had defected to Reform UK including former minister Robert Jenrick.Asked how she would steady the Tory ship, Badenoch said: \"I think defections are part of the ship being steadied.\"And while it is always sad to lose people who used to be on the team, losing people who were not team players and were more focused about their own personal ambition rather than the country's ambition is actually helpful for showing what kind of party we are.\"Badenoch took over leadership of her party in 2024 following its worst-ever general election defeat.Since then her party has fallen in the opinion polls, being overtaken by Reform UK, and suffered big defeats in the 2025 local elections. Badenoch said the Conservative Party had been around for more than 200 years and that after being elected leader in 2024 her \"mission\" was to \"make sure that we didn't just disappear\". She added she had a \"long-term strategy\" to win back voters but there would be \"setbacks in between\".\"Quite often, the thing you're doing for the long term is not that helpful in the short term.\"'We'll all look stupid together'Her musical choices for the programme included The Story of Tonight from the musical Hamilton and Baz Luhrmann's Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen). She said the Australian film director's 1997 spoken word song contained advice that was still \"relevant\" and was \"very sympathetic to politicians\". \"It says 'accept certain inalienable truths - prices will rise, politicians will philander and you too will get old'.\"\"I always thought about that as being very helpful in thinking about life going quickly. I will get old too. What do I want?\"Explaining why she picked The Story of Tonight - a number in which revolutionaries in the American War of Independence sing about the future and friendship -  Badenoch said it reminded her of the first time she ran to be leader of the Conservative Party in 2022.\"I had a group of friends, a renegade group of junior ministers, who had all resigned because we were so frustrated that the politics wasn't working.\"They said you've got to stand, you're the only one that would do well and we will support you. \"And I said, this is a mad idea. It's not going to work and they said, don't worry, we're all in it together and if we look stupid, we'll all look stupid together.\"Badenoch was part of the mass resignation of ministers that forced Boris Johnson out of office in July 2022. 'I'm an Essex girl'Badenoch began her parliamentary career when she won the Essex seat of Saffron Walden for the Conservatives in 2017.Asked how she managed to convince local Conservatives to select her as their candidate despite having no links to the area, she said: \"They tell me that I was funny, I was very honest, I wasn't trying to be something I wasn't.\"\"I started off by saying I could pretend that my family has been here since, you know, the Battle of Hastings, but I don't think anyone here would believe me - and they just burst out laughing.\"They said later on that this is someone who's just herself. And Essex is like that.\"Essex is very much my personality - I call myself an Essex girl.\"She said her father, who died in 2022 a few months before she ran for the first time for the Conservative leadership, was proud that she had gone into politics telling her: \"I know you're going to go all the way.\"By contrast, she said her mother was \"tearing her hair out\" when Badenoch embarked on a political career.\"She was like, why would you do this... you've got a good job... why do you want to go into this horrible career.\"She had a very, very dim view of politicians thinking they were all out for themselves... so I think part of what I'm trying to do now in politics is to prove to her that politicians can be good people.\"'More like Borstal than Malory Towers'Badenoch was born in London but spent much of her childhood in Nigeria, as well as the United States, where her mother lectured. However, she says her upbringing was steeped in British culture adding: \"My childhood was sort of the last embers of empire and the colonial era.\"\"Everything on telly was BBC,\" she said, adding that she grew up watching the sitcom Some Mothers Do Ave Em and Doctor Who, which ignited a love of science fiction. For her luxury she picked the 22 \"Marvel universe\" superhero films. As a child, she also read Enid Blyton's Malory Towers books, which follow the lives of girls at a Cornish boarding school in the 1940s and 50s. The books, she said, gave her an unrealistic expectation of what her own boarding school would be like. \"It was more like Lord of the Flies or Borstal,\" she said, adding that every girl there had a machete, in order to cut the grass.Badenoch's choices in full:Disc one: The Story of Tonight – Original Broadway cast of HamiltonDisc two: Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough - Michael JacksonDisc three: Wonderful World - Sam CookeDisc four: Be Still in the Presence of the Lord – Aled Jones and the English Session OrchestraDisc five: Everybody's Free to Wear Sunscreen – Baz LuhrmanDisc six: Love is All Around – Wet Wet WetDisc seven: Carry You Home – Alex WarrenDisc eight: Dear Theodosia - Original Broadway cast of HamiltonBook choice: Vanity Fair by William Makepeace ThackeryLuxury item: The 22 movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe Infinity SagaCastaway's favourite: Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough - Michael JacksonYou can listen to the full episode of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 at 10:00 GMT and after that on BBC Sounds.",

The camera was later found to be connected to the internet.She said: \"I turned around and I looked down and I saw this black round dot - it was a bit out of place because the toilet's white.\"It was just there, a small camera, some wires coming off of it, and then a battery pack with kitchen roll over it, and my stomach just sank.\"The thought of someone watching, especially in such a private area, scared me. It's a really uncomfortable thing to think about, that somebody's got that now.\"There must have been so many people visiting that toilet.\"The victim had been on a date night when she found the device under the toilet seat at the Giggling Squid restaurantLeicestershire Police said it was notified the following day about the webcam at the restaurant chain.A spokesperson said: \"Officers attended and the device was recovered for examination.\"Further inquiries were carried out regarding CCTV in the restaurant and staff were spoken to in order to try and identify the person responsible.\"Advice has also been given to staff about remaining vigilant.\"A spokesperson for Giggling Restaurants, the company that runs the restaurant, said a customer had reported a \"suspicious object\" to staff on the night it was found.They said: \"Our staff did the right thing and informed police right away, who now have the item in their possession.\"We are co-operating fully with their inquiries.\"The restaurant said it was \"co-operating fully\" with the police investigationThe victim added she hoped sharing her experience would save other people from being targeted.\"I'm trying to get people to think when they go in public situations, look everywhere, even in places that we wouldn't even think would be unsafe,\" she said.\"When I've spoken to people about it, it's not something that anybody's ever thought about, nobody looks at under the toilet seats or has a little scan before they use the toilet.\"If this helps somebody spot it before it can escalate, then great.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "'Beautiful' rare octopus spotted on popular Welsh beach4 days agoOscar EdwardsBBC WalesGareth DaviesThe octopus was seen at low tide on North Beach in Tenby A photographer who was enjoying a walk on a popular Welsh beach says he became \"completely absorbed\" after spotting an octopus.Gareth Davies witnessed the \"beautiful\" orange cephalopod as it buried itself in the sand in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, and \"vanished\" in an \"effortless display of camouflage\".He said the sighting was unexpected, but that the beauty of a seaside walk is that you never know \"what might turn up\".It comes after record numbers were spotted in the UK last year, leading to a wildlife charity declaring 2025 as \"the Year of the Blooming Octopus\". This is not the first time an octopus has washed up Welsh shores, after two were seen and rescued, while crawling on a Ceredigion beach in 2022.On another occasion, an octopus was spotted changing colour in footage captured at Menai Bridge beach on Anglesey.Gareth, a professional photographer from Pembroke, said the low tide at North Beach in Tenby led to a \"sense of anticipation\" that was soon rewarded.\"I unexpectedly came across a beautiful common octopus,\" he said. \"I watched, completely absorbed, as it began to bury itself in the sand, its skin shifting colour and texture in an effortless display of camouflage.\"The octopus \"soon vanished from sight, as quietly as it had appeared\", he added.Gareth DaviesGareth said the octopus buried itself in the sand in an \"effortless display of camouflage\"There has been a dramatic increase in the number of octopuses seen in UK waters with warmer winters, which are linked to climate change, thought to be responsible for the population spike.The Wildlife Trusts said the highest number of octopuses had been seen off the south coast of Devon and Cornwall last year since 1950.Gareth said he saw what he thinks is a common octopus, which despite its name is not very common in UK waters.He described them as a \"highly intelligent\" and \"active predator\" equipped with \"specialised glands that produce venom to incapacitate its prey\".The octopus increase does however pose a problem for shellfish species around the UK shores.The eight-armed creatures eat shellfish such as lobster, crabs and scallops so the Wildlife Trusts has warned that if population numbers remain high, both fishing and eating habits may have to change.Gareth DaviesThere was a record number of octopus sightings on UK shores last yearMore top stories",

    "body": "The Liberal Democrats are calling on the government to start issuing \"war bonds\", a scheme the party says could raise up to £20bn to bolster the military. Under the plan, members of the public could loan the government money in the form of a bond which would run over a two-to-three year period and pay out the same interest as standard government bonds. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the bonds would \"give ordinary people the opportunity to contribute to Britain's security\". A spokesperson for the government said \"new debt instruments\" were kept under review but that they had to represent \"value for money\" and \"be consistent with wider fiscal objectives\". Calls to increase defence spending have intensified in recent years, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the election of US President Donald Trump, who has frequently criticised Nato countries for failing to spend enough on their military. The Labour government has pledged to raise overall defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, at an estimated cost of an additional £6bn a year.It has also promised to raise levels to 3.5% by 2035, in line with a pledge by Nato members last year. However, there have been reports in the Times and the Sun that plans to make Britain's armed forces \"war ready\" will require £28bn more than has so far been allocated.The government had been due to publish its defence investment plan last autumn but there are suggestions it has been delayed due to concerns about cost.Earlier this month, the head of the Armed Forces Sir Richard Knighton said the UK was \"not as ready as we need to be for the kind of full-scale conflict we might face\".Setting out his party's proposal, Sir Ed said: \"Now is the moment to be clear-eyed about the threats facing Britain - Vladimir Putin is waging war in Europe while Donald Trump is tearing up the rules and alliances that keep us safe.He said Britain and its allies \"must rapidly strengthen our defences to deter the likes of Putin... it is much better to invest now in deterring a war than having to fight one\".The Liberal Democrats said the money raised from issuing bonds would be ring-fenced for defence and the investment would help deliver \"growth, jobs and higher revenues\" for the government \"which would partially offset the cost of additional debt servicing\".The party added the scheme would need to be accompanied by an overhaul of the Ministry of Defence procurement process, which has previously been criticised as wasteful. Their proposal, the party says, would be similar to the bonds scheme used during World War One and World War Two. Individual citizens could lend the government money, which would be paid back in six to 10 years with interest. By the end of 1945, the scheme had raised £1.754m.Posters encouraging members of the public to buy bonds - or national savings certificates - used slogans including \"lend to defend\" and \"feed the guns with war bonds\". Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at investors AJ Bell, said: \"War bonds are a proven way of raising money to fund national defence spending, but they can burden a government with long-term debt. \"In theory, the public might demand a better rate of interest than they could get on cash in the bank to take up the bonds. \"While some people might think it is their duty to support the country, there will be others who treat such a bond in the same way as any type of investment.\" ",

    "body": "16 minutes agoAndrew WhiteheadGetty ImagesSir Mark spent much of his journalistic career covering IndiaThe broadcaster and journalist Sir Mark Tully - for many years known as the BBC's \"voice of India\" - has died at the age of 90.For decades, the rich, warm tones of Sir Mark were familiar to BBC audiences in Britain and around the world - a much-admired foreign correspondent and respected reporter and commentator on India. He covered war, famine, riots and assassinations, the Bhopal gas tragedy and the Indian army's storming of the Sikh Golden Temple.In the small north Indian city of Ayodhya in 1992, he faced a moment of real peril. He witnessed a huge crowd of Hindu hardliners tear down an ancient mosque. Some of the mob - suspicious of the BBC - threatened him, chanting \"Death to Mark Tully\". He was locked in a room for several hours before a local official and a Hindu priest came to his aid.How the Babri mosque destruction shaped IndiaWill English kill off India's languages?The demolition provoked the worst religious violence in India for many decades - it was, he said years later, the \"gravest setback\" to secularism since the country's independence from Britain in 1947.\"We are sad to hear the passing of Sir Mark Tully,\" Jonathan Munro, Interim CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, said in a statement. \"As one of the pioneers of foreign correspondents, Sir Mark opened India to the world through his reporting, bringing the vibrancy and diversity of the country to audiences in the UK and around the world.\"His public service commitments and dedication to journalism saw him work as a bureau chief in Delhi, and report for outlets across the BBC. Widely respected in both India and the UK, he was a joy to speak with and will be greatly missed.\"India was where Sir Mark was born - in what was then Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1935. He was a child of the British Raj. His father was a businessman. His mother had been born in Bengal - her family had worked in India as traders and administrators for generations.He was brought up with an English nanny who once chided him for learning to count by copying the family's driver: \"that's the servants' language, not yours\", he was told. He eventually became fluent in Hindi, a rare achievement in Delhi's foreign press corps and one which endeared him to many Indians for whom he was always \"Tully sahib\". His good cheer and evident affection for India won him the friendship and trust of many of the top rank of the country's politicians, editors and social activists.Sir Mark, seen here with members of India's armed forces, arrived in India as an administrative assistant at the BBC in 1965Throughout his life, he performed a balancing act: English, without doubt; but not - he insisted - an expat who was passing through India. He had roots there; it was his home. It's where he lived for three-quarters of his life.Immediately after World War Two, at the age of nine, Sir Mark came to Britain for his education. He studied history and theology at Cambridge and then headed to theological college with the aim of being ordained as a clergyman before he - and the church - had second thoughts.He was sent to India for the BBC in 1965 - at first as an administrative assistant, but in time he began to take on a reporting role. His broadcasting style was idiosyncratic, but his strength of character and his insight into India shone through.Some critics said he was too indulgent of India's poverty and caste-based inequality; others admired his clearly expressed commitment to the religious tolerance upon which independent India was anchored. It's \"really important to treasure the secular culture of this country, allowing every religion to flourish,\" he told an Indian newspaper in 2016. \"... we must not endanger this by insisting on Hindu majoritarianism\".Getty ImagesSir Mark's was a familiar voice for BBC listeners in the UK and around the worldSir Mark was never an armchair correspondent. He travelled relentlessly across India and neighbouring countries, by train when he could. He gave voice to the hopes and fears, trials and tribulations, of ordinary Indians as well as the country's elite. He was as comfortable wearing an Indian kurta as in a shirt and tie.He was expelled from India at 24 hours' notice in 1975 after the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered a state of emergency. But he headed back 18 months later and had been based in Delhi ever since. He spent more than 20 years as the BBC's head of bureau in Delhi, leading the reporting not simply of India but of South Asia, including the birth of Bangladesh, periods of military rule in Pakistan, the Tamil Tigers' rebellion in Sri Lanka and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Over time, he became increasingly out of step with the BBC's corporate priorities, and in 1993 he made a much-publicised speech accusing the then director general, John Birt, of running the corporation by \"fear\". It marked a parting of the ways. Sir Mark resigned from the BBC the following year. But he continued to broadcast on BBC airwaves notably as presenter of Radio 4's Something Understood, turning back to issues of faith and spirituality which had engaged him as a student.Getty ImagesSir Mark stayed on in Delhi after he left the BBCUnusually for a foreign national, Sir Mark was accorded two of India's top civilian honours: the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan. Britain too gave him recognition. He was knighted for services to broadcasting and journalism in the 2002 New Year's honours list. He described the award as \"an honour to India\".He continued to write books about India - essays, analyses, short stories too, sometimes in collaboration with his partner, Gillian Wright. He lived un-ostentatiously in south Delhi.Sir Mark never gave up his British nationality but was proud also to become late in life an Overseas Citizen of India. That made him, he said, \"a citizen of the two countries I feel I belong to, India and Britain\".Read more on the story",

    "body": "4 hours agoPauline McLeanScotland arts correspondentPA MediaThe lost portrait (left) is now hanging in the National Galleries of Scotland alongside the original Nasmyth painting (right)It's a missing painting story worthy of Sherlock Holmes.In 1803, the greatest painter of the day, Sir Henry Raeburn, was commissioned to create a new image of the greatest poet of the day, Robert Burns.Burns, who had died a few years earlier, had only ever agreed to sit for one artist, Alexander Nasmyth in 1787 and that painting became the template for every image.The publishers – Cadell and Davies – paid 20 guineas for the new painting which they planned to use as an engraving in all future editions of Burns' books.Although the painting was delivered a year later, it was never used as planned. In fact, it vanished all together - setting in motion a mystery which has taken 200 years to resolve.Burns scholar and enthusiast Dr Bill Zachs said: \"Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, reported about a séance that happened where a crazy Burns collector named Edward Barrington Nash tried through the medium of a spirit to invoke Robert Burns and find where this missing portrait was.\"Stories you may have missedThe director of Glasgow Art Galleries and Museums, TCF Brotchie, wrote in 1924 that \"its discovery would be an event bordering upon the sensational\".But it would take a further 100 years for that sensational moment to happen.Zachs, who is director of the Blackie House Library and Museum in Edinburgh, had been searching for the lost Raeburn since he first came to Edinburgh 42 years ago.Last March, he came across a painting in a London auction house, part of a house clearance.\"There have been so many copies of the Nasmyth in auctions over the years. I have two or three myself,\" he said.\"So there was no reason to think that this was the missing painting - except that I had acquired a letter 20 years before from the man who had the Nasmyth portrait in his possession and who chose Raeburn as the person to produce a new painting, an image of Burns that would endure for the ages.\"That man was Alexander Cunningham, a close friend of Burns who had become a custodian of the Nasmyth painting.He agreed that it could be used as the basis for a new image of Burns – as long as the artist was Raeburn. The leading portraitist of the late 18th and early 19th century, he was renowned for his direct and powerful style.Nick MailerDr Bill Zachs has been searching for the lost Raeburn portrait for 42 yearsWhile he uses the Nasmyth work as his template, his Burns is younger, fresher faced and more vivacious than the original.Zachs believes he may have met Burns – and was painting from memory as much as from the only available portrait.With a starting price of £300-£500, he was willing to take a chance but others had the same idea, and the bids pushed the final price up to £68,000.It was only then that Zachs could return to Scotland and begin the process of having the work cleaned and verified.Lesley Stevenson, senior conservator of paintings at the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh, is among several experts who have since confirmed the Raeburn attribution.\"Raeburn's expressive, seemingly effortless brushwork, the characteristic warm palette, soft atmospheric lighting and sensitive rendering of the instantly recognisable Robert Burns are a joy,\" she said.\"This is a significant discovery and one we can all celebrate.\"On public displayThis week the painting went on public display for the first time, alongside the Nasmyth portrait which already belongs to the National Galleries of Scotland.Director general Anne Lyden said: \"We call it the patron portrait. \"It is the one that people call to mind when they think about Robert Burns because it's featured in everything from shortbread tins to tea towels and key rings.\"Everything originates from that.\"But to see it hanging side by side with the Raeburn and look at the differences in size, in palette and in light is very special.\"It just makes Burns feel like a real living figure.\"Having been \"lost\" for two centuries, the painting is now back home in the place where it was first made, and just in time for Burns Night.Zachs is lending the work to the National Galleries of Scotland where it will be free to see until July, when it will transfer to the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum in Ayr.\"To share this painting  is fantastic and the story is just beginning,\" he said.\"The doors have only just opened and I hope people will come and see for themselves this work which has been hidden from the world for 200 years.\"",

    "body": "What could have been a magic Monday for Team GB ended rather muted.It started with an agonising fourth-place finish for skier Kirsty Muir in the slopestyle final, and finished the same for Mia Brookes in the snowboard big air - sandwiching a missed opportunity for a guaranteed curling medal for Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds in the mixed doubles.But it was so close to glory for Brookes, a backside 1620 trick - featuring four and a half rotations - landed before she over-rotated and her heel edge caught in the snow.\"That was a gold,\" said Ed Leigh on BBC Sport commentary.\"She so nearly held on to it. It would have been a world first in competition.\"Instead, the 19-year-old finished just off the podium with a combined score of 159.50 from her opening two runs.Japan's world champion Kokomo Murase won her maiden Olympic gold with 179 points, with New Zealand's Zoi Sadowski Synnott and South Korean Yu Seungeun taking silver and bronze.\"It was insane. Obviously I'm bummed I couldn't land that last trick,\" Brookes told BBC Sport, later revealing it was the first time she had attempted it on snow.\"I had too much spin on it, which I didn't think I would. Maybe I should have done an 1800 instead!\"Brookes is one of the biggest names in her sport and, despite her tender age, already has a medal collection that most would be jealous of.In 2023, she became the sport's youngest senior world champion with slopestyle gold in Georgia, a victory sealed by landing the first Cab 1440 double grab in a women's event.She has since become a two-time gold medallist at the X Games, an invitation-only event widely seen as the holy grail of action sports.There are few athletes - if any - among Team GB's ranks who have cut a more chilled out figure than Brookes at these Games so far.An Olympic medal is not something she has ever \"craved\", but the magnitude of this global event has perhaps hit home and she is \"pretty excited\" for another shot at a medal in the slopestyle, which starts with qualifying on 16 February.\"I'm hyped for it, everything good can come from it. I'm in a good headspace and ready to to do slopestyle.\"At the Beijing Games, Dodds and Mouat blew a semi-final lead against Norway before losing to the inspired Swedes in the bronze-medal match.Both Scots had spoken in the build-up about using that as fuel this time but, although this was a different Swedish pair, the outcome was the same.The British duo had seen off Rasmus and Isabella Wranaa with relative ease on Friday, but the siblings started strongly and just got stronger in a flawless display.They restricted GB to one in a scrappy first end, taking two themselves in the second, and stealing another in the third.Dodds and Mouat were just not quite at it, their shots not quite coming off and the margins going against them. The Swedes could not miss, but the GB pair did. Time and again. Not by much, but by enough.The fourth end again only brought one, leaving them trailing 3-2 at the interval, but then Dodds - the best women's player here all week - belatedly found her touch.The 34-year-old spied the chance to take out two Swedish stones. Mouat and coach Greg Drummond were wary. But Dodds was adamant she could execute. And she did.The Swedes still had a chance to take one, but Isabella Wranaa erred for once and GB stole one to level the contest.It turned out to be a brief flash of hope, though. Poor throws from both Dodds and Mouat left them chasing in the sixth end and their ruthless opponents took full advantage by taking five. It was a decisive moment.Sweden were never likely to lose such a huge lead in the remaining two ends, and so it proved. The British pair, chasing a big score in the seventh, couldn't find a miracle, gave up one more point, and shook hands with an end to spare. \"We don't want this to affect our chances of a medal tomorrow so we'll speak about the things that need to be spoken about and corrected and we'll come out firing tomorrow,\" Dodds told BBC Sport.The British agony had started earlier on in the day when freestyle skier Muir missed out on a medal by the narrowest of margins with her fourth-place finish in the women's slopestyle.Muir scored 76.05 points with a brilliant third run, finishing only 0.41 behind Canadian bronze medallist Megan Oldham in Livigno.Having fallen on the penultimate jump of her opening run, Muir - who had qualified third - sat in sixth after her second.But despite a vastly improved performance on her final attempt, a crestfallen Muir was left wanting more on the biggest stage.\"I put it out there on every run,\" the 21-year-old told BBC Sport.\"I was so proud to put one down. I struggled to accept how close it was, but I know I've got more in me.\"In a final that demonstrated the strength of women's freestyle skiing, Mathilde Gremaud successfully defended her Olympic title by only 0.38 points.China's Eileen Gu - the world's fourth highest-paid female athlete in 2025 but arguably a bigger star off the slopes through her modelling and brand endorsements - took silver, but crashed on her final run to allow Gremaud a victory lap.Gremaud soaked up her moment, a Switzerland flag tied around her neck and billowing in the wind as she floated down the course.At the end of a downbeat day for Team GB, Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson failed to match their performance in the team event as they began their quest to become Great Britain's first Olympic figure skating medallists since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1994.They scored 84.57 in the rhythm dance, lower than their season best recorded in Milan on Friday. It leaves them fourth - 0.71 off the podium - going into Wednesday's free dance where the medals will be decided.Performing to their popular Spice Girls medley, Fear, 26, lost her balance slightly on the sequential twizzles. But they brought it back big time in the rhythm sequence and concluding rotational lift to keep themselves in the podium hunt. They will perform in tartan to a Scottish-inspired routine on Wednesday.In gold medal position are France's Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron, who set a season best with a huge score, 90.18. Cizeron won the Olympic title four years ago with Gabriela Papadakis, with who he has since had a very acrimonious split.He partnered with Fournier Beaudry in November, who herself needed a new partner in controversial circumstances when her boyfriend Nikolaj Sorensen was suspended amid sexual assault allegations, external. She has since publicly defended Sorensen,, external who has denied wrongdoing.On the ice, Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron stormed to gold at the European Championships and are right in the mix for the Olympic title. Despite being ranked 25th in the world and performing sixth on the night, they held top spot for more than two hours after a technically perfect display to Madonna's Vogue.USA husband and wife Madison Chock and Evan Bates - who have already won gold in the team event and are three-time world champions - are in silver position after the final performance of the night scored 89.72.Britain's biggest rivals for a medal are likely to be Canada's Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier, who are currently third with 86.18.Italy's Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri, who live and train in Fabbri's home town of Milan, were very popular with the home fans but slightly underperformed. Their score of 84.28 leaves them in fifth.Fear and Gibson's compatriots James Hernandez and Phebe Bekker put on a season-best showing to secure their place in Wednesday's final.The duo, on Olympic debut, scored 72.46 with a clean rhythm dance performance to a George Michael soundtrack, ensuring they will return for the free skate.It continues the young couple's good form following an 11th place finish in January's European Championship for Bekker, 20, and 24-year-old Hernandez.",

    "body": "GB in curling medal match - Tuesday's guideImage caption, Updated 9 February 2026The 25th Winter Olympics will feature almost 3,000 athletes from 90 countries competing for 116 medals at Milan-Cortina. Team GB have sent 53 athletes to the Games with plenty of medal potential.Here is your guide to what is happening each day and who to look out for.All times GMT.Day four: Tuesday, 10 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Mixed team short track relay (09:30-12:30); Men's and women's cross-country skiing sprint classic (08:15-12:50); Men's ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Women's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20), Men's biathlon 20km (12:30-14:30); Women's luge (16:00-18:50) Mixed doubles curling (17:05-19:25) Mixed team ski jumping (17:45-20:10).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)The USA's Alex Hall bids to retain his Olympic title. He will have extra motivation to do so in Italy as his mother comes from Bologna and he will have plenty of family in Livigno to cheer him on. Hall had to settle for bronze at last year's World Championships, won by Norway's Birk Ruud – who won Olympic big air gold at Beijing 2022.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hall spent a lot of time on European slopes during his childhoodAlpine skiing: Women's team combined (13:00) The women's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) makes its Olympic debut. Returning slalom legend Mikaela Shiffrin and USA downhill star Breezy Johnson won the maiden World Championship title in this event in early 2025 and will be the pair to beat here.Curling: Mixed doubles bronze-medal match (13:05)The mixed doubles is the only curling event in which Britain have never won a medal  – Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds will be hoping to be in a position to change that today. They were comprehensively beaten by Sweden in Monday's semi-final but have a chance to win bronze and GB's first medal against hosts and defending world and Olympic champions Italy. Curling: Mixed doubles final (17:05-19:20)Sweden, who claimed bronze in 2022, are guaranteed to go better this time and will face the United States in the final.It will be the first time the US have won a medal in the mixed event. Ice hockey: Women's preliminary round (19:10)The group A game between Canada and the USA is widely expected to be a dress rehearsal for next week's gold medal match given their dominance over the rest of the world. Six of the seven Olympic finals have been contested by the sides. Canada took gold in 2022 but the USA triumphed at last year's World Championship and have won the last six meetings.Good to knowMost athletes don't get the chance to compete in one home Olympics but short track skater Arianna Fontana is about to appear in two. She will compete at Milan-Cortina 20 years after making her debut as a 15-year-old in Turin. We should get our first glimpse of her in the women's 500m (09:30), where she is the two-time defending champion. She may also feature in the mixed team relay final (11:56) – another Olympic medal would be her 12th.Ilia Malinin starts his quest for Olympic gold in men's figure skating (17:30). The American has only just turned 21 but comes to these Games as a two-time world champion.The women's singles luge medals will be decided (17:34) – and the chances are that gold will go to Germany, who have won the last seven Olympic titles. Natalie Geisenberger, the winner of the last three and one of the most successful female Winter Olympians in history, has retired, paving the way for one of her compatriots, headed by reigning world champion Julia Taubitz.Day five: Wednesday, 11 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's moguls (10:00-14:15); Women's biathlon 15km (13:15-15:10); Men's speed skating 1000m (17:30-19:00); Luge doubles (16:30-19:40); Figure skating ice dance (18:30-22:15).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's super-G (10:30-12:50)Swiss speedster Marco Odermatt will be the man to beat if the 2025 season is anything to go by – the 28-year-old finished almost 300 points clear of his nearest rival Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria in the World Cup rankings and also claimed the World Championship title in February. Shocks do occur in this sport, however, like Ryan Cochran-Siegle's silver in Beijing four years ago. The American won't be a medal favourite in Milan but every time he's reached a World Cup podium it has been on Italian snow.Ice hockey: Men's preliminary round (15:40)  The opening game of the men's ice hockey is a high-profile clash between Finland and Slovakia, the 2022 gold and bronze medallists respectively. The return of NHL players to the Olympics for the first time since 2014 means team rosters will be stacked with world-class talent. Both sides will be vying to win Group B as that would mean they advance directly to the quarter-finals without having to contest an extra match in the play-off round.Luge: Men's & women's doubles (16:00)Officially, women's doubles is the only new luge event at these Olympics but technically men's doubles is one too, as it was previously open to both sexes, albeit it was always men who took part. The women's event might offer an opportunity for a rare non-German winner, with Austria's Selina Egle and Lara Kipp winning the last two world titles. In the men's doubles, Germany's Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win gold for a remarkable fourth consecutive Games. There are two runs in each event, with the women's second run at 17:53 and the men's second run at 18:44.Curling: Men's round robin (18:05-21:05)Britain's men, skipped by Bruce Mouat, had a phenomenal 2024-25 campaign, winning the world title and becoming the first rink ever to win four Grand Slam events in one season. Now they are targeting the Olympic title that has so far eluded them, although they came mightily close in 2022, losing to Sweden in the gold medal match. GB begin their campaign against China, who had to come through the last-chance qualifying competition in December.Figure skating: Ice dance – free dance (18:30-22:05)Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson have their eyes on the podium as the ice dance reaches its conclusion. Duos from the USA and France are likely to battle it out for gold and silver but Fear and Gibson, who won World Championship bronze last year, are hoping to become the first British figure skaters since Torvill and Dean in 1994 to earn an Olympic medal. Britain's Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez will also be competing.Good to knowUSA's Chloe Kim has overcome a recent injury to begin her quest for a third straight Olympic gold in the women's snowboard halfpipe, with qualification at 09:30. This will be the first Olympic men's snowboard halfpipe competition (18:30) since 2002 that hasn't featured USA superstar Shaun White. The top 12 qualifiers in the men's and women's events advance to the final.Can anyone stop the Dutch in the men's 1000m speed skating (17:30)? They have won gold in this event at each of the past three Games, with the now-retired Thomas Krol taking the title in 2022.Defending champion Jakara Anthony bids to become the first Australian to win two Winter Olympic gold medals in the women's moguls final (13:15).Day six: Thursday, 12 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Men's moguls (09:00-12:35); Women's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Women's cross-country 10km interval (12:00-14:00); Men's snowboard cross (09:00-14:25); Women's speed skating 5000m (17:30-19:10); Mixed Luge team relay  (17:30-18:55); Women's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's 500m and men's 1000m short track (19:15-21:20).Daily highlightsSkeleton: Men's heats one and two (08:30-11:00)Beijing 2022 marked the first Winter Olympics in which Great Britain failed to win a medal in skeleton but there is every hope of putting that right in Milan-Cortina. Matt Weston dabbled with rugby and taekwondo before finding skeleton but could now become Britain's first male Olympic champion in the sport. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Weston was 15th on his Olympic debut in Beijing but has made huge progress sinceTwo-time reigning world champion Weston dominated at the World Cup this season, while team-mate Marcus Wyatt is also among the medal contenders at these Games. The first two of four runs take place today (08:30 and 10:08) on the new track in Cortina, with the final the next day.Alpine skiing: Women's Super-G (10:30)This event promises to be one of the most entertaining – and open – of the entire Games. Home hopes lie with all-rounder Sofia Goggia, while 34-year-old Swiss star Lara Gut-Behrami is seeking to retain her Olympic title before retiring from the sport. 2018 Olympic champion Ester Ledecka and returning legend Lindsey Vonn will be in the mix, as will newcomer Emma Aicher of Germany.Mexico's Sarah Schleper, soon to be 47, will be making all kinds of history as she competes in her seventh Winter Olympics. She'll be the oldest female alpine skier ever to compete at the Games, and the first woman to compete at three or more Winter Olympics for two different nations, having represented the USA from 1998 to 2010. Furthermore, her teenage son Lasse Federico Gaxiola has also been selected in alpine skiing, making them the first mother and son to compete at the same edition of an Olympic Winter Games.Snowboard: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)American Chloe Kim is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe. The 25-year-old American took two years off after winning gold in Beijing but picked up right where she left off on her return. She comes to Milan-Cortina as the reigning world champion and the favourite for gold, and says she's \"good to go\" despite dislocating her shoulder in early January.Short track: Women's 500m & men's 1000m (19:15-20:50)It could be a good day for hosts Italy. Veteran skater Arianna Fontana, competing in her sixth Olympics, is bidding for a third consecutive gold in the shortest of the short track distances. Anything can happen in the unpredictable sport of short track, which provided one of the all-time famous Winter Olympic moments when Australian Steven Bradbury took gold in the men's 1000m in 2002 after the other competitors wiped out. That final will also be held tonight and Italy have a live-wire contender in Pietro Sighel. Britain's Niall Treacy will be hoping to make an impression over his favoured distance.Good to knowWomen's curling gets under way, with Rebecca Morrison leading Great Britain's team, who start their campaign against China at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain face a rematch of the 2022 Olympic final – which they lost – against Niklas Edin's Sweden rink (13:05).Buoyed by the availability of NHL players for the first time since 2014, Canada and the USA play their opening group games in the men's ice hockey. Nine-time gold medallists Canada take on the Czech Republic at 15:40 while the USA – who haven't lifted the title since 1980 – face Latvia at 20:10.The luge team relay (17:30) is always an entertaining watch and has been extended to four legs at these Games, with the addition of women's doubles. Germany have won gold all three previous times it has been held and will be favourites once again.The fast-paced and exciting snowboard cross begins with the men's competition today (09:00). Huw Nightingale goes for Britain.Day seven: Friday, 13 FebruaryMedals: SevenMedal events: Men's cross-country 10km (11:00-12:55); Women's snowboard cross  (09:00-14:10) Men's biathlon 10km sprint (13:00-14:40); Men's speed skating 10,000m (15:30-17:10); Men's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20) Men's skeleton (18:30-21:20); Men's figure skating (18:00-22:15).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's snowboard cross (09:00-14:05)Britain's former world champion Charlotte Bankes has enjoyed plenty of success in snowboard cross but the Winter Olympics have so far produced only frustration. Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno.Figure skating: Men – free skate (18:00-22:10)We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps.Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20)Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion? The final two runs of the competition (18:30 and 20:05) will decide the medals with reigning world champion Weston already having a win on the Cortina track under his belt this season. The women's competition also begins today (15:00), with Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman and Freya Tarbit all competing for Team GB.Snowboard: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) American legend Shaun White may have retired but there will still be plenty of gasp-inducing acrobatics as riders drop into the pipe to show off their bag of tricks. Reigning world and X Games champion Scotty James won bronze in 2018 and silver in 2022 – is it finally the Australian's time to grab gold?Good to knowWomen's ice hockey enters the knockout phase, with two quarter-finals taking place. The second round of group games in the men's tournament also gets under way, with four fixtures, including Finland against Sweden at 11:10. The Finns are the reigning champions, while Sweden finished fourth in Beijing. Both have named squads packed full of NHL talent.Britain's men's curling team face hosts Italy at 09:05, while in women's curling, GB take on South Korea at 13:05.Day eight: Saturday, 14 February Medals: EightMedal events: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:05), Women's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Men's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 7.5k sprint (13:00-14:35); Women's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Women's skeleton (17:00-19:50), Men's ski jumping large hill (17:45-20:05); Women's short track 3000m relay (19:15-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Switzerland's Marco Odermatt has claimed four successive World Cups in this event and is attempting to do something that not even greats like Marcel Hirscher and Hermann Maier could manage – back-to-back Olympic gold medals in giant slalom. The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian – Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 – so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held. Can Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman or Freya Tarbit emulate the likes of Lizzy Yarnold, Amy Williams and Shelley Rudman?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Muir has recovered from knee and shoulder surgery which kept her out of action for a yearFreestyle skiing: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45)Britain's Kirsty Muir begins her campaign to better the fifth-place finish she achieved on her Olympic debut four years ago when aged just 17. Also likely to be in the field are China's California-born defending champion Eileen Gu, Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France and the sport's latest sensation, 18-year-old Flora Tabanelli. The Italian teenager, who won the Youth Olympic title in 2024, is the reigning world champion and has made a swift recovery from an ACL injury.Good to knowThe two remaining women's ice hockey quarter-finals take place, while in the men's preliminary round there's a rematch of the 2022 bronze medal game, won by Slovakia against Sweden (11.10am GMT).Round robin matches of the men's and women's curling continue, with Great Britain's women up against current world champions Canada at 09:05. Bruce Mouat's rink face the Czechs at 13:05.Britain's Niall Treacy will be among the competitors in the men's short track speed skating 1500m, with the quarter-finals getting under way at 7.15pm.Day nine: Sunday, 15 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Men's biathlon 12.5km pursuit (10:15-11:00); Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:05); Men's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Mixed team snowboard (10:00-14:05); Women's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 10km pursuit (13:45-15:00); Men's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Mixed team skeleton (17:00-19:00); Women's ski jumping - large hill (17:45-20:05).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.Good to knowThe first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Day 10: Monday, 16 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's short track 1000m (10:00-12:30); Men's slalom (09:00-14:20); Men's ski jumping super team (18:00-20:05); Women's freeski big air (18:30-20:05); Women's bobsleigh monobob (18:00-21:15); Pairs figure skating (19:00-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Dave 'the Rocket' Ryding will compete in this event at his fifth and final Games. The 38-year-old slalom specialist became the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold in 2022 and earlier this year he sealed the nation's best World Championship result by a male since 1934 by finishing sixth. However, he is not expected to reach the podium. Clement Noel of France is the defending Olympic champion, Switzerland's Loic Meillard the 2025 world champion and Henrik Kristoffersen is the most successful slalom skier ever produced by Norway, although Olympic gold has so far eluded him.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brookes first tried snowboarding aged only 18 monthsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Good to knowWomen's ice hockey reaches the semi-final stage (15:40 and 20:10). Barring any surprises, Canada and the USA will be kept apart and will be red-hot favourites to advance to the final. Six of the seven previous women's gold medal games have been contested by those two countries.It's a busy Monday for Team GB in women's curling – Rebecca Morrison's rink play Denmark at 09:05 and Switzerland at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain's quest for gold continues with Team Mouat meeting Norway at 13:05.The figure skating pairs event reaches its conclusion (19:00), with reigning world champions Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara aiming to win Japan's first Olympic title in the discipline. The pair finished seventh at the last Games but have since finished either first or second at the last four World Championships. Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are competing for Great Britain.Day 11: Tuesday, 17 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Men's biathlon 4 x 7.5km relay (13:30-15:10); Men's and women's speed skating team pursuit (13:30-16:25); Men's two-man bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's freeski big air (18:30-22:05).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Good to knowWomen's figure skating begins with the short programme (17:45). It should be an intriguing competition with the likes of three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto up against the returning Alysa Liu, who dethroned the Japanese skater at last year's World Championships, and her American team-mate, the rejuvenated Amber Glenn. Britain's Kristen Spours, who has overcome a serious back injury to make it to Milan, will also be competing.Curling round robin matches continue. Britain's women have a rest day, with the men up against Canada (18:05), the only country to have won the men's Olympic title more than once. However, the last time they earned gold was 2014. Day 12: Wednesday, 18 FebruaryMedals: EightMedal events: Men's and women's cross-country team sprint (08:45-12:15); Women's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Women's slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 4 x 6km relay (13:45-15:20); Men's 500m and women's 3000m short track (19:15-21:00).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)\"I don't want Beijing to be the reason that I'm scared of the Olympics,\" said former double Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin. \"For the past few years, it has been a little bit.\" The 30-year-old endured a nightmare 2022, failing to finish the slalom, giant slalom and the slalom portion of the combined. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Shiffrin became the youngest slalom gold medallist in Olympic history with her victory in Sochi in 2014\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle (11:30-13:10) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Good to knowIt's the quarter-finals in men's ice hockey, with the four winners from the previous day's play-off games taking on the four teams with the best record in the group stage.In curling, Great Britain's women return after a rest day to face the USA at 09:05 and Japan at 18:05. Britain's men meet the USA at 13:05 in the last of their round-robin matches.There'll be plenty of breathtaking acrobatics on display as the women's aerials final takes place (10:30). Can 35-year-old five-time Olympian Xu Mengtao of China retain her title?Day 13: Thursday, 19 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's and women's ski mountaineering sprints (08:50-13:45); Men's Nordic combined team sprint (09:00-14:00); Men's 1500m speed skating (15:30-17:10); Women's ice hockey (18:10-21:10); Women's figure skating (1800-2215).Daily highlightsSki mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Good to knowIt's the final day of the curling round robin stage, with the semi-final line-ups to be determined and – in the case of the men's competition – played on the same day. Britain's women, led by Rebecca Morrison, face hosts Italy in their final round at 13:05 while Bruce Mouat and his GB men's team will be hoping to be involved in the men's semi-finals (18:05).Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stolz made his Olympic debut in Beijing aged 17Prepare for some gravity-defying tricks and jumps in the men's aerials final (10:30). Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m.Day 14: Friday, 20 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Good to knowIt's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05).Day 15: Saturday, 21 FebruaryMedals: 10Medal events: Men's team aerials (09:45-11:35); Men's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's cross-country 50km mass start (10:00-13:05); Mixed ski mountaineering relay (12:30-13:50); Women's biathlon 12.5km mass start (13:15-14:15); Men's and women's speed skating mass start (14:00-17:00); Women's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's two-woman bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's curling (1805-2135).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's ski cross final (09:00-12:35)Beijing champion Ryan Regez suffered a torn ACL followed by a loss of form but his world title win last year shows he is now back to his best. His biggest threat could be Canada's Reece Howden, who has won the World Cup title in both of the past two years.Bobsleigh: Two-woman heats three and four (18:00 & 20:03)Germany's Laura Nolte won this event in 2022 aged 23, becoming the youngest female pilot to take gold. Since then, she and brakewoman Deborah Levi have been a model of consistency on the World Cup circuit. The USA's Kaillie Humphries won this event in 2010 and 2014 and could run Nolte close.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Atkin was ninth in the event at Beijing 2022Curling: Men's gold-medal game (18:05-21:20)Britain's Team Mouat will be hoping to be involved as the men's curling reaches its conclusion. The quartet who competed in the 2022 final are all back in Milan-Cortina and determined to upgrade the silver they took home last time to gold, which would be Britain's first in Olympic men's curling since 1924. The bronze medal game in the women's curling starts at 13:05 GMT.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Can Britain's Zoe Atkin dethrone China's Eileen Gu as the Olympic champion? The US-born 21-year-old is the reigning world champion but will be up against a stacked field, likely to also include Li Fanghui, her biggest rival last season and the skier with whom she shared the overall 2024-25 World Cup title.Good to knowAs well as the conclusion of the two-woman event, the opening two heats of the four-man bobsleigh take place (09:00 and 10:57). Germany – particularly pilot Francesco Friedrich – have monopolised major titles in recent years but the British crew driven by Brad Hall also have podium aspirations.The most gruelling event in the Winter Olympics is cross country skiing's 50km mass start (10:00). The men's medals will be decided on Saturday and current world champion Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the red hot favourite. Team GB's Andrew Musgrave is competing in his fifth Winter Olympics.Day 16: Sunday, 22 FebruaryMedals: FourMedal events: Men's four-man bobsleigh (09:00-12:20); Women's cross-country 50km mass start (09:00-12:35); Women's curling (12:05-13:35); Men's ice hockey (12:40-15:40)Daily highlightsBobsleigh: Four-man heats three and four (09:00 & 11:12)History beckons for German great Francesco Friedrich on the final day of the Games. The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in BeijingCurling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.Good to knowWith all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held.Related topicsShort Track SkatingCurlingLugeSpeed SkatingWinter SportsNordic CombinedIce HockeyAlpine SkiingCross-Country SkiingBobsleighBiathlonSkeletonSnowboardingWinter OlympicsSki JumpingFreestyle SkiingFigure Skating",

    "body": "1 hour agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesSinger Chappell Roan says she has left the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman, whose name appears in the Epstein files.Announcing her split with the agency, Roan said she has a \"duty to protect her team\" and her decision reflected her belief that \"meaningful change in our industry requires accountability\".Wasserman has been criticised after his flirtatious emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, sent in 2003, were revealed among the millions of files published in relation to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Roan made no mention of Epstein, nor the Epstein files, in her statement on Instagram announcing her departure.\"As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman,\" she said. Roan added: \"No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\" The BBC has reached out to Wasserman for comment.Wasserman is also the chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games, and has faced calls to step down from the position following the release of the emails.He said in a statement that his correspondence with Maxwell \"took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light\".Who is in the Epstein files?Wasserman also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" he said.\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.Roan's announcement comes after two other bands represented by Wasserman released statements indicating they wanted to distance themselves from his agency.Wednesday, a self-described indie rock band, said they were \"aghast\" to see Wasserman feature in the Epstein files and did not want to continue to be associated with him. They said that they hoped he would step down \"for the sake of his staff\".Rock band Beach Bunny said they were \"hugely disappointed and disgusted\" that Wasserman \"had involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoNardine SaadAFP via Getty ImagesThe Gordie Howe International Bridge will connect southern Detroit, Michigan, USA, and Windsor, Ontario, Canada when completedPresident Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of a bridge connecting the US and Canada until Washington is \"fully compensated for everything\" it has given to its northern neighbour.The Gordie Howe International Bridge, connecting the Canadian province of Ontario to the US state of Michigan, would not open until Ottawa \"treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve\", Trump wrote on social media.According to the project's website, the bridge is being funded by the Canadian government but will be publicly owned by both Canada and Michigan.It is not clear how Trump could block its opening but he said negotiations would begin immediately, without elaborating.Spanning the Detroit River, the bridge is expected to open to traffic pending formal tests and approvals in early 2026. Construction began in 2018, but the project has been a point of contention between the countries for more than a decade.It is estimated to have cost $6.4bn CAD (£3.4bn), according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In the statement on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that the US should own \"at least one half of this asset\". He also suggested that Canada owned both the Canadian and US sides of the bridge.The organisation developing the bridge, the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, is wholly owned by the Canadian government, according to the project's website.Trump wrote: \"The Canadian Government expects me, as President of the United States, to PERMIT them to just 'take advantage of America!'\"\"I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them,\" he added.The Moroun family - the American owners of the neighbouring Ambassador Bridge that also connects Detroit to Canada - appealed to Trump during his first term to stop construction of the new bridge, arguing that it infringed on their exclusive ability to collect tolls. In response, Trump and then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a joint statement saying the bridge was a \"vital economic link\" between the countries. Trump on Monday pointed to recent trade disputes between the two countries, saying that \"the Tariffs Canada charges us for our Dairy products have, for many years, been unacceptable\". Trump continued: \"The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.\"Canada's bridge authority, the Ontario premier's office and the Detroit mayor's office did not immediately response to requests for comment.

    "body": "7 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesAward-winning actress Catherine O'Hara died of a pulmonary embolism, her death certificate in the US has revealed. O'Hara died on 30 January in a Los Angeles hospital, at the age of 71. In addition to the blood clot in her lungs, the death certificate listed rectal cancer as the long-term cause of death. It was indicated that she had been receiving treatment for the cancer since March 2025. Tributes have poured in for the Canadian actress, who most recently appeared in the Emmy-winning comedy The Studio and The Last of Us.O'Hara rememberedActor and The Studio creator Seth Rogen said he was devastated by O'Hara's death, describing the actress as \"hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous\". \"We're all lucky we got to live in a world with her in it,\" he said.Actor Pedro Pascal, who worked with O'Hara on The Last of Us, wrote on Instagram: \"Oh, genius to be near you. Eternally grateful. There is less light in my world, this lucky world that had you, will keep you, always.\"The actress starred in six seasons of comedy series Schitt's Creek, for which she won an Emmy for best comedy actress. Show creator and co-star Eugene Levy told People magazine that he has had the \"honor of knowing and working with the great Catherine O'Hara for over fifty years\".\"Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today,\" he said. Co-creator Dan Levy, who played O'Hara's son David, described her as \"family before she ever played my family\".He added on Instagram that he would \"cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her\".O'Hara's on-screen son in holiday classics Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, Macaulay Culkin, also paid an emotional tribute on Instagram.\"Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you,\" he wrote.\"I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later.\"O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch, her sons Matthew and Luke, and her six siblings.What is a pulmonary embolism?According to the NHS, a pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood vessel in the lungs is blocked by a blood clot.Symptoms include a sudden difficulty in breathing, chest pain that increases when breathing and coughing up blood.

    "body": "10 hours agoAmy WalkerGetty ImagesTemperatures are rising after days of extreme cold and snow in the city A total of 18 people have died as a result of a period of extreme cold weather in New York City, its mayor has said.Since late January, the city has endured a cold snap, including 13 days of temperatures of 0C (32F) or below – one of the longest stretches of sub-zero weather New York has seen in six decades.Over the weekend, another person \"lost their life on the streets of our city,\" Zohran Mamdani said on Monday, adding that \"each life lost is a tragedy, and we will continue to hold their families in our thoughts\".While temperatures are set to rise this week, they remain below average, with Mamdani telling residents to \"stay safe, stay indoors... [and] keep looking out for one another\".The mayor added that since 19 January, when a Code Blue emergency was announced - which relaxed intake policies for homeless shelters - about 1,400 placements had been made into shelters.An additional 64 hotel rooms had been added to the city's shelter capacity, with at least another 150 outreach workers on the streets, said Mamdani.On 27 January, Mamdani said at least 10 of the people who had died were found outdoors. The circumstances of the other deaths are not known.\"We have been working hard to keep New Yorkers safe, and we will continue to do so. Because it is not forecast to be above 32 degrees [Fahrenheit] until tomorrow, and 35 degrees is hardly balmy weather,\" he said.Getty ImagesNew York City was under an extreme cold warning over the weekendThe US National Weather Service (NWS) said temperatures would increase to about 0C for the most part of the week, following persistent freezing temperatures on Monday. It added that highs were normally around 4C at this time in the year.An Arctic airmass brought hazardous sub-zero \"wind chills\" - the temperature it feels like rather than the temperature it is - to the region over the weekend, bringing a risk of hypothermia and frostbite, the forecaster said.NYC's Emergency Management agency said that following days of extreme cold and snow pose serious safety risks remained across the city.It warned that melting snow and ice could fall from buildings without warning and that streets and pavements could refreeze overnight.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBBCHealth Secretary Wes Streeting has been accused of attempting a \"No 10 coup\", reports the Daily Telegraph in its top story. It characterises his publication of texts with former British ambassador to the US Lord Peter Mandelson as \"an attempt by Mr Streeting to neutralise any obstacles in a future leadership contest\". Lord Mandelson's appointment to the position came at a time when it was publicly known he had maintained a friendship with the late Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction for paedophilia. The appointment has come under fresh scrutiny after the publication of the latest Epstein files by the US justice department. The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.The Times headlines with the \"PM comes out fighting as cabinet falls in line\" after \"surviving an attempt to force him from office\". After Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for the PM's departure, one minister tells the paper Sarwar was \"Streeting's outrider\", while another said he had \"bottled it\". The Financial Times also leads with Starmer and Streeting, saying the former \"defies calls to stand down\" as allies have accused the latter of \"fuelling crisis\". Lower down the page is a report that the US embassy in London has been denying visas to \"top executives over petty offences going back to the 1970s\", as US President Donald Trump's \"immigration clampdown extends to the UK\". \"Resign now!\" demands the Daily Express, saying Starmer is on the \"brink as calls to go mount\". The paper says the PM had to \"plead for his future\".The Guardian leads with \"embattled\" Starmer's rebuttal: \"I'm not prepared to walk away\". In an exclusive, it says a leadership website for former Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner briefly appeared online in January, which her team have labelled \"fake\". After the \"mauled PM wins cabinet backing\", Metro asks \"how long?\" Also on its front is a photo of King Charles III as he is heckled on a visit to Clitheroe over his brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's links to Epstein. The King has announced that Buckingham Palace is ready to support the police as they consider allegations against his brother. The cabinet have been \"bounced into giving PM stay of execution\" according to the Daily Mail. In a double header, the paper also notes the \"King's 'profound concern' over Andrew claims as Palace ready to work with police\".The King announcement also tops the Daily Mirror in the latest \"royal bombshell for Andrew\". It says the King's move is \"an unprecedented development\", that comes as the Prince and Princess of Wales have said their \"thoughts remain focussed on the victims\". The impact of the fallout from the Epstein files on the royal family also leads the Daily Star in an echo of the Mirror with \"King: We'll help police.\" The paper also promises the \"full story as Starmer fights for survival\". And in a merger of the day's top stories, the Sun marks the King's promise to \"help cops on Andy\" as coming \"as PM fights to cling on\". Thames Valley Police have said they are examining claims that Andrew shared confidential trade secrets with Epstein, the paper writes.In its commentary, the Daily Mirror says the prime minister \"held his ground\", but that \"governing with a purpose must follow\". The Daily Express asks: \"Wouldn't it be more honourable to quit now?\"The Daily Mirror calls the King's offer to \"assist police with their investigations\" into his brother a \"royal bombshell for Andrew\". The Sun says the statement is \"unprecedented\". The Mail's commentary says the intervention is \"significant\" but there is \"one word no one in the House of Winsdor seems able to utter: sorry.\" Andrew Mountbatten Windsor has previously denied any wrongdoing.The Financial Times says the US embassy in London is denying visas over petty offences, in some cases going back to the 1970s. Lawyers say executives are among those affected, in what the paper calls a \"sign of how far-reaching the US anti-immigration drive has become\". The state department said it was \"upholding the highest standards of national security through the visa process\".And, the Times says you can buy a \"former royal island\" for the price of \"a modest semi-detached house in the home counties\". The paper says Ynys Gifftan, which sits within Yr Wyddfa national park (Snowdon), was once owned by Queen Anne but could now be yours for £350,000. It says while the island has no electricity it does have \"a mains water pipe and a septic tank\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorPA MediaStarmer (centre) left Downing Street in his private vehicle on Monday evening after a day of political pressureThe prime minister has had a political near-death experience – and survived, for now at least.At various points, he looked like he might be done for and imminently.If Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar's desire to dislodge Sir Keir Starmer had had public accomplices, that could have been it.There was a crucial pivot point on Monday afternoon when things could have gone in one of two ways.If others had said Sir Keir should go, he might not have got to the end of the day without announcing his departure.But instead, there was a rallying of support from the cabinet and from various wings of the Labour Party.Let's be clear: missives of loyalty from cabinet ministers towards the prime minister shouldn't be newsworthy and they only become so when the opposite seems feasible.The sheer volume of social media posts only served to underline just how perilous Sir Keir's position had been: he needed political scaffolding to prop him up from wherever it could be found.But that support did come and he has seen off, for now, the moment of maximum danger for him.It is, though, also true that this has been a deeply wounding week for Sir Keir and he is weaker for it.And jeopardy peppers the diary ahead for him.There is the Gorton and Denton by-election in Greater Manchester in just over a fortnight.Then there are the Scottish and Welsh devolved elections, and English local elections, in May.If either or both of those dates are doomladen for Labour, who gets the blame?I detect a sense, taking a step back, that while concerns within the party about Sir Keir have been notching up remorselessly for months, the sheer horror of the Lord Mandelson revelations repulsed so many, so quickly, things quickly accelerated to a crunch point – is it time to change leader?The party has blinked and thought better of it, for now. The recurring sentiment I pick up isn't a sudden conversion to gushing support for Sir Keir Starmer, but deep concern about being the authors of yet more spectacular political turbulence: bundling out an (albeit deeply unpopular) prime minister with a mandate from the electorate and picking someone between themselves who has no such public mandate. Or, as one Labour figure put it to me, \"behaving just like the Conservatives did\".That, Labour MPs have collectively concluded, is too big a leap, for now.As the prime minister attempts to reset, again, and set out what his government is all about, we expect an announcement that the country's most senior civil servant, Chris Wormald, is to leave his job.And what has happened at Westminster in recent days will continue to ripple through our politics in the days, weeks and months to come.In time, Parliament voting for the publication of no end of documents and messages prompted by the Lord Mandelson scandal could yet provoke embarrassment and diplomatic headaches with Washington.One man, noted for his prime ministerial ambitions, has decided to get ahead of that.Health Secretary Wes Streeting's transparent attempts to cleanse his reputation, after years of association with Lord Mandelson, by publishing their text exchanges, is a reminder of the job he quite fancies after the one he is doing now.And it is a reminder that the story of the consequences of recent days is far from over.",

    "body": "Savannah Guthrie pleads for help finding missing mother as purported ransom deadline passes7 hours agoMax MatzaWatch: \"We are at an hour of desperation\", says Guthrie in new plea for missing motherA purported ransom deadline for the safe return of Savannah Guthrie's mother has passed, shortly after the US news anchor issued a fresh plea for help.In a video posted on Instagram, Guthrie said her family is \"at an hour of desperation\".As the Monday deadline of 17:00 local time (00:00 GMT) approached, officials said they had still not identified a suspect or person of interest in the investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and was last seen on 31 January. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.ReutersThe FBI said they are not aware of \"any continued communication between the Guthrie family and suspected kidnappers\". It is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for any information. The FBI also said it is taking an email with a ransom note sent to US media outlets stating the Monday deadline seriously, the BBC's US partner CBS reported.A previous alleged deadline for ransom, which was meant to be paid in Bitcoin, passed on 5 February. Nancy Guthrie was reported missing when she did not attend a Sunday church service on 1 February and other members grew concerned.The family has released three previous videos saying they were willing to speak to the potential kidnapper, and asking to provide proof that her mother was alive.The family had earlier indicated that they would be willing to pay for her safe return.\"I just want to share a few thoughts as we enter another week of this nightmare,\" Guthrie says, appearing alone in the latest video, in contrast to previous recordings where she has appeared with her siblings.   \"She was taken, and we don't know where. And we need your help,\" Guthrie says.Guthrie requests people everywhere, \"even if you're far from Tucson\", to report anything suspicious that could lead to clues about her mother.She continues: \"If you see anything, if you hear anything, if there's anything at all that seems strange to you, that you report to law enforcement\".In an update just before Monday's deadline, the Pima County Sheriff's Office said it did not have any new information to release publicly. The sheriff's statement added that the \"investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance remains active and ongoing\", and that \"the FBI is handling all aspects related to any ransom note(s) or communications involving the Guthrie family\".The FBI also released a statement, saying that FBI agents from around the country \"continue to deploy to Tucson\".\"We are currently operating a 24-hour command post that includes crisis management experts, analytic support, and investigative teams. But we still need the public's help,\" the FBI statement added, including the number for the FBI's tip line.'We will pay': Savannah Guthrie's new message about missing motherAt a news briefing last week, FBI Special Agent Heith Janke said his agency was reviewing a ransom note sent to several media outlets.The note gave a deadline for payment of 17:00 on Thursday, he said, without specifying which time zone, and had a second deadline for Monday.On Monday, FBI Director Kash Patel arrived in Tucson, on a trip that was scheduled prior to Guthrie's disappearance.

    "body": "6 hours agoEmily HoltRebecca SommersRebecca says she wanted to reignite a fading connection with her partner after they became parents.Rebecca has been with her husband for 10 years, but since having three children over the past three years she has grown \"disconnected\" from him. \"We are just cohabiting, like we're not a couple. We are just parents,\" she says. Like many parents, they struggle to find time to spend alone.\"Our kids are so young and they are so demanding that it's hard to even get five minutes to catch up and we're both exhausted come the end of the day.\"She says the dynamic of her relationship changed after she gave birth to her first child. \"We knew it was going to be different when we started trying for our first baby, but I think the gravity of it, we weren't expecting how different it would be.\" In Rebecca's case, her whole life has changed as she's switched from working full time to becoming a full time mother, and says she has struggled to open up with her partner about her feelings. \"His life is still his life. He does see how hard it is for me at home and also our relationship, he knows it's affected, but he'd never bring it up.\"Getty ImagesKate Moyle, psychosexual and relationship therapist, says it's normal for relationships to change after becoming parents.\"There's nothing that can prepare you for becoming parents. You think you know yourselves really well as a couple,  and then everything you think you know about someone is gone.\"The early years are typically the toughest with studies suggesting relationship dissatisfaction is often highest within the first three years of a child being born.Kate says making changes to improve your relationship is not about trying to get back to life before children, but about adapting.\"It's never going to look the same as it looked before, but we have to think about it in a new way now.\"Make time to hug and kissShe advises thinking about the small things such as eye contact or touch that you can do with the time you have in the day together to make you feel like a couple again. \"We call this sexual currency in my world, which is, you know, a hand squeeze, a hug, a quick kiss, anything that makes you connected.\"And when we have those opportunities, drop everything else and just prioritise that.\"Kate says small actions like this can have a big impact on improving a romantic relationship.\"When you're in the thick of it, that's not the time to say we need to change everything.\"She says a kiss or a touch then become bridges for bigger moments of intimacy and connection in the relationship. Be open about how you feelKate also recommends using a quiet moment to be honest about how the relationship is going.\"Their attention is the thing that we often miss. We feel separate, and then we think that our partner also feels separate, and we have this gap between us.\"Like friendships and families, Kate says you have to invest and nurture your relationship throughout, not just at the start.\"It takes work and adaptation and paying attention when we feel like we have nothing left.\"Spend time together without the kidsSam Owen, relationship coach and author, says after children you often need to \"get to know each other\" again, suggesting dates or conversations about interests outside your kids.Dates could include things like massages, checking into a hotel with a creche facility, playing games, getting creative with paint or drawing or cooking a nice meal together,\" she says. \"It's consciously creating a habit of connecting so it becomes part of your relationship.\" She says physical intimacy is also important.\"It's a vital glue for keeping your relationship together, it helps improve communication and reduce couple conflict.\" Since talking to CBeebies Parenting Helpline about her relationship, Rebecca says her and her husband have done several different things to improve their relationship.She says they now make sure they have meals still together with their children, but without their phones, which she says makes conversation flow easier without distractions. They also make sure they spend some time together each evening after they have put the kids to bed, often watching a film or TV show which she says means they now have an offiical time to relax together.\"Relationships take work, if you both want it then you will always find a way back to each other, don't shy away from the hard conversations and hold tight,\" says Rebecca.Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "11 hours agoGlenn CampbellScotland political editorPA MediaSarwar has indicated that his loyalty to Starmer only stretches so farThis was a big, bold intervention from Anas Sarwar - to be the first leading Labour figure to call for the prime minister to go.He has done so out of frustration and anger.Anger at the prime minister's handling of the Mandelson mess.He said on Thursday that the Labour peer should never have been considered for the job of UK ambassador to Washington.That was a pretty heavy criticism of Starmer albeit that he said at that time it could be possible for him to remain PM.PA MediaAnas Sarwar spoke out at a hastily-arranged press conference in GlasgowSarwar's position hardened over the weekend.He is no longer prepared to defend a prime minister in whom he has lost confidence.He is frustrated that the PM's accepted misjudgement in appointing Mandelson, despite his known links to Jeffrey Epstein, is not an isolated error.Many in Scottish Labour believe the blunders and about turns that have marked Starmer's leadership are wrecking their Holyrood election campaign.Just 18 months ago, Sarwar looked like a contender for the job of first minister - a serious challenger to the SNP's John Swinney.Today, Scottish Labour appears to be trailing the SNP by a long way if the trend in opinion polls and the party's own canvassing paints an accurate picture.Sarwar felt that if he did nothing his prospects were unlikely to improve.Instead, he has taken a big gamble and decided to do something - taking a stand on Starmer's leadership in the hope that it changes the political weather.At first glance, he has opened up divisions in Scottish Labour with MSPs like Jackie Baillie and Monica Lennon backing him and MPs like the Scottish secretary Douglas Alexander and his predecessor Ian Murray rallying behind the prime minister.If support for Starmer hardens and he remains in office - the rift between him and Sarwar could run through Labour's Holyrood campaign.How would a potential first minister Sarwar be able to do business with prime minister Starmer having called for him to go?Far from removing the Downing Street dimension from the Scottish debate, it could make it more of a thing - especially if UK ministers campaign in Scotland.The former Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross got himself into a similar position when he called for Boris Johnson to quit over Covid parties.Of course, it is still possible that Starmer is forced out sooner rather than later.What's next?Maybe Sarwar will not be the first senior figure in the party to pressure the PM to step down. Maybe that pressure will become too much.There is a difficult by-election coming soon in Gorton and Denton. Might a bad result for Labour there provide new momentum for a change at the top?If the prime minister goes, perhaps some in Labour and in the voting public will give Sarwar credit for having raised his doubts.The SNP would certainly need a new slogan having urged voters to back them to get rid of Starmer. That line certainly doesn't work if he's already gone.Arguably, it's a bit suspect anyway given that the primary purpose of a Holyrood election is to choose a Scottish government.If Starmer goes soonish that still doesn't stop Westminster political drama distracting from debates about the NHS, education and housing in Scotland.The big questions in UK politics would be about who should replace Starmer? Will there be a coronation or a contest?And in Scotland, Sarwar would repeatedly be asked who would he prefer to take over? Does he back the stance of this or that potential candidate?However this plays out, Sarwar has signalled that he is his own man rather than Labour's branch office manager in Scotland.But taking a stand against his UK party leader still risks trashing a brand under which they both campaign.",

    "body": "11 hours agoDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentandJoe Pike,Politics investigations correspondentPA MediaHealth Secretary Wes Streeting has been talked of as a potential leadership challenger to the prime ministerHealth Secretary Wes Streeting has released his messages with former US ambassador Peter Mandelson, as he insists they were not close friends.Among them are messages from March 2025, where Streeting said he thinks he is \"toast\" at the next election, and others where he criticised the government for having \"no [economic] growth strategy\".Writing in the Guardian, Streeting said he had decided to publish the messages \"after a weekend of smear and innuendo that I have something to hide\".The health secretary said he thought Lord Mandelson's appointment was \"a good move\" at the time, but admitted he \"did not think enough about the appointment or the past that was known\".Streeting's team said they released all private messages between the pair from six months before Lord Mandelson's appointment in December 2024 to the present day.Some have a friendly, warmer tone, and the occasional exchange of an \"x\" to signal a kiss.Writing in the Guardian, Streeting said \"contrary to what has been widely reported, I was not a close friend of Peter Mandelson, but I am not going to wash my hands of my actual association with him either\".Lord Mandelson was sacked last year as the UK ambassador to Washington and resigned as a Labour member last week, over his links with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Streeting said: \"Mandelson and I saw each other for dinner on average once a year, in a group setting. He offered advice. My partner worked for him 25 years ago and I therefore got to know him better than others of that generation in politics.\"The released text messages show Streeting feared Labour were \"in big trouble\" electorally, with voters having no clear reason to support the party. He also criticised the government for having \"no growth strategy at all\".In March 2025, an exchange begins with them discussing Matthew Doyle, who had recently left his job as Sir Keir Starmer's director of communications.Mandelson asked: \"Why was he pushed out?\"Streeting replied: \"God knows\". To which Mandelson responded: \"the government's problems do not stem from comms\".Streeting agreed: \"quite\".Streeting then said he was concerned that he could lose his own parliamentary seat at the next general election.\"I fear we're in big trouble here - and I am toast at the next election. \"We just lost our safest ward in Redbridge (51% Muslim, Ilford S) to a Gaza independent. At this rate I don't think we'll hold either of the two Ilford seats,\" he said.And in a clear, if indirect, criticism of Sir Keir's leadership, Streeting said \"there isn't a clear answer to the question: why Labour?\"In a separate set of messages from July 2025, Streeting sought advice from Lord Mandelson after French President Emmanuel Macron announced he would be formally recognising a Palestinian state.Streeting said \"morally and politically, I think we need to join France\".He added that \"politically, a Commons vote will be engineered in September on recognition, and we will lose it if we're not ahead of it. There are no circumstances in which people like me or Shabana [Mahmood] could abstain or vote against\".Lord Mandelson replied that he was \"worried that such a gesture now could blow a 2 SS [two state solution] out of the water if Israel decided that unilateral recognition justified further WB [West Bank] annexation\".Streeting replied that \"Israel is doing it anyway\" and said \"this is rogue state behaviour. Let them pay the price as pariahs with sanctions applied to the state, not just a few ministers\".The health secretary said there is considerable unhappiness among Labour MPs, and there could be \"resignations at every level\" in the government over the issue.Lord Mandelson replied that \"if those events unfolded it would certainly convince the public that we are unfit for government\".In September, Sir Keir announced the UK's recognition of a Palestinian state. Ministers highlighted the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law, as a key factor in the decision.The move drew fierce criticism from the Israeli government, families of hostages held in Gaza and some Conservatives.Writing in the Guardian, Streeting said he was not involved in the decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as ambassador in 2024, and \"like many other people I thought it was a good move at the time\".He added: \"I filtered the news of it entirely through the lens of whether it seemed a sensible way to help our relationship with a critical ally at a crucial moment.\"Streeting said the appointment was a \"scandal\", adding that \"the really worrying aspect is... a candidate's known association with a convicted sexual predator did not weigh heavily enough on decision-makers\".\"We need to think too about the silence of those who stood by, who knew enough to feel uneasy and yet did not speak loudly enough to influence the decision. This is a group I include myself in.\" He said the government's response should go deeper than reforming vetting procedures, and should deal with the fact that \"for too long, proximity to power insulated powerful, wealthy and well-connected men from the consequences of their appalling behaviour towards women and girls\".Streeting's decision to publish his text messages with Lord Mandelson has various aims - and all are connected to his ambition to become the next prime minister.Firstly, he wants to distance himself from the former ambassador. To try to demonstrate the pair are not that close, and to scotch claims that his links to Lord Mandelson could ruin a future leadership pitch. He believes he has nothing to hide and, with the prime minister's premiership teetering, he needs to quickly minimise doubts among potential supporters on the backbenches.Secondly, Streeting hopes the intervention helps project him as a confident, decisive and front-footed politician. And this arguably creates a clear contrast with the more cautious instincts of the prime minister.Thirdly, the health secretary is probably keen to show Labour MPs that he is a little like them: privately frustrated about the state of the economy, worried about holding onto his constituency, and even excited to meet a famous US politician - the Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg.Fourthly, his messages show some views that are likely to be widely-shared amongst the Labour members - who will be the ones ultimately deciding on the next party leader.In particular, Streeting's push for the UK to recognise a Palestinian state before Sir Keir made that shift. As for accusations that these messages have been selectively chosen, Streeting's team insist these are all the WhatsApps between the pair from six months before Lord Mandelson's appointment to Monday.There are certainly moments in the messages that some might find cringe-worthy - including the kisses from both Lord Mandelson and Streeting to each other. But there is nothing so embarrassing as to stop a leadership bid in its tracks, and the health secretary wants to prove that fast.",

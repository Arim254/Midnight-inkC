    "body": "Phase one of their seismic change has been executed.The shock of 450 redundancies.Virtually a complete overhaul of senior management.Significant changes purposely carried out at speed in a bid to ensure the process was not dragged out and the inevitable unease could start to settle much quicker.After the Manchester United exodus has come the rebuild.BBC Sport tells the story of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Old Trafford revolution.When he paid £1.25bn for a 27.7% stake in United on Christmas Eve 2023, Ratcliffe vowed to take the club back to the top of the English game. He also wanted to make it profitable.Eye-watering financial losses of £113.2m to 30 June 2024 subsequently led Ratcliffe to claim the following March that, without action, the club would \"go bust\" by Christmas.The impact of the on-pitch upheaval is there for all to see.Erik ten Hag was replaced as manager by Ruben Amorim. More than £450m was invested in the first-team squad. Ratcliffe spent £50m overhauling United's Carrington training complex.Behind the scenes the changes have been seismic.The motivation was twofold.As they assessed the inner workings of the club, senior figures around the ownership concluded it was \"over-dimensioned\", according to one observer close to the process.In other words, there were too many people and too many jobs.They found a structure which they felt required United to be playing in the Champions League every season and competing to win the Premier League. Failure put a strain on finances.Having reached such a view and with losses so high, slashing staff numbers was a harsh but inevitable reality.An initial cull of 250 staff within months of Ratcliffe's arrival was carried out to get the numbers down.It is accepted internally that the pain created was extensive, the shock huge.It was the second round of 200 redundancies this year that allowed the hierarchy to pursue a different staffing model, so finance could be used in what was felt to be a more efficient way.Nowhere is the impact of that more evident than in United's data operation.In an interview with the popular United We Stand fanzine in December 2024, Ratcliffe described the club's approach to data analysis as being in the \"last century\".It was felt that Formula 1 was the sport at the cutting edge of data and AI use. The performance of every single component is monitored in fine detail, and success and failure can be measured in hundredths of a second.As a result, Michael Sansoni's arrival from the Mercedes F1 team as director of data in April was one of the least surprising moves.Sansoni has completely revamped United's data capabilities, which are now being used extensively across performance, recruitment and training.Precise details of the work Sansoni has implemented are a closely guarded secret, but one source said the work of United's data and analytics team has accelerated to such a degree it is now \"among the top four teams\".Following the second set of job cuts there was a strategic focus to bring in what have been described as \"versatile people who are multi-faceted and multi-skilled to help in multiple areas\".It is the senior appointments that really catch the eye, though.A quick list of new arrivals among senior staff at the Old Trafford club unearths 19 names.Not all the exits were forced and, as at any big organisation, a change in ownership can lead to movement further down - but the scale of change has been significant.Two notable figures remain: Collette Roche and Martin Mosley.Chief operating officer Roche is leading United's representation around their proposed 100,000-capacity new stadium and the wider Old Trafford regeneration.Mosley joined United in 2007 and took over as general counsel in the summer of 2024 following the departure of Patrick Stewart, who is now chief executive at Rangers.Roche and Mosley's presence is regarded as a crucial link to the pre-Ratcliffe era while those running the club get a full understanding of the scale of United, which can come as a shock, even for those - like chief executive Omar Berrada (Barcelona/Manchester City), chief business officer Marc Armstrong (Paris St Germain), performance director Sam Erith (Manchester City/Tottenham/FA) and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell (Chelsea/Red Bull) - with experience of working at big clubs.Trusted Ineos figure Roger Bell has become United's chief finance officer and Kirstin Furber has arrived from Channel 4 as people director.But it goes much further. A head of sports medicine and, for the first team, a new doctor, a new physio and a new performance chef. Experts in nutrition and soft tissue treatment. Academy director. Media director. All part of the nuts and bolts at a leading Premier League club in 2025.So many significant figures from the previous era, who negotiated key deals, treated players and presented the public face of the club, have gone.No-one can be sure if the future will be better.As with every other club, external judgement of the success or failure of off-field change can be swift and it is almost always connected to results of the first team, which by their nature can hinge on arbitrary moments.There is an acceptance internally at United of an unquantifiable lag time between inception of new processes and their outcome.Sometimes, though, it becomes obvious a certain move has failed.Dan Ashworth clearly falls into that category. Highly respected in the game, Ashworth's willingness to leave Newcastle to take up the job of sporting director is still felt at Old Trafford to be a positive and reflected well on the changes being made and future direction anticipated.However, after United paid Newcastle £3m in compensation, within five months he was gone.Sources deny that a split occurred around the choice of Ten Hag's replacement.But there was a difference of opinion, the respective views of how Ashworth's job should work did not fit and a parting of the ways - with another compensation payment, in the region of £4m - was viewed as the inevitable outcome.As we approach the second anniversary of Ratcliffe's involvement, United are a much-changed organisation.Those gargantuan losses have been cut to a manageable size. United's latest accounts to 30 June 2025 showed they were at £33m. It is anticipated that the club will eventually become profitable.The Glazer family, it is stressed, are not passive observers. They remain active and engaged. But the focus is now on Ratcliffe and his leadership team.\"What is happening next week or in the next transfer window is part of life, but an eye needs to be kept on the mid and the long term,\" says a club insider.European football of any description is this season's goal.But the sweeping changes have not been made to achieve that. The targets are bigger.\"If you are at Manchester United the thought process has to be around competing to win the Premier League and Champions League every year,\" says someone with an understanding of how the club is being run.\"That is a huge pressure. But it should also be regarded as a privilege.\"",

The Chair of the BBC, Samir Shah said “the BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement”.\nThe BBC has been given a Friday deadline by Trump to respond or face possible legal action, with the US president threatening to sue the corporation for a billion dollars.   \nAnthony and Marianna speak to Elie Honig, CNN’s Senior Legal Analyst who assesses the likelihood of the case ending up in court, and how any damages could be calculated. We also look at whether any of Trump’s previous legal actions against other media outlets can predict how this dispute may play out.\nPlus, newly released emails between Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein from 2011 allege that Donald Trump 'spent hours' with one of Epstein’s victims. The documents have been published by House Democrats and refer to the president as the \"dog that hasn't barked.” Donald Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has accused Democrats of “trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects.”\nAnthony and Marianna unpack what this means for the administration and whether it could affect the president’s approval ratings.\nHOSTS:\n* Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations correspondent\n* Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nGUEST:\n* Elie Honig, Senior Legal Analyst at CNN\nGET IN TOUCH:\n* Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n* Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n* Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n* Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Billionaire UK businessman Joe Lewis, whose family trust owns Tottenham Hotspur football club, has received a pardon from US President Donald Trump.Lewis, 88, pleaded guilty to insider trading as part of an agreement with prosecutors in 2024 that saw him avoid prison. He was accused of passing on information about his companies to his private pilots, friends, personal assistants and romantic partners in a fraud that authorities said netted millions of dollars in profit.A White House official said Trump approved the pardon for Lewis, who requested it so he could receive medical treatment and visit his grandchildren and great grandchildren in the US.\"Mr Lewis admitted he made a terrible mistake, did not fight extradition in the case, and paid a $5 million fine,\" the official told the BBC.In a statement, Lewis said:  \"I am pleased all of this is now behind me, and I can enjoy retirement and watch as my family and extended family continue to build our businesses based on the quality and pursuit of excellence that has become our trademark.\"Confirming the pardon to the BBC, a source close to the Lewis family said they were  \"extremely grateful\" for the pardon, and thanked Trump.Lewis founded the investment firm Tavistock Group, which has ownership stakes in a large array of property, sports, finance, energy and life sciences companies.He was ranked 39th in the 2023 Sunday Times Rich List, with an estimated worth of more than £5bn ($6.4bn).He was arrested in July 2023 and charged with sixteen counts of securities fraud and three counts of conspiracy.Prosecutors had alleged that between 2013 and 2021, he abused his access to corporate board rooms and passed the insider information on to his contacts.US attorney Damian Williams said those contacts made millions of dollars in \"sure thing\" bets on the stock market.In one instance, according to an indictment, Lewis told a girlfriend to invest in a biotech company in July 2019, before the results of a clinical trial by the company were made public.He then allegedly logged into her bank account himself and used $700,000 to invest into the company, eventually netting a profit of $849,000.In 2024, Lewis pleaded guilty to conspiracy and two counts of securities fraud as part of a deal with prosecutors. He was later fined $5m and sentenced to three years of probation.Lewis is best known for his ownership of Tottenham Hotspur football club, which he bought a controlling stake in for £22m in 2001 - a sum then worth around $32m.In 2022, control was handed over to a family trust, and financial documents the club filed with the UK's Companies House indicate that Lewis no longer has \"significant control\" over the club.",

    "body": "Israel has confirmed it has received a coffin Hamas says contains the body of another hostage.Red Cross vehicles collected the body hours after Hamas issued a joint statement with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad saying it had located it in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza.The Israeli prime minister's office said the body will be transferred to Israel, where it will be received at a military ceremony before undergoing an identification process.Confirmation that it belongs to a hostage would mean 25 out of 28 deceased hostages have been handed over to Israel under the first phase of the current ceasefire deal which forms part of a US plan to end the Gaza war. Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.For each dead Israeli hostage returned, Israel has agreed to hand over the remains of 15 Palestinians. But with no DNA testing available in Gaza, it is hard to identify them.Hamas seized 251 hostages when it launched the deadly attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023 during which it killed 1,200 people. More than 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory response, according to figures provided by the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, whose figures the UN considers reliable, but Israel disputes.Before the latest handover, of the four bodies still in Gaza, three were Israeli and one was Thai.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the hostages' bodies, but Hamas has said it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas, and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.",

    "body": "42 minutes agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterLawyers for Trump have written to the BBC saying he will sue for $1bn (£759m) in damages unless the corporation issues a retraction, apologises and compensates him for the Panorama broadcast.In response to Thursday's story in the Telegraph, a BBC spokesperson said: \"The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards. This matter has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.\"A spokesman for Trump's legal team told The Telegraph it was \"now clear that BBC engaged in a pattern of defamation against President Trump\".In Trump's speech on 6 January 2021, he said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme, the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Newsnight programme the edit is a little different.He is shown as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol. And we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.\"This was followed by a voiceover from presenter Kirsty Wark saying \"and fight they did\" over footage from the Capitol riots.Responding to the clip on the same programme, former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who quit a diplomatic post and became a critic of Trump after describing the 6 January riots as an \"attempted coup\", said the video had \"spliced together\" Trump's speech.\"That line about 'we fight and fight like hell' is actually later in the speech and yet your video makes it look like those two things came together,\" he said.The Telegraph also reported that a whistleblower told the newspaper that a further discussion the following day was also shut down.Last week, a leaked internal BBC memo claimed Panorama had misled viewers by splicing two parts of Trump's 6 January 2021 speech together, making it appear as though he was explicitly urging people to attack the US Capitol after his election defeat.The documentary aired days before the US presidential election in November 2024.Speaking to Fox News, Trump said his 6 January 2021 speech had been \"butchered\" and the way it was presented had \"defrauded\" viewers.",

    "body": "1 hour agoZoe ConwayBusiness correspondentA botched net zero scheme which has caused damp issues in thousands of homes was the result of ''serious failings at every level\", a UK government official has said. Last month, the National Audit Office found that 98% of the 23,000 homes that had external wall insulation installed under two separate schemes will result in damp and mould if left unaddressed. Its damning report also found that hundreds of homeowners' health and safety had been put at immediate risk because the insulation work had not been done correctly.Appearing before Parliament, Jeremy Pocklington, the most senior civil servant at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, said the failures were \"unacceptable\". These schemes commonly used external wall insulation, which involved fixing insulation boards to the exterior brickwork and then applying render to make it waterproof. It can go wrong when water becomes trapped behind the boards.The damage also applies to about a third of homes which had internal insulation installed under the ECO4 scheme and the Great British Insulation Scheme, available to residents in England, Scotland and Wales. More than three million homes have been insulated under a variety of government schemes over the last 20 years. Billions of pounds of public money have been spent on it.Appearing before the Public Accounts Committee, Mr Pocklington began his evidence session by saying his thoughts were with the families and households affected.The chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP, said  the NAO report findings were the ''worst'' he'd seen in 12 years of chairing the committee and accused the department of negligence. Mr Pocklington said there had been poor oversight of the ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme by Trustmark, the body responsible for overseeing the quality of the insulation work. However, he added that the department ''did not oversee these schemes in the way that they should have done''.Independent MP Rupert Lowe said this amounted to ''systemic failure of a government department''. Acknowledging this remark, Mr Pocklington, said ''there are serious failings at every level of the system that are systemic'', and that the department \"didn't take enough steps to ensure that Trustmark was set up to deliver appropriately\". Simon Ayers, the chief executive of Trustmark, earlier told the panel of MPs that his organisation had raised the issue of faulty installations with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero from late-2022, but they were \"informal operational meetings\" and minutes were not taken.Mr Pocklington explained that the department had been under pressure after dealing with the Covid pandemic and the effect on energy prices of the war in Ukraine. Labour MP Clive Betts asked Mr Pocklington whether the department would take responsibility for all of the homeowners that have been ''badly treated'' under all of the government's energy efficiency schemes, not just those carried out since 2022. Mr Pocklington said the focus was on the two schemes which had taken place since 2022. Asked by Mr Betts if the government would \"stand behind'' affected homeowners,  Mr Pocklington said the government's responsibility was ''to ensure that the schemes we put in place operate effectively and that there are appropriate systems of consumer protection in place\".

    "body": "17 minutes agoJake Lapham and Jonathan Beale,Defence correspondentTwo-thirds of women serving full-time in the UK's armed forces reported experiencing sexualised behaviour over the past year, according to a survey.This included comments about their appearance, harassment, leering and groping. Women were twice as likely to experience the behaviours as men, the survey said.The Ministry of Defence (MoD), which commissioned the report, called the findings \"wholly unacceptable\" and said it had launched a prevention programme to address unacceptable behaviour.The survey was part of an effort to get to grips with the deeply troubling experiences of many women in the armed forces – who make up about 12% of the force. In 2021, 19-year-old gunner Jaysley Beck took her own life after being sexually harassed and assaulted.  Warrant Officer Michael Webber, 43, had pinned down Beck and tried to kiss her. He was jailed for sexual assault last month.The survey of more than 90,000 military personnel - including full-time personnel referred to as regulars, and part-time reservists - highlights a wide spectrum of harassment – from verbal to physical. Sixty-seven percent of female full-time personnel had encountered some kind of sexualised behaviour in the last year – such as inappropriate jokes, pornography, or comments about their appearance. Among male regulars it was 34%. Of these women, 93% said they believed the behaviour amounted to sexual harassment. Some 42% of female regulars said they had been stared or leered at. A third said they had been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable. Sexualised behaviour was most common in an open workplace at the military home or training unit. The MoD said it was addressing what it called inappropriate behaviours by educating recruits about consent, misogyny and harmful online influences.Minister for Veterans and People, Louise Sandher-Jones, said the survey results were \"wholly unacceptable\", describing it as a \"no holds barred baseline, to fully confront and address the root causes of this issue\".\"New standards in transparency and accountability are being set across our Armed Forces,\" she added.The survey comes a year after a separate Royal Navy investigation found women in the Submarine Service had suffered misogyny, bullying and other unacceptable behaviours.The behaviour was seen \"amongst all ranks\" but was \"not pervasive\" across the service, the report said, after a two-year long investigation.",

    "body": "1 hour agoVictoria GillScience correspondent, BBC NewsVictoria Gill/BBC NewsMy own dog seems a long way from a wild wolfIf you, like me, have a spoiled, lazy dog that enjoys cheese flavoured treats, the fact that your pet's ancestors were wild predators can seem unfathomable.But a major new study suggests their physical transformation from wolf to sofa-hogging furball began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than we previously thought.\"When you see a Chihuahua - it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified,\" says Dr Allowen Evin from the University of Montpellier, a lead researcher on this study.She and her colleagues discovered that the transformation of our pets championed by the Victorians through selective breeding actually started more than 10,000 years ago.C AmeenThe researchers studied more than 600 skulls that spanned 50,000 years of dog and wolf evolutionIn a paper published in the journal Science, this international team of researchers focused their attention on prehistoric canine skulls. Over more than a decade, they collected, examined and scanned bones that spanned a period of 50,000 years of dog evolution.They created digital 3D models of each of the more than 600 skulls they examined - and compared specific features across ancient and modern dogs - and their wild relatives.This revealed that, nearly 11,000 years ago, just after the last ice age, dog skulls started to change shape. While there were still slender, wolf-like dogs, there were also many with shorter snouts and wider, stockier heads.Dr Carly Ameen from the University of Exeter, another lead researcher on this project, explained to BBC News that almost half of the diversity we see in modern dog breeds today was already present in dog populations by the middle of the Stone Age.\"It's really surprising,\" she said. \"And it starts to challenge the ideas about whether or not it was the Victorians -  and their kennel clubs - that drove this.\"C Brassard (VetAgro Sup/Mecadev)The researchers produced digital scans of each of the skulls they studied. The pink skull on the left in this image is a modern dog with a shorter snout and the green image on the right is a scan of a wolf skull. Domestication: An ancient mysteryDogs were the first animals to be domesticated. There is evidence that humans have been living closely with canines for at least 30,000 years. Where and why that close association began remains a puzzle.This study has revealed some of the earliest physical evidence of dogs transforming into the diverse array of pets, companions and working animals that we know today. And the researchers' digital scans of the skulls that they studied will allow them to answer more questions about the evolutionary driving forces behind domestication.Some researchers have suggested that humans and wolves came together almost by accident, when wolves moved to the outskirts of hunter-gatherer communities to scavenge for food.Tamer wolves would get more food, and the humans gradually came to rely on the wolves to clean up remains of messy carcasses and to raise the alarm if a predator came near.As to why that ultimately changed dogs' physical appearance, Dr Ameen said there were likely to be a number of reasons. She did not rule our ancestors preference for boxy heads and cute, snub noses but she explained: \"It's likely to be a combination of interaction with humans, adapting to different environments, adapting to different types food - all contributing to the kind of explosion of variation that we see.\"It's hard to untangle which of those might be the most important one.\"For tens of thousands of years, our human story and that of our dogs has been entangled. In another paper in this same edition of the journal Science, a research group led by scientists in China studied ancient DNA from dogs that lived between 9,700 and 870 years ago - at sites across Siberia, the Central Eurasian Steppe, and northwest China.They concluded that the movement of domestic dogs across that region often coincided with migrations of people - hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. So our dogs have travelled alongside us - and been integrated into our societies - for thousands of years.I can't say that my own stubborn, disobedient terrier provides me with any of the benefits that the first domesticated wolves bestowed on our ancestors. But I can see why, as research suggests, once a dog showed up for some leftovers, there was no going back.",

The girl was pronounced dead at the scene while a 38-year-old woman from Cefn Fforest is currently receiving treatment in hospital. Armed police went to a property in Wheatley Place on Thursday following reports that two people had sustained serious injuries. Det Supt Philip O'Connell, said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident following the arrest. \"We understand that reports of this nature can be concerning, and it is likely that residents will see an increased number of officers in the area while we carry out further enquires,\" he said.He appealed for anyone with information to contact them.A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said ambulances were sent to the scene at 07:23 on Thursday, as well as two air ambulance helicopters. Police officers have been guarding the entrance to the propertyOn Thursday afternoon, two police officers were guarding the door of a semi-detached house behind a police cordon.Crime officers in white paper suits were going in and out of the house taking equipment with them, examining the interior of the home, while a police dog was searching the area to the front of the house.A large area had been sealed off with police tape in the roads surrounding the house. It was very quiet on the street with few residents moving about.Two teenage girls approached the officers at the police cordon, one who was crying.Neighbour Alun Phillips, 77, told the BBC he had been working nights and woke to banging doors this morning.He said he did not know the people in the house who \"kept themselves to themselves\".More top stories",

    "body": "ByChris BevanBBC Sport journalist and Chris CollinsonBBC Sport statisticianAnd then there was one.Thomas Tuchel's latest squad has laid bare the current dearth of English centre-forwards, with Harry Kane the only out-and-out striker in the 25-man group.Admittedly that is partly down to injury, with Tuchel explaining Ollie Watkins has been rested to manage an ongoing issue, while Dominic Solanke has been sidelined since August and Liam Delap is only just back in action for Chelsea after two months out.We should not forget that some more versatile forwards have been selected, too. Marcus Rashford, Jarrod Bowen, Phil Foden and Anthony Gordon may not be traditional number nines but they could be asked to play through the middle against Serbia and Albania this week.But still, seeing Kane as the only true striker's name is a stark reminder of how heavily England rely on the 32-year-old as the fulcrum of their attack, with the shortage of other options to lead their line a real worry before next summer's World Cup and, especially, beyond.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kane is England's all-time record goalscorer, with 76 goals in 110 senior appearancesKane has been prolific in the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich this season - but just eight English strikers have appeared in the Premier League in the current campaign and 22-year-old Delap is the only one under the age of 26.Behind Delap, there does not appear to be a new generation waiting for its chance, either.England Under-21s went to last summer's European Championship without a recognised striker and their latest squad includes only one, Manchester City's Divin Mubama, 21, who is yet to score in the Premier League and is currently on loan at Championship side Stoke.So, where have all the English number nines gone, and why is the country not producing traditional strikers anymore?Fewer games, and different systemsThere are some English strikers out there, but when you look at their stats, they are not exactly encouraging.Danny Welbeck, who turns 35 at the end of the month, and 33-year-old Callum Wilson are the only ones who have scored more than one goal in the Premier League this season.Of those under consideration by Tuchel who play further afield, Ivan Toney is the most prolific in the current campaign with 11 goals in 15 games for Saudi Pro League side Al-Ahli, whom he joined in 2024.Tuchel picked the 29-year-old for the games against Andorra and Senegal in June, but Toney only featured as an 88th-minute substitute in the Senegal friendly, and has not made it into another squad since.This shortage of number nines is not down to a sudden drop-off in numbers. Instead it's a trend that has been going on for a while.Last season, just three English strikers - Watkins (16), Delap (12) and Welbeck (10) scored 10 or more Premier League goals, the fewest ever.It's a far cry from the first season of the Premier League era in 1992-93, when 20 English strikers passed the 10-goal mark.In recent years, however, what was already a steep decline has fallen off a cliff. Last season, only 67 goals were scored by English strikers, less than half the number in 2020-21.Kane's departure from Tottenham for Germany has played a part, of course, but he left for Bayern in 2023 and English strikers still scored 96 goals in 2023-24.If anything, this campaign is shaping up to be even worse.So far, English strikers have scored only 11 goals between them - and they are on course for a meagre total of 38 collectively, if they continue at their present rate. That's only four more than Andy Cole and Alan Shearer each scored as they topped the Premier League scoring charts 30 years ago.Cole bagged 34 goals for Newcastle in 1993-94 and Shearer netted the same number for Blackburn the following season - still the record haul for English strikers in the Premier League era, albeit in 42-game seasons.The decline of English strikers is down to several factors according to BBC pundit Chris Sutton, who passed the 10-goal mark himself in four separate Premier League campaigns, including a 25-goal haul with Norwich in 1993-94, and an 18-goal season with Blackburn that saw him take a share of the Golden Boot in 1997-98.One reason is a lack of appearances. From the table above, only Welbeck, Watkins and Calvert-Lewin have started more than three league games this season, while Nketiah, Solanke and Barnes have not started any.\"If you look back at the 1990s, players like Jurgen Klinsmann and Dennis Bergkamp started arriving from abroad but the overall number of foreign strikers was much lower,\" Sutton explained.\"The number one striker of my era was Shearer but if you went through the teams, then there were so many brilliant English centre-forwards like Ian Wright, Les Ferdinand, Andy Cole, Teddy Sheringham, Robbie Fowler and David Hirst - you could add Stan Collymore and Dion Dublin to that list too.\"There was an unbelievable number of them, even before Michael Owen came through ahead of the 1998 World Cup, and all different types of striker too.\"One of the differences is that they were all playing every week, because how many English centre-forwards start for their clubs in the Premier League now? That's down to the quality which the clubs can attract from elsewhere.\"Another change we've seen is in the way teams are set up. I am not saying everyone was a rigid 4-4-2 back in my day, because that's nonsense, but far fewer sides play with two strikers now.\"In other ways, things have gone full circle, because if you look at teams like Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United, then the big number nine is back in fashion. There are plenty of strikers in the Premier League, just not many who are English.\"Did people stop wanting to be a striker?Shearer, who formed the devastating 'SAS' partnership with Sutton to help Blackburn win the Premier League title in 1995, feels the tactical shifts we have seen over the past 10 to 15 years are the biggest reason for the current shortage of strikers.\"Because of the way kids have been training and the coaching they have had, no-one wants to play at centre-forward because you very rarely get a touch,\" the former England captain told The Rest is Football podcast.\"Instead, coaches want a pass from the keeper, a pass to the side, then a pass into midfield... and then it goes back. As a centre-forward you are thinking 'I am not getting involved'.\"I am convinced that is why there is a lack of number nines, particularly in our country.\"Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, The SAS - Shearer And Sutton - partnership that fired Blackburn Rovers to the 1994-95 title scored 49 Premier League goals between them that season, although Shearer did get 34 of themSutton agrees with his old strike partner and, although modern-day wide forwards like Rashford and Bukayo Saka are scoring more goals than old-school wingers ever did, he sees the current situation as \"a massive problem\".\"Alan makes a good point about how everyone wants to mess around on the ball these days,\" Sutton explained. \"Everyone wants to be a creative player off the wide areas, or be a left-footer cutting in off the right wing. Those players can score goals too, but it is very different to having someone who can lead the line.\"Owen, who shared the Premier League Golden Boot with Sutton as an 18-year-old in 1997-98 and won the award outright the following year, feels he would not be considered as a striker if he emerged now.\"In today's game, I think I would have been one of the wide players,\" he told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. \"I don't think I had the stature to occupy two defenders, so I guess I would have played on the left.\"The worry I have for strikers is that I spent my life learning my trade, playing off people. Now, how are we going to reinvent those pairings. I have been waiting and waiting for teams to go back to having two, but will it ever happen?\"Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Owen (number 10) struck up a seemingly telepathic partnership up front with his Liverpool and Three Lions team-mate Emile Heskey (number nine) for club and country. They both scored in England's famous 5-1 win over Germany in 2001, with Owen netting a hat-trick'We've got Kane, but then what?'Playing with two strikers is not an option for Tuchel this week, at least not in the way Owen means.\"Just on numbers alone, the situation is incomparable to the 1990s,\" Sutton added. \"But when you actually list the players we had then, there was unbelievable depth of quality too and a lot of them didn't really get a look in for England.\"Ferdinand only won 17 caps but he was phenomenal. Fowler, who only got a few more, was probably the most natural finisher you could ever see. But they were both behind Shearer because he was like a machine with the way he finished.\"Sutton only won one full cap, coming on as a substitute against Cameroon in November 1997, before falling out with then England boss Glenn Hoddle when he turned down a call-up to the England B team in February 1998.\"I can joke about how I messed things up with Hoddle but nowadays you would be rubbing your hands if you are a half-decent striker with a World Cup coming up,\" he added. \"We have got Kane, but then what?\"If you're an English centre-forward now and you can kick a ball straight, you've got a good chance of going to the World Cup. I feel like dusting my boots off myself.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Harry Kane has been England's number nine since 2015, but who will be next to wear the famous shirt?FootballEngland Men's Football Team",

    "body": "Amber warnings have been issued by the Met Office as Storm Claudia is forecast to bring heavy and persistent rain to parts of the United Kingdom.Through Friday, rain will spread across large parts of England and Wales with a larger yellow severe weather warning also issued.There will be some flooding and difficult travelling conditions with a strong easterly wind also developing through the day.The warnings come after recent rain and flooding has already affected many areas such as south Wales last week.Storm Claudia - named by the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) - has already brought heavy rain and strong winds to Spain and Portugal.But rain associated with this storm will spread quickly north across England and Wales during Friday where it will stall and become persistent for most of the day.Met Office Amber warnings have been issued for parts of south-east Wales from 12:00 to 23:59 GMT where up to 150mm of rain - nearly 6 inches - is possible over high ground.An additional amber warning will also come in to effect for the same time across parts of east Wales, the Midlands and towards eastern England.Widely 50-75mm (2-2.9in) of rain is expected throughout Friday with some places seeing up to 80mm (3in).Difficult driving conditions and transport disruption is likely. With flood warnings in place in some parts of the country already, Ben Lukey, Flood Duty Manager at the Environment Agency, said:\"Storm Claudia will bring heavy prolonged rainfall across parts of England, with significant surface water flooding probable across parts of central England on Friday, while significant river flooding impacts are also possible, and into Saturday.\"A larger Met Office yellow severe weather warning has been issued elsewhere across England and Wales that will come into force from 06:00 GMT Friday, lasting through until Saturday at 06:00 GMT.Around 30-50mm (1.2-2.9in) of rain is expected quite widely which may also bring some localised flooding and transport disruption.Strong south-easterly winds will accompany the rain.Additional yellow warnings for the wind have been issued for the far north-west of Wales and the Pennines.Gusts up to 50-70mph (80-113km/h) could bring some minor damage and disruption.While a typical named storm in the UK might sweep in from the North Atlantic bringing strong and damaging winds,  Storm Claudia is more notable for the rainfall.Named by AEMET earlier this week for the impacts it has brought to Spain, the storm is moving up the western side of Portugal and France and approaching the UK from the south-west.And while it will turn quite windy with gusts up to 70mph (113km/h) in north-west Wales and the Pennines, the winds are not the most notable feature of this storm.Once a meteorological agency takes the decision to name a storm, there is agreement that all nations use the same name to allow consistency and clearer communication of the impacts.Claudia will not replace Bram in the list of the UK's named storms. So we can still expect the next weather event deemed serious enough to be named by either the Met office, Met Eirean in Ireland or KNMI in the Netherlands to be Bram.Rain has featured a lot so far this November with some areas seeing over their November average in the first thirteen days.Shap and Carlisle in Cumbria for example have recorded more than their November rainfall already; 226mm and 95mm compared to the averages of 205mm and 85mm respectively.Other sites on higher ground such as Honister in the Lake District has recorded over 500mm of rain.Bannau Brycheiniog - known as the Brecon Beacons - in south Wales, has also been particularly wet with many Natural Resources Wales rainfall stations recording over 200mm of rain so far.The heavy rainfall in south Wales has also led to some significant flooding.A business owner who had to close his shop in Carmarthen due to the floods described it as \"the worst in living memory\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoCurtis Lancaster and Danai Nesta KupembaBNPSThe pocket stopped at the moment the Titanic disappeared beneath the wavesA gold pocket watch recovered from the body of one of the richest passengers on the Titanic is expected to fetch £1m at auction.Isidor Straus and his wife Ida were among the more than 1,500 people who died when the vessel travelling from Southampton to New York sank after hitting an iceberg on 14 April 1912.His body was recovered from the Atlantic days after the disaster and among his possessions was an 18 carat gold Jules Jurgensen pocket watch that will go under the hammer on 22 November.Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge, of Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, told BBC Radio Wiltshire: \"With the watch, we are retelling Isidor's story. It's a phenomenal piece of memorabilia.\"Getty ImagesIsidor Straus and his wife Ida both died when the ship sank in 1912Mr Straus was a Bavarian-born American businessman, politician, and co-owner of Macy's department store in New York.\"They were a very famous New York couple,\" said Mr Aldridge. \"Everyone would know them from the end of James Cameron's Titanic movie, when there is an elderly couple hugging as the ship is sinking - that's Isidor and Ida.\"On the night of the sinking, it is believed his devoted wife refused a place in a lifeboat as she did not want to leave her husband and said she would rather die by his side. Ida's body was never found.BNPSIt is believed the watch was a gift from Ida to her husband in 1888The pocket watch stopped at 02:20, the moment the Titanic disappeared beneath the waves.It is believed to have been a gift from Ida to her husband in 1888 and is engraved with Straus' initials.It was returned to his family and was passed down through generations before Kenneth Hollister Straus, Isidor's great-grandson, had the movement repaired and restored.It will be sold alongside a rare letter Ida wrote aboard the liner describing its luxury.She wrote: \"What a ship! So huge and so magnificently appointed. Our rooms are furnished in the best of taste and most luxurious.\"BNPSThe 18 carat gold Jules Jurgensen watch is expected to fetch £1mThe letter is postmarked \"TransAtlantic 7\" meaning it was franked on board in the Titanic's post office before being taken off with other mail at Queenstown, Ireland.Both items will be offered by Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, with the letter estimated to fetch £150,000.The watch is set to become one of the most expensive Titanic artefacts ever sold.The auction house said news of the sale had already generated \"significant interest from clients all over the world\". BNPSThe letter by Ida is estimated to fetch £150,000\"Theirs was the ultimate love story - Isidor epitomised the American Dream, rising from humble immigrant to a titan of the New York establishment, owning Macy's department store,\" a spokesperson for the auction house said. \"As the ship was sinking, despite being offered a seat in a lifeboat, Ida refused to leave her husband and stated to him 'Isidor we have been together all of these years, where you go, I go'.\"The spokesperson added: \"This is the reason why collectors are interested in the Titanic story 113 years later - every man, woman and child had a story to tell and those stories now are retold through these objects.\"A gold pocket watch presented to the captain of the Carpathia, the steamship which rescued more than 700 Titanic survivors, sold last year a record-breaking £1.56m.More on this story",

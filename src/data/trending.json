    "body": "Hewlett Packard (HP) is seeking $1.7bn (£1.3bn) from the estate of Mike Lynch - who died last year when his yacht sank - over HP's acquisition of his firm Autonomy, the tech giant's lawyers have told the High Court.HP, now known as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), bought Mr Lynch's tech firm Autonomy in 2011, but it says Mr Lynch and Autonomy's former chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, misrepresented the company's finances.In a 2019 trial, HPE had accused Mr Lynch of inflating Autonomy's revenues which it said forced it to announce an $8.8bn write-down of the company's worth.Mr Justice Hildyard ruled in 2022 that HPE had \"substantially succeeded\" in its claim, but that it was likely to receive \"substantially less\" than the $5bn it sought in damages.Earlier this year, he ruled that HPE suffered losses amounting to around £700m through the purchase of Autonomy.Mr Lynch and his teenage daughter Hannah were among seven passengers and crew who died when the Bayesian went down off the coast of Sicily last August during a storm which caused the vessel to capsize and sink.A hearing in London, which began on Tuesday, will now decide whether Mr Lynch's estate can appeal against the 2022 and 2025 rulings.In written submissions, Patrick Goodall, the barrister representing HPE, argued that Mr Lynch's estate was liable to pay $1.7bn, which includes around $761m in interest.He said that Mr Lynch had \"not only perpetrated an enormous fraud, but lied about it at every stage\".He said the claimants had spent almost £150m on the legal battle, and were seeking nearly £113m of their costs from Mr Lynch's estate.Mr Goodall also said that Mr Lynch's estate should not be allowed to appeal against either the 2022 or 2025 rulings.In written submissions, Richard Hill, the lawyer representing Mr Lynch's estate, said that the $761m in interest sought by the claimants was an \"excessive sum... based on a flawed analysis\" and that the \"legally and economically rational approach would provide for a materially lower figure\".The claimants' position that \"they were the victors in this litigation\" was \"overly simplistic\", he added.Mr Hill also said that Mr Lynch's estate should be allowed to appeal against the two earlier rulings, claiming that the judge \"erred in law\" and that there was a \"compelling reason for allowing the appeal to be heard\".A spokesperson for the Lynch family said: \"Today's hearing addresses technical matters that change nothing about the underlying substance of the case.\"The core facts remain that HP's claim was fundamentally flawed and a wild overstatement.\"In a separate case, Mr Lynch was extradited to the US in 2023 to face criminal charges, and he was cleared of fraud charges in 2024.He was celebrating being acquitted on his yacht when it sank.",

Has Donald Trump changed his mind on the Epstein Files?AmericastAvailable for over a yearOn Sunday night Donald Trump told Republicans in the House of Representatives to vote in favour of releasing files relating to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “because we have nothing to hide”. It’s a striking change in position from the president who has so far resisted pressure from Democrats and Republicans in his own party who have been demanding that all files relating to Epstein be released into the public domain. \nOne of the Republicans calling for their release is the conservative firebrand and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was once one of Trump’s most faithful supporters. After stepping up her demands to see the files released, she now appears to have lost the president’s backing who called her a “traitor” and a “disgrace” to the Republican Party. We answer your questions on why the pair have fallen out.\nAnd, we answer your questions on why there’s been another presidential pardon, this time for the UK billionaire Joe Lewis, whose family trust owns Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.

    "body": "11 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondent, City of LondonThe Princess of Wales has called for more dignity for carers and a greater respect for values such as \"tenderness\" in business, in her first public speech in two years.At an event in the City of London, Catherine called on 80 top business leaders to play their part in ensuring employees can have healthy family lives, including caring responsibilities.\"I believe in restoring the dignity to the quiet, often invisible work of caring, of loving well, as we look to build a happier, healthier society,\" the princess told the Future Workforce Summit.The event was part of Catherine's campaign to raise awareness about the importance of children's early years and building healthy family relationships.This was Catherine's first speech since November 2023 and the first since her cancer diagnosis, which was revealed in March 2024.Since then, she has delivered recorded messages on social media, including about her gradual recovery after chemotherapy, but this has been the first speech since then to have been delivered in person.It marks another step in her return to public life and also reflects her style, with the event beginning with a poem read by Alex Wharton, former children's laureate for Wales.Her speech, confidently delivered, reflected her deeply-held, personal message about the need for a greater emphasis on kindness and recognising that \"love is the first and most essential bond\".\"The love we feel in our earliest years fundamentally shapes who we become and how we thrive as adults,\" said the princess.She told business leaders about the need for families to be able to provide a supportive home for their children, as part of what she called the \"weave of love\".The speech was delivered high up in a city skyscraper, with London stretched out below like a model village.Catherine called on business leaders to re-think their workplaces and create a different kind of model for their priorities, in which companies were \"valuing time and tenderness just as much as productivity and success\".The princess, who set up the Centre for Early Childhood before her illness, called for a more rounded way of measuring success.\"As business leaders you will face the daily challenge of finding the balance between profitability and having a positive impact. But the two are not, and should not be incompatible,\" she said.The event also heard from Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School, who said research showed that people who had been in nurturing relationships in early childhood were still likely to be more emotionally secure in their old age.Former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate, addressing this business gathering, said that when he was trying to motivate players, he had found that youngsters from difficult family backgrounds might not have the same level of trust as those who had grown up in closer family relationships.He said that coaches carried out personality profiles on the players to understand the \"way they were wired\".He talked about his own experiences of responding to moments of pressure, using a combination of \"sleep, good nutrition and limiting alcohol\" and breathing exercises to control stress.Sir Gareth also remembered his own recovery after the \"public humiliation\" of missing a penalty in the Euro 96 semi-final when he said \"half the world was watching\".He said that it meant \"slowly taking small steps to recover your confidence\" and he talked of the importance of people, in any type of workplace, being able to \"feel comfortable in your own skin\".This gathering was part of the Business Taskforce set up by the princess to try to get business support for her campaign to recognise the importance of early childhood.Delegates at the event heard from leaders of companies supporting the project including Aviva, NatWest Group, Iceland, Ikea, Lego and Deloitte.In her first public speech in two years, Catherine pays tribute to the ''invisible work of caring''",

He added that the ban was not for them to consider and was irrelevant to the evidence in this case.Beginning the prosecution's case, Deanna Heer KC, said that the six defendants had been \"willing participants\" in a plan to cause damage to the plant, which manufacturers defence technology equipment.Wearing red jumpsuits and carrying sledgehammers, they used a prison van, allegedly driven by Charlotte Head, to crash through security fencing, before then breaking into the factory itself, the court heard.Ms Heer told the jury that each of the \"red team\" carried a sledgehammer to cause damage - but they were also prepared to use them as weapons.\"The evidence demonstrates that all of these defendants used them for that purpose, to threaten or to attack the security guards and to lend support to one another as they did so,\" she said.\"When the police arrived, as the defendants knew they would, Samuel Corner attacked them, going so far as to strike a female officer, Sgt Kate Evans, across the back with his sledgehammer while she was on the floor, facing away from him.\"Ms Heer said that the red team had taken three minutes to gain access to factory, first cutting into a roller door and then smashing through it with the prison van.\"Inside the warehouse, the Red Team set about destroying as much property as they could,\" said Ms Heer, adding the group was armed with sledgehammers, whips, and fireworks.'Screamed in pain'\"They used fire extinguishers filled with red paint to spray the walls and floor.\"They used crowbars and hammers to damage computer equipment and boxes of technical products, which they smashed apart.\"The fabric of the building was also damaged, not only the loading bay but also the security systems and even the disabled toilet,\" she added.Footage played in the opening address was said to show Zoe Rogers brandishing and swinging a sledgehammer in front of a security guard, Angelo Volante.He also said he had been whipped by Charlotte Head and threatened with a saw by Leona Kamio.Eventually he retreated - but later returned with the police. As he led officers into the factory, video played to the jury on Tuesday was said to show Ms Kamio raising her sledgehammer over her head and bringing it down towards him.She was then tasered - but continued to resist arrest. The video is then said to show Samuel Corner approaching Sgt Evans and striking her back with a sledgehammer.\"Having hit her once, he raised the sledgehammer again and hit her with it a second time,\" said Ms Heer.\"Fortunately, Sgt Evans was wearing a stab vest which may have absorbed the force of the impacts. Nevertheless she screamed in pain as she felt the force of the blows.\"She was immediately terrified that her spine had been damaged and when she tried, she was unable to get up.\"Sgt Evans suffered a fractured vertebrae and was unable to work for three months. Due to the ongoing impact of the injury, she has been confined to restricted duties.The trial is expected to last until January.Related internet links",

    "body": "54 minutes agoVictoria GillScience correspondent, BBC NewsGettyThe researchers found evidence of kissing in multiple species Humans do it, monkeys do it, even polar bears do it. And now researchers have reconstructed the evolutionary origins of kissing. Their study suggests that the mouth-on-mouth kiss evolved more than 21 million years ago, and was something that the common ancestor of humans and other great apes probably indulged in.The same research concluded that Neanderthals may have kissed too – and that humans and Neanderthals may even have smooched one another.The scientists studied kissing because it presents something of an evolutionary puzzle - it has no obvious survival or reproductive benefits, and yet it is something that is seen not just in many human societies, but across the animal kingdom. GettyThe scientists defined a kiss as mouth-on-mouth contact \"with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer\"By finding evidence of other animals engaging in kissing, scientists were able to construct an \"evolutionary family tree\" to work out when it was most likely to have evolved.To ensure that they were comparing the same behaviour across different species, the researchers had to give a very precise - rather unromantic - definition to a \"kiss\". In their study, published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, they defined kissing as non aggressive, directed oral-oral contact \"with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer\".\"Humans, chimps, and bonobos all kiss,\" explained lead researcher Dr Matilda Brindle, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Oxford. From that, she concluded, \"it's likely that their most recent common ancestor kissed.\"\"We think kissing probably evolved around 21.5 million years ago in the large apes.\"In this study, scientists found behaviour that matched their scientific definition of kissing in wolves, prairie dogs, polar bears (very sloppy - lots of tongue), and even albatrosses. They focused on primates - and apes in particular - in order to build an evolutionary picture of the origin of the human kiss. The same study also concluded that Neanderthals - our closest ancient human relatives that died out around 40,000 years ago - also kissed. One previous piece of research on Neanderthal DNA also showed that modern humans and Neanderthals shared an oral microbe - a type of bacteria found in our saliva. \"That means that they must have been swapping saliva for hundreds of thousands of years after the two species split,\" explained Dr Brindle.        GettyThe scientists say this behaviour is something 'we share with our non-human relatives'While this study pinpointed when kissing evolved it was not able to answer the question of why. There are already a number of theories - that it arose from grooming behaviour in our ape ancestors or that it might provide an intimate way to assess the health and even the compatibility of a partner. Dr Brindle hopes that this will open a door to answering that question. \"It's important for us to understand that this is something we share with our non-human relatives,\" she said.\"We should be studying this behaviour, not just dismissing it as silly because it has romantic connotations in humans.\"     ",

Your voice, your memory, and your spirit will continue to inspire all of us in the AJR - and beyond - for generations to come.\"",

    "body": "A loose wire on a cargo ship caused a power outage that may have led to the 2024 deadly collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, US investigators have said. The Dali container ship, which crashed into the bridge and left six workers dead, was \"preventable\", National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators said during a hearing on Tuesday. Police stationed at the bridge's ends were notified that the ship had veered off course but did not call the construction team's inspector to warn them.  Had the six workers been notified when police were, the NTSB said, they may have had time to evacuate. \"There would have been about one minute and 29 seconds to evacuate\" before the collision, said NTSB engineer Scott Parent, according to the Washington Post.That could have been \"sufficient time to drive to a portion of the bridge that did not collapse\", he said. In the black of night on 26 March 2024, several vehicles on the Scott Key bridge plunged into the icy waters of the River Patapsco in Baltimore, Maryland, after the Dali container ship crashed into one of its pillars. Six workers fell to their deaths.Tuesday's hearing unveiled the potential causes behind the deadly tragedy, as outlined in the NTSB's year-long investigation. The agency identified multiple factors, including the loss of electrical power from a faulty cable, problems with a fuel pump on the ship and a lack of counter measures to reduce the bridge's vulnerability. The NTSB also reviewed its safety recommendations.The findings confirmed those of a 2024 NTSB preliminary report, which had cited faulty cables as the likely cause of an electrical blackout on the Dali in the final moments before collision. \"This tragedy should have never occurred. Lives should have never been lost. As with all accidents we investigate, this was preventable,\" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said at the hearing. The deadly incident was massively disruptive to the major US shipping Port of Baltimore while it was closed, and severed part of a major interstate roadway.Officials preliminarily estimated the repairs would be completed by 2028 and cost roughly $1.9bn (£1.4bn). However, an update on Monday estimated the total cost of repairs to be closer to $5bn and moved the timeline for completion to 2030.\"Just as families across the country are dealing with the reality of increased costs, so is Maryland,\" the state's Democratic Governor Wes Moore said in a statement on Monday.  \"Trade policies out of Washington, D.C. have raised prices on everything - including essential materials we need in order to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge. \"Still, despite this new economic reality, our resolve is unwavering,\" he said.

    "body": "6 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterPolice drama Line of Duty is to return to the BBC for a seventh series, with Adrian Dunbar, Vicky McClure and Martin Compston all set to reprise their roles in the hit show.A new six-part series, written by creator Jed Mercurio, will begin filming in Belfast in the spring, the BBC confirmed.McClure said she was \"so excited\" the series was returning, with Dunbar adding: \"What a joy it is to know that the Three Amigos will be back filming together next year.\"The last series concluded in 2021 with a finale that attracted more than 17 million viewers. Speculation about a return has been rife ever since, but Mercurio and the BBC have not confirmed it until now.The BBC has not yet announced when the new season will hit screens.The finale of series six drew the show's long-running storyline about the hunt for criminal mastermind known as \"H\" to a close, and the BBC and creative team behind the show said at the time there were no plans for any further series. However, the corporation confirmed on Tuesday that a seventh series is now in development.Series seven will open with AC-12 having been disbanded and rebranded the Inspectorate of Police Standards, the BBC confirmed.Steve Arnott (Compston), Kate Fleming (McClure) and Ted Hastings (Dunbar) are still working to tackle corruption in the police force.The BBC said their line of work \"has never been more difficult, and, in this challenging climate, [the trio] are assigned their most sensitive case so far\".A new character, Det Insp Dominic Gough, a charismatic officer celebrated for a string of takedowns of organised crime, is accused of abusing his position to act as a sexual predator. But his case could be a deliberate distraction from a bigger threat still operating in the shadows, the announcement teased.In a statement, Mercurio said: \"Everyone involved in Line of Duty feels enormous gratitude to the show's fans. \"We're privileged to have had so many of you follow the ups and downs of AC-12 over six previous seasons and we couldn't be more delighted to be returning for a seventh.\"He added: \"Corruption in this country is supposed to have come to an end while Line of Duty was off air so I've been forced to use my imagination.\"Line of Duty launched in 2012 and went on to become one of the most popular TV drams of the last decade, attracting guest stars such as Stephen Graham, Thandiwe Newton, Kelly Macdonald and Lennie James.Compston described appearing in the police drama as \"a job of a lifetime\". \"Not only in terms of the show's success but the people I've had the opportunity to work with I now call some of my closest friends.\"I can't wait to pull the waistcoat on again and get the team back together,\" he said.McClure added: \"It goes without saying I'm so excited Line of Duty is back! Can't wait to work with Jed, Martin and Adrian again. Belfast, we'll see you soon!\"Dunbar remarked: \"As we count down the AC-12 days of Christmas what a joy it is to know that the Three Amigos will be back filming together next year. \"Delighted with the news and looking forward to those mercurial twists and turns.\"",

    "body": "Imprisoned rap mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has denied a new sexual battery allegation that is being investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.The allegations reportedly stem from 2020 and involve a music producer who was asked to attend a photo shoot inside a Los Angeles warehouse where Combs allegedly assaulted him. Combs, who is serving a four-year prison sentence in New Jersey for prostitution related charges, has denied this and all allegations of sexual abuse.\"Let me make it absolutely clear, Mr. Combs categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone,\" one of Combs' attorneys Jonathan Davis said in a statement to the BBC.\"He looks forward to vindicating himself in court, where such matters are decided—and not in the media—based on admissible, material evidence, not rank speculation and unsubstantiated allegations,\" Mr Davis continued. The sheriff's department confirmed to the BBC that its special victim's bureau is in the preliminary stages of investigating a sexual battery allegation against Combs. It said that additional details would not be released \"given the sensitivity of the case\".The male music producer accuses Combs exposing himself and masturbating while at the warehouse photoshoot, according to US media. Combs is accused of asking him to assist in the sexual acts and throwing a dirty shirt when the producer refused, multiple news agencies report. Dozens of people - including underage accusers - have filed civil lawsuits against Combs on allegations that include being drugged and sexually assaulted. Some claims include that the music mogul made both promises of career advancement or threats if accusers spoke up. Earlier this year, the rapper was convicted in a New York trial on two counts of transportation for prostitution. He was sentenced last month to 50 months in sentence. The high-profile criminal case accused Combs of running a sprawling sex-trafficking operation and his trial included testimony from stars that included rapper Kid Cudi and Combs' ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. He was ultimately found not guilty of the most serious charges, which could have resulted in him spending the rest of his life in jail. \"I lost my way,\" he wrote to the judge before his sentencing. \"My downfall was rooted in my selfishness. I have been humbled and broken to my core.\"Combs is currently serving out his sentence in New Jersey. ",

    "body": "10 hours agoRobert Cuffe & Matt MurphyBBC VerifyNurPhoto via Getty ImagesNet migration to the UK last year was 20% lower than previously thought, according to revised figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The number, the difference between those entering and leaving the country, has been revised down by 86,000 people and now stands at 345,000 in 2024.The driving factor behind the change is that more British nationals are thought to have emigrated in 2024 than initially recorded, with 100,000 fewer now thought to be living in the UK.Migration peaked higher than previously thought, according to the figures, adding 944,000 to the UK population between April 2022 and March 2023. Previous estimates put the number at 906,000 by June 2023.When challenged on the migration peak - which occurred under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government - Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said that \"once those figures came out we actually put in quite a few measures to bring immigration down\".\"But we recognise immigration was too high,\" she added during a news conference ahead of next week's budget. \"It was because people took their eye off the ball, allowing bureaucrats to manage our borders - that was not what people voted for when they voted to leave the EU.\"Successive Conservative governments sought to cut migration to the UK, while Labour argued in last year's manifesto that higher migration \"reduces the incentives for businesses to train locally\".In May Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced measures which he said would ensure net migration falls \"significantly\" over the next four years. His proposals included a plan to ban recruitment of care workers from overseas, tighten access to skilled worker visas and raise the costs to employers.The new figures make little change to the overall estimate of net migration to the UK between 2021 and 2024, falling slightly from 2.6 million people to 2.5 million in the revised report.The ONS have been rebuilding the system used to produce official estimates of migration since 2020. Before the pandemic, statisticians asked a small number of passengers at airports and ports about their travel plans and used those responses to work out how many arrivals might be coming to stay.But the results obtained by this method were \"implausibly low\" for British nationals, according to Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory think tank.Officials at the ONS said the new figures are based on how often people appear in tax and benefits records, providing a more accurate and active reflection of migrants activities in the UK.Based on that method, the ONS now thinks that 257,000 British nationals left the UK in 2024 while 143,000 Britons living abroad returned. That means net emigration of Britons - the difference between departures and arrivals - is 114,000 people, rather than its initial estimate of 17,000.Dr Sumption warns that these figures are \"still not final\" because they don't measure when someone enters or leaves the country. That can cause problems if someone stays in the country but disappears from tax and welfare data because they're living on savings.Using that method such a person would usually be counted as an emigrant, skewing migration figures. The ONS has stopped using this method to measure EU migration, instead of using visas and border data shared by the Home Office.Data obtained under the old system estimated that there were 96,000 fewer EU citizens in the UK by the end of 2024, but the new system has revised that estimate downwards to 69,000.Why had migration been rising?Critics have largely attributed the recent increase to changes brought in under Boris Johnson's government from 2021.The three main factors have been identified as an increase in work visas - particularly in health and social care - an increase in student visas, and the opening of humanitarian routes for people from Ukraine, Hong Kong and Afghanistan.Small boat crossings have also been rising in that time. So far this year, 39,075 people have crossed the Channel.Both Conservative and Labour governments have sought to tackle the rising migration figures. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced restrictions on the rights of students and care workers to bring their families to the UK.On Monday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced sweeping changes to the asylum system, which she said was \"out of control and unfair\".Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: \"If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says Saudi crown prince \"knew nothing\" about Jamal Khashoggi's murderUS President Donald Trump said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\".It was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing. \"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\" \"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\"The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\". A US intelligence report made public in 2021 - under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report. While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince.At the time, Saudi Arabia rejected the report as \"negative, false and unacceptable\". On Tuesday, Khashoggi's widow called on the crown prince to apologise for her husband's murder, for which she said there was \"no justification\".\"The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband @JKhashoggi,\" Hanan Elatr Khashoggi posted on X. Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year. Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\". The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis. Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin. The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s. The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.\"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre.\"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added. The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday. Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - was also expected to be at the White House on Tuesday, a White House official confirmed to the BBC. Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues. ",

    "body": "We all know our phones aren't great for our relationships, but that doesn't stop us reaching for them dozens of times a day.That's how so called phubbing - unintentionally snubbing someone in favour of your phone -creeps into everyday moments.This can impact your relationship by making partners feel ignored and parental phone use can really affect children from weakening bonds with younger kids and denting self-esteem in older ones.Rather than criticising yourself about your lack of self-control, focusing on being more intentional about when we pick up our devices can be more effective, according to one psychologist.Dr Kaitlyn Regehr, Associate Professor at University College London suggests one simple way to stop you picking up your phone mindlessly when you're with someone else.Every time you reach for your phone, tell the other person why you're doing it, and when you're done, put it down and re-engage.It sounds almost too easy, but Dr Regehr tells Woman's Hour that this small shift can help change our behaviour as we often check messages, swipe notifications or \"Just quickly look something up\" without thinking.What matters is being transparent, so if a message pops up that you need to check, you should tell the person or people you are with: \"I just need to reply to this, then you'll have my attention again.\"By naming it - \"I need to check my train times\" or \"I'm replying to my mum\" - you interrupt the automatic habit of checking your phone and it also signals to the person beside you that they still matter.\"It stops the other person feeling ignored,\" Dr Regehr says.\"And it keeps you accountable, because you're less likely to drift into other apps or endless scrolling.\"Doing this could help improve your relationships too.Dr Claire Hart, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southampton, led a study which involved speaking to 196 people about their relationships and phone use. Overall the results showed that the more you feel you're being phubbed, the worse your relationship tends to be.\"Not everyone reacts in the same way,\" Dr Hart says. \"It depends on personality, but once one person feels ignored, it can trigger retaliation.\"They pick up their own phone, and that's when it becomes a dangerous spiral as each partner feels rejected or less valued than whatever's on the screen.\"Every time you are phubbed you lose connection and once you've left a shared moment to look at a screen, it can take a while to get back to what was going on before.",

The Government says the legislation is designed to protect the mental wellbeing of Australian children and teens – but it’s already proving controversial, not least among American tech companies and some politicians who see the ban as a threat to free speech.  \nIn today’s episode, we are joined by Katy Watson, the BBC’s Australia correspondent, to discuss how the country became a global test case for a bold new policy – and crucially, whether it will succeed.  \nProducers: Cat Farnsworth, Aron Keller and Xandra Ellin\nMix: Travis Evans\nSenior News Editor: China Collins\nPhoto: A teen using her phone ahead of social media band for users under 16.

    "body": "GCHQ Christmas card sets annual code-cracking challenge7 hours agoAnna LamcheGCHQFans of codebreaking, maths and brainteasers can now try their hand at the latest cryptic Christmas challenge set by GCHQ, the UK's intelligence agency.GCHQ released its annual Christmas card on Wednesday, filled with puzzles and hidden codes designed to help children aged 11-18 hone a range of skills \"they might need to become a spy\".The card was created by \"schoolchildren as well as spies\", according to GCHQ, after hundreds of young people entered a design competition in the lead-up to the festive period.It contains seven puzzles set by \"GCHQ's in-house puzzlers\", geared towards testing a range of problem-solving skills including intuitive reasoning and lateral thinking.Students were asked to draw their response to the question: \"What do you think GCHQ looks like on Christmas Day?\". They were challenged to embed hidden codes and ciphers into their designs.Three winners were selected by a panel of judges across three age groups.The famously tricky puzzles \"aren't meant to be solved alone\", GCHQ said, adding: \"We believe the right mix of minds means we can solve seemingly impossible problems.\"\"Puzzles are at the heart of GCHQ's work to keep the country safe from hostile states, terrorists and criminals; challenging our teams to think creatively and analytically every day,\" said GCHQ director Anne Keast-Butler.She said she hoped the puzzle encourages the next generation \"to explore STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects and consider the rewarding careers available in cybersecurity and intelligence\".Meanwhile, the spy agency's \"Chief Puzzler\", known only as \"Colin\", said the puzzles are designed to test \"the same blend of skills our teams use every day to keep the country safe.\"Answers were released on Wednesday evening - so you can see below whether you've got the puzzles correct.More on this story",

    "body": "3 hours agoVisitors to the US may have to disclose their social media activity from the past five years in order to enter the country, according to the Guardian. The paper reports that the Trump administration intends to apply the new mandates to the 42 countries whose nationals can enter the US without a visa - which includes the UK. Author Sophie Kinsella is also pictured on the front page, after she died on Wednesday following a three-year battle with a glioblastoma, the deadliest and most aggressive type of brain cancer.The Metro also leads on the Trump administration's new immigration rules, noting that the move could impact fans travelling to the US for the World Cup next year. The i Paper reports that the UK could be set to rejoin the European Union's Erasmus programme from January 2027, detailing \"increasing optimism on both sides of negotiations\" that a deal could be struck by Christmas. The \"Brexit reset plan\" would allow young people in the UK and the EU to study abroad for up to a year.\"Net zero plan to cost households £500 a year,\" declares the Times, writing that the National Energy System Operator has found that the UK could save £14bn a year if it forgoes its legally binding target to reach net zero. The paper says the figures have been \"seized on\" by the Conservatives and Reform UK, each of whom have pledged to scrap the target.Argentinean President Javier Milei has spoken to the Telegraph, which reports that negotiations have begun between the UK and the South American nation to lift a weapons ban that has been in place since the Falklands War in 1982. Current British export rules restrict any weapon with British components from being sold to Argentina if they would \"enhance\" the country's military. Milei told the paper that the Falkland Islands would be returned to Argentina through \"diplomatic means\", and said he intended to visit the UK some time next year. The Mirror has focused on Labour's \"£3.5bn war on homelessness\", after Housing Minister Steve Reed vowed to \"build a future where homelessness is rare, brief and not repeated\". His new strategy was published on Thursday, and will be backed by £3.5bn in funding.The Daily Mail reports that campaigners have launched a legal action to halt an NHS-backed clinical trial of puberty-blocking drugs. The paper says that the trial has been branded as \"grotesque\" by Conservatives. British citizenship has been revoked from more than 200 people since 2010, via a system that the Independent suggests is \"racist\" in their leading story. It says that the UK's total is only surpassed by Bahrain and Nicaragua, and is the only G20 nation to strip people of their citizenship \"en masse\".A Suffolk archaeological site is pictured on the front page of the Financial Times, after new evidence of fire-making dating back 400,000 years was discovered earlier this year. The paper has also honed in on interest rates, following the Federal Reserve's \"divisive decision\" to cut them to the lowest level in three years.Sir Keir Starmer is accused of \"handing our country over\" to the EU on the front page of the Express, with the paper reporting that Chancellor Rachel Reeves has become the \"latest cabinet minister to hint at joining an EU customs union\". The Sun says Davina McCall has \"wed in secret\", claiming the television personality  married celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas in a \"tiny bash\" close to her home in Kent. \"Down to earth\" darts champion Luke Littler beams from the front page of the Daily Star, which says he only receives £50 a week in pocket money.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterOlympic medal-winning swimmer and campaigner Sharron Davies has been named as one of three new Conservative peers.Ms Davies, a vocal critic of trans women in women's sport, was nominated by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch.The Tories said it was in recognition of her sporting achievements and her campaigning on women's rights. Iceland supermarket chairman Richard Walker and former Number 10 communications director Matthew Doyle are among 25 new Labour peers nominated by Sir Keir Starmer. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey nominated five new peers.Ms Davies will sit alongside ex-Tory cabinet minister John Redwood and journalist and historian Simon Heffer - who have also been handed peerages.She has become an outspoken campaigner against allowing transgender athletes in female competitions in order to \"protect women's sport\".The swimmer, who won a silver medal at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow and two Commonwealth golds, denied that her comments were transphobic and claimed she had spoken to many other female athletes who \"feel the same way as me\".Following her nomination, Ms Davies said it would be \"exciting to carry on fighting for women's rights and safeguarding as well as trying to get as many kids, in particular, doing sport as possible\".Meanwhile, a Labour spokesperson said their new 25 peers would allow the government to \"deliver on our mandate from the British people\" and \"correct\" the imbalance against  Labour in the House of Lords, where the Tories currently have more representation.Despite having a majority in the House of Commons, Labour is currently outnumbered in the Lords, with 209 peers to the Tories' 282.Mr Walker's nomination confirms reports earlier in the week from Labour sources calling him \"a committed champion of families dealing with the cost of living\".The 45-year-old left the Conservative Party in 2023, and was later seen at the launch of Labour's manifesto for the 2024 general election.In February this year, he gave the new government a score of \"six out of 10\" in comments to the Financial Times, taking issue with it raising employer national insurance contributions but praising its attempts to improve relations with the EU.A Labour spokesperson said: \"⁠The Tories stuffed the House of Lords, creating a serious imbalance that has allowed them to frustrate our plans to make working families better off.\"We will continue to progress our programme of reform, which includes removing the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the Lords.\"Labour is in the process of abolishing 92 seats reserved for hereditary peers - who inherit their titles through their families.Sir Keir Starmer has previously come out in favour of abolishing the House of Lords and replacing it with an elected Assembly of the Nations and Regions, but has not put forward deeper reforms before the next election.Labour’s election manifesto called House of Lords reform \"long overdue\" and \"essential\" as the chamber is too large and many peers fail to serve democracy.Among the new Labour peers are Mr Doyle, a veteran of the Tony Blair government who resigned in March after nine months leading Downing Street's press operation. Rachel Reeves's ex-chief of staff Katie Martin, was also given a peerage.Labour nominated several senior London-based political figures including Len Duvall, chair of the London Assembly, Mayor of Lewisham Brenda Dacres and ex-leader of Southwark Council Peter John.The Lib Dems nominated Lord Addington and Earl Russell, both hereditary peers, letting them stay in the House of Lords after those seats are abolished.The Earl of Kinnoull, one of the deputy speakers of the House of Lords, has also been awarded a peerage to remain as an independent crossbencher.Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said his party had appointed members who will work to \"deliver the change our country desperately needs, including reform of the House of Lords\".They include ex-Lib Dem MP Sarah Teather, who served as children's minister between 2010 and 2012, and Rhiannon Leaman who has been Sir Ed's chief of staff since 2019.No other party received new peers.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said he had written to the prime minister in the summer requesting that his party, which has five MPs and one Lord but regularly leads national voting intention polls, \"have some representation in the House of Lords\".Most Lords are entitled to a £371 daily allowance for each sitting day they attend - although they can choose not to claim it. Like MPs, they scrutinise the work of government and recommend changes to proposed legislation. Unlike MPs, however, peers are not elected.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical CorrespondentA high-profile Hong Kong pro-democracy activist living in the UK has been the target of a campaign of harassment involving letters containing fake, sexually explicit images of her sent from China to her neighbours.Carmen Lau, 30, who fled Hong Kong four years ago, told the BBC she was \"shocked\" as the letters, delivered to addresses in Maidenhead in Kent, included her name and images made to look like she was either naked or in underwear and offering sexual services.\"The letters had a couple of very unpleasant images, AI-generated or photo-shopped, where they put my face on those images, portraying me as a sex-worker,\" she said.The existence of the letters was first reported by the Guardian.The first she knew about the letters was when the local MP, Liberal Democrat Joshua Reynolds, called her to say he had been alerted by some of his constituents who had received them.Ms Lau had sought sanctuary in the UK in 2021 after opposition politicians and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong began being arrested following the imposition of a controversial new National Security Law.While in the UK she has frequently criticised China's Communist leadership and has spoken out about China's controversial plans to build a 'mega embassy' in London, warning that it could become a base for trans-national repression of China's critics abroad.Last year up to a dozen of the same neighbours in Kent had received letters sent from Hong Kong, and purporting to come from the police, offering a bounty payment of £95,000 to anyone who would take Ms Lau and hand her over to the Chinese embassy in London.The new letters were sent last month from the Chinese territory of Macau, close to Hong Kong.\"I was quite shocked because last time it wasn't explicit and so unpleasant to see,\" Ms Lau told the BBC.\"When I was in Hong Kong pro-Beijing agents were trained to use gender-based harassment targeting pro-democracy activists,\" she said, \"but AI technology has enhanced this sort of intimidation, it is beyond just transnational repression, as a woman it is very worrying\".Reynolds told the BBC \"the government need to be very clear that this is not acceptable, we cannot have these letters sent to UK residents\".\"We need to find out who sent these letters,\" he said, adding \"officials in Beijing need to be held accountable\".Reynolds said he had raised the issue with both the Home Office and the Foreign Office.A government spokesperson said \"the safety and security of Hong Kongers in the United Kingdom is of the utmost importance\".Ms Lau said police had told her they would be investigating.The government has previously insisted that any attempt by a foreign power to intimidate, harass, or harm individuals or communities would not be tolerated.It has said the UK continues to raise concerns about transnational repression directly with the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities, and has publicly condemned the issuing of arrest warrants and bounties by the Hong Kong Police Force.",

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterPresident Donald Trump has launched a scheme offering fast-tracked US visas to wealthy foreigners who can pay at least $1m (£750,000).The card will give buyers a \"direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,\" Trump said on social media on Wednesday.The Trump Gold Card, which was first announced earlier this year, is a US visa awarded to those who can demonstrate they will provide a \"substantial benefit\" to the country, according to the scheme's official website.It comes as Washington intensifies its immigration crackdown, including raising work visa fees and deporting undocumented migrants.The Gold Card scheme promises US residency in \"record time\" and will require a $1m fee which is \"evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States\", the programme's website said.Businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m, along with additional fees. A \"platinum\" version of the card that offers special tax breaks will also be available soon for $5m, the website said.Extra fees to the government may be charged depending on each applicant's circumstances, the site said. Individuals are also required to pay a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee before their application is reviewed.The gold card scheme has faced criticism since it was first announced in February, with some Democrats saying that it would unfairly favour wealthy individuals.When Trump first unveiled the plan he described the visas as similar to green cards, which allow immigrants of various income levels to live and work permanently in the US. Green card holders typically become eligible for citizenship after five years.But the Gold Card is aimed specifically at \"high-level\" professionals, Trump said, emphasising, \"we want people that are productive\".\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"The scheme comes as the Trump administration has devoted significant resources to deporting immigrants.The US has also paused immigration applications by individuals from the 19 countries, mostly in Africa and in the Middle East, which are subject to the president's travel ban.The government has also halted all decisions on asylum applications and said it would review thousands of cases that were approved under the administration of President Joe Biden.In September, Trump also signed an order to charge a $100,000 fee for applicants of the H-1B visa programme for skilled foreign workers. The decision caused panic among overseas student in the US and technology firms. The White House later clarified that the fee would apply only to new applicants who are currently abroad.",

    "body": "9 hours agoMaia Davies & Anna LamcheA member of the UK armed forces who died in Ukraine has been named as Lance Corporal George Hooley of the Parachute Regiment.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer paid tribute to the 28-year-old paratrooper, saying he had lived a life \"full of courage and determination\".\"He served our country with honour and distinction around the world in the cause of freedom and democracy, including as part of the small number of British personnel in Ukraine.\"The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said he had been killed in a \"tragic accident\" while observing Ukrainian forces test \"a new defensive capability, away from the front lines\" on Tuesday.Speaking in the House of Commons, Sir Keir said he had placed L/Cpl Hooley's name on record \"to express our gratitude and respect, and to affirm that his service will never be forgotten\".L/Cpl Hooley had an \"incredibly bright\" future, his commanding officer said in a tribute on Wednesday.\"I have no doubt that he would have continued to perform at the very front of his peer group over the coming years,\" the commanding officer said, adding that \"all members of the Parachute Regiment mourn his loss\".The 28-year-old's company commander added: \"If you met George Hooley, you remembered it. His energy and enthusiasm were simply extraordinary.\"He provided spark that lifted others, a drive that inspired, and a zest for life that reminded us all how to live with purpose and joy. And we loved him for it. George had a rare gift: a deep kindness and genuine time for everyone.\"He was \"the model of professionalism\" and a \"born soldier\", the company commander added.\"His colleagues will tell you that he wasn't just part of the team, he was the character within it. The glue. The laughter. The calm voice of sense. The soldier who made the hard days easy and the good days memorable.\"The paratrooper was due to be promoted to Corporal in January and had been given the role's responsibilities on his deployment to Ukraine, the MoD said.He had previously been deployed to Afghanistan, Africa and Eastern Europe.Defence Secretary John Healey shared his condolences with L/Cpl Hooley's family and colleagues. He said: \"He served our country with distinction. His tragic death reminds us of the courage and commitment with which our outstanding armed forces serve every day.\"The BBC understands the incident is not thought to have been caused by hostile fire. A military source told the BBC two Ukrainian personnel were believed to have died in the incident, and several more were injured.The weapons system being tested was said to be an armed interceptor drone, according to unconfirmed reports.Ukraine's Ministry of Defence has been approached for comment.It is not known what L/Cpl Hooley's role was in the country. This is the first time the presence of paratroopers in Ukraine has been confirmed.The UK government has never disclosed the number of service people in Ukraine, but has previously acknowledged a small number is there to support Ukrainian armed forces and provide security to diplomatic personnel.The Parachute Regiment is an airborne infantry regiment of the British Army.It has not been confirmed in which battalion L/Cpl Hooley served. The first battalion is under the direction of special forces, while others are part of the Army's rapid response formation.It is the first death of a UK service member in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.The Parachute Regiment said it was mourning the death of the 28-year-old, who joined the British Army in November 2015.He joined the Regiment in June 2016 after completing his training at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick in North Yorkshire, it said in a statement on social media.A series of meetings to bring the war in Ukraine to an end have taken place in recent weeks, following interventions from US President Donald Trump and a range of European leaders.Sir Keir told the Commons he had met Ukraine's President Zelensky in Downing Street on Monday, alongside France's President Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as efforts to negotiate an end to the war intensify.\"We must redouble our efforts,\" he told the House.\"The UK, Europe and our allies will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine, stand up to Putin's aggression and work to deliver a just and lasting peace.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, also speaking in the Commons, said: \"The thoughts of the whole House will rightly be with family of Lance Corporal Hooley, who tragically died supporting Ukraine in her fight for freedom.\"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who welcomed Healey to Washington DC for defence talks on Wednesday, also paid tribute to L/Cpl Hooley, saying: \"It is a reflection of the sacrifice and commitment that so many make around the world.\"",

    "body": "Banks to tell you where you might put your money4 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesPeople who might otherwise turn to friends, family, or social media influencers for financial advice are to be given new help to invest their money.Targeted support from registered banks and other financial firms is being given the go-ahead by the City regulator and should start in April.This will allow firms to make investment and pensions recommendations based on what similar groups of people could do with their money.It still falls short of individually tailored advice, which can only be provided by an authorised financial adviser for a fee.Nearly one in five people turned to family, friends or social media for help making financial decisions, according to a survey by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive of the FCA, said the new regime would be \"game changing\". \"It means millions of people can get extra help to make better financial decisions,\" she said.\"We also hope it will build greater confidence to invest. While investing will not be right for everyone, we know people in the UK invest less compared to the EU or US.\"'Advice gap'Investing money is not an option for millions of people. The regulator said that one in 10 people had no cash savings, and another 21% had less than £1,000 to draw on in an emergency.However, FCA data suggested about seven million adults in the UK with £10,000 or more in cash savings could receive better returns through investing.Investing does come with some risk as the value of an investment can go down as well as up, but the spending power of cash savings can be eroded by rising prices.The regulator said that many consumers who were in a position to invest but chose not to did so because they were unsure of their options, felt overwhelmed,  or needed more support. Only 9% of people surveyed received regulated advice on their pensions and investments in the 12 months to May 2024.Targeted support aims to bridge a gap between general guidance and information, and financial advisers who charge a fee.For example, banks could explain how a large pot of cash savings could be invested, or how investments could be spread out to reduce risk. \"The FCA's new rules mark a significant step towards closing the advice gap and will empower millions,\" said Yvonne Braun, director of policy at the Association of British Insurers.Some consumer groups have made clear that the new rules must not be a pathway to firms exploiting customers.The FCA said firms taking part would need to be authorised in advance. They might include banks, building societies, investment platforms and digital wallet providers.They would also be required to show that their recommendations were suitable and should only be offered when it put people in a better position, the regulator said. Any customer vulnerabilities would need to be identified and taken into account.Consumers will have the right to take any disputes that arise to the independent financial ombudsman.There will also be a move to allow people to make more informed decisions with their pensions.The regulator's new rules will require legislation, but the government has made it a clear objective to encourage people to invest. The Treasury believes this will help to create economic growth.It was one of the reasons for the decision by Chancellor Rachel Reeves to cut the annual allowance for cash Isas (Individual Savings Accounts) from £20,000 to £12,000 a year for under 65s, from April 2027.Separately, the FCA has launched a \"firm checker\" tool to help prevent people from losing money to fraudsters through investment scams.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSimon Jack,Business editorandArchie MitchellWatch: GSK boss Dame Emma Walmsley lays out competitions facing the UKThe US is the best place for a business to invest, the boss of one of the UK's biggest pharmaceutical companies has said.Dame Emma Walmsley, chief executive of vaccines and medicines giant GSK, said it will invest $30bn (£23bn) in the US by 2030.It comes as other major drug makers have pulled UK projects worth billions after years of frustration on NHS drug budgets and pressure from President Donald Trump to set up production in the US.However Dame Emma, who will leave GSK in January after eight years in charge, welcomed a new deal which will see the NHS pay more to help secure zero tariffs on shipping UK pharmaceuticals to America.Speaking to the BBC from the firm's central London headquarters, Dame Emma said she would not \"shy away\" from GSK's investment plans for the US, where it makes more than half of its turnover.The US is \"still the leading market in the world in terms of the launches of new drugs and vaccines,\" she said. And alongside China, it was \"the best market in the world to do business development,\" she added.GSK's latest stateside investment drive followed US pharmaceutical company Merck - which is called MSD in Europe – scrapping a planned £1bn expansion of its UK operations.UK drug maker AstraZeneca has also announced it is pausing a planned £200m investment in a Cambridge research facility while ploughing tens of billions of dollars into the US.Other drug companies have also said there is little appetite to invest in the UK which successive governments have insisted is a life sciences superpower. Despite the challenges facing Britain's pharmaceuticals industry, Dame Emma said the deal to scrap tariffs on UK drug shipments to the US was \"a step in the right direction\" for Britain.The deal means the UK will pay more for medicines through the NHS - in return for a guarantee that US import taxes on pharmaceuticals made in the UK will remain at zero for three years.Dame Emma said it was a welcome reversal of a long term decline in the portion of the NHS budget spent on medicines compared to other countries' health systems. The move, she said, would encourage the kind of innovation that supports ground breaking new medicines like GSK's new asthma drug which can be taken twice a year and could slash hospital admissions by 70% for serious asthma sufferers.GSK hopes the new treatment will be approved for use by the NHS within weeks. Asked about the health of the country, she said there were \"social demographic root causes\" for its decline.She said UK health outcomes varied widely depending on where you live  \"you can probably get a 10 or 15-year difference in lifespan prospects depending on which postcode you're in.\"Dame Emma pointed to British diets and a lack of education around nutrition as part of the problem.  \"I think there's no question that the food system is fundamentally something we need to look at harder,\" she said.Dame Emma also opened up about the differences she has experienced between the NHS and the private healthcare system in the US, having given birth in London, Paris and twice in New York.\"Both the experience of childbirth and all the follow up that happens afterwards are very, very different,\" she said. \"Anything from the advice you're given...the frequency with which you are expected to be visited, how long you are in hospital and what kind of follow-up advice.\"Dame Emma said what matters is the balance of price, access and outcomes, and that the NHS still has \"work to do\" on getting the balance right.Dame Emma, who also sits on the board of Microsoft, said the world was on the cusp of major advances in health science thanks in part to advances in AI which promise to accelerate innovation \"90 % of the projects in our industry don't work, they take a decade and cost billions, getting to a place where you just double that to you know, instead of 10% working, 20% working will completely change the trajectory of innovation\"In the end, she said, few things are more important than health. \"It is one of the few things that every single person on the planet ends up caring about\".",

    "body": "Author Sophie Kinsella remembered as a 'wonderful, warm woman'11 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Sophie Kinsella's books have sold more than 50 million copies in more than 60 countriesSophie Kinsella, author of the bestselling Shopaholic series of novels, has been remembered as a \"wonderful, warm woman\" following her death at the age of 55.The writer, whose real name is Madeleine Sophie Wickham, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2022.Me Before You author Jojo Moyes, who has known Kinsella for 20 years, told BBC News she had \"never met anybody who carried more grace\".\"She was incredibly kind, incredibly smart, and she wore her success and her brilliance so lightly,\" she said.\"There was not a person who met her who didn't light up in her presence, because she was just good and kind, and people felt that through her characters,\" Moyes told the BBC's David Sillito.\"She was one of the best people I've ever met... I feel really glad to have known her, really lucky to have had her in my life.\"How 'little treats' helped Sophie Kinsella through cancerKinsella's books have sold more than 50 million copies in more than 60 countries, and have been translated into more than 40 languages.Author Jodi Picoult said Kinsella \"will be missed greatly\", while fellow novelist Adele Parks described her as a \"wonderful, warm woman\" who \"brought so much joy to the world\".\"She'll be missed so much but celebrated too and will live on in millions of minds and hearts,\" Parks said.Writer Jenny Colgan told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive: \"When you do lose someone close it can be hard to communicate [who they were] but everybody who has ever read a Sophie Kinsella novel, that is what she was like. She was really funny, really warm.\"Actress Isla Fisher, who starred in the 2009 film adaption Confessions of a Shopaholic, said she was \"absolutely heartbroken\" following Kinsella's death.\"You are still my hero, and I'm grateful for you,\" she wrote in her tribute to the author on Instagram. \"Though we won't meet again, your light and magic lives on in your incredible characters.\"Sarah CresswellKinsella, pictured in 2024, had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancerKinsella announced in 2024 that she had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma two years earlier.In a statement on Wednesday, her family said they were \"heartbroken\" to announce the death of \"our beloved Sophie\".\"She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy.\"They continued: \"We can't imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.\"Despite her illness, which she bore with unimaginable courage, Sophie counted herself truly blessed - to have such wonderful family and friends, and to have had the extraordinary success of her writing career. \"She took nothing for granted and was forever grateful for the love she received. She will be missed so much our hearts are breaking.\"'Unique voice'A statement from Kinsella's publisher said she \"defined and elevated romantic comedy by populating her stories with real-life issues that combined wit, emotional depth and societal insight\".Bill Scott-Kerr, her longstanding publisher at Transworld, described Kinsella as \"our author, our cheerleader, our fellow conspirator and our friend\".He added: \"Maddy leaves behind a glorious and indelible legacy, a unique voice, an unquenchable spirit, a goodness of intent and a body of work that will continue to inspire us to reach higher and be better, just like so many of her characters.\"British romantic comedy writer Jill Mansell offered: \"Maddy was a brilliant writer but more importantly a truly lovely person.\"In both respects she brought so much joy to the world.\"Sarah CresswellThe author's agents Araminta Whitley and Marina de Pass described Kinsella as \"an intelligent, imaginative, loving and irreverent woman who valued the deeply connective power of fiction\".\"She had a rare gift for creating emotionally resonant protagonists and stories that spoke to, and entertained, readers wherever they were in the world and whatever challenges they faced.\"They added: \"She also had an unmatched wit and ability to find the funny side. \"Comedy, for her, was both an art form and an intellectual pursuit and she instinctively understood that it is often a tightrope act of balancing light with dark.\"Moyes agreed, telling the BBC: \"The big mistake people make with Sophie's books is they assume they were easy [to write] because they're easy to read.\"But anybody who's tried to replicate them knows that she was a master plotter, and a master at characterisation. She was a genius, actually.\"Getty ImagesKinsella wrote last year that she had \"always processed my life through writing\"Kinsella was born in London in 1969, and studied music at New College, Oxford, before switching to philosophy, politics and economics. She wrote her first novel, The Tennis Party, aged 24 under her married name Madeleine Wickham, while working as a financial journalist.\"My overriding concern was that I didn't write the autobiographical first novel,\" she told the Guardian in 2012. \"I was so, so determined not to write about a 24-year-old journalist. \"It was going to have male characters, and middle-aged people, so I could say, look, I'm not just writing about my life, I'm a real author.\"The book was acclaimed by critics and became a top 10 bestseller. She released six further novels as Madeleine Wickham.Five years later, writing as Sophie Kinsella, she published The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic - also known as Confessions of a Shopaholic.It introduced readers to Becky Bloomwood, a financial journalist who is a serial shopper and hopeless when it comes to her own finances, often buying new clothes or shoes on her credit card rather than saving her money.\"I thought, wait a minute, shopping has become the national pastime, and nobody has written about it,\" Kinsella said of her bestselling series.Getty ImagesA film adaptation of Confessions of a Shopaholic starring Isla Fisher was released in 2009After its huge success, Kinsella went on to write eight further Shopaholic novels and a short story, and another 18 books in total, including one young adult novel and four children's books.Kinsella's other works include Can You Keep A Secret? and The Undomestic Goddess.Her books were occasionally referred to as \"chick lit\" - a description she did not fully endorse\"When I hear the term 'chick lit', I feel a pinprick of, not annoyance but of slight resignation,\" she told the Daily Mail in 2018. \"'Oh, this again…' \"I've never had anyone say to my face, 'Your books are inferior,' but if people say, 'Your books are beach reads,' I say, 'Yep, that's fine by me. Read them on the beach!'\"Kinsella's most recent novella, What Does It Feel Like?, published in October 2024, was a semi-fictional account of her cancer diagnosis, written after she had surgery.In an introduction to the book, Kinsella said she had \"always processed my life through writing\".\"Hiding behind my fictional characters, I have always turned my own life into a narrative. It is my version of therapy, maybe.\"Kinsella is survived by her husband Henry and their five children.What is a glioblastoma?Glioblastomas are the deadliest and most aggressive type of brain cancer.About 3,200 people are diagnosed with a glioblastoma every year in the UK. Of these, just 160 survive for five years or more.It's a type of cancer that grows quickly - glioblastomas are likely to spread within the brain and come back even after being removed.Symptoms vary, but can include headaches caused by a build-up of pressure, personality changes, and memory problems. People may also have trouble speaking or experience extreme tiredness, depression, seizures and sight problems.Common treatments include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or if a patient is well enough, a surgeon will try to remove as much cancer as possible during an operation.",

    "body": "57 minutes agoKayla EpsteinWatch: Video shows US military seizing oil tanker off Venezuela coastUS forces have seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, President Donald Trump said, marking a sharp escalation in Washington's pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro's government.\"We have just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela - a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.Releasing a video of the seizure, Attorney General Pam Bondi described the vessel as a \"crude oil tanker used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\".Caracas swiftly denounced the action, calling it an act of \"international piracy\". Earlier, President Maduro declared that Venezuela would never become an \"oil colony\".The Trump administration accuses Venezuela of funnelling narcotics into the US and has intensified its efforts to isolate President Maduro in recent months. Venezuela - home to some of the world's largest proven oil reserves - has, in turn, accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.Brent crude prices inched higher on Wednesday as news of the seizure stoked short-term supply concerns. Analysts warn the move could threaten shippers and further disrupt Venezuela's oil exports.US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the US Department of Justice, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the US Coast Guard co-ordinated the seizure.\"For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,\" the nation's top prosecutor wrote on X.Footage shared by Bondi showed a military helicopter hovering over a large ship, and troops descending on to the deck using ropes. Uniformed men were seen in the clip moving about the ship with guns drawn.A senior military official told the BBC's US partner CBS that the helicopters used in the operation launched from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which was sent to the Caribbean last month.It involved two helicopters, 10 Coast Guard members and 10 Marines, as well as special forces.Watch: Venezuela’s Maduro sings \"Don't worry, be happy\" as he calls for peace with the USDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth was aware of the operation, and the Trump administration was considering more actions like this, a source told CBS.When asked by reporters what the US would do with the oil on the tanker, Trump said: \"We keep it, I guess... I assume we're going to keep the oil.\" Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech identified the vessel as the Skipper and said it believed the ship had been \"spoofing\" its position - or broadcasting a false location - for a long time.The US treasury department sanctioned the Skipper in 2022, CBS reported, for alleged involvement in oil smuggling that generated revenue for Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.BBC Verify located this tanker on MarineTraffic, which shows it was sailing under the flag of Guyana when its position was last updated two days ago. A statement from Guyana's Maritime Administration Department on Wednesday evening, however, said that the Skipper was \"falsely flying the Guyana Flag as it is not registered in Guyana.\"Watch: Trump says US has seized \"large tanker\" off Venezuela coastThe Venezuelan government issued a statement denouncing the seizure as a \"grave international crime\".Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello called the US \"murderers, thieves, pirates\".He referred to Pirates of the Caribbean, but said that while that film's lead character Jack Sparrow was a \"hero\", he believed \"these guys are high seas criminals, buccaneers\".Cabello said this was how the US had \"started wars all over the world\".Speaking at a rally earlier on Wednesday, Maduro had a message for Americans opposed to war with Venezuela. It came in the form of a 1988 hit song.\"To American citizens who are against the war, I respond with a very famous song: Don't worry, be happy,\" Maduro said in Spanish before singing along to the lyrics of the 1988 hit.\"Not war, be happy. Not, not crazy war, not, be happy.\"It's unclear if Maduro knew about the seizure of the tanker before this rally.In recent days, the US has ramped up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north.The build-up involves thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela, BBC Verify reported. The move has sparked speculation about the potential for some kind of military action.Since September, the US has conducted at least 22 strikes on boats in the region that the Trump administration says are smuggling drugs. At least 80 people have died in these attacks.Ione Wells contributed to this report from Sao Paulo, Brazil.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJoe Pike,Politics investigations correspondentandJoshua Nevett,Political reporterBBCLord Mandelson was arrested at his London home on MondayLord Mandelson's lawyers have said police officers arrested the former ambassador to the US at his London home on Monday afternoon because they worried he was a flight risk.The peer's lawyers have told the BBC there is \"absolutely no truth\" in the suggestion that Lord Mandelson was planning to leave the UK and move abroad.The Metropolitan Police has said it will not comment.The former Labour minister was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office on Monday and later released on bail, pending further investigation.A spokesperson for Mishcon De Reya, Lord Mandelson's lawyers, said: \"Peter Mandelson was arrested yesterday despite an agreement with the police that he would attend an interview next month on a voluntary basis.\"The arrest was prompted by a baseless suggestion that he was planning to leave the country and take up permanent residence abroad. There is absolutely no truth whatsoever in any such suggestion.\"We have asked the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] for the evidence relied upon to justify the arrest. \"Peter Mandelson's overriding priority is to cooperate with the police investigation, as he has done throughout this process, and to clear his name.\"Lord Mandelson was arrested on Monday afternoon and taken to Wandsworth police station in London for interview.He was at the police station for nine hours before being released on bail in the early hours of Tuesday morning.The force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.The arrest on Monday followed search warrants at two addresses in Wiltshire and Camden.The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.On Monday, Lord Mandelson was seen being led away from his London home by plain clothes officers who put him in the back of an unmarked car.The BBC understands his arrest was carried out by officers from the Met's central specialist crime division.Consultations between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service are ongoing.The Met said Lord Mandelson has been bailed to the end of May.The former Labour spin doctor has been a high profile figure in British politics for decades.He began working for Labour in the 1980s, playing a key role in the New Labour movement and Sir Tony Blair's landslide election victory in 1997.Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.An email from 2009 appears to show that Lord Mandelson passed on an assessment by an adviser to the then prime minister Gordon Brown about policy measures, including an \"asset sales plan\".He also appeared to discuss a tax on bankers' bonuses and confirm an imminent bailout package for the Euro on the day before it was announced in 2010.",

    "body": "4 hours agoThe fourth anniversary of the war in Ukraine leads the Financial Times, which pictures Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alongside other European leaders holding commemorative candles during a ceremony in Kyiv's Independence Square on Tuesday. The headline reads \"US shuns war anniversary\", noting that the Trump administration did not send a representative to Kyiv for the ceremony.\"Prince of Darkness\" declares the Daily Star, following the arrest and subsequent release of former US ambassador Lord Mandelson on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The paper pictures the former Labour minister leaving the police station in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.The Guardian says that Lord Mandelson was arrested over concerns that he was a flight risk, and reports that his lawyers say Scotland Yard previously agreed to interview the peer under caution next month rather than arrest him. According to the paper, the Met were told Lord Mandelson was preparing to move abroad to the British Virgin Islands, a claim his lawyers have dismissed as \"baseless\".\"Flight-risk fiction led to my arrest\" is the headline on the Times story about Lord Mandelson. Police declined to comment when asked by the paper the conditions of Lord Mandelson's arrest, including whether or not he had been forced to surrender his passport. The Telegraph says that officials have now confirmed that they will release documents related to Lord Mandelson's work in government in early March, but notes that MPs will have the final say over what is made available to the public.\"Minister attacks 'rude, arrogant' Andrew in historic Commons rebuke\" declares the i Paper, following what it calls an \"unprecedented political attack\" on the former prince by trade minister Chris Bryant. According to the paper, he said Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was a man \"on a constant self-aggrandising and self-enriching hustle\".Andrew is pictured on the front page of the Sun under the headline \"Get orf your high horse Andy\", following reports that the former prince has been banned from horse riding in the wake of his arrest.The Mail features a political piece on the front page of its Wednesday edition, which takes a look at the Green Party's immigration policy. The paper says that under the proposed policy, illegal migrants would be given a free house and a wage with \"no requirement to work\", in addition to free use of the NHS. \"Beware the green menace,\" the paper warns.Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown has penned a piece for the Mirror to warn voters of the \"dark days of Tory austerity\", ahead of a by-election in Gordon and Denton. He writes that \"poorer children will suffer the most\" under Reform UK, and adds that the Nigel Farage's party plans to cut the rights of works and renters.\"Tough porn crackdown to tackle abuse\" says the Metro, which says that new laws will make it illegal to create or possess pornographic content which portrays incest or \"twisted family sex\". The changes are part of an amendment to last year's Crime and Policing Bill, which entered Parliament on Monday, and are designed to protect women and girls.The Express leads on new research that suggests that \"millions\" of people in the UK went without healthcare that they needed last year.Related Internet Links",

The court heard the Fabergé egg had not been located.Conticello admitted theft and three charges of fraud by misrepresentation. He was remanded into custody to next appear at the same court on 6 March.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.Addressing Conticello, also known as Hakin Boudjenoune, after he pleaded guilty, Judge Martin Griffiths said: \"I expect it was probably quite a surprise to you when you discovered that egg.\"What you did with it, I don't quite know, but I expect we're going to find out.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorPAIt was quite a moment when a minister of the crown called the King's brother \"rude, arrogant and entitled\" at the despatch box of the House of Commons.Granted, Sir Chris Bryant was almost as disobliging about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor 15 years ago, as an opposition MP, when there were calls then for him to be sacked as the government's trade envoy.So Sir Chris's views about the former prince are not new but still, when speaking on behalf of the government, it tells you something about how the collapse in respect for Mountbatten-Windsor has been near total.But the debate in the Commons, triggered by a Liberal Democrat demand for documents relating to the former prince's appointment as a trade envoy to be published, was not a case study in and of itself in a collapse of parliamentary deference around the Royal Family.Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has effectively been fired out of a cannon — disowned by the Royal Family and the political classes, and stripped of his titles.But remarks were much more muted, restrained or simply absent about remaining senior royals.There were, though, some concerns expressed about those conventions — and a sense from some that for too long custom had been the midwife of deference and that must change.MPs back move to release files on Andrew's appointment as trade envoyAndrew is Prince William's problem too - and it makes his future job harderHow much could Andrew's arrest hurt the Royal Family?Why the limitations on criticising the royals, asked some. Why limit the capacity of the Freedom of Information Act to allow probing questions of the monarchy? Why not have a public inquiry into all of the recent revelations?The government has said it will publish the documents relating to the appointment of the former prince 25 years ago. But they are more circumspect about those other requests, while saying they want to press on \"at pace\" in removing Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession.But let's see how sustained and broad — or the opposite — the appetite for radical change around conventions really is.Such things have a British habit of being rather sticky. But perhaps the drip, drip of disclosures and developments may shift things. Let's see.It is also true that there is a subtlety to these conventions. Debate about the Royal Family isn't banned – the House of Commons Library points to the Counsellors of State Act 2022, which was fully debated in the Commons and the Lords.And, clearly, the Royal Family is treated as different to the rest of us, in Parliament and beyond. Some cherish this, some don't, but it is a fundamental reality of a hereditary monarchy.One final observation. In a parliamentary debate a week after the King's brother was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into his conduct, no MPs stood up and made a first-principles, direct argument for the abolition of the monarchy.Granted, the debate was sparsely populated for much of the discussion and there are MPs in the Commons right now who would prefer an elected head of state to the current constitutional arrangements.But the case for a republic appears to be a first-order concern to fewer MPs now than it has been in the past.And, perhaps counterintuitively to some given what many see as the rolling horror show of revelations right now, this moment is yet to provoke, among many parliamentarians at least, a debate about the fundamentals of the UK's constitutional settlement.For those in Buckingham Palace braced for whatever might come next in this saga, that may be at least some consolation.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThe NHS says it has secured a rescue package of alternative medical cement to allow joint surgery to continue.Last week hospitals had been told to postpone treatments, including knee and hip replacements, after the health service's main supplier encountered a major production problem.The NHS was thought to have only two weeks' supply in stock and so was focussing on emergency patients and the most complex cases on the waiting list.But NHS England believes the shortfall will now be covered after a new supplier was found and an existing supplier agreed to up its deliveries.Prof Tim Briggs of NHS England said: \"This shortage has been extremely concerning for patients and surgeons and we are delighted the NHS has now been able to secure this 'rescue package' of alternative bone cement to ensure trauma and elective care can continue across the country.\"Heraeus Medical, which supplies around three-quarters of the bone cement used by the NHS, had to temporarily halt production at its main site in Germany last week.It said it had experienced a critical machine failure when it was in the process of upgrading its production processes. It is expected to cause disruption to supply for two months.The product is used in more than 1,000 operations a week, including in joint replacements and to treat older patients who have suffered falls and those with broken hips.Currently there are 850,000 patients on the waiting list in England requiring planned treatment for their joints – the largest of any speciality.But the NHS has now secured enough for 10 to 12 weeks' supply of bone cement from Dutch manufacturer Zimmer Biomet, with the first stocks already in the country.One of the NHS's other suppliers – Johnson and Johnson – has said it can increase its deliveries too.The extra supplies will also be available to hospitals in other parts of the UK which were affected too.Fergal Monsell of the British Orthopaedic Association said: \"The alternative bone cement has been widely used since 2008 and has been assessed by surgical experts who confirm that it has the same chemical components and material properties. \"Patients can therefore be reassured that it this will not affect the outcome of their surgery.\"Health minister Zubir Ahmed said he was delighted by the breakthrough: \"This government's top health priority is cutting NHS waiting lists – and while it's good news that disruption has been minimised, our focus is now on rescheduling those procedures that were postponed.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoDaniela RelphSenior royal correspondentGetty ImagesThe MPs in the chamber did not hold back. This was new territory – hearing politicians openly criticising a member of the Royal Family in a parliamentary debate was striking.The language was stark. We heard Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was \"a rude, arrogant, entitled man who could not distinguish between the public interest, which he said he served, and his own private interest\".For Buckingham Palace, it may have been an uncomfortable watch at times.MPs shared their personal experiences of meeting the former prince – all of them were resoundingly negative. The debate, called by the Liberal Democrats to demand the release of documents relating to Andrew's 2001 appointment as UK trade envoy, took in privilege, deference, and holding power to account. The talk was of building a culture of accountability and transparency.MPs questioned Andrew's appointment and what oversight existed during his decade-long tenure, and if lessons had been learned following allegations he shared sensitive information with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on specific allegations that have emerged after the US release of files in January related to Epstein. He has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to the late financier.The fact that this debate happened at all is in itself significant. It reflects the heat of the Andrew story and how conventions are shifting with the public mood.Buckingham Palace will not be getting involved in the details of what we heard today, but their position remains the same. Their focus is on supporting the police investigation and they will not be saying anything that could impact the proper process of the law.Erskine May, the guide to parliamentary procedure first published in 1844, says MPs should not put a question before Parliament which \"casts reflections upon the sovereign or the Royal Family\".That has generally been treated more as guidance than an official ban on discussing or criticising the Royal Family in Parliament.Decisions on royals being talked about in Parliament have been managed by the Speaker of the House, with a nod to convention and historical precedent.Over the years, MPs have generally abided by that approach - sometimes grudgingly.Today was perhaps the closest Parliament had come to removing those bandages.The level of public interest and the mounting questions around Andrew's work as trade envoy made it worthy of parliamentary debate.Several MPs said the public deserved clarity about the nature of his official role and how concerns, if raised at the time, were handled.It was, of course, a debate with limitations due to the ongoing police investigation but even hearing the small number of MPs in the chamber openly discussing stories that had existed in the shadows for so long felt impactful.Today was a reminder that public mood is moving fast and conventions must sometimes shift with it.Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, who led the debate, called the Jeffrey Epstein associations with the British establishment a \"stain\" on the UK and said today's debate had been an opportunity to \"clean away that stain with the disinfectant of transparency\".More on this story",

    "body": "30 minutes agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent on Capitol HillReutersDonald Trump delivered a combative State of the Union address on Tuesday night that hailed what he said was an American \"turnaround for the ages\".At a time when polls suggest many in the US are dissatisfied with the current state of the nation – and with Trump's leadership of it – the president offered little hint of a change of course.Instead, he delivered a sales pitch to the nation, a patriotic rallying cry to his loyal supporters and taunts for his political opponents.His speech opened with familiar lines. \"Our nation is back,\" he said. It was the \"hottest\" country in the world. At one point, after blaming Democrats for creating a crisis of \"affordability\", he added: \"We are doing really well.\"He pointed to the rising incomes, a growing stock market, lower petrol prices, a southern border with dramatically reduced undocumented migrant crossing and tamed inflation.\"Our country is winning again,\" he concluded.The challenge for the president is that his public approval ratings are hovering around 40 percent, and the American public wants him to do more to address their concerns. Last month, he gave a national address from the White House where he struck similar themes and cited similar statistics – but it hasn't convinced the public. The president and his aides appear to be hoping that with a bigger State of the Union audience, which should measure in the tens of millions, the results will be different.What Trump didn't do in this speech, however, was offer much in the way of new policies. He sprinkled the nearly two-hour address with a handful of ideas, including new retirement savings accounts for working-class Americans and a deal with AI companies to provide sufficient electricity for their plants to avoid consumers being hit with higher bills.He made new pitches for other, older ideas, such as a healthcare plan that provides direct payments to Americans to help cover insurance premiums, a law to require all voters to prove their citizenship and ban on providing commercial driver's licences to undocumented migrants.He also pledged to continue to push ahead with his broad tariff regime, even in the face of last Friday's Supreme Court decision striking down many of the duties he had previously imposed.Three of the justices who had ruled against the president remained expressionless as they watched on from the front row. Watch: Trump says he has overseen a \"turnaround for the ages\" in first year backIn a speech that was frequently interrupted by cheering Republicans in the crowd, Trump's tariff discussion prompted murmurs from Democrats and uncomfortable silences from Republicans, many of whom have been uneasy about their economic cost and the threat their unpopularity with the public might pose to their electoral chances.If tariffs sucked the air out of the chamber, when Trump turned to immigration tempers flared.Trump's passages on what he said was the threat of \"illegal aliens\" prompted some of the most thunderous applause from Republicans in the chamber and angry shouts and icy stares from Democrats.The immigration issue had been one of Trump's political strengths, but his enforcement surge in Minneapolis, which resulted in the shooting deaths of two American citizens by federal agents, has significantly eroded his standing.The president made no mention of those fatal shootings - or the \"softer approach\" to enforcement he had suggested might be needed in the aftermath. Instead, Trump's speech, with its focus on crimes committed by undocumented migrants – murders, accidents and corruption – was an attempt to wrest back the issue.\"The only thing standing between Americans and a wide-open border right now is President Donald J Trump and our great Republican patriots in Congress,\" he said.That was a tacit acknowledgement that in just over eight months, Americans will head to the polls in midterm elections that will determine the composition of both chambers of Congress.As is typical with these congressional addresses, no matter who the president is, foreign policy tended to take a back seat. Despite the massive build-up of American forces near Iran, Trump did little to make the case to the American public that a sustained US military action was necessary.For the moment, the political winds are blowing in the president's face. But Trump may believe that the public's mood is poised for a change.Perhaps he is convinced Americans will begin to feel the economic benefits of his policies. Or maybe he believes the mood will shift, with a renewed sense of patriotisim, during the nation's 250th birthday celebrations this summer.His speech, with call-outs to military heroes and gold-medal-winning hockey players in the audience, could hint that this is a political wager he has placed.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesEnergy bills will fall in April following a shake-up in costs by the government, with details of the extent of the drop to be announced shortly.Nearly everyone in England, Wales and Scotland will benefit from a cut irrespective of their tariff, although the amounts will vary between households.Energy regulator Ofgem will publish its next price cap imminently. The latest forecasts suggest households on variable tariffs will see their bill cut by about 7%.However, prices still remain relatively high by historical standards, debts have ballooned, and billpayers are being urged to shop around for further savings.Budget promise to reduce billsDomestic gas and electricity bills are a complicated mix of charges for energy policy, costs to run the network, as well as the price of gas and electricity to run a home.In November's Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced changes to the first of these - policy costs. She said the typical annual household energy bill would fall by £150, by scrapping the Energy Company Obligation (Eco) scheme introduced by the Conservatives in government, and also moving some charges onto general taxation.So, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have forecast that a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will see their annual bill drop by £117, to £1,641 in April. A similar fall was seen last summer, but prices have risen since then. The announcement for bills in April will be made at 07:00 GMT on Wednesday.Crucially, the discount on each household's individual energy bill will depend on the size and type of household and how much energy it uses.The reduction is expected to be primarily applied through a lower price per unit of electricity used. This means high electricity users, which may include vulnerable households with medical equipment, are likely to see the biggest benefit. Those who use little electricity and a lot of gas will benefit the least.Ofgem is announcing changes to its price cap, which affects millions of households on variable deals.However, the changes to policy costs will also mean a reduction in bills for those on fixed deals. They will be contacted by their supplier with details in the coming weeks on the specific change to their tariff.The wholesale cost of gas, which spiked after Russia's invasion of Ukraine four years ago and led to soaring household bills, remains relatively volatile and difficult to predict.This makes it tricky to say what will happen to domestic energy bills later in the year, but Cornwall Insight is forecasting relatively little further change.Regulators and campaigners have encouraged people to shop around for a cheaper, fixed deal, depending on their circumstances.Richard Neudegg, director of regulation at Uswitch, said: \"While it is good news that the price cap is coming down, consumers should not be fooled into thinking that it is a good deal. \"By moving into a competitive fixed deal, consumers could save £200 [a year] as well as get the benefit of these government changes.\"Cost of living pressureEnergy bills will fall in April, but other bills will increase - meaning most people will continue to face a squeeze in the cost of living.Water bills will rise sharply in some areas, council tax will go up, and various other household costs will increase. Some larger families will receive more in universal credit when the two child benefit cap is scrapped.Households struggling to make ends meet have fallen behind on energy payments, leading to a collective debt to suppliers of well over £4bn.Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said companies can help.\"They are giving them different tariffs, extra help and support, offer white goods such as efficient fridges, but they can only do this if they know who is in your household and what your circumstances are,\" she said.",

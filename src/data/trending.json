The US government has said the strikes in international waters were targeting \"narco-traffickers\". </p><p>But it has not provided evidence or details about who or what is aboard, and the strikes have attracted condemnation in countries in the region amid concerns they breach international law.</p><p>The US Senate rejected a measure on Wednesday that would have barred President Donald Trump from using military force against the boats. </p></div><div><p>Petro replied to a post on X by US Senator Adam Schiff, a Democrat, who said he would vote to block strikes against vessels in the Caribbean as some lawmakers sought to challenge the use of the armed forces in Congress. </p><p>The Colombian president said that a \"new war scenario has opened up: the Caribbean\".</p><p>Petro added that \"indications show that the last boat bombed was Colombian with Colombian citizens inside it.</p><p>\"I hope their families come forward and report it. There is no war against smuggling; there is a war for oil and it must be stopped by the world. The aggression is against all of Latin America and the Caribbean.\"</p><p>Petro did not provide further details about the alleged identities of those on board. The US has not commented on the identities of the individuals killed in the strikes.</p><p>The White House said in a statement that it \"looks forward to President Petro publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement\". </p><p>It said that while the two nations had \"policy differences\", the US remained \"committed to close co-operation on a range of shared priorities, including regional security and stability\". </p><p>The US says its strikes, which began on 2 September, had targeted vessels off the coast of Venezuela that it alleges were carrying illegal drugs. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o\">First US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': Was it legal?</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c78nl9lz8zeo\">What is Trump's goal after bombing 'Venezuela drugs boat'?</a></li></ul><p>The measure considered by the Senate on Wednesday, which would have required Trump to seek congressional approval for the strikes, was rejected in a 48-51 vote.</p><p>It had been introduced by Democratic Senators Schiff and Tim Kaine. The vote broke down mostly along partisan lines.</p><p>Earlier this month, a leaked memo sent to Congress said that the US was now categorising itself as being in a \"non-international armed conflict\". </p><p>Framing this as an active armed conflict is likely a way for the administration to justify the use of wartime powers, including killing \"enemy fighters\", even if they pose no violent threat.</p><p>Trump has already designated many cartels, including in Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela, as terrorist organisations – granting US authorities more powers in their response to them.</p></div>",

cutting a figure more akin to an off-duty rock star than a bank CEO - wearing an open-collar shirt and jeans, and high-fiving staff on his way to the stage.  </p><p>Opening with his take on the UK's economy, Dimon said he felt Rachel Reeves was doing a \"terrific job\", and he felt optimistic about some of the government's attempts to boost innovation and cut regulation.</p><p>However, on the broader economic picture, he felt there were increased risks US stock markets were overheated.</p><p>\"I am far more worried about that than others,\" he said.</p></div><div><p>There were a \"lot of things out there\" creating an atmosphere of uncertainty, he added, pointing to risk factors like the geopolitical environment, fiscal spending and the remilitarisation of the world. </p><p>\"All these things cause a lot of issues that we don't know how to answer,\" he said.</p><p>\"So I say the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds than what I would call normal.\" </p><p>Much of the rapid growth in the stock market in recent years has been driven by investment in AI.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Bank of England drew a comparison with the dotcom boom (and subsequent bust) of the late 1990s - and warned that the value of AI tech companies \"appear stretched\" with a rising risk of a \"sharp correction\".</p><p>\"The way I look at it is AI is real, AI in total will pay off,\" he said.</p><p>\"Just like cars in total paid off, and TVs in total paid off, but most people involved in them didn't do well.\"</p><p>He added some of the money being invested in AI would \"probably be lost\". </p></div><p></p><h2>Bullets, guns and bombs</h2><p></p><div><p>Global security has been a recent focus for the JP Morgan boss, with his letter to shareholders earlier this year warning the US would run out of missiles in seven days of a South China Sea war.</p><p>Reflecting on how the world could combat risk factors, he pointed to greater military investment. </p><p>\"People talk about stockpiling things like crypto, I always say we should be stockpiling bullets, guns and bombs.</p><p>\"The world's a much more dangerous place, and I'd rather have safety than not.\" </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a1c1/live/8c354910-a4df-11f0-97b2-7b0352757645.jpg.webp\" alt=\"BBC Business editor Simon Jack sits opposite Jamie Dimon as he interviews him near a fireplace surrounded by TV cameras\" /></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jamie Dimon was speaking exclusively to the BBC's Simon Jack</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Another risk factor which many in the global economy believe the US could be facing is pressure placed on the independence of the Federal Reserve, America's central bank.  </p><p>On this, he said he thought central bank independence was important -

    "body": "<div><p>Pubs and bars in England and Wales could see extended opening hours as the government launches a fast-track a review on \"outdated\" licensing rules.</p><p>The plans could make it easier for venues to serve food outside and host more live music, in a bid to \"remove unnecessary barriers\".</p><p>Pub landlords and local communities will be able to have their say in a four-week call for evidence. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the review was about \"cutting red tape\" and \"boosting footfall\" to support the UK's economic growth. </p><p>But critics have warned relaxing rules around alcohol would lead to more antisocial behaviour.</p></div><div><p>Sir Keir said \"pubs and bars are the beating heart of our communities\", and added that the government was \"backing them to thrive\".</p><p>\"When our locals do well, our economy does too,\" he said.</p><p>The call for evidence will focus on nine key recommendations from the government's licensing taskforce, with particular emphasis on streamlining on-trade alcohol licensing for hospitality venues.</p><p>It said it plans to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crme2jr3j2vo\">cut the cost of licensing</a>, extend business rates relief and cut alcohol duty on draught pints.</p><p>A proposal to remove the local newspaper advertising requirement for a manager wanting to set up a premises or alter their licence was among the taskforce's other recommendations.</p><p>It also recommended a permanent increase to the number of temporary event notices - needed to hold a one-off licensable event on unlicensed premises - and simpler rules for trading in outdoor areas. </p><p>Nick Mackenzie, co-chair of the licensing taskforce and chief executive at pub giant Greene King, said updating the licensing system was a \"vital step\" towards reducing the challenges of running a hospitality business.</p><p>\"Pubs are faced with continued rising costs, placing them under enormous pressures which is why the government must continue to back the sector, including critical reforms on business rates which would unlock opportunities for pubs to invest and help drive economic growth,\" he said.</p><p>UK Hospitality, the body which represents pubs and bars in the UK, welcomed the review and said the changes could reduce red tape and costs stifling businesses.</p><p>\"Under the current regime, a single complaint from a single resident is enough often to stop a business from being able to trade. It can result in a review; it can result in a business being closed down,\" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the body, told BBC Radio 4 Today programme.</p><p>\"This is not about trading later, this is not about 24-hour licensing and drinking, this is about making sure that we can respond to consumer demands, and that we can offer freedom and flexibility at a low enough costs.\"</p><p>Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, called for the government to implement the licensing taskforce's recommendations published in June and cease \"endlessly delaying whilst it's literally 'last orders' for many pubs and businesses'. </p></div><div><p>But<b> </b>Richard Piper, the chief executive of the charity Alcohol Change UK told the Guardian the proposed reforms would be a \"charter for chaos\" without support from local authorities and health experts.</p><p>He said permitting vendors to sell alcohol later into the evening would \"inevitably mean more victims of crime, including domestic violence, more antisocial behaviour and disturbance, more police time spent dealing with drink-fuelled incidents and both ambulance and A&E staff having to deal with even more people who have come to harm as a result of alcohol\".</p><p>Pubs in England and Wales do not have universal fixed opening hours under current licensing rules. Instead, local authorities grant licenses with specific operating hours which pubs must follow.   </p><p>The number of pubs in the UK has steadily decreased every year since 2000, according to the British Beer and Pub Association. The association estimates that 378 pubs would close in 2025 across England, Wales and Scotland, amounting to more than 5,600 direct job losses.</p><p>The BBC has heard from landlords and customers on government's licensing review. </p><p>Mark Costello from Leeds, who runs a brewery and tap room, said costs were his main concern. </p><p>\"It doesn't matter how long we're allowed to stay open; it costs a huge amount to stay open so what we need is the customers to fill the place, and they don't have the money to go out like they used to,\" he said. </p><p>\"We need help with business rates, energy and staffing costs,\" he added</p><p>Jay Ashton from Huddersfield, who owns two micropubs said he has to deal with \"a bureaucratic mountain\" when dealing with the councils who he says are \"barriers to growth\". </p><p>Andy in Heathfield, East Sussex, said a pub he lives next to is making \"everyone's lives a misery\" and longer hours and more music will destroy the village. </p><p>David from Cambridge, who has been a pub goer for 55 years, says the increased business rates, national insurance and minimum wage and customers with less disposable income are the real problem facing pubs.</p></div>",

The CMA said part of the reason it had allowed a rise was because interest rates on those loans have risen, making it more expensive for the firms to carry out their plans.</p><p>Troubled firm Thames Water also appealed for higher price rises, but has deferred its case until late October while it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn82pm40915o\">tries to fix a rescue bid</a>.</p><p>Water firms have been told by authorities to fix outdated infrastructure which has been found to be the cause of much river and water pollution. The Environment Agency said serious pollution incidents by water firms <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg5zl75dmm0o\">went up by around 60% in a year.</a></p></div><div><p>Water Minister Emma Hardy said she expected every water company to \"offer proper support to anyone struggling to pay\".</p><p>Citizens Advice's Anne Pardoe said: \"Ramping up water bills, when people up and down the country are already rationing showers and cutting down on laundry, is going to stretch budgets beyond breaking point\".</p><p>She called for the introduction of a national social tariff, in order to help people from low-income households pay for essential bills. Social tariffs are offered by some companies offering services such as broadband and energy, and allow those on benefits access to cheaper bills, although criteria differ from firm to firm.</p></div><div><p>The CMA's findings will lead to an additional increase on average of \"£1 per household, per month\" for customers of the water firms that appealed, said David Henderson, chief executive of Water UK which represents water firms.</p><p>When asked by the BBC's Today programme why the firms themselves could not pay for the needed upgrades, Mr Henderson said shareholders had already invested a lot of their own money, and eight water firms had made a loss in 2024.</p><p>\"They [investors] don't have to put money into this sector, they don't even have to put money into this country,\" he said, adding that many \"haven't made a profit in years. This isn't an industry awash with cash. It is an industry providing vital infrastructure\".</p></div>",

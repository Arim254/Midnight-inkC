    "body": "20 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentBBCVladimir Putin may have a reputation among some as a ruthless autocrat, a master manipulator of the international scene. But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with RussiaHe could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind? And what else could Ukraine, Europe and even China, do differently?Could Europe do more?At the moment, the continent is preparing for a ceasefire. Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".WPA Pool/Getty ImagesZelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday. (Pictured: Starmer with Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk)Mr Giles said: \"The only thing that will unarguably, undeniably stop Russian aggression is the presence of sufficiently strong western forces where Russia wants to attack, and the demonstrated will and resolve that they will be used to defend.\"This strategy would of course come with huge political difficulty - with some voters in western Europe unwilling to risk a confrontation with Russia.Few analysts expect Ukraine to reverse the tide and make actual territorial gains of its own. Having spent several weeks in Ukraine recently, I heard no mention of any Spring offensive, only the need to slow Russia's advance and increase the price it pays in blood and treasure.Some western diplomats claim Russia's generals are lying to the Russian president, pretending the situation on the ground is better than it is - adding to what they see as a deliberate strategy to exaggerate Russian gains, designed to suggest Ukraine is on the back foot and should thus sue for peace.According to Thomas Graham in Foreign Affairs, in this year, Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded.AFP via Getty Images'It is remarkable they [Ukraine] have held off for so long, not least fighting with one hand behind their back,' says Fiona HillFiona Hill, senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, who served on Trump's national security council during his first term, says the biggest thing Putin has in his favour is that many people believe Ukraine is losing. \"Everyone is talking of Ukraine as the loser when it now has the most potent military in Europe,\" she says. \"Just think what they have done to Russia. It is remarkable they have held off for so long not least fighting with one hand behind their back.\"Trade, sanctions and Russia's economyThen there's the lever of sanctions. Certainly, Russia's economy is suffering. Inflation at 8%, interest rates 16%, growth slowed, budget deficits soaring, real incomes plunging, consumer taxes rising. A report for the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform says Russia's war economy is running out of time. \"The Russian economy is substantially less able to finance the war than it was at the beginning of it in 2022,\" the authors say.But so far none of this appears to have changed much Kremlin thinking, not least because businesses have found ways of evading restrictions, such as transporting oil on unregistered ghost ships.Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via ReutersIn this year alone, Russia has seized 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded, according to Thomas Graham in Foreign AffairsTom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at Rusi, said western messaging about sanctions was convoluted and there were too many loopholes. Russia would, he said, work around recent US sanctions on two Russian oil giants, Lukoil and Rosneft, just by re-labelling the exported oil as coming from non-sanctioned companies.Mr Keatinge said if the West really wanted to hurt Russia's war economy, it would embargo all Russian oil and fully implement secondary sanctions on countries that still buy it. \"We need to stop being cute and go full embargo,\" he said. \"We need to take our implementation of sanctions as seriously as the Kremlin takes circumvention.\"In theory, sanctions could also affect Russian public opinion. In October, a survey by the state-run Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) said 56% of respondents said they felt \"very tired\" of the conflict, up from 47% last year. But the consensus among Kremlinologists is that much of the Russian public remains supportive of Putin's strategy. ReutersThe Ukrainian president arrived in Berlin on Sunday for peace talks with Witkoff and Friedrich Merz (Trump and Zelensky pictured on a previous occasion)The European Union could agree to use about €200bn (£176bn) of frozen Russian assets to generate a so-called \"reparation loan\" for Ukraine. The latest European Commission proposal is to raise €90bn (£79bn) over two years.In Kyiv, officials are already banking on getting the cash. But still the EU hesitates. Belgium, where the bulk of the Russian assets are held, has long feared being sued by Russia - and on Friday, the Russian Central Bank announced legal action against Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court.Belgium says it will not agree the loan unless legal and financial risks are shared more explicitly with other EU members. France has concerns, such is its own vast debts, and fears exploiting the frozen assets could undermine the stability of the eurozone.EU leaders will make a further attempt to agree a deal when they meet in Brussels on 18 December for their final summit before Christmas. But diplomats say there is no guarantee of success.There is also disagreement over what the cash should be used for: keeping Ukraine's state solvent now or paying for its reconstruction after the war.Ukraine's conscription questionAs for Ukraine, it could mobilise more of its armed forces.It remains the second-biggest army in Europe (behind Russia), and the most technically advanced - but it is nonetheless struggling to defend an 800-mile frontline. After almost four years of war, many soldiers are exhausted and desertion rates are rising.Getty ImagesUkraine is defending itself against repeated Russian air attacksArmy recruiters are finding it harder to fill gaps as some younger men hide from press gangs or flee the country. But Ukraine could widen its conscription laws. Currently only men aged 25 to 60 must be available to fight. This is a deliberate strategy by Kyiv to manage Ukraine's demographic challenges; a country with a low birth rate and millions living abroad cannot afford to lose what have been dubbed \"the fathers of the future\".This puzzles outsiders. \"I find it incredible that Ukraine has not mobilised its young people,\" one senior UK military figure told me. \"I think Ukraine must be one of the only countries in history facing an existential threat that has not thrown its mad 20-year-olds into the fight.\"Fiona Hill said Ukraine had simply learned the lesson of history and the devastating impact World War One had on 20th Century European empires, which declined after failing to rediscover the population growth that had fuelled their economic rise. \"Ukraine is just thinking of their demographic [future].\"Strikes, diplomacy and TrumpIf Ukraine could import and manufacture more long-range missiles, it could hit Russia harder and deeper.This year it stepped up its air strikes on targets both in occupied territory and the Russian Federation. Earlier this month Ukraine's military commanders told Radio Liberty they had hit more than 50 fuel and military-industrial infrastructure facilities in Russia during the autumn.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, says some Russians experienced fuel shortages earlier this year. \"By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's thirty-eight major refineries at least once.\"Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel.\"But would more deep strikes on Russia make an impact, when both the Kremlin and public opinion in Russia seem indifferent? AFP via Getty ImagesAs well as defending its territory, Ukraine has stepped up air strikes in the Russian federationMick Ryan, former Australian major general and now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says deep strikes are not a magic bullet. \"They are an extraordinarily important military endeavour, but insufficient by themselves to force Putin to the negotiating table or to win the war.\"Dr Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow in military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said more deep strikes would certainly damage Russia's energy and military infrastructure, as well as using up its air defence missiles. But he warned the tactic could be counterproductive. \"It could reinforce the argument the Russian leadership makes that an independent Ukraine poses a massive military threat,\" he said.More from InDepthThere's also - still - a diplomatic route.Some analysts argue that if Putin is offered a way out of the war, he may choose it.The theory goes like this: a deal is agreed that allows both sides to claim victory. Say, a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition. Compromises all round. But the deal would require the US to engage hard with Russia, setting up negotiating teams, using its power to drive through agreement.\"The United States… needs to deploy its formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia,\" Thomas Graham argues. \"One cannot overstate the role the United States – and Trump personally – plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader.\"China's leverageThe wild card is China. President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens to. When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use, the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. Russia's war machine is also hugely dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes.So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue, then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. For now, the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow. So the question is whether President Xi would be willing to apply any leverage off his own bat.ShutterstockPresident Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens toAt the moment China seems happy for the US to be distracted, for transatlantic allies to be divided, and for the rest of the world to view China as a source of stability. But if Russia's invasion escalated, if global markets were disrupted, if the US applied secondary sanctions on China in punishment for its consumption of cheap Russian energy, then the thinking in Beijing might change.For now though, Putin believes he is sitting pretty, with time on his side. The longer this conflict goes on, analysts say, the more Ukrainian morale will fall, the more divided its allies will become, and the more territory Russia will gain in Donetsk. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin said last week.\"Nothing will change his position,\" Fiona Hill told me. \"Unless he exits stage left. Putin is betting right now that he can keep this going for long enough that circumstances play out to his advantage.\"Top picture credit: Reuters BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi was taken to hospital after being beaten when she was arrested last week, her family says.The 53-year-old human rights activist told them in a phone call on Sunday that she was brought to an emergency department twice after being \"attacked by plain clothed agents with severe and repeated baton blows to the head and neck\", according to the Narges Foundation.There was no comment from Iranian authorities, but they have said she was detained for making \"provocative remarks\" at a memorial ceremony in the city of Mashhad on Friday.The Nobel Committee and award-winning film-maker Jafar Panahi are among those calling for her release.Ms Mohammadi, the vice-president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Iran, was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights.She has spent more than 10 years of her life in prison. Since 2021, she has been serving a 13-year sentence on charges of committing \"propaganda activity against the state\" and \"collusion against state security\", which she denied.In December 2024, she was given a temporary release from Tehran's notorious Evin prison on medical grounds.She has continued campaigning while undergoing treatment.On Friday, she gave a speech at a memorial ceremony in Mashhad for Khosrow Alikordi, a human rights activist and lawyer who was found dead earlier this month in what human rights groups described as \"suspicious\" circumstances.According to the Narges Foundation, eyewitnesses cited by Ms Mohammadi's family said that she was attacked by around 15 plainclothes agents at the memorial, and that some were seen pulling her hair and beating her with clubs and batons.On Sunday evening, Ms Mohammadi made a brief phone call to her family and told them that \"the intensity of the blows was so heavy, forceful, and repeated that she was taken to the hospital emergency room twice\", a statement said.\"She emphasised that she does not even know which security authority is currently detaining her, and that no explanation has been given in this regard. Her physical condition at the time of the call was not good, and she appeared unwell,\" it added.The Narges Foundation cited Ms Mohammadi as saying that she was accused of \"co-operating with the Israeli government\" and that they had made a death threat, telling her: \"We will put your mother into mourning.\"The statement said that two other activists detained at the memorial ceremony, Sepideh Gholian and Pouran Nazemi, were also beaten by the plainclothes agents.Mashhad prosecutor Hasan Hematifar told reporters on Saturday that Ms Mohammadi was among 39 people arrested.He said that she and Khosrow Alikordi's brother, Javad, had encouraged those present \"to chant norm-breaking slogans\" and \"disturb the peace\".The Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday that it was deeply concerned by what it called the \"brutal arrest\" of Ms Mohammadi and called on Iranian authorities to \"ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions\".Jafar Panahi, fellow film-maker Mohammad Rasoulof and more than a dozen other activists said in a joint statement that what happened at Alikordi's memorial ceremony \"was a stark reflection of the worrying state of freedom and security, and, consequently, the inefficiency and lack of accountability of the authorities in today's Iran\".",

The complainant then made their complaint to Ofcom.\"Parents and carers would have accessed Diary of a Wimpy Kid on the basis that it was appropriate for their children to view, potentially unaccompanied by an adult (as had the complainant in this case).\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoChristina McSorleyPolitical producer The government is considering a draft definition of anti-Muslim hatred which does not include the term \"Islamophobia\".The BBC has seen the form of words from the Islamophobia/Anti-Muslim hatred working group, which the government has taken to stakeholders for consultation.Free speech campaigners have expressed concerns that protections for \"Islamophobia\" would mean it would not be possible to criticise the religion itself.Members of the working group argue the definition protects individuals while avoiding overreach.A working group was established in February to provide the government with a working definition of anti-Muslim hatred/Islamophobia.They submitted their proposal to the government in October.The definition will be non-statutory, meaning it is not set in law or legally binding,  but will provide a form of words public bodies can adopt.It provides guidance to the government and other bodies on what constitutes unacceptable treatment of Muslims, aiming to help them better understand and quantify prejudice and hate crimes against this group.The draft definition is: \"Anti-Muslim hostility is engaging in or encouraging criminal acts, including acts of violence, vandalism of property, and harassment and intimidation whether physical, verbal, written or electronically communicated, which is directed at Muslims or those perceived to be Muslims because of their religion, ethnicity or appearance.\"It is also the prejudicial stereotyping and racialisation of Muslims, as part of a collective group with set characteristics, to stir up hatred against them, irrespective of their actual opinions, beliefs or actions as individuals.\"It is engaging in prohibited discrimination where the relevant conduct – including the creation or use of practices and biases within institutions - is intended to disadvantage Muslims in public and economic life.\"The working group met last week to consider changes from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.The BBC understands one area of debate is around the use of the word \"racialisation\" in the definition.Baroness Gohir, who sits on the working group, said their submission achieves \"the right balance\" by \"safeguarding individuals while avoiding overreach\".\"The definition also recognises that Muslims are frequently targeted not only for their beliefs but also because of their appearance, race, ethnicity, or other characteristics,\" she said.\"Including the element of racialisation validates these lived experiences.\"The Free Speech Union is concerned that any definition of anti-Muslim hatred could infringe on free speech and possibly introduce a blasphemy law through the back door.Conservative peer Lord Toby Young, the campaign group's director, said: \"The definition is unnecessary because it's already a criminal offence to stir up religious hatred and unlawful for employers or service providers to discriminate against people on the basis of their religion or belief. \"Granting Muslims additional protections not extended to people of other faiths will have the effect of increasing anti-Muslim hostility, not reducing it.\"Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who chairs the working group, is adamant the form of words does not remove the right to free speech.Mr Grieve said: \"The review done by the working group is within a framework that makes it clear that no definition of anti-Muslim hatred should have an adverse impact on freedom of expression under law including the right to criticise Islam and its practices. \"The working group has been mindful of this at all times in the advice it is giving to government.\"A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said they do not comment on leaks.\"With all hate crime on the rise and anti-Muslim hate incidents at a record high, we are tackling hatred and extremism wherever it may occur,\" the spokesperson said.\"We will always defend freedom of speech, this remains at the front of our minds as we carefully consider the recommendations.\"There was a 19% increase in religious hate crimes targeted at Muslims last year, with a spike after the Southport murders and riots that followed last summer, according to Home Office figures. Labour had promised to introduce a new definition of Islamophobia, after the last Conservative government rejected a cross-party proposal in 2019.The All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims had defined Islamophobia as \"rooted in racism\" and \"a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness\".Critics had argued this definition was too vague and could inhibit freedom of speech.The new draft definition being considered by the government differs from this previous proposal, which was adopted by the Labour Party in 2019 when it was in opposition.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThis week's five-day doctor strike in England will go ahead despite a new offer from the government.The British Medical Association said 83% of its members had voted to continue with the walkout in an online poll over the weekend, with a turnout of 65%. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"gutted\" by the result, describing it as \"irresponsible\" given the rising pressure from flu.The union agreed to the snap poll last week after the government came forward with a fresh deal which included increasing speciality training posts and covering out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees.The strike by resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, is due to start at 07:00 on Wednesday.Sir Keir, who was appearing in front of MPs on the Liaison Committee, said: \"It's irresponsible at any time, particularly at the moment.\"It comes on the back of a very substantial pay increase in the last year or so.\"There's a deal that we've put on the table that could have been taken forward, and so I think it's irresponsible action by the BMA, and not for the first time.\"The offer did not include any promises on pay – Health Secretary Wes Streeting has maintained he will not negotiate on that after resident doctors pay has been increased by nearly 30% in the past three years.The BMA argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.Streeting said the pay demands were \"fantasy\".And he added: \"The BMA has chosen Christmas strikes to inflict damage on the NHS at the moment of maximum danger. These strikes are self-indulgent, irresponsible and dangerous.\"He said he hoped resident doctors would still go to work, saying there was a different magnitude of risk striking at this moment.Flu pressuresData shows the number of patients in hospital with flu had risen by more than 50% in a week, topping 2,600 in the first week of December, with officials warning there is still no sign of it peaking yet.Flu came early this winter, and it looks to be a particularly nasty season.The strain that is circulating is H3N2, which tends to cause more severe illness, and it has mutated somewhat with fears people may have less immunity.This will be the 14th strike in the long-running dispute which began in March 2023.Resident doctors, which represent nearly half the medical workforce, will walk out of both emergency and non-urgent care. Senior doctors will be drafted in to provide cover.BMA resident doctor leader Dr Jack Fletcher said the \"resounding response\" should leave the health secretary in no doubt about how badly he has just fumbled his opportunity to end industrial action. \"Tens of thousands of front-line doctors have come together to say 'no' to what is clearly too little, too late,\" he added.He said any solution had to address pay.But he added the union was \"committed to ensuring patient safety\" and would be in close contact with NHS England throughout the strike to address concerns as they arise.Rory Deighton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said: \"It's bitterly disappointing that the BMA has rejected this offer and chosen to continue with hugely disruptive strikes. \"These strikes come at the worst possible time, with rapidly rising flu levels putting huge strain on hospitals.\"If BMA members had instead voted not to continue with this week's strike, that would have then triggered a new survey on the actual deal that the government had put forward last week.Only if they voted in favour of that deal would the dispute have ended.",

He was shot multiple times and has since undergone surgery for his wounds.His father told BBC Arabic: \"Ahmed was driven by his sentiment, conscience and humanity.\"The fruit shop owner and father of two has been hailed as a hero for intervening in the shooting, which killed 15 people and left dozens injured at an event to celebrate Hanukkah on Sunday.Mr Ahmed was meeting a friend for coffee in the area when the attack unfolded, his father said.His son did not hesitate to intervene and \"rushed forward, stopped the gunman, and snatched his weapon\".The family said they felt immense pride in Mr Ahmed, who was now in a stable condition and awaiting further treatment for wounds to his shoulder and hand.Speaking from Syria, where Mr Ahmed was born and raised, his uncle remarked: \"He made us proud - our village, Syria, all Muslims and the entire world.\"Chris Minns/FacebookChris Minns met Mr Ahmed after the attack and said it had been an \"honour\" to thank himNew South Wales Premier Chris Minns shared a picture of himself and Mr Ahmed late on Monday and described him as a \"real-life hero\".\"His incredible bravery no doubt saved countless lives when he disarmed a terrorist at enormous personal risk,\" he wrote on Facebook.He said it had been an honour to spend time with Mr Ahmed and \"to pass on the thanks of people across NSW\".\"There is no doubt that more lives would have been lost if not for Ahmed's selfless courage.\"Meanwhile, a US billionaire donated A$99,999 (US$ 65,000; £49,000) to Mr Ahmed, calling him a \"brave hero\".William Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, made the top donation to a GoFundMe for Mr Ahmed, which had raised more than $1m by late Monday.Mr Ahmed managed to wrest the gun from the attacker in the struggle The footage of Mr Ahmed's intervention was shared widely online.It shows one of the gunmen standing behind a palm tree near a small pedestrian bridge, aiming and shooting his gun towards a target out of sight.Mr Ahmed, who was hiding behind a parked car, is seen leaping out at the attacker and tackling him.He manages to wrest the gun from the attacker, pushes him to the ground and points the gun towards him. The attacker begins to retreat back to the bridge.Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the shooters.The same attacker is later seen on the bridge picking up another weapon and firing again.Another gunman also continues firing from the bridge. It is unclear who or what they are aiming at.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday: \"We have seen Australians today run towards danger in order to help others.\"These Australians are heroes, and their bravery has saved lives.\"Speaking at a White House Christmas reception, US President Donald Trump also praised Mr Ahmed, saying he had \"great respect\" for him. \"It's been a very, very brave person, actually, who went and attacked frontally one of the shooters, and saved a lot of lives,\" he said. Police say that the two shooters involved were a father and son aged 50 and 24. They have been named by local media as Sajid Akram and son Naveed Akram.Sajid Akram died at the scene while his son remains in hospital in critical condition.",

    "body": "7 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, SantiagoReutersSupporters of José Antonio Kast celebrated his victoryChile is perceived by many of its neighbours in the Latin American region as a safer, more stable haven. But inside the country, that perception has unravelled as voters worried about security, immigration and crime chose José Antonio Kast to be their next president.Kast is a hardline conservative who has praised General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former right-wing dictator whose US-backed coup ushered in 17 years of military rule marked by torture, disappearances and censorship.To his critics, Kast's family history, including his German-born father's membership in the Nazi Party and his brother's time as a minister under Pinochet, is unsettling. However, some of Kast's supporters openly defend Pinochet's rule, arguing that Chile was more peaceful then.In a nod to Chile's past and to accusations levelled at other right-wing leaders in the region after they imposed military crackdowns on organised crime, the 59-year-old pledged in his first speech as president-elect that his promise to lead an \"emergency government\" would not mean \"authoritarianism\". Sunday's election makes Chile the latest country in Latin America to decisively swing from the left to the right, following Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama. Peru, Colombia and Brazil face pivotal elections next year.Kast's victory places Chile within a growing bloc of conservative governments likely to align with US President Donald Trump, particularly on migration and security.In some cases, like that of Argentina, inflation and economic crisis drove the shift. In others, it was a backlash against leftist governments mired in corruption or infighting. In Chile, immigration and crime seemed to swing it.Kast promised a border wall and mass deportations of undocumented migrants.At rallies, he counted down the days until the inauguration and warned that those without papers should leave by then if they wanted the chance to ever return.His message resonated in a country which has seen a rapid growth in its foreign-born population. Government figures show that by 2023 there were nearly two million non-nationals living in Chile, a 46% increase from 2018.The government estimates about 336,000 undocumented migrants live in Chile, many from Venezuela. The speed of that change has unsettled many Chileans.\"Chile was not prepared to receive the wave of immigration it did,\" says Jeremías Alonso, a Kast supporter who volunteered to mobilise young voters during the campaign. He rejects critics' accusations that Kast's rhetoric amounts to xenophobia.\"What Kast is saying is that foreigners should come to Chile, let them come to work, but they should enter properly through the door, not through the window,\" he says, arguing that undocumented migrants are a strain on taxpayer-funded public services.He says his working-class neighbourhood has experienced \"the social changes that irregular immigration brings in terms of crime, drug addiction and security\".Jeremías Alonso supported José Antonio Kast in the electionKast has blamed rising crime on immigration, an allegation that resonates politically even as the number of murders has fallen since peaking in 2022, and despite some studies suggesting migrants commit fewer crimes on average.Many voters cite organised crime, drug trafficking, thefts and carjackings as contributing towards their sense of insecurity. Kast's victory message is that migrants will be welcome if they comply with the law, criminals will be locked up and order will return to the streets.He, like Trump, is expected to move quickly to demonstrate an \"iron fist\" approach, deploying the military to the border and probably promoting his crackdown through social media.But in practice, large-scale deportations will be difficult. Venezuela does not accept deportees from Chile and deportations have so far been limited. Kast seems to hope his rhetoric will encourage irregular migrants to leave voluntarily. But this is unlikely to compel hundreds of thousands to pack up.Gabriel, who is from Venezuela, felt hurt by comments diners made about migrantsFor irregular migrants already in Chile, the future feels uncertain.Gabriel Funez, a Venezuelan waiter, moved to Chile four years ago, crossing the land border irregularly to escape his country's \"very, very bad economic situation\".He has since submitted his documents to police and immigration authorities and received a temporary ID so he can pay taxes but has so far had no response to his visa request. His salary is currently being paid into a friend's bank account. \"I'm basically a ghost here,\" he says.While he fears deportation, his bigger concern is a rise in xenophobia, which he says has already increased.\"Kast is expressing what many Chileans want to express. He's validating it,\" he said.He recalls how at the restaurant where he works, he served diners who were discussing how migrants should leave.\"It was uncomfortable. I'm a foreigner, and I'm hearing all those super hurtful words.\"He explains that about 90% percent of the restaurant's staff are migrants. With migrants increasingly key to Chilean businesses, Kast could come up against opposition from those relying on foreign labour for their business. Carlos Alberto Cossio, a Bolivian national who has lived in Chile for 35 years, runs a business making and delivering salteñas, savoury Bolivian pastries. Carlos Alberto Cossio says migrant workers are key to his businessHe says he has often employed workers from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela and insists that \"the migrant workforce is very important\".He explains that migrants are eager to work and less likely to change jobs as they rely on their employer for a contract visa until they are issued with a permanent visa.\"Many companies, especially in fruit harvesting, employ migrant workers who are not necessarily registered,\" he adds. Expelling unregistered workers \"will impact Chile's export economy and make raw materials more expensive,\" he warns.Mr Cossio acknowledges that there has been some friction since large numbers of migrants arrived from Venezuela to escape the economic and political crisis there.\"Many of the customs they have brought haven't been compatible with Chilean customs,\" he says, lamenting how this has damaged the reputation of migrants who want to work and contribute.Mr Kast's party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning some of his proposals, from tougher sentencing to maximum-security prisons, may require compromise and negotiation.But for many voters, the perception of control may matter just as much as delivering results as anxiety over crime, insecurity and migration is sweeping the continent.",

Spain, one of the most visited countries in the world, has a buoyant tourism economy but that has fuelled concerns about unaffordable housing, as high demand from visitors raises the price of housing, pushing local people out of the market.\"There are thousands of families who are living on the edge due to housing, while a few get rich with business models that expel people from their homes,\" said Spain's consumer rights minister Pablo Bustinduy in a statement.But Airbnb said in a statement that it was \"confident that the Ministry of Consumer Affairs' actions are contrary to applicable regulations in Spain\".A spokesperson added that since short-term rental regulations in Spain changed in July, Airbnb was \"closely collaborating with Spain's Ministry of Housing to support the enforcement of the new national registration system\".Like many countries, Spain's government is concerned about how short-term holiday lets can change a neighbourhood, fuelled by a transient population of holiday-goers.The country has been fighting a battle with thousands of Airbnb listings, banning them and clamping down on how many properties the firm can advertise. In May, there were demonstrations against the firm ahead of the busy summer season.Spain's government said 65,122 adverts on Airbnb breached consumer rules, including promotion of properties that were not licensed to be rented, and properties whose licence number did not match with those on official registers.Writing on social network Bluesky, Mr Bustinduy said: \"We'll prove it as many times as necessary: no company, no matter how big or powerful, is above the law. Even less so when it comes to housing.\"Globally, several popular tourist cities place heavy restriction on Airbnb, including Barcelona, New York, Berlin, Paris and even San Francisco, where Airbnb was founded.The tech firm started up in 2007 but became hugely popular around 2014, as tourists looked for cheap accommodation without the tax costs imposed on hotels.Users swelled as anybody could become a \"host\" and make some extra cash from renting out their spare room - though many major cities have since placed limits on these types of rentals, as complaints of noisy house parties and absent hosts became an issue.",

    "body": "Give newborns automatic library cards, authors urge2 hours agoKerena CobbinaAFP via Getty Images(L-R) Richard Osman, Kate Mosse and Sir Philip Pullman are among authors to call for babies to have library membershipA group of leading authors are calling for every newborn baby to be signed up for a library card automatically at birth. Writers including Sir Philip Pullman, Richard Osman and Kate Mosse have backed the proposal by think tank the Cultural Policy Unit (CPU), which says a universal, lifelong membership issued at birth would boost literacy.\"A lot of people still feel that [libraries are] not for them,\" Mosse told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, but said automatically giving out cards could show that \"every single young child that's born is welcome\".The CPU proposal would see membership linked directly to birth registration, so library cards would be waiting for newborns at their local library.At present, parents have to sign their kids up online and bring proof of address or an ID to a library.Award-winning novelist Mosse, known for her 2005 book Labyrinth, said of an automatic library card: \"It just says its something you could do and it puts it in people's minds, and that's why it could be transformational.\"She told Today: \"I take my grandchildren, who are three and six months, to the local library for story time. It helps with isolation, it will make an enormous difference to young parents who maybe don't have a support network near them.\"Mosse added that the proposal \"fits very well with the government's mission of intervention in the early years\".His Dark Materials author Sir Philip said: \"It's a brilliant and optimistic plan, and I hope very much it will come into existence as soon as possible\".Meanwhile Osman, who authors the best-selling Thursday Murder Club series, said: \"How lovely to hear of something intended to broaden the world of our children, rather than to simply speed that world up.\"The CPU's plan would see the creation of a \"National Library Card\" that would give every UK citizen access. Currently, library cards are issued by local authorities.It said the proposal aims to make reading a habit for more children, as well as exposing families to parenting support, and community and cultural experiences at libraries.CPU director Alison Cole said the think tank also wanted the card to be \"integrated\" with services that see young families, so that midwives, health visitors and nursery staff could introduce them to library services.\"If it is part of your welcome pack for your child to our society, then it is much more likely families who haven't necessarily had a library card... will think that's for me too,\" Mosse said.'Books are for babies as well'Louie Stowell, author of the Loki children's series, described the scheme as a \"fantastic idea\". \"It reminds everyone that books are for babies as well as older children - not everyone knows that babies can enjoy and benefit from being read to from birth,\" she told BBC News. \"It also normalises library use and, even if the admin involved in getting a library card isn't vast, it's one more thing to do when you're juggling nappies and sleepless nights.\"But the British Book Awards winner author stressed the scheme would need to be paired with funding for libraries and fully trained librarians. \"There's no point signing babies up for libraries that don't exist,\" she added.The CPU estimates the scheme would cost £14-22m annually, which it says should come from both the Department for Education and Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). A spokesperson for DCMS, when asked about the proposal, said libraries \"can help boost children's speech and language and social development\", as well as \"engender a love of reading from the earliest stages of life onwards\".They added: \"Public libraries are funded and run by local authorities and each local authority is responsible for determining how best to meet the needs of its communities.\"We encourage library services to promote their services to families from the earliest stages of a child's life.\"",

    "body": "Tens of thousands of people gathered across Brazil's main cities on Sunday to protest against a bill that - if passed - would reduce the time former President Jair Bolsonaro will spend in jail.The former president is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup d'etat after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.One of the lawmakers backing the bill told AFP news agency it could lead to Bolsonaro's sentence being shortened to two years and four months in prison.Last week, chaos erupted as conservative lawmakers pushed it through the lower house of Congress. It is expected to go before the Senate later this week.Protesters took to the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Salvador and other cities to  show their rejection of the bill. Close to 19,000 people, among them the Oscar-winning actor Fernanda Torres and 83-year-old singer Caetano Veloso, rallied at Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach to denounce the proposed changes. In São Paulo, around 13,700 took to the streets.It is not the first time anti-Bolsonaro protests have been held in Brazil. Three months ago, tens of thousands of people rallied to denounce calls to officially pardon Bolsonaro. In September, Brazil's Supreme Court found the former president, who governed from January 2019 to December 2022, guilty of proposing a coup to military leaders. The judges also found that he knew of a plot to assassinate Lula.While a military coup did not materialise, his supporters launched a violent assault on government buildings in Brasília in January 2023, after which thousands were detained.Were the bill to pass, the sentences of those jailed for their involvement in the January 2023 attacks could also be cut.Brazil's Chamber of Deputies - where conservatives are in the majority - overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal.However, before it can become law, it still needs to be approved by the Senate and President Lula.While President Lula is likely to veto the bill, such a veto could be overturned by Congress.",

    "body": "6 hours agoYasmin RufoGetty ImagesAt first glance, my emails are polite and warm, after all \"I'm just checking\" in on a deadline but \"no worries either way\". However, a closer look reveals my messages are punctuated by unnecessary apologies, smiley faces, exclamation marks and even kisses.I like to think I'm being friendly and approachable, but according to experts, these linguistic habits may be quietly undermining how seriously I'm taken at work.Careers coach Hannah Salton and etiquette coach William Hanson explain why so many of us write like this and the impact it could be having on how we're perceived, and even promoted at work. Is your punctuation extra?\"Thanks very much!\" I've replied to many an email - my punctuation may be extra but a full stop feels blunt.People use exclamation marks to show \"positivity and enthusiasm,\" says Hannah.Women use them three times more often than men, a recent study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found.She thinks that’s likely down to the idea that \"women are often judged more harshly than men when they are direct and are called bossy and other gendered negative words\". And while a single exclamation mark isn't the problem the cumulative effect can be, warns Hannah. “If it looks fake or like it's covering up insecurity it could impact credibility,” she explains.Would you kiss them in real life?Written communication is notoriously easy to misread, which is why many of us insert an emoji as a picture of our warmth or humour.But etiquette coach William Hanson warns this can backfire. \"One emoji can mean different things to different people or something entirely unintended,\" he says.\"It would be better if people used words and a good command of English,\" he advises.Emojis can have an \"infantile connotation\" which could lead to people perceiving you as younger, less senior, capable or responsible, he says.\"I would not put an emoji in an email,\" he says. \"You can be friendly in your writing and remain professional at the same time.\" And when it comes to signing off with a kiss, he says: \"I would never put a kiss on the end of an email unless I would kiss them on the cheek in real life.\" Softening language can dilute authority\"Just checking that you're following me and this all makes sense?\"Emails containing reassurance checkers can be self-deprecating, Hannah says, adding that over time, that tone can subtly shape how someone is perceived.\"As a manager, it's a difficult balance of being liked and respected and if you're not direct, there's a risk of creating an impression of being less capable,\" she says.\"There are definitely times where communicating in an overly apologetic or overly measured way can make you come across as less impactful.\" \"A lot of it is unconscious,\" Hannah says. \"No one reads an email and thinks 'oh, they don't back themselves', it's more subtle than that.\"But if you're consistently communicating in a people-pleasing way, that can build up an impression of someone who doesn't back themselves, or who is potentially less competent.\"What to cut out of your emailsHere are some of the things you might want to consider losing to appear more professional, our experts suggest:Qualifying words such as \"just\" (\"just checking\", \"just wondering\")Pre-emptive apologies like \"sorry to bother you\" or \"I'm sure you're really busy but…\"Reassurance checkers such as \"does that make sense?\", \"hope that's ok\" or \"no worries either way\"Exclamation marksEmojisKisses or overly warm sign-offsHannah and William stress it's not about stripping all warmth or personality from professional communication. \"Personal style is important,\" Hannah says. \"Showcasing personality at work is not a bad thing. You don't want to feel like you have to filter everything you write and remove any personality from it.\"But at the same time you shouldn't use certain words and symbols \"as a tool to be liked\". A practical way to spot and reduce these habits without losing personality is to pay attention to the emails you receive and notice how different styles make you feel - what sounds clear, confident or reassuring, and what feels excessive, she says.Salton says AI tools can also be useful for reviewing drafts and removing excess filler or qualifier words.",

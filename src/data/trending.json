    "body": "47 minutes agoHazel ShearingEducation correspondentGetty ImagesNearly half a million under-16s in England use taxis, buses and other transport funded by their local authorities to get to school, according to government estimates.The new data comes amid warnings from councils about the growing cost of providing transport for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). A head teachers' union said the transport played a \"crucial\" role in getting many children to school, but councils were having to make cutbacks.The data suggests that 6% of all pupils in England receive funded transport, and that 40% of those pupils aged under 16 (180,000) have Send.Local authorities spent £1.5bn on transport for under-16s with Send in the 2023-24 financial year, about two-and-a-half times what it was in 2015-16.The new data from the Department for Education (DfE) - which is the first of its kind - is based on voluntary submissions from three quarters of local authorities in February and March.It suggests that, across England:470,000 pupils under the age of 16 (6% of the total) use home to school transport 50,000 pupils over 16 also use funded transport9% of under-16s who receive funded transport because of Send travel alone in single-occupancy vehiclesLocal authorities in England are required by law to arrange funded transport for children who live a certain distance from school, who cannot walk because of Send or mobility problems, or who cannot walk due to safety reasons.  The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, said the pressure had ramped up over the past three years. \"Continuing to fulfil the current statutory responsibilities for home to school transport is becoming increasingly financially unsustainable, posing a real threat of bankruptcy for some, and necessitating cuts to other vital aspects of children's services provision in many more,\" it said in a report this summer.'Equality of opportunity is really important'Mum Ailith says she may need to drive two hours each way to get her daughter Talia to school after she turns 16Ailith Harley-Roberts, a Send parent and campaigner, is concerned that her 15-year-old daughter Talia's travel funding to and from school will stop at 16.This will be a \"massive issue\" for the family's income, Ailith says, if she and her husband have to drive several hours a day to drop Talia off instead.Their council, Leeds City Council, announced earlier this year that Send students aged over 16 will no longer be provided with council-funded school transport in order to save the local authority £800,000.Ailith is campaigning against the changes.\"I want her to be in a place of education, which is her right, that best meets her needs,\" she says. \"I don't want to put her somewhere that 'will do', just because of the issues with transport.\"Many children with Send need specialist provision, and cannot go to a local mainstream school, she says.\"I think it's really important to remember that people have a right to their education,\" Ailith says.\"That equality of opportunity is still really important.\"Rob Williams, senior policy advisor at school leaders' union the NAHT, said funded transport \"plays a crucial role\" in helping many children \"attend school regularly and develop their independence\".\"However, a growing number of councils are reducing transport provision due to increasing budgetary pressures, and when children simply cannot get to school this threatens to deepen existing attainment gaps and place even more pressure on already stretched parents,\" he added.Ministers have faced calls not to cut education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for children and young people with Send.Last month, the education committee recommended that the government keep them.The National Audit Office has previously said the Send system in England is \"broken\", not financially sustainable and failing to deliver better outcomes for children and young people.Cllr Bill Revans, Send spokesperson for the County Councils Network, said the current system \"does not work for young people, families and councils alike\".The DfE announced last week that it was delaying reforms to the Send system and other policy proposals for schools in England until next year.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said there would be a \"further period of co-creation, testing our proposals with the people who matter most in this reform\".Cllr Revans said that delay was \"massively disappointing\", but that it was vital the government used the time to \"set out genuine root and branch reform to the system\".School Standards Minister Georgia Gould said the schools white paper would \"ensure more children can have their needs met in their local school\".She said work had already begun to improve the system, and added: \"My message to families is that it won't stop here. We're absolutely determined to deliver a better system that supports your children at every stage.\"Over the next few months, I'll be meeting with more parents across the country to make sure your experiences are at the very heart of our reforms.\"Additional reporting by Wesley Stephenson and Hayley Clarke.",

    "body": "16 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology Correspondent, San FranciscoOpenAI has released new estimates of the number of ChatGPT users who exhibit possible signs of mental health emergencies, including mania, psychosis or suicidal thoughts.The company said that around 0.07% of ChatGPT users active in a given week exhibited such signs, adding that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recognizes and responds to these sensitive conversations.While OpenAI maintains these cases are \"extremely rare,\" critics said even a small percentage may amount to hundreds of thousands of people, as ChatGPT recently reached 800 million weekly active users, per boss Sam Altman.As scrutiny mounts, the company said it built a network of experts around the world to advise it.Those experts include more than 170 psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians who have practiced in 60 countries, the company said.They have devised a series of responses in ChatGPT to encourage users to seek help in the real world, according to OpenAI.But the glimpse at the company's data raised eyebrows among some mental health professionals.\"Even though 0.07% sounds like a small percentage, at a population level with hundreds of millions of users, that actually can be quite a few people,\" said Dr. Jason Nagata, a professor who studies technology use among young adults at the University of California, San Francisco.\"AI can broaden access to mental health support, and in some ways support mental health, but we have to be aware of the limitations,\" Dr. Nagata added.The company also estimates 0.15% of ChatGPT users have conversations that include \"explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.\"OpenAI said recent updates to its chatbot are designed to \"respond safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\" and note \"indirect signals of potential self-harm or suicide risk.\"ChatGPT has also been trained to reroute sensitive conversations \"originating from other models to safer models\" by opening in a new window.In response to questions by the BBC on criticism about the numbers of people potentially affected, OpenAI said that this small percentage of users amounts to a meaningful amount of people and noted they are taking changes seriously. The changes come as OpenAI faces mounting legal scrutiny over the way ChatGPT interacts with users.In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple sued the company over the death of their teenage son alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life in April.The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.In a separate case, the suspect in a murder-suicide that took place in August in Greenwich, Connecticut posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fuelled the alleged perpetrator's delusions.More users struggle with AI psychosis as \"chatbots create the illusion of reality,\" said Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law & Innovation Institute at the University of California Law. \"It is a powerful illusion.\"She said OpenAI deserved credit for \"sharing statistics and for efforts to improve the problem\" but added: \"the company can put all kinds of warnings on the screen but a person who is mentally at risk may not be able to heed those warnings.\" ",

    "body": "15 hours agoCharlotte GallagherCulture reporterFive: We didn't know if we could still sing and danceThere weren't many boybands bigger than Five in the late 1990s. But at the height of their popularity they dramatically called it a day in 2001, as the stress and pressures of fame and an unrelenting schedule took a toll on all of them. Now, decades later - and to the delight of Millennials - Scott, Ritchie, J, Sean and Abz are back. \"It was too much too fast. Way too fast,\" Abz tells me, while Ritchie explains it was \"like being strapped to a rocket\". \"I think I was just in survival mode for five years, because I can't remember a thing,\" Sean adds, who was just 15 when the band was formed. They have invited me into the rehearsal studio ahead of their upcoming tour, 25 years after they were last on the road together. And it's clear they're much more comfortable this time around, with J saying they feel \"spectacularly fortunate\" to have a second chance. GettyThe boys at the height of their 1990s fame The group sold more than 20 million records in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with tracks such as Keep on Movin' and Everybody Get Up.But reuniting after more than 20 years doesn't come without risk. Oasis may have sold out a stadium tour in seconds, but others haven't been as fortunate. Scott says all five of them didn't sleep the night before their reunion was announced.\"I phoned my wife, Kerry, in the middle of the night and asked: 'What if no one cares? What if we think it's going to be this big thing and everyone goes, so what?'\"'Could we still perform together?'But fortunately, the group's fans did care, and the band's arena tour of the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand is almost sold out. \"We knew we'd done well but I don't think we realised how well our younger selves had done. And how much we'd affected some peoples lives and how much they'd loved us,\" Ritchie says.Another thing the band were unsure about was the prospect of singing and dancing together again.Sean explains: \"We sold a tour without even knowing [we could do it]. We believed it but we had to get into rehearsals to actually find out, but we can confirm it's still there!\"GettyFive at the Brit Awards 2025The band are now all in their 40s but had barely left school when they formed. It was clearly an overwhelming time. Ritchie tells me: \"We got into it very young and we thought we'd won the lottery and all our dreams were coming true. In many ways, they did, but in some ways it turned into a nightmare psychologically, [there were] a lot of things we weren't expecting.\"We'd wake up on a tour bus and think, not what country are we in, but what continent are we in?\"J agrees: \"There are loads of blank spots in our memories, and we've spoken about it and come to the conclusion that it was all so fast, and we were in flight or fight mode for the whole thing. It was like you were being chased by something.\"So after all that time apart, I want to know who made the first move about the prospect of reuniting. Scott says that not even being in the same room with his four former bandmates for over 20 years had been playing on his mind. \"I phoned Abz and I hadn't spoken to him for 10 years, and one of the first things he said to me was 'It's so nice to hear your voice'. So we just got together - it wasn't about a tour, it was about being friends again.\"No one outside this bubble knows what we went through,\" he adds.

Ritchie says he had \"performer insecurity\" and feared the crowd wouldn't know who they were, \"but it went off\". Sean adds that Robbie \"knew everything we've been through\", adding the six of them sat for two hours chatting.On the emotional trauma Five went through, Scott says Robbie told them it was like \"carrying a big bag of rocks and you need to empty it day by day.\"For J, the whole experience of being back in the band is \"the antithesis of what it was before.\"\"The people we've got around us, how we're being managed. how we're being looked after, which is the most important thing. We were last time but people were kind of learning on the job.\"They've reconciled and reunited now but would Five go back in time and do it all again? Abz says he would \"but differently\", while Ritchie laughs: \"With this head, I'd love to do it, because I'd be checking the accounts a lot more!\"Five: Still Movin' is on the BBC iPlayer from Tuesday 28 October. Five begin their tour on Wednesday 29 October in Cardiff. ",

    "body": "Most countries fail to submit new climate pledges ahead of summit5 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentGetty ImagesOnly 64 countries have submitted new plans to cut carbon, the UN says, despite all being required to do so ahead of next month's COP30 summit.Added together these national pledges would fail to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C, a key threshold to very dangerous levels of climate change.While the UN review does show progress in curbing carbon emissions over the next decade, the projected fall is not enough to stop temperatures surging past this global target.The report underlines the scale of the task facing world leaders who head to Belém in northern Brazil next week for the COP30 climate gathering.Ten years after the Paris climate pact was agreed in 2015, the efforts of countries to restrict the rise in global temperatures are under renewed scrutiny.Every signatory agreed to submit a new carbon-cutting plan every five years, which would cover the next decade.But only 64 countries managed to put a new pledge in place this year, despite many extensions of the deadline. These represent around 30% of global emissions.In addition, the UN's review includes statements from China and the EU on their future plans made at Climate Week in New York in September.Taken together, the efforts mean that global emissions of carbon dioxide should fall by around 10% by 2035.However, scientists say that such a drop is nowhere near enough to keep the rise in temperatures under 1.5C.To keep that goal alive will require steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, up to 57% by 2035, according to the UN last year.\"This report shows that we are going in the right direction but too slowly,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, often referred to as a key architect of the Paris Agreement.\"It is essential to acknowledge the missing national pledges and confront the persistent gap between ambition and actual implementation.\"The 1.5C limit, agreed at Paris, has long been seen as the threshold of very dangerous warming. In 2018, scientists outlined the massive benefits to the world of keeping the rise under 1.5C as compared to allowing them to rise to 2C. Passing 1.5C include more frequent and intense heatwaves and storms, increased damage to coral reefs and growing threats to human health and livelihoods, UN scientists have said.However, that limit was breached in 2024 for a whole year for the first time. UN leaders are increasingly accepting the fact that the threshold will be breached permanently by the early 2030s at current rates.Getty ImagesBrazil's President Lula visits Belém ahead of COP30 in November\"One thing is already clear: we will not be able to contain the global warming below 1.5C in the next few years,\" UN secretary general António Guterres told delegates at a meeting of the World Meteorological Organisation last week.\"Overshooting is now inevitable. Which means that we're going to have a period, bigger or smaller, with higher or lower intensity, above 1.5C in the years to come.\"Despite this, the UN is keen to stress that there are some significant green shoots in the new report that provide hope.Many more countries are expected to lodge plans as their leaders gather for COP30 in Belém in Brazil.Large carbon producers such as India and Indonesia haven't yet unveiled their carbon plans. They will likely do so during COP30 and these may have a significant impact on the overall projections for 2035.Some countries are also likely to cut faster and deeper than they've promised, say experts.\"It's actually completely reasonable to look at China,\" said Todd Stern, former US Special Envoy for climate change.\"They'll put down a certain number, which is not great, and then they will overachieve it, and China does that a lot.\"The UN says they are confident that emissions globally will likely peak and start to decline in the next few years, for the first time since the industrial revolution in the 19th century.They say the plans in place show clear stepping stones to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Net zero means balancing the amount of planet-warming \"greenhouse\" gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere.One important factor is that the cuts assessed by the UN include the planned US pledge submitted under President Biden.While President Donald Trump has said he will pull out of the Paris agreement, that process is not completed yet, so the UN are keeping the US plans in their calculations even if these won't happen as planned.",

    "body": "Just nowJack FenwickPolitical correspondentPA MediaWhere to house asylum seekers has become one of the fiercest topics of political debate since last year's general election.Ministers are considering housing 900 men in the Cameron Barracks in Inverness and Crowborough army training camp in East Sussex, as they seek to expand the use of military sites as an alternative to hotels. Small boat crossings have reached near-record levels and MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee said the Home Office had squandered billions of pounds of taxpayers' money on asylum accommodation.The estimated cost of the government's 10-year asylum accommodation contracts has more than tripled, from £4.5bn to £15.3bn.Ministers inside the Home Office believe that ultimately this issue can only be solved by increasing removals of failed asylum seekers and deterring people from arriving on small boats in the first place.But while they attempt to implement policies to achieve those aims, the Home Office still has to find somewhere for the tens of thousands of people seeking asylum to stay.ArrivalWhen people arrive in the UK by crossing the Channel on small boats, they are generally sent to a processing centre at Manston in Kent.The site is located on the former RAF Manston base and was opened by the Home Office in February 2022 as a response to the increasing number of arrivals.Migrants are supposed to be held there for 24 hours, while officials carry out security and identity checks, but overcrowding has sometimes led to people being forced to stay on the site for weeks.In late 2022, thousands of migrants were placed in tents at Manston, leading to overcrowding and disease, including diphtheria.A Home Office inquiry is currently taking place into the conditions at Manston.The department is also seeking planning approval to improve the site and use it for processing asylum seekers into the 2030s.Initial accommodationAfter leaving Manston, asylum seekers are then sent to initial accommodation provided by the Home Office, while officials decide whether they are eligible for further support.These are supposed to be centres managed by specialist migrant help staff, but many asylum seekers are instead sent to hotels or hostels straight away.There are 1,750 places available in initial accommodation and the latest government data showed 1,665 of those places were occupied in June.Most asylum seekers will then be sent to longer-term accommodation, where they will stay while their asylum claim is being processed.Flats and HMOsUnder the contracts signed by the Home Office, asylum seekers are supposed to be housed in so-called dispersal accommodation.These are self-catered properties within communities and are usually local flats or houses in multiple occupation (HMOs), a type of rented accommodation where at least three individuals share the use of a bathroom and kitchen.The average cost of housing an asylum seeker in dispersal accommodation is £23.25 a night, making it by far the cheapest option.In 2019, the government signed 10-year contracts with three companies – Serco, Mears and Clearsprings – and tasked them with finding properties that can be used for dispersal accommodation.But since the number of small boat crossings began to rise significantly in 2022, there's been a shortage of this type of accommodation.Finding more of these properties became a big priority for the former Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and the latest government data shows that 66,234 people were in dispersal accommodation in June – around two-thirds of the total number of asylum seekers being housed.But the three companies tasked with finding these properties can make bigger profits from other types of accommodation – and the contracts drawn up by the Home Office don't include any penalties for the companies when they fail to hit their targets.Dispersal accommodation can impact local housing markets by effectively taking flats or HMOs out of general supply, something the Home Office acknowledges would cause frustrations within communities.Some concerns have been raised that protests targeting this type of accommodation could be difficult to police.HotelsHotels were only ever meant to be used as a stop-gap option when there was a temporary shortage of other accommodation.But increasing numbers of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats has meant hotels have become a regular, expensive and highly controversial feature of the UK's asylum accommodation system.They have led to soaring costs for the taxpayer and large profits for the three companies providing the accommodation.The average cost of housing an asylum seeker in a hotel is £144.98 a night, more than six times the price of dispersal accommodation.One of the reasons hotels are so much more expensive than other accommodation is because the asylum seekers being housed there are also given food.Under the contracts drawn up by the Home Office, providers are still paid even if the rooms are vacant.Asylum hotel use peaked under the Conservatives in September 2023 when 56,042 people were being housed.Latest government statistics show there were 32,059 asylum seekers being housed in hotels at the end of June – much lower than the peak, but 8% higher than when Labour came to power.The Home Office removed the need to consult local authorities about hotel use in 2020 and they've become lightning rods for protests.Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029, but achieving that target will be a tough ask.Large sitesBoth Conservative and Labour governments have experimented with using larger sites to house asylum seekers.Hundreds of asylum seekers could be placed in disused military sites, as part of efforts to achieve the prime minister's pledge to end hotel use.Ministers hope to move asylum seekers into sites in Inverness and East Sussex by the end of next month, with discussions between the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence ongoing about other potential locations.The Home Affairs Select Committee has said that large sites such as these will not enable the government to drive down costs of asylum accommodation.The idea is also likely to be highly controversial in the local communities where the sites are chosen, but the Home Office hopes that military sites could act as a deterrent to people thinking of crossing the Channel.Disused military land has in the past been earmarked for housebuilding, but plans to build on these sites have repeatedly gone awry.The government has indicated that other disused sites such as empty tower blocks, student accommodation and industrial sites could also be used to house asylum seekers.What happens next?The government's contracts with Serco, Mears and Clearsprings run until 2029, but have break clauses which the government could trigger in March next year.Home Office ministers wanted to trigger break clauses in the previous set of contracts, but the department hadn't left itself enough time to plan for an alternative accommodation system.The housing department has been working with local councils to explore what that alternative system could look like.But some within the Home Office do not believe that an alternative would be ready by March and as recently as May, it was understood that there was no plan to trigger the break clauses next year.The Home Office needs to save £1bn from the cost of asylum accommodation by 2029, otherwise it may have to find cuts in other areas of its budget.",

    "body": "41 minutes agoMatt Taylor and Dan Hunt,LeicesterJulia WandeltJulia Wandelt has given her version of events about a face-to-face encounter with the McCanns in December 2024A woman accused of stalking the parents of Madeleine McCann has said there were tears from her and the missing girl's mother during a face-to-face encounter outside the family home.Julia Wandelt - who a court heard has claimed she is Madeleine - has been giving evidence at the trial, in which she and co-defendant Karen Spragg are charged with stalking Kate and Gerry McCann.The 24-year-old said she and Mrs Spragg approached Mrs McCann outside her home on 7 December 2024 to present her with a DNA report in a bid to prove she is Madeleine.\"She started crying straight away, I got too upset,\" Miss Wandelt said. The court heard Mr McCann then returned home and said: \"Julia, I think you need help.\"Leicester Crown Court has been told that a DNA test was taken from Miss Wandelt when she was arrested at Bristol Airport in February this year, which \"conclusively proved\" she is not the missing child.Madeleine's disappearance at the age of three in Portugal in 2007 is one of the most widely reported missing child cases and remains unsolved.On Tuesday, the court heard Miss Wandelt stayed with Mrs Spragg in Cardiff before they drove to the McCanns home in Rothley, Leicestershire.Upon arrival, Miss Wandelt said: \"I said 'Kate'. She turned around, she started crying, I started crying.\"She started crying straight away, I got too upset. I planned to say other things, I did not say any of them.\"I said 'I would like to speak with you and can we speak for like two minutes?' She said no. She said she will call the police. I said the police don't care. I think I said if she wants to call the police she can - maybe I said it.\"Miss Wandelt told the court her 61-year-old co-defendant was behind her and said \"do you want to find your daughter?\"In response, Mrs McCann said: \"I do, but I don't need this.\"The court heard Mrs McCann then went inside.PA MediaThe court heard Karen Spragg picked Miss Wandelt up from the airport when she visited the UK in December 2024Miss Wandelt said she did not attempt to touch Mrs McCann \"at all\" and added: \"A lot of people told me to take her hair, but I would never do this.\"The jury heard Mr McCann then arrived home, and Miss Wandelt attempted to pass him a DNA report, which the court heard was put together by US DNA expert Dr Monte Miller.Mr McCann told the defendant \"Julia, I think you need help\", before going inside the house.She told the court she did not have the finances to pay for a private test, so sent out emails hoping someone would reply to her, and received pro-bono help from Dr Miller.The court heard Dr Miller sent a report which Miss Wandelt said: \"From my understanding, he said the DNA matches very well\", and showed \"a close relationship\".The court has previously heard from Det Ch Insp Mark Cramwell, of Operation Grange - the name of the Metropolitan Police's investigation into Madeleine's disappearance - who said DNA samples of Miss Wandelt were taken on her arrest.\"It conclusively proved that Julia Wandelt is not Madeleine McCann,\" he said.Joe Giddens - WPA Pool/Getty ImagesThe court has heard Kate and Gerry McCann both went inside their home after being \"accosted\" by the defendants The court also heard extracts from several messages and voicemails left by Miss Wandelt to Mrs McCann, including \"numerous contacts\" on 13 April 2024.Jurors were told voice calls and texts were \"happening in a very close time to each other\".Miss Wandelt said \"me possibly being Madeleine was bigger\" than the potential upset that could be caused to the family.One correspondence during that time period heard Miss Wandelt say: \"I just need one call and that is all.\"The court heard another message from Miss Wandelt, describing a memory she had from just before Madeleine McCann disappeared.Tom Price KC, defending, said: \"You seem to be setting out a memory of the abduction of Madeleine that took place in Portugal.\"Miss Wandelt said that was a memory that came to her in pieces, but she did not intend to cause any distress to Madeleine's mother when she sent it.Miss Wandelt's messages said she \"really believed\" she was Madeleine, the court heard.One message from her to Mrs McCann said: \"Please don't think Madeleine is dead. This is a chance. It will cost you nothing to talk to me.\"PA MediaThe disappearance of Madeleine McCann has never been solvedThe court also heard Fia Johansson, an American woman, contacted Miss Wandelt in February 2023 after she went public with her story that she believed she was Madeleine.Jurors heard the pair had a WhatsApp phone call before they both flew out to Los Angeles in the US.Miss Wandelt said: \"She organised interviews, not sure actually how or why. I did not see the point, for example, going on Dr Phil. It was all her idea.\"The defendant told the jury she did not get paid to appear on the Dr Phil show, hosted by Phil McGraw - one of the top chat show hosts in the US - in March 2023.The trial continues.Additional reporting by PA MediaMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Australia has started to deport foreign detainees to Nauru, marking the start of a controversial deal with the tiny Pacific island nation.In a statement on Tuesday, Australian Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke confirmed that \"the first transfer had occurred\" last Friday, although how many people were deported is unknown.The deal was struck after Australia's top court ruled that it could not indefinitely detain about 358 people, the bulk of whom have been convicted of crimes, forcing their release into the community.Human rights groups have criticised the deal, which is expected to cost A$2.5bn (£1.64bn; $1.23bn).The Australian government has repeatedly refused to release details of the agreement for the so-called NZYQ cohort, and refugee advocates says it goes against the country's human rights obligations.Laura John, from the Human Rights Law Centre told SBS News the plans have been \"shrouded in secrecy from the outset\". \"We do not know if the person who has been exiled has left family behind in Australia, whether they need medical care that is unavailable in Nauru, or even if they still had visa appeal options in Australia.\"The NZYQ cohort refers to a group of detainees who were released into the Australian community after a landmark High Court decision in 2023 found that the government's power to hold them indefinitely in immigration detention was unlawful.Many of them had been convicted of serious crimes including assault, drug smuggling and murder, leading to their Australian visas being cancelled.The Australian government found itself in a difficult situation - unable to send the former-detainees back to their home countries for fear of persecution or because their government wouldn't accept them - but also facing severe backlash from the public for their release into the community.Last year, the government, under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, made changes to Migration Act, bolstering its powers to deport non-citizens, in a move critics described as \"brutal\".It included paying third-countries to take Australia's deportees.Australia turned to Nauru, and under the agreement which was finalised earlier this year, the deportees are given a 30-year visa that allows them to work on the island and mix freely with its 12,500 inhabitants.The first transfer triggers an upfront payment of A$408m to resettle the group in Nauru.Aside from these details, little is known about the agreement.\"People are secretly being sent to Nauru, with key aspects of the deal still kept from the Australian public\", immigration spokesperson for the Greens party, David Shoebridge, told Australian media.Criticising the lack of transparency in the plan and \"contemptuous silence\" from Minister Tony Burke, Shoebridge also expressed concern that once the deportees arrive in Nauru, they could then be sent back to their home countries.\"No matter who you are or where you were born, governments should not be able to disappear you, send you off against your will to a country that you have zero connection to,\" he said.Burke has defended the arrangement, telling the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he has inspected the accommodation and health facilities on Nauru and \"the standard there is good\".\"When somebody has come and treated Australians in a way that shows an appalling character, their visas do get cancelled and when their visas are cancelled, they should leave,\" Burke has previously said.This deal is separate to the arrangement for Nauru to run Australia's offshore immigration processing regime. That system was scaled back following international condemnation on how the detainees were treated and housed.",

    "body": "39 minutes agoEmma Saunders,Culture reporter and Paul Glynn,Culture reporterPrunella Scales's memorable moments in Fawlty TowersFawlty Towers actress Prunella Scales has died aged 93, her family have confirmed.Scales was best known for playing hotel manager Sybil Fawlty, the long-suffering and domineering wife of Basil - played by John Cleese - in the classic British sitcom.The actress died \"peacefully at home in London yesterday\", her sons Samuel and Joseph said.They added that she was watching Fawlty Towers the day before she died. Cleese paid tribute, describing Scales as \"a really wonderful comic actress\". He said: \"Scene after scene she was absolutely perfect.\"The actress had been diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2013.\"Our darling mother Prunella Scales died peacefully at home in London yesterday. She was 93,\" her sons told the PA News agency. \"Although dementia forced her retirement from a remarkable acting career of nearly 70 years, she continued to live at home.\"Her husband, fellow actor Timothy West, died in November last year.She is survived by two sons and one stepdaughter, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.The statement added: \"We would like to thank all those who gave Pru such wonderful care at the end of her life: her last days were comfortable, contented and surrounded by love.\"'Wonderful comic actress'BBC ImagesCleese said in a statement: \"How very sad. Pru was a really wonderful comic actress. I've recently been watching a number of clips of Fawlty Towers whilst researching a book. Scene after scene she was absolutely perfect.\"He added: \"She was a very sweet lady, who spent a lot of her life apologising. I used to tease her about it. I was very, very fond of her.\"Broadcaster Gyles Brandreth remembered her as \"a funny, intelligent, interesting, gifted human being\".Jon Petrie, director of comedy at the BBC, offered: \"She was a national treasure whose brilliance as Sybil Fawlty lit up screens and still makes us laugh today.\"An official spokesman for prime minister Sir Keir Starmer noted how Scales was \"part of a golden era of British comedy\" and someone who \"gave many people a huge amount of enjoyment\".Scales also went on to receive a Bafta nomination for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in Alan Bennett's 1991 televised play, A Question of Attribution. But she will forever be most closely identified with the domineering and long-suffering comedy creation Sybil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, best defined by one bark of \"Basil\".Getty ImagesTimothy West and Prunella Scales proved a hit in Great Canal Journeys on Channel 4This year marked 50 years since the classic comedy Fawlty Towers first appeared on our screens.In the sitcom, the aspirational and stylish Sybil - with her permed hair and sharp skirt suits - ruled the roost over her bumbling and often hapless husband Basil as they both attempted to run a Torquay hotel.Often, when he was on the verge of a crisis, she would arrive and step in to either clear up his mess or benefit from his misfortune.He referred to her by a number of negative nicknames including \"the dragon\" and \"my little piranha fish\", but only behind her back as he was terrified of her.In one episode, titled The Psychiatrist, Basil finally lost his patience and snapped at his wife, declaring: \"Shut up, I'm fed up.\"\"Oh, you've done it now,\" responded Sybil.Speaking of her character, Scales once said: \"I feel very grateful for Sybil. Fawlty Towers was very hard to make, but it was very stimulating.\"But in an interview with the Independent last year, she said she \"loves it when people don't\" ask her about the show as she found the topic \"boring\".Getty ImagesScales met Queen Camilla during a garden party in Rye in May last yearLater in life, she enjoyed an unlikely hit with Channel 4's Great Canal Journeys, travelling waterways in the UK and elsewhere with her husband.\"We didn't start out thinking it was going to be an especially exciting performance for people to watch,\" admitted West in an interview with the BBC's Colin Paterson in 2023.But for 10 series - from 2014–2019 - the couple made canals captivating. \"We were good at it,\" he smiled.West noted how his wife's dementia would not break their 60-year love story.Watch: Prunella Scales during 2023 interview with the BBCFollowing the annoncement of her death on Tuesday, Corinne Mills, interim chief executive officer for Alzheimer's Society, praised the actress for raising awareness.She said: \"We are deeply saddened by the news that Prunella Scales - a true British icon - has died.\"Prunella was an inspiration not just for her achievements on screen, but because she spoke so openly about living with dementia, shining an important light on the UK's biggest killer.\"She added: \"We are profoundly grateful for the awareness she helped to raise and send our heartfelt condolences to her loved ones.\"West EndScales' big acting break came in the early 1960s sitcom Marriage Lines, and she also featured in various BBC Radio 4 sitcoms.She appeared in the West End in productions like Long Day's Journey Into Night in 1991, again alongside her husband, as well as the TV and radio comedy After Henry.Her other credits include the 1987 film The Lonely Passion Of Judith Hearne and the 1988 comedy Consuming Passions, opposite Dame Vanessa Redgrave and Sir Jonathan Pryce.",

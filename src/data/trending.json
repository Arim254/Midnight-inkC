    "body": "9 minutes agoReutersFarmers protested against the changes again at last month's Budget Government proposals to tax inherited farmland have been watered down, with the planned threshold increasing from £1m to £2.5m.The climbdown follows months of protests by farmers and concern from some Labour backbenchers.At last year's Budget, ministers said they would start imposing a 20% tax on inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m from April 2026.Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said: \"We have listened closely to farmers across the country and we are making changes today to protect more ordinary family farms.\"\"It's only right that larger estates contribute more, while we back the farms and trading businesses that are the backbone of Britain's rural communities.\"Head of the National Farmers' Union Tom Bradshaw welcomed the change, telling BBC Radio 5 Live it \"takes out many family farms from the eye of pernicious storm\".Gavin Lane, President of the Country Land and Business Association, said: \"The government deserves credit for recognising the flaws in the original policy and changing course.\"However, this announcement only limits the damage - it doesn't eradicate it entirely. \"Many family businesses will own enough expensive machinery and land to be valued above the threshold, yet still operate on such narrow profit margins that this tax burden remains unaffordable.\"In the 14 months since the initial proposal was announced, there have been regular protests by farmers outside Parliament. Some Labour MPs in rural areas have also expressed concern. At a recent parliamentary vote on the plan, a dozen backbenchers abstained and one, Markus Campbell-Savours, voted against.Campbell-Savours was subsequently suspended for voting against the government, meaning he now sits as an independent MP.",

    "body": "2 hours agoIan AikmanandIain Watson,Political correspondentGetty ImagesPolice leaders are set to recommend scrapping non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs) in a review to be published next month.College of Policing chair Lord Herbert told the BBC a \"sensible\" new approach, focused only on the most serious incidents, would \"re-balance the system\" for the social media age.NCHIs are alleged acts motivated by hostility or prejudice towards people with certain characteristics, such as race or gender, but which do not meet the bar for a criminal offence.Current Home Office guidance says they are recorded to collect data on \"hate incidents that could escalate into more serious harm\", but critics say they divert police resources and restrict freedom of speech.Though they are not crimes, NCHIs stay on police records and can come up in background checks.Police guidance on the recording of NCHIs was first published in 2005, following recommendations by an inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence - the London teenager who was stabbed to death in a racist attack in 1993.But Lord Herbert said \"an explosion of social media\" in the years since they were introduced has meant police had been drawn into monitoring \"mere disputes\" online.Officers do not want to be \"policing tweets\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.He added that recent headlines about NCHIs were \"awkward and very damaging\" for the police.\"It was quite clear that the whole regime needed looking at, that there was a perception that the police were being drawn into matters that they shouldn't have been,\" he added.The home secretary will have the final decision on whether to adopt the recommendations outlined by the College of Policy and National Police Chiefs' Council in their review next month.The Home Office told the BBC \"a consistent, common-sense approach\" that protected the \"fundamental right to free speech\" was needed, but added it would not pre-empt the findings of the review.Details of the new proposals were first reported by the Telegraph. Lord Herbert told the newspaper that \"only the most serious category of what will be treated as anti-social behaviour will be recorded\". Last year, the paper reported that 43 police forces in England and Wales had recorded more than 133,000 NCHIs since 2014.In October, the Metropolitan Police said it would no longer investigate NCHIs to allow officers to \"focus on matters that meet the threshold for criminal investigations\".It came after the policing watchdog said forces should stop recording them.In April, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called for NCHIs to be scrapped in most cases, arguing they \"wasted police time chasing ideology and grievance instead of justice\".",

The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain's former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein's abuse.\nAlso: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria. Anti-government youth protesters in South Korea are taking cues from the American right's MAGA movement. Italy announces a fee for tourists to visit the Trevi Fountain in Rome. Putin vows revenge on Ukraine after an oil tanker was blown up in the Mediterranean Sea. Palestinians tell the BBC they were sexually abused in Israeli prisons.

    "body": "1 hour agoJoe LangstaffeBBC WalesBBCThe Archbishop of Wales Cherry Vann says she has received backlash since her appointment but wants \"unity\" in the churchThe Archbishop of Wales has said that some parishioners have chosen to leave the Church in Wales in protest over her sexuality and gender.The Most Reverend Cherry Vann, who is also Bishop of Monmouth, became both the UK's first female Archbishop as well as the first openly gay Archbishop in the world, in July.Speaking ahead of delivering her first Christmas message as Archbishop, she said she had been hurt by attacks over her sexuality, but added those with different opinions should not be forbidden from expressing their views.It follows the Global Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (Gafcon) describing her appointment as \"another painful nail in the coffin of Anglican orthodoxy\".Speaking to BBC Wales, the Archbishop said: \"There are still patches all over the place where people continue to struggle with women in leadership and I have to respect that.\"The Church in Wales is working hard to welcome LGBT+ people, but also I respect that there are people in the Church in Wales who find that really difficult.\"Some, sadly, have felt the need to leave and I take that very seriously\".Archbishop Vann was elected by her fellow bishops with a two-thirds majority, following the retirement of her predecessor, Andrew John, in the summer.He retired after issues with safeguarding, excessive drinking and church members overstepping sexual boundaries came to light at Bangor Cathedral.Archbishop Vann said the vast majority of people had been supportive about her election, but added others had been \"quite hostile\".\"It can be very hurtful\", she said.\"It's hard to hear some of the things that people say, but I think it's important that there is the space for them to say that.\"I don't want people to feel shut down or silenced just because I hold a different view.\"But it does nevertheless hurt because it feels like an attack on who I am and who God has made me to be.\"We have to find a way as a Church to respect one another's views and find a commonality in our faith in Christ, despite our differences\".Archbishop Vann said that despite the widespread interest in her election because of her sex and gender, they were not the most important things to her.\"Other people find it fascinating\", she said.\"I had a lot of people contact me rejoicing at my election and saying how much hope and strength they get from the fact that there is now a woman in the role – and a civilly partnered woman at that.\"I've had the opposite as well. That's just life\".In her Christmas message, the Archbishop said she had chosen a passage from the Gospel of John about finding light in the darkness, a popular choice at carol services.\"It's really about how the coming of Jesus into the world is the light in the darkness – and there's plenty of darkness around in the world at the moment\", she said.\"Our message as Christians is that Jesus comes into all that difficulty and despair and brings the light of hope and love and joy, because of who he is\".Cherry Vann, as her election as Archbishop of Wales was announced in Chepstow last JulyAfter a turbulent year for the Church in Wales, Archbishop Vann said she was very conscious of her responsibility to fix the issues that led to her predecessor's departure.Asked whether her time as Archbishop should be judged against her ability to change the culture within the Church, she said it presented a significant challenge.\"I think there is a big cultural issue in the Church\", she said.\"Anybody who has tried to change the culture in an organisation will tell you it takes a long time.\"This is a big thing and I guess that there will still be work to do when I retire.\"(We need) to take a greater care for those who have been damaged by the Church, of which sadly there are many.\"But I am hopeful that we are already making changes.\"There are many people who are determined to make a difference and ensure that the Church is a place where, when things go wrong, they are dealt with properly\".",

    "body": "51 minutes agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterPA MediaDenise Coates, the founder and chief executive of Bet365, received a pay package of at least £280m in 2025, marking another year as one of Britain's highest-paid bosses.Her total earnings jumped by more than two thirds from almost £158m a year earlier, despite profits at the gambling firm tumbling.Ms Coates was awarded £104m in salary in the year to March 2025, Companies House filings show.In addition, as a majority shareholder in Bet365, she was entitled to at least half of the £354m dividend payment declared by the firm for the year.The £280m package means she has earned more than £2bn from Bet365 over the past decade.Campaign group the High Pay Centre condemned Ms Coates's pay as too high.Director Andrew Speke said: \"Denise Coates is well-liked in Stoke for being self-made and giving back to her community.\"But the eye-watering sums she earns go far beyond what anyone needs for a life of luxury - and her fortune comes from an industry that has caused real harm to too many people.\"Bet365 has been approached for comment.Her latest pay deal came as Bet365's pre-tax profit fell to £349m for the year, from £627m previously. Overall revenue rose by 9%, from £3.7bn a year earlier to £4bn.Ms Coates founded Bet365 in a portable building in a Stoke-on-Trent car park more than 20 years ago. It is now the biggest private sector employer in the city and offers sports betting, poker, casino games and bingo online to millions of customers worldwide.She is one of Britain's richest women and among the world's highest-paid executives.After training as an accountant, Ms Coates helped build Bet365 into one of the biggest online gambling companies from her father's bookmaking business. Her brother, John Coates, is a co-chief executive of the company.As well as being one of the UK's best-paid bosses, Ms Coates is reportedly among the country's biggest taxpayers. Her £104m salary would see her pay tens of millions in income tax and national insurance.Bet365 also said the company paid £482m of tax in the year to March, up from £364m a year earlier, including tax on dividend payments.During the year, Bet365 donated £130m to the Denise Coates Foundation, which donates to charities covering education, arts and culture and health.",

    "body": "Can rugby star's stolen caps be found after 40 years?6 hours agoLions RugbyKen Goodall, from Londonderry, won 19 international caps for IrelandThe family of a former Irish rugby star whose international caps were stolen during a break-in almost forty years ago have appealed for their return.Ken Goodall, who died in 2006, first played for Ireland against Australia in 1967 and won the last of his 19 international caps against Wales in 1970.His Irish international caps were the only items taken during the break-in at his family home in Londonderry in 1987.\"I would love the family to get these caps back... that would be the end of it as far as I am concerned,\" Goodall's brother Alan said.Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle's 20 Minutes with Mark Patterson programme, Alan said nothing else was taken when the home was targeted back in 1987.\"It was only the caps that went,\" he said,  adding Ken and his wife Wilma were not the type of people \"who would have had expensive jewellery and stuff like that\".He has over the years started to think the caps were \"stolen to order\".Alan said he knows it is a \"tall order\" to expect the caps to be returned after all this timeGetting the caps back now, Alan said, is \"a tall order\" but he hoped whoever had them might return them.\"If the person who done this is about… and maybe thinking: 'Oh, them caps, they're lying up in my loft.' \"I do not want to see you prosecuted.\"I'd say: 'Thanks very much for doing that.'\"Derry, Ulster, Ireland and the LionsKen Goodall, a number eight from City of Derry RFC, rose quickly through the competitive ranks of rugby, making his Ireland debut at the age of 19.Over the course of his rugby union career he played for Ulster, Newcastle University, Ireland and the Barbarians.In 1968, at the age of 21, he played on the British Lions tour of South Africa.However, Goodall's Lions career did not last long after he broke a bone in his hand during his first game against Eastern Transvaal and had to return home.The last of his 19 Ireland caps was won in a victory over Wales, and Goodall then joined rugby league side Workington.When his time in sport came to an end, Goodall returned to teach in Derry, retiring as vice-principal of Faughan Valley High School.The family's appeal comes after they were reunited with Goodall's cap won for representing the British Lion on that 1968 tourThe family's appeal for the return of the stolen Irish caps comes just months after they were reunited with Goodall's cap won for representing the British Lion on that 1968 tour.In 2017 the Lions Trust launched an initiative to reunite former players with their international caps.The cap had been, unbeknown to the family, in an office in Dublin until July, when it was reunited with the Goodall family.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJamie RyanBBC Social NewsFake adverts for weight loss drugs by a company pretending to be health and beauty retailer Boots have been removed from TikTok after the firm complained.The adverts for prescription-only weight loss drugs appeared to show smiling healthcare professionals from the British retailer - but in reality they were made with AI.It is illegal to advertise prescription-only weight loss drugs to the public. A spokesperson for Boots told the BBC the firm was \"aware\" of the videos and had complained to TikTok, which said it had removed the videos.A TikTok spokesperson said it did not allow \"harmful or misleading AI-generated ads\" on its platform.But the BBC found while the videos were removed, the account - seemingly located in Hong Kong - was not.It was able to re-upload the exact same videos despite the originals being removed.TikTok was again notified of this, and the user was subsequently deleted.Weight-loss jabs have been available on the NHS in England since the end of June, but they are not available over-the-counter and patients must meet strict criteria in order to be eligible for a prescription.Before the fake Boots account was removed, its videos linked to a website where weight loss drugs could be bought.It featured testimonies from customers and doctors which were either made with AI or taken from other websites.The TikTok videos showed what appeared to be health workers drinking from a vial of blue liquid.This would then appear to jump forward several months, with the workers apparently having lost a drastic amount of weight.\"AI now makes it trivially easy to generate a convincing series of videos or images showing an apparent change in a plausibly real generic health professional, or to impersonate specific health professionals wholesale,\" AI expert Sam Gregory told the BBC. \"The underlying question is how quickly and comprehensively platforms act when they detect - or are notified of - scams that clearly breach their terms of service. \"Major brands like Boots will get prioritised over an individual business owner who's been targeted.\"Other videos uploaded by the same account on TikTok seemed to have used content originally posted by real people, showcasing their weight-loss journey, but repurposed and used without permission.All of the videos used similar branding and names to that of the official Boots account on TikTok - using the handle \"@BootsOfficial\". Boots said it only runs adverts on social media through its actual account @BootsUK.The website also included warnings from the MHRA, the UK's governmental body that ensures medicines and medical devices are safe, about purchasing counterfeit products.A spokesperson for the body told the BBC weight loss medicines \"should only be obtained from a registered pharmacy against a prescription issued by a healthcare professional\". \"Taking these medicines sourced in any other way carries serious risks to your health with no guarantees about what they contain,\" they said.TikTok said it would continue to \"strengthen\" its detection methods for AI-generated content and it does not allow \"the depiction, promotion, or trade of controlled substances\".",

She had maybe three inches of air gap to breathe in.\"And there was jet fuel in there mixed with the water, fumes real bad. She was really fighting for her life.\"Earlier the Mexican Navy Secretariat said search and rescue operations were under way in co-ordination with the US Coast Guard.Video taken near Scholes International Airport in Galveston showed rescuers including a dive team working in dense fog.In a statement shared on X, the Michou y Mau Foundation sent \"our deepest condolences to the families of the victims of this tragedy\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoZoe ConwayNews CorrespondentThe Wadleys tell the BBC of the ongoing impact of problems with the insulationTony and Becs Wadley say they can't spend Christmas at home after insulation installed under a government scheme has caused black mould in several rooms, and their asthmatic son can't be inside the property.Mr Wadley says the situation is tearing the family apart: ''It's awful. Elliott can't come into our house, it's as if he's been ostracised from his own home.''The couple are among more than 300 people who have contacted the BBC in recent weeks to tell us about insulation that has gone wrong in their homes. The Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it was taking action to ensure consumers are no longer let down by poor installations. Becs WadleyBlack mould in one of the Wadleys' bedrooms earlier this year. It spread under internal wall insulation which was installed in 2024.Mr and Mrs Wadley got a government grant to have energy efficiency measures fitted in their Gower Peninsula house because they hoped a warmer home would help Elliott's asthma. The grant covered the cost of insulating his bedroom walls.But months after the work was completed, the Wadleys discovered black mould was growing behind the insulation boards. It was removed by the installer and replaced with a new insulation system. But this also had to be removed along with all the plaster after it became damp. Elliott, 19, hasn't entered the house since April, instead staying with his grandmother during university breaks.''I miss him like you wouldn't believe',\" says Mrs Wadley.The family are going to stay with Mr Wadley's sister for Christmas so they can all be together.Billions of pounds of public money has been spent on insulating homes over the last 15 years. The Wadleys' home was insulated under a government scheme known as ECO4.  In October, the National Audit Office (NAO) spending watchdog found that 98% of homes fitted with external wall insulation under ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme since 2022 had major issues that needed to be repaired. It added that 29% of homes that had internal wall insulation fitted under the schemes had major issues.The report also said there had been \"weak\" government oversight and regulatory ''failure''.DESNZ said it had \"inherited a flawed system of oversight and regulation\". A spokesman for the department said it was \"committed to introducing comprehensive reforms through the Warm Homes Plan to ensure that consumers get the quality installations they deserve and failures like these are not repeated\".The spokesman added: \"People should not be expected to navigate a complex web of organisations when they want to improve their homes – and with this government, they won't.\"Becs WadleyBecs and Tony Wadley with their three sons Felix, Freddie and Elliott.In the downstairs rooms of the Wadleys' home the insulation has also failed and has had to be removed. There is black mould on the walls while electric sockets hang loose with the wires exposed. The family says it has been in this condition for months. The installer, Stellar Energy, says it has ''no record of any immediate safety hazards being flagged.'' It says the descriptions of the exposed wires and sockets was \"highly inconsistent\" with their standard operating procedures, which required all such  work to be made safe.Building surveyor, David Walter, says the insulation wasn't fitted correctly and says the installer ''didn't understand what they were doing and what they were doing to the building which is why we've got these problems.''Stellar Energy told the BBC the design was ''technically correct for a stone house and was installed...in strict accordance with the mandatory technical specifications of ECO4.''Mr Wadley says he wouldn't have signed up for the grant if he'd known what would happen. ''You wouldn't put your family through this. Nobody would. Somebody needs to take responsibility.''Stellar Energy says it ''sincerely regrets any distress this situation has caused the family'' and says its priority is ''providing a final resolution to ensure the home meets the high standards'' it strives for.Scott Proudman had external wall insulation fitted to his family's home in 2021 under a government scheme. He is facing a £20,000 bill to get it replaced.Scott Proudman contacted the BBC about the botched external wall insulation fitted to his Bristol home in 2021.His family had been eligible for a government grant because of his eight-year-old daughter's disabilities. Born 24 weeks premature, she has cerebral palsy, a partial visual impairment and was recently diagnosed with autism. ''I feel like a failure every time I come home because this was meant to be something to look after my family, to make life easier, and it hasn't,\" he says.When the work was done, insulation boards were fixed to the outside of the house and render was applied to make it waterproof.  But the render has been falling off for years.Scott ProudmanRender is falling off Scott Proudman's home. As a result, the insulation underneath it is no longer waterproof and damp and mould could grow inside the house.Building surveyor Mr Walter, says poor design and poor workmanship has caused the render to disintegrate. He says rainwater will very likely get under the cracked render and behind the insulation and will likely cause dampness inside.  ''It's like a timebomb. It's going to get worse and worse, affecting the inside of the property,\" he says.Mr Walter says all of the render and insulation will have to come off and will cost tens of thousands of pounds to put right.Right now the family is stuck with the repair bill because the installer, SPMS Wales, is being liquidated and Mr Proudman says they weren't given the required guarantee for the work. Trustmark, the organisation responsible for overseeing quality, told Mr Proudman it couldn't help because the company is no longer accredited.Mr Proudman says he chose the company ''because it was on a government website and was Trustmark registered. I can't believe how few rights consumers have.''Brett Langdon, a director at SPMS Wales says he is ''very sorry the Proudmans have ended up in this situation'' and says all works ''were done to the manufactures specification.'' He says he gave a guarantee to the Proudmans but has told the BBC he can't remember who the guarantee is with. He says the delamination of the render was \"due to a failure of the system\".In a statement TrustMark said it was ''very sorry to hear about what's happened to Mr and Mrs Proudman and Mr and Mrs Wadley and the conditions both families' homes have been left in. It is totally unacceptable and we are in discussions with the relevant Scheme Providers and guarantee providers to help resolve these situations.'' And it said it underlined ''the need for reform to the current system''.",

    "body": "'A miracle': Officer shot in head during Bondi attack home from hospital6 hours agoYang TianSydneyPA MediaJack Hibbert had been working as a police officer for just months before he was shotA young police officer who was shot in the head during the Bondi Beach attack has been released from hospital.Probationary Constable Jack Hibbert - who is just four months into the job - was patrolling a Hanukkah event when two gunmen opened fire, injuring over 40 people and killing 15.The 22-year-old, who was also hit in the shoulder, has lost vision in one of his eyes but is now recovering at home, his family confirmed in a statement.\"As a family, we couldn't ask for anything more - having our Jack home, especially for Christmas, truly feels like a miracle.\"They thanked the public for their \"overwhelming support\" and praised medical staff for their \"exceptional\" care and dedication.\"While he is home, he is still recovering and will need space, support, and continued positive thoughts during this time,\" the statement added.Even after he was shot during the attack, Constable Hibbert continued to help festival attendees until he physically couldn't, his family previously said.\"Many of his colleagues who were present on the night of the incident have visited in hospital and given testaments to Jack's bravery during the incident... They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger,\" they said.He was one of two police officers injured in the shooting, with the second officer Constable Scott Dyson, 25, still recovering from his injuries in hospital, according to the last police update.Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon visited Constable Hibbert in hospital, praising him as a \"positive young man\".Lanyon added that the force would rally around Constable Hibbert and find \"appropriate duties for him\" after his recovery.Police have alleged the suspected gunmen were inspired by Islamic State ideology and targeted the Jewish festival in what has been declared a terror attack.Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of terror. A second gunman - his father, Sajid Akram - was shot dead by police at the scene.On Monday, new court documents alleged the pair \"meticulously\" planned the attack for months, and two days prior to the shooting, visited Bondi for reconnaissance.",

    "body": "'This is our future,' climate adviser warns as 2025 to break heat records44 minutes agoMark PoyntingClimate researcherEPARising temperatures in the UK will become \"the new normal\", a leading government climate adviser has warned, as she called for more to be done to prepare for the impacts of climate change.It comes as the Met Office revealed 2025 was on course to be the UK's hottest year since records began, with climate change continuing to drive higher temperatures.With just over a week still to go, the average UK air temperature across 2025 is on track to end up at about 10.05C, which would edge out the current record of 10.03C from 2022.\"This is our future, encapsulated in data,\" Professor Rachel Kyte told the BBC.\"Now the question is 'how are we going to prepare ourselves and build our resilience to this?'\"A lack of rainfall and persistent warmth left the country vulnerable to droughts and wildfires through the spring and summer. While temperatures vary naturally from year to year, scientists could not be clearer that human-caused climate change is driving the UK's rapidly warming trend.\"The pollution [carbon dioxide] we've put in for the last 20-30 years is now what is driving this warmth, and so not curbing emissions well enough means we're going to continue to see these kinds of impacts,\" Prof Kyte, the UK's special representative for climate, said.She said the UK needed to become \"resilient\" to the inevitability of higher temperatures through further investment in nature and infrastructure.\"If we don't invest in our adaptation now, it's going to cost us way more,\" she warned.By the end of 2025, the UK's 10 warmest years on record will all have taken place in the last two decades, in measurements going back to the late 1800s.\"Anthropogenic [human-caused] climate change is causing the warming in the UK as it's causing the warming across the world,\" said Amy Doherty, a climate scientist at the Met Office.\"What we have seen in the past 40 years, and what we're going to continue to see, is more records broken, more extremely hot years [...] so what was normal 10 years ago, 20 years ago, will become [relatively] cool in the future,\" she told BBC News.The Met Office's projection uses observed temperatures up to 21 December and assumes that the remaining days of the year are 2C below the long-term December average, with slightly cooler conditions expected over Christmas.So while the Met Office cannot say with certainty that 2025 will be the hottest year, it is the most likely outcome. It would be the sixth time this century that the UK has set a new annual temperature record, following 2002, 2003, 2006, 2014 and 2022.\"The changes we are seeing are unprecedented in observational records back to the 19th Century,\" said Mike Kendon, another climate scientist at the Met Office.The expected new record of 2025 has been built on persistent heat through the spring and summer.Those long, hot, sunny days may feel like a distant memory as we head towards Christmas, but both spring and summer were the UK's warmest ever recorded.Each month from March to August was more than 2C above the long-term average between 1961 and 1990.Temperatures peaked at 35.8C - well below the highs of more than 40C seen in July 2022 - but hot spells happened repeatedly.Four separate - albeit relatively short-lived - heatwaves were declared across much of the country. The UK Health Security Agency also issued several heat-health alerts through the summer.Mr Kendon said longer spells of hotter days and nights posed an increased risk to elderly and vulnerable people.He told the Today programme it would also have an impact on the agriculture sector, influencing which crops farmers are able to grow in the UK.Spring and summer were also marked by low rainfall. Spring was particularly dry - the UK's sixth driest since 1836. Combined with the warm weather helping to dry out the soils, this lack of rainfall pushed large parts of the country towards drought. Through the summer, official droughts were declared across several regions in England and Wales, by the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales respectively. Parts of eastern Scotland also entered \"significant water scarcity\", according to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.Recent rainfall has eased the situation across much of the country and most areas are no longer in official drought. But water levels are still below average in some places.\"There's a huge deficit to be made up, and there's a huge implication, not just for people who are farming the land [and] growing food, but our rivers, our aquifers, our availability of drinking water,\" said Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading.The repeated swings between drought and flooding were making it very hard for communities to adapt to increasing weather extremes, she added.The prolonged dry, warm weather created ideal conditions for wildfires too.By late April, the area of the UK burned by wildfires had already reached a new annual record, according to data from the Global Wildfires Information System going back to 2012.More than 47,100 hectares (471 sq km or 182 sq miles) has now been burned throughout 2025 - smashing the previous high of 28,100 hectares of 2019.Andy Cole, chief fire officer at Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters in his region had responded to more than 1,000 wildfires this year - an \"unprecedented\" number, he said.\"I've been doing this for over 20 years and we've seen a marked increase in the number of fires we're having to deal with in the open,\" he told the Today programme.As the UK continues to heat up - driven by humanity's greenhouse gas emissions - scientists expect the UK to experience more weather extremes. \"The conditions that people are going to experience are going to continue to change as they have in the last few years [with] more wildfires, more droughts, more heatwaves,\" said Dr Doherty.\"But also it's going to get wetter in the winter half-year, so from October to March [...] the rain that does fall will fall more intensely, and in heavier rain showers, causing that kind of flooding that we've been seeing this year as well,\" she added.The UK has not been alone in experiencing extreme heat this year. The world is on course for its second or third warmest year ever recorded, according to the European Copernicus climate service.But the international consensus on tackling climate change is also being tested, with the US and some other leading producers of fossil fuels rowing back on their net zero commitments.

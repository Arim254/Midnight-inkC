    "body": "'Good idea' or taking 'massive chance' - is Rosenior ready for Chelsea?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liam Rosenior's last involvement in the Premier League was as a player for Brighton in 2017ByEmlyn BegleyBBC Sport journalistLiam Rosenior is the leading contender to be the new Chelsea manager - just 18 months after being sacked by Championship side Hull City - so why is he favourite, and would appointing him be a good decision?The 41-year-old Englishman has impressed with French Ligue 1 club Strasbourg, who are also part of Chelsea owners the BlueCo group, leading to this chance to move across to the Londoners.He would take over from Enzo Maresca, who won the Club World Cup in the summer, but became the latest Blues boss to fall out with the hierarchy and left on Thursday.\"They will get someone in who is young and easy to manipulate,\" said BBC pundit and former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin.If appointed, Rosenior would be the fourth out of the past five Chelsea managers to have managed in the Championship.He took his pre-match news conference as usual before Strasbourg's game against Nice on Saturday.\"I'm going to talk about Nice because that's my job,\" he said in quotes reported by local media outlet DNA., external\"There's a lot of noise, a lot of speculation, but as a coach, if you get involved, you fail.\"I don't want to guarantee how long I'll be here, but I enjoy myself here every day. I love this club, but I can't guarantee anything. Nobody can.\"I could say I'm going to stay here for years and then get fired.\"About having contact with Chelsea, he said: \"There are discussions because we're part of the same group.\"BBC Sport takes a look at his career to date.Rosenior's youthful Strasbourg teamOne of Rosenior's most striking achievements with Strasbourg has been guiding them into the top reaches of Ligue 1 while fielding a team of youngsters, something which would stand him in good stead with Chelsea.The average age of the Blues' line-up in the Premier League last season was 24 years and 36 days, the lowest of any team across a Premier League campaign.Their oldest player is Tosin Adarabioyo, 28, and earlier this season they became the first team to have three teenagers on the scoresheet in a Champions League game.Meanwhile, in August Strasbourg became the first club in Europe's top five leagues to play a team of players all born in the 2000s - and had an average age of 20 years and 283 days for a Ligue 1 game against Monaco. The oldest player was 22.Former England left-back Ben Chilwell, who joined Strasbourg from Chelsea in the summer, spoke to BBC Sport's Nizaar Kinsella in November about Rosenior's leadership style.\"The manager is very good at managing a young dressing room,\" he said. \"It's not necessarily an immature dressing room but a young dressing room that doesn't have the experience of knowing what it takes yet to win stuff.\"The manager wants to win stuff this season, wants us to qualify for the Champions League, wants us to win the French Cup, wants us to win the Conference League.\"Strasbourg finished seventh last season, and sit in the same position again after 16 games of this campaign. They finished top of this season's Conference League group with five wins and a draw - including victories over Crystal Palace and Aberdeen.But Rosenior, who has already managed Chelsea's Liam Delap at Hull City and Andrey Santos at Strasbourg last season, could now swap the Conference League for the Champions League.Flexible tactically and plenty of passes - Rosenior at StrasbourgStrasbourg's Ligue 1 form has dipped in recent months though, with only one win in the past six Ligue 1 games.In the middle of October they were in third place, just one point off leaders Paris St-Germain, but they are now 14 points behind current leaders Lens.Rosenior has not been wedded to a shape, playing in both a 4-2-3-1 and a 3-4-3 formation.They play a passing style, with the third highest number of passes in Ligue 1 this season - but they are only eighth for passes in the opposition half. Their 55 through balls are more than anyone else in Ligue 1 - by a huge distance - while they rank at the bottom for long passes, again by some way.In fact Strasbourg have played fewer long passes than any other team in Europe's top five leagues - 511. The team next on the list, Barcelona, have hit 598 long balls. Chelsea, by contrast, have played 925 long passes in the league.Strasbourg have been clinical too, ranking 14th for shots in Ligue 1 but seventh for goals.In November club president Marc Keller - who denied Strasbourg are Chelsea's feeder club - told the BBC: \"Liam is very innovative. \"He is playing top football and we are playing with a young team, so they have space to play.\"BlueCo knew him from England and when I met him he was clear about what he wanted to set up in Strasbourg - and what he said is exactly what is happening now.\"Rosenior built his reputation in the EFLImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liam Rosenior (right) played a huge part in Wayne Rooney's Derby County coaching staff Rosenior, a right-back, had a solid but unspectacular career as a player - featuring in the top flight for Fulham, Reading, Hull and Brighton.Roughly half his career was spent in the EFL and that's where he started his coaching career.After a spell as Brighton's under-23s coach, he spent three years at Derby.He was first-team coach under Phillip Cocu and then assistant boss to Wayne Rooney - before taking over as interim boss after Rooney's departure.But he was more hands-on than the average assistant.\"There was an argument when Mel Morris sacked Phillip Cocu in November 2020, Rosenior should have been put in charge, not Rooney,\" said BBC football news reporter Simon Stone.\"Rooney had the profile of course, but it was Rosenior who put the sessions on at Derby and who guided the team during games.\"Rosenior replaced Rooney for a short time in 2022, after administration had led to relegation into League One.\"It was Rosenior who put Derby back together, helping to bring in 14 new players after the club had been left with only five under contract.\"History suggests the new ownership would have been better leaving Rosenior in charge, given they were seventh when he left and under his replacement, Paul Warne, they didn't even end with a play-off place.\"He then spent almost two years as Hull manager - with observers again thinking he was harshly done by at the end.The Tigers were one point above the relegation zone when he took over in November 2022 and led them to 15th.The following season they finished three points off the play-off places, and Rosenior was sacked.In 2024-25 while Rosenior was leading Strasbourg into Europe, Hull City avoided relegation from the Championship on goal difference.'You need a puppet'Many of Chelsea's managers under BlueCo have had big personalities and fallen out with the ownership.They include Thomas Tuchel, who had won the Champions League, and Maresca, who lifted the Club World Cup in the summer.Mauricio Pochettino left the club 18 months ago despite having appeared to stabilise the team in the latter stages of that season.Would Chelsea be looking to the manager sitting seventh in the French league if they were not already part of their ownership group?BBC pundit Nevin said: \"Chelsea need someone who is going to buy into the methodology. Another way to say that is, you need a puppet. Someone who does exactly what they are told from above.\"Chelsea want success. But they want something else. They want someone who will do what they tell them to do. Those two things may not be compatible.\"Liam Rosenior sounds like a really good idea, but he's never done it at this level. To bring someone in who doesn't have that level of experience is a massive, massive chance to take.\"Rosenior does have more managerial experience than his predecessor Maresca, who  had a short spell at Parma in 2021 and one season as Leicester boss before taking over at Chelsea in 2024.Former Manchester United striker Dion Dublin said \"Rosenior is doing brilliant at Strasbourg\".But he added: \"Chelsea had a manager who I don't think is going to be matched unless they spend a lot of money at it, to get a top-class manager in, and I don't think that is going to happen.\"It sounds like the owners want to control the manager and everything that goes on and what happens beyond the white line.\"",

    "body": "Men remanded after pensioner killed in hit-and-run5 hours agoJacob PanonsandCash Murphy,South EastKent PoliceMr Wallace died when he was struck by a vehicle on MondayTwo men have appeared in court charged over the death of an 89-year-old man described by his family as a \"respected and loved member of the community\", who died in a hit-and-run car crash.Retired dental surgeon Tom Wallace was struck by a grey Mercedes estate on the A289 Gads Hill, in Gillingham, on Monday, Kent Police said.Detectives said Mr Wallace \"had been carried by the car\" and was found on the ground at Grange Road, almost a mile from where he was believed to have been hit.Albert Matraxhiu, 28, of Orange Hill Road, Edgware, north London, has been charged with death by dangerous driving, and Erald Paci, 29, of Five Ways Court, Chatham, has been charged with intention to pervert the course of justice.Matraxhiu has also been charged with intention to pervert the course of justice, driving with no insurance, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence, failure to stop after an accident, and failure to report an accident.After appearing at Medway Magistrates' Court on Friday, both men have been remanded to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on 30 January.GoogleThe crash happened on the A289 Gads Hill in GillinghamIn a statement issued through Kent Police, Mr Wallace's family said he \"deserved a better end to his life than this\".They said: \"He had been married for 63 years, was a father of three, a grandfather of four, and recently a great grandfather.\"He sailed his boat up and down the east coast, and across the Channel to France, usually single-handed.

He has been remanded in custody until his next appearance at Maidstone Crown Court on 26 January, the force said.Related internet links",

    "body": "5 hours agoMick LunneyYorkshireMaisy Creed RacingMaisy was crowned karting's PF International X30 Junior Champion 2025 in NovemberA teenager from Sheffield has said she aims to become a top F1 driver in the footsteps of the sport's biggest names after being crowned a champion in the sport of karting.Maisy Creed, 16, took the prestigious PF International X30 Junior Champion title in November, becoming the first ever female driver to do so.The title was previously won by future stars such as Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button and Lando Norris, and Maisy said she was determined to win a place in the renowned F1 Academy so she could follow a similar path.\"I'm there with all the guys, the only female driver there, and it just feels really special. I've done something nobody else has done - and that feels special,\" she said.Maisy said that later this year she would use facilities at Silverstone, the legendary home of the British Grand Prix and MotoGP events, to develop her driving skills in cars.The aim was to impress the F1 Academy with her performance data and, if she succeeded, it could see her achieving her academy goal in 2027, she explained.Maisy Creed RacingFemale drivers are few and far between at the higher end of the sportMaisy began her racing adventures with indoor karting at the age of eight, later than most drivers who rise in the outdoors version of the sport.Her dad, Adam, said he was very proud of his daughter's achievements so far - and knew she could succeed in her goals despite the fact it was \"a massively male-dominated sport\".\"For girls to come into that sport and excel, it's unbelievably difficult,\" Mr Creed said.Maisy agreed and said there was unfortunately still a lot of sexism faced by females in the sport.\"There's a few girls that I'm quite close with, and we all experience it,\" she said.\"It's just really annoying to deal with because I don't understand why they [males] find it so unbelievable, and they really just don't want to be beaten by me.\"'Passion and desire'Maisy said she realised she was \"fairly unusual\".\"I'm one of a tiny handful of girls on the whole planet that can actually compete at the top level against the boys and actually be at the front,\" she said.However, Maisy added that she believed she was on track for further success in 2026 and beyond.\"I have the passion and desire to reach for the very top of this amazing sport that I love,\" she smiled.\"I can't wait to experience the journey over the next five years.\"More stories like thisRelated internet links",

    "body": "8 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterPAPoliticians have given away too much power to lawyers, activists and regulators, and cannot deliver their promises, an ex-aide to the prime minister has said.Writing in The Times, Paul Ovenden, who quit as Keir Starmer's director of political strategy last September after offensive messages he had sent in 2017 surfaced, said  the British state had got \"bigger and bigger while simultaneously and systematically emasculating itself\".He also said the case of the British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah \"revealed the sheer weirdness of how Whitehall spends its time\". Speaking to the BBC, he said with a \"stiffening resolve\" politicians could \"take back control\" of the levers of democracy. Mr Ovenden told Radio 4's Today programme, that he believed Sir Keir was \"exactly the right person\" to make changes adding: \"He does feel those frustrations very acutely.\"Separately, Chris Powell – who worked on four Labour general elections and the brother of the PM's adviser Jonathan Powell – has said the Labour government needs a \"fundamental reset\" in order to fight off the electoral threat posed by Reform UK.Writing in The Guardian, he said voters were \"fed up, think nothing works – and some are simply angry and feel ignored\".Their comments come at the start of a potentially difficult year for the prime minister which includes local elections in May and the threat of a leadership challenge from those in the Labour Party unhappy with his performance so far.Mr Abd El Fattah was imprisoned in an Egyptian jail for more than a decade after being convicted of \"spreading fake news\" about torture in the country. He was released in September following lobbying by successive British governments and arrived in the UK last week. His arrival was initially welcomed by the prime minister who said he was \"delighted\" and that his case had been \"a top priority for my government\".However, Sir Keir faced criticism when social media posts emerged in which Mr Abd El Fattah called for the killing of Zionists and police officers.Sir Keir said he had been unaware of the \"absolutely abhorrent\" posts, which Mr Abd El Fattah has since apologised for, and that the government was reviewing the \"information failures in this case\". Reflecting on the case, Mr Ovenden told Radio 4's Today programme: \"We'd be having long meetings on the priorities of the government and they would be railroaded by any other business into discussions about this gentleman.\"Most of us on the political side of government weren't that aware of it, weren't that tuned into it because it didn't impact us on a day-to-day basis.\"It actually became a kind of running joke within government that people would always find a way to bring it back to this conversation.\"He said the case \"became sort of totemic of the distraction of issues that it felt like a different part of government were fascinated by\". Asked why politicians could not ignore these subjects, Mr Ovenden said they had \"effectively handed away power\".\"What they're really trying to do is hand away risk but they've handed away power to arm's length bodies, to quangos, to activists, to lawyers, to regulatory framework, to well-networked organisations... who are able to basically stop the machinery of government doing things.\"He said examples of subjects he considered to be distractions included paying colonial reparations or banning vaping in pub gardens.He added that it was \"no surprise the public are fed up with politicians' ability to get things done\" but that he believed that \"we can change this and change quite quickly\". He argued that the government should start by scaling back some of the government's legal obligations such as environmental obligations for building and the right to launch legal challenges against government policies through judicial reviews. His comments echoed a sentiment previously expressed by others in government, including the prime minister. Before Christmas, when asked by the parliamentary Liaison Committee what he had found most difficult in government, Sir Keir replied: \"Speed and ability to get things done in Parliament.\"We have so many checks and balances and consultations and regulations and arm's length bodies.\"My own sense, after 12 to 18 months in the job - and this is a fault of governments of all political colours - is that every time something has gone wrong in the past, successive governments have put in place another procedure, another body or another consultation to try to stop ourselves ever making a mistake again. \"My experience as prime minister is of frustration that every time I go to pull a lever, there are a whole bunch of regulations, consultations and arm's length bodies that mean the action from pulling the lever to delivery is longer than I think it ought to be, which is among the reasons I want to cut down on regulation generally and within government.\"",

    "body": "A coroner has warned that further babies could die unless the government introduces regulation of non-therapeutic male circumcision following the death of a six-month-old boy in west London.Non-therapeutic circumcision is the removal of the foreskin of male babies and young children for religious or cultural reasons, rather than medical reasons.Mohamed Abdisamad was circumcised on 12 February 2023, by a circumciser who had been recommended to his parents and requested by them to perform the procedure on their son, the West London Coroner's report said.The baby began showing symptoms of illness three to four days later and was taken to hospital on 19 February and died the same day.He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital by ambulance where he went into cardiorespiratory arrest and was pronounced dead at 23:55 GMT.A jury inquest which concluded on 8 October 2025 found the medical cause of death to be an \"invasive streptococcus pyogenes infection following male circumcision\".Assistant coroner Anton van Dellen wrote a prevention of future deaths report in which he called for action over the lack of safety and regulatory measures surrounding non-therapeutic male circumcisions.\"During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern,\" Dr van Dellen wrote in the report dated December 28 2025.\"In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.\"The coroner said there are no national safeguards governing non-therapeutic male circumcision, with no requirements for training, accreditation or registration of those carrying out the procedure, and no rules on record keeping, infection control or aftercare.He also pointed to the lack of a system for obtaining consent prior to the procedure being carried out.The report is being sent to the Department of Health and Social Care, and to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.They have 56 days from the date of the report being issued to respond, the coroner said.Copies of the report are also being sent to Mohamed's mother and father, his maternal grandmother, his uncle, and the London Ambulance Service.",

Police sources told the BBC the charges included causing death by dangerous driving.Joshua's personal trainer, Latif Ayodele, and strength coach, Sina Ghami, died on Monday after the vehicle they were travelling in crashed into a stationary truck on a highway in Ogun state, near Lagos.The former heavyweight champion was taken to hospital with injuries after the crash and was discharged on Wednesday.Prosecutors brought four charges against Mr Kayode - causing death by dangerous driving, reckless and negligent driving, driving without due care, and driving without a valid driver's licence, a police source told the BBC.The defendant was granted bail in the sum of 5,000,000 Naira (£2,578) and was remanded pending his bail conditions being met.The case has been adjourned until 20 January.Joshua, 36, was a passenger in a Lexus SUV that collided with a parked truck on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway, in south-west Nigeria, on Monday.Mr Ghami and Mr Ayodele were both pronounced dead at the scene, while Joshua was pictured being helped from the wreckage.Federal Road Safety CorpsNigeria's road safety authority shared this image of the crash site on MondayOgun and Lagos state officials said in a statement that the British boxer was \"heavy hearted\" over the deaths of the two men, who were both his close friends.After being discharged from hospital, Joshua visited the funeral home where their bodies were \"being prepared for repatriation\", the statement added.Just hours before the crash, Joshua posted a video to Instagram of him playing table tennis with Mr Ayodele.On Wednesday, Eddie Hearn, who has been Joshua's promoter for more than a decade, paid tribute to the team members.\"Rest in peace Latz and Sina,\" Hearn posted on Instagram.\"Your energy and loyalty among so many other great qualities will be deeply missed. Praying for strength and guidance for all their family, friends and of course AJ during this very difficult time.\"Joshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town in Ogun state, near the crash site.He was on his way to visit relatives for New Year celebrations in the town at the time of the crash, a family member told the BBC. The boxer had been spending time in Nigeria after his recent victory over American YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul on 19 December.Paul posted on X after the crash: \"Life is much more important than boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ and anyone impacted by today's unfortunate accident.\"",

Medicines obtained from unregulated sources pose a major risk to people's safety.\"Healthcare professionals prescribing weight loss treatments must act in accordance with the standards set by the respective professional regulatory bodies,\" they added.More top storiesRelated internet links",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has named spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as his new chief of staff, just over a month after his previous top aide resigned amid a corruption row.\"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues,\" Zelensky said in a post on social media, publishing a photo of his meeting with Budanov in Kyiv.Budanov, 39, has until now led the Hur military intelligence, which has claimed a number of highly-effective strikes against Russia.His predecessor, Andriy Yermak, wielded enormous political influence throughout Russia's full-scale invasion launched in 2022. He also led Ukraine's negotiating team in crucial talks with the US aimed at ending the war.In Friday's post on social media, Zelensky wrote: \"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the defence and security forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations. \"Kyrylo has specialist experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results.\" The president added that he had already instructed his new office chief to update and present key documents regarding \"the strategic foundations\" of Ukraine's defence.Zelensky said Budanov was being replaced by 56-year-old foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko.Yermak, 54, stepped down on 28 November,  and his departure was seen as a major blow to Zelensky.Yermak quit shortly after his home in Kyiv was raided by the country's anti-corruption agencies. He is not accused of any wrongdoing, and the anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office Sapo did not explain why they searched his property. In the past few months investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position at a delicate time.Kyiv, backed by its European allies, is seeking to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.Russian officials have seized on the scandal, talking up corruption claims.",

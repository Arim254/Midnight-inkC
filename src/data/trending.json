    "body": "16 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, Jerusalem andBBC Visual Journalism teamGetty ImagesA ceasefire has come into effect for the war in Gaza, after the Israeli government approved a US-brokered deal with Hamas in negotiations that had the personal involvement of US President Donald Trump.The full text of the agreement has not been made public - but part of it has been published by Israeli media.It appears to lack details and in some cases is vague and ambiguous - perhaps on purpose.Even its title, \"Implementation steps for President Trump's proposal for a comprehensive end of Gaza War\", leaves room for different interpretations.The full title suggests these are steps for the implementation of the 20-point plan that President Trump announced at the White House last week. The document was agreed after negotiations in Egypt over the first phase of the plan, related to a ceasefire, a hostage and prisoner exchange, and a surge in humanitarian aid.However, by highlighting \"Comprehensive end of Gaza war\", the document appears to be announcing the end of the two-year-old war.This paragraph explicitly says the war is over, which sets the scene for future discussions on later stages of the president's plan for Gaza. It appears to suggest that, even if the negotiations reach an impasse, hostilities will not resume.This is crucial as key sticking points remain, including the Israeli demand for Hamas to disarm, the scale of the Israeli withdrawal, and a plan for who will govern the territory. The document does not mention guarantees that could have been given that the conflict will not restart, or what could happen if either side returns to fighting.Speaking after the deal was reached, Hamas's exiled Gaza leader, Khalil Al-Hayya, said he had received assurances from the US and other mediators that the war had ended.Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly said that the conflict is over. Following the approval of the deal by the Israeli government, Netanyahu released a video in which he appeared to threaten to use force if Israel's demands, including Hamas's disarmament, were not met. \"If this is achieved in the easy way, it's all for the better. And if not, it'll be achieved the hard way,\" he said.The document does not mention the next steps for the full implementation of Trump's plan.This appears to leave room for a return of Israeli troops to areas they had withdrawn from if Hamas is seen as not being fully compliant with the deal. It provides no details about what could constitute a violation.And the text does not explicitly rule out air strikes. Prior to the deal, Hamas officials were concerned that there would be a situation like the one in Lebanon, where a ceasefire deal has not prevented near-daily air strikes on people and targets Israel says are linked to Hezbollah, the Shia militia and political movement. The Lebanese government says Israel's actions are violations of the deal, which was also brokered with US help.Despite the demand that all hostages, alive and dead, should be freed within 72 hours of the partial Israeli withdrawal, the text concedes, although not explicitly, that Hamas is unlikely to be able to retrieve all bodies from deceased hostages within that timeframe, allowing the group to share the information it had gathered about those that could not be located.The text does not say what could happen in case of delays in freeing the 20 captives believed to be alive.This suggests the creation of a mechanism to monitor the deal and report any violations.US officials said separately that the US was moving up to 200 troops already based in the Middle East to co-ordinate the multination force. Assuming the hostage and prisoner exchange is completed, the officials said the intention was for a so-called International Stabilisation Force to be built, although this was yet to be agreed between the sides.Next phase of deal unclearThis deal is a significant diplomatic breakthrough led by Trump, who wants to be remembered as the one who brought the conflict to an end. The president employed American leverage to force Netanyahu, who has been accused of sabotaging earlier efforts for a deal, to engage with the negotiations. Hamas came under pressure from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, and from a population in desperate need of help.Israel launched the war in response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, when around 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 were taken hostage.Israel's military campaign has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians and including more than 18,000 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and led to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.The first phase of the president's plan was, perhaps, the easiest one. Netanyahu was also facing growing domestic pressure, with polls consistently suggesting that the vast majority of Israelis wanted a deal with Hamas and the end of the war. Hamas, meanwhile, was apparently convinced that keeping the hostages had become a burden, giving Israel a reason to continue fighting.What happens next, however, is not clear. Progress will only happen if the Trump administration remains engaged, as both Israel and Hamas have reasons to stall the process. There is momentum, but major obstacles remain."

    "body": "9 hours agoRuth CleggHealth and wellbeing reporterEmilyThe facelift is moving into new territory.A quick search on socials and my feed is inundated with posts from people in their late 20s, 30s, discussing different types of facelift - the mini, the ponytail, the deep plane.Gone are the days when facelifts were reserved for the ageing wealthy - now an increasing number of younger people are opting to go under the knife.Some happily share pictures of their face before, after and the very bruised bit in between - their often very painful recovery.It's no longer a procedure that's spoken about in secret, celebrities like Kris Jenner, Catt Sadler and Marc Jacobs have spoken openly about their treatment. Many more are rumoured to have had one.The facelift is often seen as the last resort, the most major of cosmetic surgeries.Are people becoming so insecure in an often fake online world that they will pay thousands of pounds for the operation?Or have we had so many non-surgical treatments, such as Botox and fillers, that having our skin peeled from our cheekbones and our facial tissues and fat rearranged feels like a logical - and longer lasting - next step?EmilyEmily, pictured here in recovery and post-surgery, says she does not regret her operationFor Emily, who had a facelift at 28, it was about getting a \"snatched look\" - a sculpted, sharp jaw, high cheekbones and fox eyes. She says having surgery in Turkey was \"life-changing\" and she does not regret it.\"In total I had six surgeries rolled into one,\" she explains. \"Among them I had a mid- face lift, a lip lift and a rhinoplasty [nose job].\"Describing the process, the businesswoman from Toronto, Canada, says the surgeon played her favourite song as she went under general anaesthetic and then: \"I fell asleep and I woke up, threw up, and I had a new face and a new nose.\"The recovery process was long - the pain and bruising began to subside over the first few weeks, but it took six months for Emily to regain feeling in parts of her cheeks.Would she do it again? She hesitates. \"Since my surgery, I've changed my life. I'm healthier, I drink a lot less, I look after my skin, I sleep. I think if I knew what I know now I might not have gone through with it.\"My mum didn't even know until I told her a couple of days after surgery.\"But then she stops and reflects. \"But I just wanted to be the best version of myself,\" Emily says, \"and now I think I am.\"Figures from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) show an 8% increase in facelifts over the past 12 months in the UK - they don't break down the figures by age, but many members report that the demographic is shifting.This is reflected in other parts of the world, with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons seeing a rise in Gen X (ages 45 to 60) opting for a facelift.Nora Nugent, president of BAAPS, believes there are a host of reasons for the change - including the rise of weight-loss medications.\"Losing weight so quickly on these drugs can leave a lot of excess skin. A facelift can help with that,\" she says. \"Techniques have developed massively - a facelift no longer means risking that 'wind tunnel' [an overly stretched face as a result of the skin being pulled back] effect on the face we saw many years ago.\" BAAPSDuring a facelift cuts are made on both sides of the face by the ear, extending up along the hairline. An incision is then made in the muscle that controls facial expressions, so that tissues and muscle can be repositionedHowever, a facelift is still a significant operation that should only be undertaken by a specialist, registered plastic surgeon in a registered facility with proper equipment, she says.At his clinic in Bristol, consultant plastic surgeon Simon Lee has carried out hundreds of facelifts - and shows me a video of one.For the duration of the procedure the client is wide awake, having had low levels of local anaesthetic injected into the skin and the deeper tissue beneath.He makes a series of small incisions in her face, before going under the skin, the fat and the superficial fascia (SMAS) - the part of the face which controls our expressions - then reaching the deep plane where he repositions tissue and muscles to reshape the face.As he finishes, the client, who has been under the knife for four hours, smiles in relief.One of the reasons it's become more appealing, Mr Lee says, is the ease with which face and neck lifts can now be carried out. Once reserved for a hospital theatre and requiring a general anaesthetic, he now carries the face and neck lift without sedation in his clinic.It's an \"exciting time\" in the industry, he says, with developments happening at speed. While the classic facelift - which focuses on the lower jaw and neck is still popular, there are newer treatments which target the upper two thirds of the face - where he says, the ageing process begins and is noticeable at a younger age.The surgeon caveats this saying a facelift is suitable for those over 40, but it would be very unusual to carry out such a complex procedure on someone in their 20s and 30s.There are risks and complications involved in these kind of procedures, such as developing a hematoma - a collection of blood under the skin which, if not treated, could lead to necrosis (death of surrounding tissues), infections, nerve injury and alopecia.A facelift costs, on average, £15,000-£45,000 in the UK, but there are clinics offering these procedures for as little as £5,000.Experts say it is important to do your research and choose a plastic surgeon who specialises in facelifts.Julia GilandoJulia Gilando went to Turkey for her surgeryJulia Gilando, 34, decided she needed a facelift to fix asymmetry in her face after having issues with the jaw alignment earlier in her life.Although many of her friends said they couldn't see a problem with her face, she felt it, \"trusted her gut\", and flew to Turkey for her procedure, which cost $8,000 (£6,000).Despite warnings about the risks associated with having cosmetic surgery in Turkey it has become increasingly popular to do so, mainly due to lower prices.\"At first I thought this whole idea was crazy, but I did my research and I decided to go for it,\" Ms Gilando, a healthcare professional, says. \"I was scared, I was in a foreign country, I was alone, and I didn't speak the language.\"After my surgery I spent two days in hospital and then had to fend for myself. I was so swollen I couldn't see.\"There were some dark times, it was a whole mental rollercoaster of emotions, you go through these highs and lows.\"There are concerns from researchers about whether such cosmetic surgery procedures give the self-esteem and confidence the industry advertises.\"I think there's an unprecedented pressure,\" Dr Kirsty Garbett, a body image expert from the Centre of Appearance Research at the University of West England, explains. \"Especially when it comes to the face - we see ourselves on video calls, social media platforms, we compare ourselves to others so easily.\"And she says, what we see isn't necessarily a true reflection of reality.\"AI, filters - all play a part in creating a fake online world. And, at the same time, we are seeing a rise in the normalisation of cosmetic procedures.\"Celebrities being more outspoken about having these operations is, in some ways, a good thing, she says, but it also normalises them - making them appear \"just a part of life and that is really worrying\".Caroline StanburyCaroline Stanbury describes her facelift as the \"best thing\" she's had doneCaroline Stanbury, TV presenter and one of the Real Housewives of Dubai, had a facelift two years ago aged 47, despite everyone telling her not to do it because she was too young.\"It was the best thing I have ever had done,\" Caroline says. \"Why do I want to wait until I am in my 60s, desperate and need it? I want to look and feel amazing now.\"Having spent 20 years getting regular Botox and fillers, she felt like she was \"beginning to look weird\". She paid $45,000 (£34,000) for a deep plane facelift in the US.\"I still look like me, and this procedure has given me another 20 years of feeling great,\" she says.Alexis Verpaele, a plastic surgeon based in Belgium, with clients from all over the world including the UK, says he's worried about the increasing number of younger people coming for the treatment.He often talks to these clients at length about ways certain looks can be achieved without something as major as surgery.\"If they have a facelift in their 20s, and we know it can last 10, 15 years say.\"So by the time they are 60, they might have had three facelifts,\" De Verpaele says.\"That's a lot of trauma for one face to endure - and that's the best case scenario without any complications.\"More weekend picks"

    "body": "'It's going to be really bad': Fears over AI bubble bursting grow in Silicon Valley10 hours agoLily JamaliTechnology correspondent, San FranciscoGetty ImagesSilicon Valley is home to many major tech firms, including Apple's circular headquartersAt OpenAI's DevDay this week, OpenAI boss Sam Altman did what American tech bosses rarely do these days: he actually answered questions from reporters.\"I know it's tempting to write the bubble story,\" Mr Altman told me as he sat flanked by his top lieutenants. \"In fact, there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.\"In Silicon Valley, the debate over whether AI companies are overvalued has taken on a new urgency. Sceptics are privately - and some now publicly - asking whether the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies may be, at least in part, the result of what they call \"financial engineering\".In other words - there are fears these companies are overvalued.Mr Altman said he expected investors would make some bad calls and silly start-ups would walk away with crazy money.But with OpenAI, he told me, \"there's something real happening here\".Not everyone is convinced.In recent days, warnings of an AI bubble have come from the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund, as well as JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon who told the BBC \"the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds\".And here, in what is often considered the tech capital of the world, concerns are growing.At a panel discussion at Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum this week, early AI entrepreneur Jerry Kaplan told a packed audience he has lived through four bubbles.Getty ImagesJerry Kaplan founded Go Corporation, which developed early tablet computersHe's especially concerned now given the magnitude of money on the table as compared to the dot-com boom. There's so much more to lose.\"When [the bubble] breaks, it's going to be really bad, and not just for people in AI,\" he said. \"It's going to drag down the rest of the economy.\"However, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which has minted its fair share of tech entrepreneurs, Prof Anat Admati says while there have been many attempts to model when we're in the bubble, it can be a futile exercise.\"It is very hard to time a bubble,\" Prof Admati told me. \"And you can't say with certainty you were in one until after the bubble has burst.\"But the data is concerning to many.AI-related enterprises have accounted for 80% of the stunning gains in the American stock market this year - and Gartner estimates global spending on AI will likely reach a whopping $1.5tn (£1.1tn) before 2025 is out.OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with ChatGPT in 2022, is at the centre of the tangled web of deals drawing scrutiny.For example - last month, it entered into a $100bn deal with chipmaker Nvidia, which is itself the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.It expands an existing investment Nvidia already had in Mr Altman's company - with  expectations that OpenAI will build data centres powered with Nvidia's advanced chips.Then on Monday, OpenAI announced plans to purchase billions of dollars worth of equipment for developing AI from Nvidia rival AMD, in a deal that could make it one of AMD's largest shareholders.Remember this is a private company, albeit one recently valued at a half-trillion dollars.Then there's tech giant Microsoft, which is heavily invested, and cloud computing behemoth Oracle has a $300bn deal with OpenAI, too.OpenAI's Stargate project in Abilene, Texas, funded with the help of Oracle and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and announced at the White House during President Donald Trump's first week in office, grows ever larger every few months. And as for Nvidia, it has a stake in AI startup CoreWeave - which supplies OpenAI with some of its massive infrastructure needs.Getty ImagesOpenAI boss Sam Altman And as these increasingly complex financing arrangements get more and more common, the experts here in Silicon Valley say they may be clouding perceptions on AI demand.Some people aren't mincing their words about it either, calling the deals \"circular financing\" or even \"vendor financing\" - where a company invests in or lends to its own customers so they can continue making purchases.\"Yes, the investment loans are unprecedented,\" Mr Altman told me on Monday. But, he added, \"it's also unprecedented for companies to be growing revenue this fast.\"OpenAI's revenue is growing quickly, but it has never turned a profit.And it is hardly a good sign that the people I've spoken to keep bringing up Nortel - the Canadian telecom equipment-maker that borrowed prolifically to help finance deals for their customers (and thereby artificially boost demand for their wares). For his part, Nvidia's Jensen Huang defended his deal with OpenAI on CNBC Monday, saying the firm isn't required to buy his company's tech with the money he invests.\"They can use it to do anything they like,\" Huang said. \"There's no exclusivities. Our primary goal is just really to support them and help them grow – and grow the ecosystem.\"Telltale signsMr Kaplan says he sees a couple of telltale signs the AI sector - and therefore the wider economy - could be in trouble.In frothy times, he says, companies announce major initiatives and product plans that they don't yet have the capital for.Meanwhile, retail investors clamour to get in on the start-up action.The surge in AMD stock this week could indicate investors are trying to get a piece of the ChatGPT wealth machine - and while all this is playing out, real physical infrastructure aimed at satisfying the seemingly insatiable hunger for more AI development is being built.\"We're creating a new man-made ecological disaster: enormous data centres in remote places like deserts, that will be rusting away and leaching bad things into the environment, with no one left to hold accountable because the builders and investors will be long gone,\" Mr Kaplan said.Getty ImagesOpenAI wants to secure $500bn to build a 10-gigawatt complex, under construction in Texas, by the end of this year.But even if we are in a bubble, the hope from Silicon Valley is investments being made now won't necessary go to waste.\"The thing that comforts me is that the internet was built on the ashes of the over-investment into the telecom infrastructure of yesterday,\" said Jeff Boudier, who builds products at the AI community hub Hugging Face.\"If there is overinvestment into infrastructure for AI workloads, there may be financial risks tied to it,\" he said. \"But it's going to enable lots of great new products and experiences including ones we're not thinking about today.\"There are plenty of believers in AI's potential to transform society.The question is whether the money to fund the ambitions of the foremost companies in the sector may be drying up.\"Nvidia looks like the last lender or investor,\" said Rihard Jarc, who founded the UncoverAlpha newsletter. \"Who else has the capacity right now to invest $100 billion in another company?\""

    "body": "3 October 2025Dr Oscar DukeDoctor and BBC Morning Live expert, LondonGetty ImagesChances are you know someone coughing and spluttering - hopefully not directly on you -  right now. There are lots of coughs and colds doing the rounds as autumn draws in.But why now, how do you know if it's more than just a cold and how can you avoid the worst.Medical doctor Dr Oscar Duke, who is also a regular TV presenter including on the BBC's Morning Live, shares his top tips.Does colder weather cause colds?Getty ImagesResearch on the extent to which cold weather impacts our immune systems remains unclear.But darker days mean we typically make a beeline for warm, cosy, indoor spaces.And this environment is perfect for viruses.It's also when young children get back together at school after the summer holidays.School and nursery can be like a petri dish with lots of viruses circulating and they may well bring these germs home with them.The same applies to freshers in university halls - where mixing together spreads germs, while heavy drinking and partying further weaken the immune system.Is it a cold, flu or Covid?ColdsSymptoms appear graduallyMostly affect nose and throatEarly sign - pressure in your earsChestier, mucus coughFluComes on suddenlyFeel wiped outFever, muscle aches, exhaustionNeed bed restDry coughCovidTypical flu symptomsLoss of taste of smellDiarrhoea or tummy upsetMany of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid, overlap.But there are some clues that might help you identify the exact culprit.If a cold's coming on, then it often does so gradually. It's going to affect your nose and the back of your throat, while some will get a tickling at the back of the mouth.Another early warning sign can be a build-up of pressure in the ear. If the virus spreads further, it can reach your lungs and cause a pesky cough.Mostly however, these symptoms don't stop us from carrying on as normal.The same can't be said for flu, which typically adds aches, fevers and muscle weakness into the mix. Flu doesn't mean you have to go to bed, but it might make you feel that way.Since the pandemic, Covid has complicated things further, with similar symptons to flu.But one key Covid-specific identifier can be a loss of smell or taste. Another, as new variants Stratus and Nimbus spike this winter, is a \"razor-sharp\" sore throat. Diarrhoea is also common.The recommendation is to stay home and rest and recover. However, if you have underlying conditions, experience breathlessness or find symptoms don't ease after three weeks, then you shouldn't hesitate to seek medical advice.Can I help make myself better? Getty ImagesOur bodies naturally fight viruses and infection, but we can also give it a helping hand with the right medication. Paracetamol: Provided you're okay to take it, this or ibuprofen is the first port of call. Both are really good for helping to bring the fever down and softening any pain that you might have. But remember that lots of cough and cold mixtures include traces of paracetamol, so make sure you're not accidentally taking too muchVitamin C:  This is often thought to help defend against colds. But there's not a huge amount of evidence for this. Unless you're deficient, focusing on a healthy, balanced diet is far more importantOther stories you may enjoyVitamin D: A top-up of vitamin D in colder months is recommended by the NHS, because let's face it, we don't usually get much sunlight at this time of year in the UKDecongestant spray: Sure, they feel great and provide instant relief, but using sprays too often can cause rebound congestion- when your nose becomes dependent and swells without a fix. I suggest using them for no more than four of five daysChicken soup: There's little evidence of the dish fighting viruses directly, but its heat can help warm the back of your throat and soothe some of those symptoms. It's also a good way to take on extra fluids, with hydration vital as you battle infection.What about vaccines? Getty ImagesIt's  crucial to take the free annual flu jab if you're offered it.Eligibility is staggered across the population to prioritise those most at risk.If you have small children who were two or three on 31 August this year, then they are entitled. Older children will be offered theirs at school.Find out more and book on the NHS website, or visit your GP.Additonal reporting by health reporter Smitha Mundasad Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world."

    "body": "The stats that say Haaland will run away with Golden BootImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Erling Haaland has enjoyed a highly prolific start to the seasonByChris CollinsonBBC football data analystWith nine goals in his first seven Premier League games, Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has started the season on fire.While it is not his best start to a campaign - he scored 11 goals in his first seven games in 2022-23 and 10 last season - it still puts him three goals ahead in the early running for this season's Premier League Golden Boot.The fact that none of his nine goals have been penalties makes it even more impressive.Of course, injury could definitively intervene in the destination of the Golden Boot,  but there are two reasons why Haaland is such a strong favourite for the award so early. First, the number of goals he has already scored - and, just as importantly, the number and quality of chances he is getting. And second, the slow start his usual rivals for the prize have made.A player's expected goals number (xG) signifies how many goals a Premier League player has historically scored from the number and quality of chances he has had.It is not a number randomly picked by statistics boffins, but by Premier League history.And if we look at players' xG in the Premier League so far this season from normal play, the Norway forward is getting so many more good opportunities to score than anyone else.Indeed, even if Haaland were no better at finishing chances than anyone else in the league, he would still have scored more than twice as many goals as everyone else.That is demonstrated by breaking down the number and quality of chances that players have had in the top flight so far.Haaland has taken 29 shots so far this season, 12 more than any other player.That is actually not that remarkable for him - he had actually taken more non-penalty shots at this point in the last two seasons (30 in 2023-24 and 34 in 2024-25).What is, however, unprecedented even for him is the quality of chances he has had this season. His shots have had a xG value of 0.27 on average.What that figure means is that players have historically converted the shots he has had at a rate of 27%. Of players to take at least 10 shots, only Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has had easier chances to score on average - thanks to a couple of tap-ins against West Ham and Brighton.Haaland's xG of 0.27 is much higher than the 0.17 xG per shot he had at the start of last season. In short, the chances he has had in 2025-26 have been notably easier to score from in a reorganised City team than those at the beginning of last season.Starting a season so strongly is, as mentioned above, not unusual for Haaland. After seven games last season he had scored 10 goals - four more than anyone else and six more than Mohamed Salah.But it was the Liverpool forward who won the Golden Boot with 29 goals, seven more than the Manchester City striker.In the new campaign, while Haaland has started in blistering form, Salah has scored half the number of goals and had half the chances (xG) than at this stage last season.In fact this has been the quietest start to a Premier League season the Egypt forward has made.It is not just Salah who has started slowly either. If we look at the top 11 scorers in the Premier League last season, Haaland has scored as many goals as the other 10 players put together so far.Whether because of injuries - Yoane Wissa, Cole Palmer and Jorgen Strand Larsen -  long-running transfer sagas in Alexander Isak's case or simply because their teams have struggled (Bryan Mbeumo, Chris Wood, Ollie Watkins and Matheus Cunha), Haaland's likely rivals in the race for the Golden Boot have not fired so far.While Haaland looks the clear favourite for the Premier League Golden Boot, what about the European Golden Shoe that is awarded to the player with the most goals in Europe's top-five leagues?That race is far more competitive at this early stage because Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe have also started in great form, with 11 and nine goals respectively.The fact Haaland has scored so many times and has the highest xG of the three without yet taking any penalties makes him the favourite.But since Kane and Mbappe are two of the best finishers in European football in terms of overperforming their xG, the race is certainly on."

    "body": "10 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesKing Charles's coat of arms will feature on the front of all new passports from December, the Home Office has said.Natural landscapes from all four UK nations will also feature inside the updated documents, including Ben Nevis, the Lake District, Three Cliffs Bay and the Giant's Causeway.It is the first full redesign of British passports in five years, when they changed from burgundy to dark blue following the UK's departure from the European Union.Passports featuring Queen Elizabeth II's coat of arms would remain valid until their expiry date, the government said.Passports have been issued in the King's name since 2023, with their pages referring to \"His Majesty\", but the late Queen's coat of arms has remained on the cover.The King's coat of arms features the rounded Tudor crown he chose as his royal cypher upon taking the throne in 2022.As part of the transition from one reign to another, images and insignia of the King have gradually been introduced - including on stamps, coins and banknotes - with an effort to use up existing stocks rather than have an abrupt change.By convention, the King himself does not have a passport because it is a document issued in his own name.PA MediaAll new passports will feature the above coat of arms from DecemberThe new passports will also feature updated security features, the Home Office said, including the latest anti-forgery technology - making them \"harder to forge or tamper with\".Migration and citizenship minister Mike Tapp said the redesign marked \"a new era in the history of the British passport\".\"It also demonstrates our commitment to outstanding public service - celebrating British heritage while ensuring our passports remain among the most secure and trusted in the world for years to come.\"The government advised people to check the validity of their passport and, if needed, apply to renew them in good time ahead of travelling.UK passports in their modern form, with a photo and signature, have been issued since 1915. The first security watermark was added in 1972 and machine-readable passports were introduced in 1988."

    "body": "The city full of tongue-in-cheek road signs2 days agoElliot Deadyin ChelmsfordLauren Carter/BBCThe latest sign has appeared since a double decker bus got stuck under a railway bridgeA council is urging whoever is putting up tongue-in-cheek signs in a city to stop the spoofs, saying they could \"mislead residents and cause confusion\".Several official-looking signs have popped up across Chelmsford over the past 18 months, with the latest poking fun at double decker bus drivers after one vehicle became wedged recently.A logo was also installed for the failed retailer Woolworths and another sign was put up suggesting the local council would provide snorkelling equipment to navigate a flooded underpass.Essex Highways asked for pranksters to stop.\"While we appreciate the imagination and good humour being shown by this creative person in Chelmsford, we do ask members of the public to not put up false signage as it can mislead residents and cause confusion\"Tracey FranklinA bus got stuck under a bridge next to Chelmsford railway station in AugustThe latest suspicious sign appeared on a bridge next to Chelmsford railway station after a bus got stuck under it in August.Another suggesting pigeons were banned from gathering outside Chelmsford Market appeared in recent weeks, as first reported by Essex Live.In January, a sign displaying width restrictions for boats passing through a railway viaduct was installed after pictures of a £1m yacht looking stuck - while moving slowly - went viral online.Lauren Carter/BBCA new sign in the city centre appears to be banning pigeons from landingRichard Smith/BBCThe unofficial sign on the railway viaduct has since been removedEagle-eyed shoppers spotted the Woolworths logo at the entrance to the Chelmer Village Retail Park in November 2024. The shopping centre said, despite wanting to see the former High Street favourite make a return, the sign was not legitimate.Earlier in 2024, Essex County Council stressed it did not provide swimming equipment after a sign suggesting it would hand out flippers, masks and snorkels appeared at an underpass near the city centre.Two months later, signs appeared stating rowing through another nearby underpass prone to flooding was prohibited.Elliot Deady/BBCThe Woolworths logo mysteriously appeared at the entrance to Chelmer Village Retail ParkMany of the signs have been removed, but some of the more recent installations remain.They appear to be authentic with similar design characteristics to genuine road signs.It is not known who is behind them, but city council leader Stephen Robinson suggested it could be \"someone having a gentle poke at the county council\".\"I wouldn't condone it but it seems to be a light-hearted criticism,\" the Liberal Democrat councillor said.More on this storyRelated internet links"

    "body": "11 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterBBCThe celebrities were shocked to discover Paloma Faith had been murdered - but for some it was all an actSpoiler warning: This article reveals details from The Celebrity TraitorsThe Traitors, at its heart, is a game of lying and deception.The celebrity edition of the hit BBC show began this week, and with it a murdering spree. For the first, it was Alan Carr in the kitchen with the poisoned lily.Just as in the regular series, we find a bunch of people attempting to find out who is lying and who is telling the truth, while faced with the enormous uncertainty of being \"killed\" off.On this occasion, the victim was singer Paloma Faith. She was unimpressed to be bumped off by Carr, who is her friend - or so she thought.So why have so many viewers taken the show to their hearts, and what does it say about our human nature?For Richard Wiseman, professor of the public understanding of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, such treachery \"feels a bit like everyday life\".\"You're trying to figure out which of your friends and partners and colleagues may not be entirely straight with you,\" he tells BBC News.Deception, he says, \"is in our DNA\" as something we do from around the age of three. \"As soon as children master language, they start lying,\" adds Prof Wiseman.\"If we were radically honest with one another all the time, then we'd probably break apart as a society fairly rapidly. So on one level, deception holds us together.\"The problem, he adds, is that it can also be used in an \"exploitative way\", as anyone who tuned in this week to find current Celebrity Traitors Alan Carr, Cat Burns and Jonathan Ross scheming so splendlidly will testify.\"It absolutely fascinates us... you've got that microcosm, you can see all of that being played out in a rather fun way.\"The hardest thing with lie detecting is knowing how people behave normally, according to Prof Wiseman, who has written about the psychology of magic and illusion, deception, luck and self-development.\"What we're quite good at is, when it's friends and partners, we know their truthful behaviour,\" he says. \"And you're looking for people departing from that.\"For example, when TV presenter Kate Garraway stood accused of being a potential traitor for her excessively theatrical reactions, she defended herself by explaining she was always \"a ham\".\"Now, you have to know her to know how she behaves normally to know whether this is deceptive or not.\"Prof Wiseman thinks the faithful stars are going wrong by so far basing their assumptions on what people do and say, when \"the best signals are what people don't say and don't do\".\"Liars tend to be pretty quiet,\" he says, noting the difficulties of that with \"a bunch of celebrities\" who will be \"used to being centre of attention\".Singer Burns, one of the traitors, told viewers she planned to \"lay low\" and go \"under the radar\", and it seems to be working so far.Good liars also tend to be intelligent, Wiseman says, citing salespeople, politicians and - ahem - performers among those who will be \"pretty high self-monitors\".\"Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross are very used to interviewing people,\" he says. \"And used to interviewees who will be somewhat elusive.\"Host Claudia Winkleman oversaw the celebrities as they dug their own graves in episode oneSo do actors and performers like those on this show make better liars than previous contestants?Not according to one of the current faithful, actor and presenter Stephen Fry, who told the Radio Times: \"Actors are terrible liars! It's not an actor's job to lie. It's an actor's job to tell the truth.\"But was he telling the truth or lying?Jake Brown, joint winner from series three, told BBC Breakfast he thinks professional performers \"know how to deceive, they know how to be someone else\".Series three finalist Alexander Dragonetti tells BBC News that anyone hoping to rely on their acting skills to win will have to be \"incredibly consistent\" and do it \"perfectly day after day\".\"If anyone sees even a small chink in your armour, they'll think you're playing a game and they'll get rid of you,\" he says.\"So if you do act, this is going to be the test of your life. You're going to have to do it perfectly day after day.\"And the days are long, the pressure is huge, and holding up that kind of act for any period I think is going to be incredibly hard.\"'The illusion of co-operation' On the latest episode, beloved veteran actress Celia Imrie was seen telling her fellow participants: \"People think I'm nice, but I'm not.\"For psychologist Susan Young, the celebrity edition of the show adds an extra level of deception and intrigue due to the professional \"impression management\" of pre-existing personas.Viewers \"project pre-existing beliefs\" on to the stars because \"these are people who we feel we know\", she tells us. But in reality we \"can't tell where the performance ends and where it begins\".As \"voyeurs of morality\", she adds, \"we can't wait for the nice person to do something unexpectedly\".The group dynamic is what interests Young most because what lies beneath is an inherent \"double bind\". \"Everyone must lie\", she says, because \"to be honest is dangerous\"; and yet \"lying corrodes the team\", which is much-needed to complete tasks.\"What the show does here, it exposes the illusion of co-operation and that's in so many systems. It's in our workplaces, it's in politics, it's in friendships under stress,\" she says.\"At the end of the day, given certain circumstances and under certain pressures, altruism will thin and self-interest surfaces.\"She adds: \"It's almost like a social experiment, it's mirroring how quickly loyalty will collapse when incentives change.\"Caroline Frost, TV editor of the Radio Times, reckons The Celebrity Traitors is on course to be \"one of the biggest shows of the year\".Two years ago, she recalls, she attended an industry seminar where producers said they had resisted the urge to include celebrities in the original show because they thought it was more interesting to select people who did not have public reputations to keep intact.But that was then, and this is now.The great paradox of a new celebrity version, she smiles, is that none of their careers and reputations \"count for anything come nightfall\".\"The further they get into the game, the more of the celebrity trappings get left behind and the less important their fame becomes, which means it really doesn't matter that they're celebrities at all.\"Frost thinks it was an \"incredibly ingenious decision\" to make Carr a traitor \"because he's giggly and extrovert and doesn't seem to be able to ever filter what he says or keep a secret\".\"Making him a traitor has really upped the stakes.\"She feels Carr's repuatation as a bubbly, chatty man has been \"weaponised\" to enable him to get away with murdering his mate in plain sight.He did seem a bit cut up about it afterwards, mind you, when he met up again with his fellow traitors.But as Ross reminded him: \"You're not a bad person. You're a good traitor.\"The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer.Additional reporting by Chris Gibson."

    "body": "The UK is \"ready to progress\" to using the full value of frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's war effort, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said.In a statement, the leaders of the UK, France and Germany said the joint action would \"increase pressure\" on Russian President Vladimir Putin and \"bring Russia to the negotiation table\". It added the move would be taken \"in close cooperation\" with the US.UK sanctions have frozen more than £25bn of Russian assets since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But until now, funds sent to Ukraine using Russian assets had only been taken from profits and interest accrued on them. Sir Keir told Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky that the UK, France and Germany were \"united in wanting to drive progress towards using the full value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to end the war\".He added that more sanctions \"in the coming days and weeks\" would add further pressure on Moscow. The announcement comes after European leaders met in Copenhagen last week to discuss using frozen Russian assets for a €140bn ($162bn; £121bn) loan to Ukraine.Last month, US President Donald Trump called on G7 allies to seize \"or otherwise use\" frozen Russian assets, according to the Financial Times.The value of frozen Russian assets in the EU is estimated to be almost €211bn (£181bn).Russia launched extensive missile and drone strikes across Ukraine on Friday, causing power cuts in large parts of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and eight other regions.Two people were killed and at least 20 people were injured in the attack, Ukrainian officials said.In a post on X following the attack, Zelensky wrote that the \"cynical and calculated attack\" targeted civilian and energy infrastructure.\"What's needed is not empty words but decisive action - from the United States, Europe and the G7 - in delivering air defence systems and enforcing sanctions,\" he wrote.\"Every sanction decision weakens Russia's war machine,\" Zelensky wrote, in a separate post.Also on Friday, Zelensky told the BBC he would urge Sir Keir to join the PURL programme, under which Nato countries buy weapons from the US to give to Ukraine.While praising the UK's strong support for Kyiv, he said it should send a clear signal that it would take part in the system, as well as impose more sanctions on Russia."

    "body": "21 hours agoBBCA ceasefire deal has taken effect in Gaza that should see Hamas release all the 48 Israeli and foreign hostages it is still holding after two years of war, 20 of whom are assumed to be alive.All but one were among the 251 people abducted during the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 67,000 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Hostages who are thought to be aliveAriel Cunio, 28, was abducted in the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October. Ariel's brother Eitan, who escaped the Hamas-led gunmen, said the last message from Ariel said: \"We are in a horror movie.\" Ariel's partner, Arbel Yehud, was freed in January 2025 under a deal that saw Hamas hand over 25 living and eight dead hostages during a two-month ceasefire.David Cunio, 35, another of Ariel's brothers, was also kidnapped from Nir Oz. David's wife Sharon Aloni Cunio and their then-three-year-old twin daughters Ema and Yuly were among the 105 hostages released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023. Sharon's sister Danielle Aloni and her daughter Emilia were also freed. In February 2025, David's family said released hostages had told them that had recently seen him alive.Gali and Ziv Berman, 28-year-old twin brothers, were abducted from Kibbutz Kfar Aza with their neighbour, Emily Damari. Ziv was held with Emily for 40 days before they were separated. She was released in January 2025 during the last ceasefire. Gali and Ziv's family said they had been informed by other hostages released in early 2025 that they were still alive. The Hostages and Missing Families ForumTwins Gali and Ziv Berman were taken hostage along with their British-Israeli neighbour Emily Damari, who has since been released Matan Angrest, a 22-year-old Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier, was in a tank that was attacked near the Gaza perimeter fence on 7 October.

Earlier this year, his family said they had been told by released hostages that he was suffering from chronic asthma, untreated burns and infections.Matan Zangauker, 25, was taken with his partner Ilana Gritzewsky from Nir Oz. Ilana was released during the November 2023 ceasefire. In December 2024, Hamas released a video showing Matan in captivity. He said he and his fellow hostages were suffering from skin ailments, shortages of food, water and medicine.Eitan Horn, 38, an Israeli-Argentine dual national, was kidnapped along with his elder brother Yair from Nir Oz. Yair was freed in February 2025 during the last ceasefire. Hamas released a video at the time showing Eitan and Yair hugging and breaking down in tears ahead of the latter's release. \"Every day we imagined what we'd do if we were freed,\" Yair recalled recently.Nimrod Cohen, 21, was serving as an IDF soldier when his tank was attacked by Hamas at Nahal Oz. In February 2025, his family were told by one of the released hostages that he was still alive in captivity but in poor physical and mental shape. After the new ceasefire was agreed, his mother Viki posted on social media: \"My child, you are coming home.\"Omri Miran, 48, was abducted from his home in Nahal Oz. His wife, Lishay, said she last saw him being driven away in his own car. She and their two young daughters, Roni and Alma, were not taken with him. In April 2025, Hamas released a video showing Omri marking his 48th birthday. In response: Lishay said: \"I always said and I always knew, Omri is a survivor.\"The Hostages and Missing Families ForumHamas published a video earlier this year purporting to show Omri Miran aliveDozens of people were taken hostage during the attack by Hamas gunmen on the Nova music festival. Among those believed to be still alive in captivity are:Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 24, attended the festival with his brother, Gal, who said the last time they saw each other was just before Hamas launched its first barrage of rockets into Israel at the start of the attack. Gal evaded the gunmen on the ground, but Guy was kidnapped. Last month, Hamas released a video showing Guy and another hostage, Alon Ohel, being driven around Gaza City in late August as the Israeli military prepared to launch an offensive there.Alon Ohel, 24, has Israeli, German and Serbian citizenship. Hamas footage showed him being taken away as a hostage from the Nova festival. Alon was not seen in another video until August 2025, when he was filmed being driven around Gaza City with Guy Gilboa-Dalal. Last month, Alon's family approved the publication of a still from a new video which they said showed he had gone blind in one eye.Yosef-Chaim Ohana, 25, had been at the festival with a friend, who said they had remained to help people escape the gunfire before running themselves. In May 2025, Hamas published a video showing Yosef and another hostage, Elkana Bohbot. Yosef is seen sitting beside Elkana, who is lying on the ground. An intravenous drip is hooked up to the wall next to Elkana.The Hostages and Missing Families ForumYosef-Chaim Ohana was captured while trying to help others flee Hamas gunmenElkana Bohbot, 36, was working at the festival when he was abducted. \"In our last conversation on the morning of the massacre at 07:00, I told him, 'It's not just missiles, come home,' and he promised he would return,\" his wife Rikva said in March 2025. The previous month, Israeli media cited a released hostage as saying Elkana, who has asthma, was being held in inhumane conditions and had developed a severe skin disease.Avinatan Or, 32, was kidnapped at the festival along with his girlfriend, Noa Argamani, but they were immediately separated. Noa and three other hostages were rescued in an Israeli military operation in central Gaza in June 2024. In March 2025, Avinatan's family said they had received a sign that he was still alive. His British-Israeli mother, Ditza, has said she just wants to put her ear to his chest and hear his heartbeat again.Eitan Mor, 25, was working as a security guard at the festival. His father Mor said he saved dozens of people before being kidnapped by Hamas gunmen. In February 2025, Eitan's family said they had received a sign of life from him. Three months later, they said a released hostage who spent time with him in a tunnel had told them how he had acted as a \"spokesman to the captors\" and \"lifted everyone's spirits\".Maxim Herkin, 37, is an Israel-Russian dual national who was invited to the festival at the last moment. His two friends were among the 378 people killed in the attack. In April 2025, Maxim appeared in a Hamas video along with Bar Kupershtein - the first signs of life from either man since they were taken hostage. The following month, Maxim was seen alone in another video and appeared to be bandaged up. Hamas said was the result of an Israeli air strike.The Hostages and Missing Families ForumMaxim Herkin is one of two dual nationals believed to still be alive in Hamas captivity Bar Kupershtein, 23, was working at the festival and stayed behind during the attack to help treat casualties. He told his grandmother that he would head home as soon as they were finished. But he was later identified him in a video of hostages. They heard no further information about him until April 2025, when he was seen in a video with Maxim Herkin.Segev Kalfon, 27, was running away from the festival with a friend when he was taken hostage by Hamas gunmen. Two months later, the Israeli military found a video of the abduction. In February 2025, released hostage Ohad Ben Ami told Segev's father, Kobi, that they had been held captive with four other men in a tunnel in \"terrible conditions\".Evyatar David, 24, was at the festival and on the morning of the attacks. He texted the family to say \"they are bombarding the party\". His family say they later received a text from an unknown number, containing video footage of Evyatar handcuffed on the floor of a dark room. In August 2025, Hamas published a video of an emaciated and weak Evyatar in a tunnel. The footage caused outrage in Israel and deep concern among his family. \"He's a human skeleton. He was being starved to the point where he can be dead at any moment,\" said his brother Ilay.Rom Braslabski, 21, was working on security for the festival. According to an account published by Hostages and Missing Families Forum, he was trying to rescue an injured person in the attack when he was caught in a volley of fire. In August 2025, Palestinian Islamic Jihad published a video of Rom, in which he is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \"is at death's door\". Medical experts said he was suffering from \"deliberate, prolonged, and systematic starvation\".Hostages whose conditions are unknownTamir Nimrodi, 20, was an education officer in the IDF at the Erez Crossing on 7 October.

    "body": "15 hours agoJessica Rawnsley andVanessa BuschschluterGetty ImagesVenezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.Machado, 58, was hailed by the Nobel Committee as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\". She has campaigned against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro Moros, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many as illegitimate.\"This immense recognition of the struggle of all Venezuelans is an impetus to conclude our task: to conquer Freedom,\" Machado said in a statement.Among those who missed out was US President Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his desire to get the prestigious award, with public overtures on the seven wars he claims to have ended.Nominations for the award closed in January. A White House official responded by saying the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\" .CBS News - the BBC's US partner - understands Trump called Machado to congratulate her, saying she deserves the award.Announcing the recipient of the prize at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo on Friday, the committee warned that \"democracy is in retreat\" across the world.Machado - who has been forced to live in hiding for much of the past year - was recognised for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\", Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said.She has been a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided... in a brutal authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis\", he added.\"Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.\"'I have no words': How María Corina Machado received Nobel newsReacting to the Nobel Committee announcement, Machado said: \"We are on the threshold of victory and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve Freedom and democracy.\"Venezuela will be free!\"Machado earlier expressed shock in response to the award, saying in a separate video message that it was the \"achievement of a whole society\".\"I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve this,\" she added.Machado - who has long been one of the most respected voices in Venezuela's opposition - was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office. The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González.When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest.González wrote on social media that the prize was \"well-deserved recognition for the long struggle of a woman and of an entire people for our freedom and democracy\".Frydnes was critical of Venezuela's leadership during a news conference after the prize was announced, saying the committee saw the same trends emerging around the world.\"[The] rule of law abused by those in control, free media silenced, critics imprisoned and societies pushed towards authoritarian rule and militarisation,\" he said.He added that he hoped Machado would be able to attend the award ceremony in Oslo in December but acknowledged the serious security situation.There were 338 candidates nominated for this year's peace prize, according to the Nobel Committee - though the names of the nominees will not be revealed for 50 years, as per tradition.Trump has repeatedly said that he deserves the award, on one occasion declaring that \"everyone says I should get it\".A number of world leaders backed his bid, including Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, who publicly revealed a nomination letter while visiting the White House, as well as the governments of Pakistan and Azerbaijan - despite nominations closing in January, just as Trump's second term began.Asked whether pressure from the US president and some in the international community to award Trump the prize had impacted the committee's deliberations, Frydnes said there had been many campaigns and \"media tension\" in the \"long history\" of the Nobel Peace Prize.\"We base our decision only on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel,\" he said.Reacting to Friday's announcement, the White House's communications director Steven Cheung wrote in a post on X that the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\".\"President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives.\"He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will,\" Cheung added.The Nobel Prize, which is split into six categories, celebrates the work of people or organisations that have contributed \"the greatest benefit to humankind\".Frydnes said that Machado met \"all the criteria\" laid out by Nobel for the prize, and \"embodies hope for the future\".More on this story"

    "body": "Hull KR & Wigan set for repeat of 2024 Grand FinalImage source, SWPixImage caption, Wigan Warriors narrowly beat Hull KR in last year's Super League Grand Final to seal a historic quadrupleByJay FreemanBBC Sport EnglandTwo familiar foes will contest the showpiece event of the Super League season, but this year it could be a very different tale.Wigan Warriors, the 2024 victors, face Hull KR in Saturday's Grand Final for the second time in as many years.Just 12 months ago, the Cherry and Whites sealed victory in a nervy final under the lights at Old Trafford, capping off a historic quadruple.In 2025 it is the Robins who stand on the precipice of sporting greatness as they target a trio of trophies of their own.With so much at stake, BBC Sport takes a look at how both are shaping up before one of the biggest fixtures the sport has seen in the modern era.Media caption, We can make a difference to so many people's lives - MinchellaSuper League Grand Final: Hull KR v WiganSaturday, 11 OctoberListen to the Super League Grand Final on BBC Radio 5 Live on Saturday, 11 October with build up throughout from 12:00 BST, and watch highlights on BBC Two on Sunday, 12 October at 13:00 BSTHull KR 'have to get job done'It is a story that has been told time and again over the past couple of years, if for no other reason than to highlight just how much of an achievement it is for Hull KR to be tussling at the top.Just nine years ago, they lost their Super League spot in agonising fashion having initially led Salford Red Devils in the 2016 Million Pound Game before losing on golden point and dropping into the Championship as a result.Less than a decade later, they look set to complete one of the most impressive comebacks in sport, let alone rugby league, has ever seen and talismanic half-back Mikey Lewis summed it up best in his pre-match media commitments.\"We've built something at the club so we've got to believe each other and get this job done,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\"That's something that will fuel us on Saturday.\"Their record this season makes for remarkable reading having won the Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield - not bad for a club which finished bottom of the pile in Super League just five years ago.What makes this all the more impressive is the fact that Hull KR have been so undeterred by Wigan's quadruple last season that they've now threatened to win a treble themselves.\"When I first came to the club we were in a relegation battle and there wasn't much in it, either,\" forward Dean Hadley, who joined in 2019, added.\"To say five or six years on you've played in back-to-back Grand Finals, you've won a Challenge Cup and League Leaders, it's a totally different place.\"It's been a process, it's taken time. It's year on year making improvements. Not just on the field but off the field as well. You can feel it when you're at the club. It's a really good club and environment to be at. Players like myself and others have thrived in that.\"Hull KR set up their place in Saturday's final off the back of beating St Helens in the semi-final and Saturday will see some departures for the east Hull club.With the youthful but formidable Lewis, accompanied by the wisdom and stewardship of senior figures like Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and Micky McIlorum, Hull KR have assembled one of the most forbidding sides of the modern era.Yet the club, and sport, will wave goodbye to the veteran pair after Saturday's game as they retire.For Lewis, Saturday's Grand Final is not just an opportunity to win silverware, write themselves into the record books and tick another box - it is a chance to pay respect to two of the sport's greats in style.\"To put them into retirement having won all three trophies in the first year of being at the club would be a massive achievement for them,\" he added.\"It's something we'd be really proud of. The leadership and the accountability and the honesty they've brought to this team this year has been massive.\"To get the job done for each other, for the east side of Hull, the board, the chairman, Neil, for our families, we all sacrifice so much and to lift that trophy would be huge for everybody.\"Media caption, Highlights: Wigan complete clean sweep with Grand Final victoryWigan's chance to win three in a rowFor Wigan Warriors, they can regain some glory having missed out on silverware so far in 2025, not least because of how impressive Saturday's opponents have been.The Cherry and Whites have their own record to chase. Having reached a 14th Grand Final, they are 80 minutes away from winning three in a row for the first time in their history.In Luke Thompson, they have the perfect man to guide them to glory at Old Trafford, with the front rower never losing in a Grand Final in four appearances - twice with St Helens and twice with Wigan.\"I see a lot of similarities. I see a lot of commitment and professionalism. The hunger,\" Thompson told BBC Radio Manchester about the current Wigan set up compared to his time with Saints.\"They're slightly different teams. I think we play a bit differently but I think the quality that underpins both teams, you can definitely see some similarities.\"One man who could be in the mix for the Cherry and Whites is Brad O'Neill, who has his own motivation to take to the field on Saturday.The Wigan hooker missed out last year with a serious knee injury and had conflicting emotions having been unable to play his part in their quadruple glory.\"It was definitely a proud moment for myself watching on and seeing the team do something special that year,\" he said.\"It was a bittersweet feeling. It would have meant so much last year to play in it but the fact that we've got here now, I'm so grateful, and I definitely won't be taking it for granted come Saturday night.\"Media caption, 'We get to make a lot of people proud, and that's what drives us' - PeetWigan captain Liam Farrell is no stranger to a Super League Grand Final and knows what it takes to win on the big occasion.Whereas some players would be unnerved by the big occasion Farrell, in contrast, thrives off his nerves.\"If I played one game for Wigan, never mind the Grand Final, I'd have been very happy. But to be in the position I'm in now, leading my team out for a third year in a row, it's a very special feeling,\" Farrell told BBC Radio Manchester.\"I can't really put into words how special it is, but it's one I'm excited about and to create some more memories with the special group we've got.\"It calms me down, the fact that I do still get nervous. It makes me realise that I still care about what I do. I want us to win, I don't want to lose.\"The club wants success and the town wants success. I think that's where the nerves come from and I like the fact that I do get them.\"Farrell, a Wigan veteran, might well be in the twilight of his career at 35 but he still believes he has the fight in him to continue and will not hang up his boots regardless of the result on Saturday.\"If you're able to win one and go out like that, it'd be a nice way to go out, but I still think I've got a little bit more to give and the club wanted me to still stay on so I'm very happy about that,\" he added.\"I'd say psychologically I'm still enjoying it as well, that's probably the main thing for me, which is a big aspect and I think as long as I'm doing that and happy about what I'm doing then I'll still go around.\""

    "body": "6 hours agoMark SavageMusic CorrespondentBBCWolf Alice at the BBC in August 2025 (left-right): Joff Oddie, Theo Ellis, Joel Amey and Ellie RowsellWolf Alice are in a class of their own when it comes to the Mercury Prize.Last month, they received their fourth consecutive nomination for the coveted music award thanks to their new album, The Clearing.That's something no-one else has ever achieved. Not Arctic Monkeys, not Radiohead, not Pulp. What's more, they've done it with their first four albums.\"For some reason, it makes me feel really anxious,\" admits singer Ellie Rowsell, speaking to the BBC from Nashville, where the band are in final rehearsals for their world tour.She's speaking from experience. When Wolf Alice won the Mercury Prize for their second album, Visions of a Life, in 2018, Ellie struggled to gain her composure at the podium.\"I'm so nervous,\" she exclaimed, her hands shaking, before bandmate Theo Ellis stepped in to finish the speech.To fans, Rowsell's jitters might have seemed strange. On stage, the singer is normally a fireball of intensity, screaming punky anthems like Yuk Foo and commanding the spotlight with magnetic charisma.But their more intimate songs portray her as an habitual outsider who doubts her own abilities and motivations.On Thorns, the pensive opening song of The Clearing, she even berates herself for \"making a song and dance\" about the break-up that inspired Wolf Alice's previous album, Blue Weekend.\"I don't know if I'm shy. I think I'm socially inept,\" she recently told Canadian DJ Tara Sloane. \"I'm very confident in some things, but I'm not the loudest person in the room.\"The band won the Mercury Prize in 2018, beating other shortlisted artists including Arctic Monkeys, Noel Gallagher and Lily AllenHer nerves about attending another awards show is understandable, then. But Rowsell is also \"grateful and happy\" to be included on the Mercury shortlist again. They will find out if they have won when the ceremony takes place on Thursday.\"We take albums pretty seriously,\" says guitarist Joff Oddie, speaking from his home in London (he's sitting out the US tour because his wife's about to give birth to their first child).\"In our world, a good album is one of the highest forms of art. People can do good songs, or a great live performance, and those are all great signposts. But, for me, a really great album is an incredible feat... if you can pull it off.\"That's why the band have signed up as ambassadors for National Album Day, which takes place on Saturday, 18 October, with special events around the UK and limited edition vinyl re-releases of classic records by Liam Gallagher, Patti Smith and Iggy Pop.Asked to name their favourite albums, however, and Wolf Alice are evasive.\"I don't know what my absolute top three would be,\" says Rowsell. \"But if I can re-listen to an album top to bottom over and over again, that's a telltale sign - because it's hard to keep your attention.\"PA MediaThe band's third album, 2021's Blue Weekend, saw them rise to festival headliner statusThe singer - who reveals Pink's Missundaztood was the first album she owned - eventually settles on The Streets' A Grand Don't Come For Free as an example of \"a perfect album\".\"I feel like it's one of those albums where, even if it's not to your taste, you can actually appreciate the artistry,\" she says.\"I'm not really that into concept albums, but it's got an amazing story from beginning to end - and it never compromises the songs,\" agrees Oddie.The guitarist also chooses Brian Eno's ambient classic Music For Airports as one of his Desert Island Albums.\"I've spent most of my adult life in transit, and it's a beautiful record for zoning out the outside world,\" he says.Shape shiftersThey collectively agree that 1966's The Velvet Underground & Nico is a must-have for any serious music fan.\"It's one of the most important alternative records of all time,\" says Oddie. \"It's got incredible songwriting, the songs stand up on their own, but they're cloaked in really avant-garde sounds and techniques.\"As a guitarist in an indie band, if you can write incredible songs and play them interestingly, then you're part of that lineage.\"The variety of their tastes - Rowsell also selects the mutant folk of Lankum's 2023 album False Lankum - is the key to Wolf Alice's shape-shifting sound.Getty ImagesAfter forming as folk duo in 2010, Wolf Alice became one of the UK's biggest indie bandsThey started out as a folk duo in 2010 but quickly expanded to a quartet, adopting an alt-rock style characterised by Oddie's textured guitar work, the rhythmic interplay between bassist Ellis and drummer Joel Amey, and Rowsell's cutting lyricism.In the early stages, Oddie says, they were \"just muddling through\".\"We had no idea, from a technical perspective, of what we were doing.\"We worked with some brilliant people that were, in hindsight, very, very patient with us.\"It was probably a nightmare to make a record [with us] at that time because we had an idea of what we wanted to sound like, but we didn't know how things worked.\"Each album marked a progression. Their 2015 debut My Love Is Cool wrapped ethereal indie anthems in barbed-wire guitar riffs; 2017's Visions Of A Life produced their biggest hit, the delirious synth-driven Don't Delete The Kisses, as well as winning the Mercury; and 2021's Blue Weekend added a sweeping, bruised grandeur to their sound.The Clearing, which topped the UK album chart in August, marks their boldest evolution yet - embracing the nostalgic sounds of 1970s FM pop radio, earning comparisons to The Carpenters, Fleetwood Mac and Steely Dan.Rachel Fleminger Hudson / RCA RecordsWolf Alice are embracing the iconography of 1970s rock bands on their new album\"Maybe in hindsight it was a bit of a stylistic turn,\" says Rowsell. \"But it didn't feel too drastic at the time. It just reflected what we were listening to.\"Their goal was to make a record that felt good to play live, full of what Oddie calls \"more song-y songs\" like the Blue Weekend track Delicious Things – which has become an unexpected highlight of their live shows.\"That song was a departure from what we'd done before [and] it didn't feel like it was one people would enjoy live,\" says Rowsell.\"But the audience were just as upbeat and excited as when we play one of our rock songs.\"So I was like, 'OK, it's not just fast, loud, heavy music that gets a crowd going'. And that was really exciting.\"\"It's a confidence thing,\" adds Oddie. \"Sometimes you feel like you have to make yourself heard by being as loud and abrasive as you can be.\"We were going, 'Oh, we can connect with the audience in a way that's just as impactful, but different'.\"The band are currently in the middle of a world tour that hits the UK in NovemberRecorded in Los Angeles with A-list producer Greg Kurstin (Adele, Beyoncé, Foo Fighters), the album is unapologetically big; brimming with harmonies and hooks and ambition and heart.But the soft rock reinvention caught some critics off guard. While reviews were largely positive, The Quietus recoiled at the lack of heavy guitar anthems in a scathing screed that employed descriptors like \"unintrusive\", \"clunking\" and \"by-numbers detritus\".\"Wolf Alice had the juice. On The Clearing, that juice has abandoned them,\" agreed Soundsphere's Callie Petch.Admittedly, it takes a minute to adjust - but The Clearing is one of those records that reveals new depths and complexity with every listen. The songs might not have the tinnitus-inducing qualities of old favourites like Fluffy or Play The Greatest Hits, but there's a newfound confidence and playfulness amid the calm.That's why, on the album's artwork, Wolf Alice lean into the iconography of 70s rock.Ellis poses in a leather jacket studded with the words Wolf Alice. Rowsell stands in a spotlight, head thrust back as she sings with eyes-screwed-shut intensity.RCA RecordsThe artwork marks the first time the band have taken full portraits for one of their album covers\"On our first two albums, the artwork was just found images,\" says Rowsell. \"And if you can stumble across a photo that represents the music and the lyrics, it's really romantic and amazing.\"For this record, however, Wolf Alice called in photographer Rachel Fleminger Hudson – who spent six months trawling through \"thousands and thousands\" of archive images and interviews to create an aesthetic that reflected the band's inspirations and ambitions.\"She was very academic in how she approached it,\" says Oddie. \"There was a lot of leather. A lot.\"It all adds up to a declaration of intent.A criticism/compliment that's often been levelled at Wolf Alice is that they're impossible to pin down. Their influences are too broad. Their ideas are too disparate.But The Clearing has a clarity and purpose that suggests they're finally OK with the idea of being a chart-topping, festival-headlining \"big band\".\"Oh, I don't know if we're owning being a big band,\" Oddie demurs. \"I don't think we'd say that. But we are owning being a band, full stop. \"We're leaning into the lore.\""

    "body": "The US has finalised an agreement that will allow Qatar to build an air force facility in Idaho, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced.He said the facility - where pilots from the Gulf state would be trained to fly F-15 fighter jets - would be established at the Mountain Home Airbase in the north-western US state.\"It's just another example of our partnership,\" Hegseth said during a meeting with his Qatari counterpart, Saoud bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, at the Pentagon on Friday.Hegseth also praised Qatar for playing a \"substantial role\" in efforts led by President Donald Trump to secure a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal.Qatar - along with Egypt and Turkey - has been an active mediator during months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas.On Friday, Hegseth said he was \"proud that today we're signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force Facility at the Mountain Home Airbase in Idaho\".\"The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership.\"You can count on us,\" Hegseth told al-Thani.The Pentagon chief did not say how many Qatari F-15s would be based at the Idaho facility, and when it would become operational.Last month, President Trump signed an executive order pledging to use all measures - including the US military - to defend Qatar.The order amounts to an extraordinary security pact between America and a key Arab ally, almost mirroring aspects of a Nato alliance.The move came after Israeli air strikes targeted Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital Doha on 9 September, leaving several lower-level members of the Palestinian group dead, along with a Qatari security official.Qatar hosts Washington's biggest military base in the Middle East - the al-Udeid.The base - home to the US military's headquarters for all air operations in the region - was attacked earlier this by Iran in retaliation for American strikes against its nuclear sites."

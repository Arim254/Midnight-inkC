    "body": "The World Cup draw is here - this is how it will workImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Washington DC has been chosen for the World Cup draw, though the city will not host any matchesByFootball issues correspondentUpdated 4 hours agoPots, quadrants, confederation constraints, group position grids... the 2026 World Cup finals draw on Friday is not going to be a straightforward affair.  There's a lot to unpack so we're going to explain it as simply as we can.Luckily, Fifa will have a computer to do most of the heavy lifting and make sure everything runs smoothly. Though as Uefa found out in 2021, sometimes technology does go wrong. Let's hope there will be no gremlins in Washington once the draw ceremony kicks off.Here is how it will work, what to expect and a few key things to look out for. When will draw start and how long will it take?Media caption, Dan Roan reports from Washington before the 2026 World Cup drawThe ceremony gets started at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time) on 5 December, but there's going to be far more to this glitzy event than simply pulling the countries out of a hat. Supermodel Heidi Klum, comedian Kevin Hart and actor and producer Danny Ramirez will co-host.Before the draw there will be live music performances from Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger, while Fifa president Gianni Infantino and US President Donald Trump are both expected to make speeches.Then it is on to video clips of the finalists, introductions and the draw itself.Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand will conduct the draw.The 47-year-old will be joined by broadcaster Samantha Johnson and a host of sporting greats, including Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Aaron Judge and Shaquille O'Neal.Once the draw has been completed, the Village People will perform YMCA to bring the curtain down, with the entire ceremony expected to last about 90 minutes.How has Fifa seeded the draw?The 48 teams have been placed into four pots of 12 based primarily on Fifa world rankings.The exceptions are the three hosts who are automatically in pot one, and the teams who will qualify through the six play-off paths, who go into pot four.Given some of the teams involved in the four European play-off paths, they have the potential to create some strong groups.Italy and Denmark would have been in pot two because of their world rankings had they qualified directly, while Wales would have been in pot three.The six play-off paths are:Uefa Play-off A: Italy, Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern IrelandUefa Play-off B: Ukraine, Poland, Albania, SwedenUefa Play-off C: Turkey, Slovakia, Kosovo, RomaniaUefa Play-off D: Denmark, Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland, North MacedoniaFifa Play-off 1: DR Congo, Jamaica, New CaledoniaFifa Play-off 2: Iraq, Bolivia, SurinameHow will the draw work?The 12 groups will include one team from each of the four pots.Fifa will start by drawing the teams from pot one.Co-hosts Mexico (A1), Canada (B1) and the United States (D1) will have coloured balls with their flags on to denote their special status. Their group positions are pre-determined to make sure they play all their games in their own countries.The draw will then continue with pots two, three and four in order.What is this about the top four teams being kept apart?Fifa's big idea is to set up the best chance of blockbuster ties in the latter stages of the World Cup. So for the first time it is giving special seeding status to the top four in the world rankings - Spain, Argentina, France and England.Crucially, this status will only apply if the countries win their groups. Let's take a look at how it will work, using England as our example.Each of the four countries will be drawn into a group in a different coloured quadrant of the bracket, as shown in the image below. Spain (ranked 1) and Argentina (2) must be in opposite halves and cannot meet until the final, likewise France (3) and England (4). France and England would not be able to meet either Spain or Argentina until the semi-finals. Let's say that France come out first and go into Group C, placing them into the green quadrant on the right side of the draw. That means England can only go into the blue or turquoise quadrants on the left side, groups E, F, G, H or I.If Argentina then drop into the blue quadrant, that further restricts England only to turquoise - groups G or H.    Are the four seeds being given an easy ride? Not necessarily.Each quadrant has a potential last-16 tie between two group winners. For instance, the blue quadrant has a meeting of the winners of Group E and Group I. That means a seeded team could meet another pot one side, let's say perhaps Brazil.Being drawn into groups C, F, H or J looks potentially more favourable, as it is not possible to play another group winner until the quarter-finals.If one of the four seeded teams finishes as group runners-up, then they lose the ranking privilege. So if England were to finish second in Group H, they would move out of turquoise and into red - perhaps meeting Spain, Argentina or France as the winners of Group J in the first knockout round.Image source, FifaImage caption, If Spain, Argentina, France and England win their groups they will slot into separate quadrants for the knockout bracketWhat are the draw restrictions to watch out for?There can be no more than one team from the same confederation per group. So, for instance, Brazil and Uruguay (Conmebol) cannot be in the same group, nor can Panama and the United States (Concacaf). There is an exception for Uefa because there are 16 teams and only 12 groups. That means four groups will contain two European nations. It all seems relatively straightforward, but as we go on these constraints are going to cause some serious complications as countries skip groups to avoid clashes with teams from their own confederation. That means it will not just be case of teams slotting into Group A, and then Group B, and then Group C in order as they are drawn. When we get to pots three and four, it might seem like countries are being sent to random groups. Fifa needs to prevent something called deadlocking, which happens when it is no longer possible to complete the draw while following the regulations.  The major issue comes from the teams who can potentially qualify via the inter-confederation play-off pathways and will go into pot four. Pathway 1 has New Caledonia (OFC), Jamaica (Concacaf) and DR Congo (CAF)Pathway 2 has Bolivia (Conmebol), Suriname (Concacaf) and Iraq (AFC)Both pathways have a Concacaf team, so they are automatically blocked out of four groups (those containing the United States, Mexico, Canada and Panama). The first pathway is less of problem, because the only other Oceania team, New Zealand, are also in pot four. But the second pathway makes it complicated, because there are 17 deadlocking nations in pots one, two and three. So, the only way to complete the draw is for the team that qualifies via this route to go into a group with two European countries and an African nation.What will this look like in practice?When pot two is being drawn, the computer will have to ensure that there is at least one group with two European teams, or one European and one African country.When it comes to pot three, there will then be two possible draw routes. If there is one group with two European nations in it, then Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia or Ivory Coast must join it. If there is one group with an African and European nation in it, then Norway or Scotland must go into it. Both could happen, in which case the draw computer will ensure one is filled as necessary. If we get to pot four and there is only one group which meets this criterion, pathway two will have to go into it.The other pot-four teams - the four potential play-off winners from Uefa, two from Concacaf, two African and one Asian nation - will have their own deadlock restrictions. The Uefa play-off paths, which include Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, will have limited options because 12 European teams will already have been drawn.   It might be hard to keep up at this point. How will teams be allocated to their groups?Once a team has been drawn they will go into the first available group, adhering to the draw constraints, in alphabetical order. The draw computer will ensure Spain, Argentina, France and England are placed in groups in the correct quadrant of the bracket.To speed up the process countries will not be drawn into their specific group positions to set the order of the fixtures.Seeded countries will all go into position one, with a pre-determined grid for all the other pots, as shown in the image below.For instance, let's take Scotland in pot three. Their fixture order will be determined by the yellow box.If they are drawn first from pot three they will go into Group A with Mexico. The grid shows the team from pot three will go into position two. The first match is A1 v A2, so Mexico would play Scotland in the opening game of the World Cup.Image source, FifaImage caption, The group position by pot has been pre-determined and will not be decided by drawWhen will teams find out when and where they will play?While nations will know their opponents and match dates on Friday, 5 December they will have to wait 24 hours to find out venues and kick-off times.The exceptions are groups A (Mexico), B (Canada) and D (US), which contain the three host nations and already have venues for the fixtures, but not kick-off times.For all other groups, you'll know only the date and the order of matches when Fifa unveils the match schedule in a live broadcast on Saturday, 6 December at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time). Fifa president Gianni Infantino will be joined on stage by legends of the game to discuss the key matches.All 12 groups will play fixtures in this order:Match Day 1: 1 v 2, 3 v 4Match Day 2: 1 v 3, 4 v 2Match Day 3: 4 v 1, 2 v 3",

    "body": "When will England and Scotland find out where they will play World Cup matches?ByFootball issues correspondentEngland and Scotland will know their World Cup opponents on Friday evening, but there might be a wait to discover where those games will take place.The exceptions are groups A (Mexico), B (Canada) and D (US), which contain the three host nations. If Scotland go into one of these groups they will find out the stadiums they will play in, but not kick-off times.For all other groups, including England's, you will know only the date and the order of matches. There will be a 50-50 chance for the city where the game will be staged.So where could England and Scotland go depending on the group? What might be the dream and horror draws? And how can you get tickets?

Which group you get will decide how much travel is involved. Group C and Group K are the only ones to be played in a single country, the United States. All other groups will involve cross-border travel, other than for the co-hosts.Group A: Guadalajara, Monterrey, Mexico City (Mexico), Atlanta (US)Group B: Toronto, Vancouver (Canada), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle (US)Group C: Atlanta, Boston, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia (US)Group D: Vancouver (Canada), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle (US)Group E: Toronto (Canada), Houston, Kansas, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia (US)Group F: Monterrey (Mexico), Dallas, Houston, Kansas (US)Group G: Vancouver (Canada), Los Angeles, Seattle (US)Group H: Guadalajara (Mexico), Atlanta, Houston, Miami (US)Group I: Toronto (Canada), Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia (US)Group J: Dallas, Kansas, San Francisco (US)Group K: Guadalajara, Mexico City (Mexico), Atlanta, Houston, Miami (USA)Group L: Toronto (Canada), Dallas, New York/New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia (USA)Best and worst draw for England?This is very much a subjective assessment of the potential opponents.England would probably prefer to get Australia from pot two, but that would lock out lower-ranked Asian countries from pots three and four. We have therefore picked Austria, as they topped a very average qualifying group ahead of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Romania. Qatar or World Cup debutants Uzbekistan would be favourable from pot three.That would leave only a handful of options from pot four: Cape Verde, Ghana, Curacao, Haiti, New Zealand and the play-off path of DR Congo/Jamaica/New Caledonia. Curacao or Haiti would likely be the one to get.Best draw: England, Austria, Uzbekistan, HaitiAs for the worst, England have never beaten Uruguay in three previous World Cup meetings, including a 2-1 loss at the 2014 finals. Norway look to be the strongest team in pot three, though a renewed rivalry with Scotland would also be testing. But if we want to create the most difficult group overall, Mohamed Salah's Egypt is the one to choose.Then from pot four you could take the play-off path of Italy, Wales and Northern Ireland. Worst draw: England, Uruguay, Egypt, Uefa Play-off ABest and worst draw for Scotland?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Steve Clarke and his coaching staff guided Scotland to their first World Cup appearance for 28 yearsIf Scotland do get a host nation, Canada would be the most favourable. Of the qualifiers in pot one, Belgium have been slipping down the world rankings from third in June 2024 to their current place of eighth.From pot two, Australia might be the optimum draw, with New Zealand from pot four.Best draw: Canada, Australia, Scotland, New ZealandYou can take your pick from pot one for the worst draw, but we will go with world champions Argentina. In pot two, Morocco reached the semi-finals in 2022 and will produce nightmares for Scotland fans. The last match the Scots played at the World Cup in 1998 was a 3-0 loss to the African nation.Finally in pot four, it again has to be the inter-confederation route including Italy, Wales and Northern IrelandWorst draw: Argentina, Morocco, Scotland, Uefa Play-off AWhere will Scotland play if they get a host country?If Scotland are drawn with one of the co-hosts, this is how the fixture list would look.If Scotland go into Group A with Mexico, their schedule would be: June 11: Mexico in Mexico CityJune 18: A4 in AtlantaJune 24: A3 in GuadalupeIf Scotland go into Group B with Canada, their schedule would be: June 13: B4 in Santa ClaraJune 18: Canada in VancouverJune 24: B2 in SeattleIf Scotland go into Group D with United States, their schedule would be: June 12: United States in InglewoodJune 19: D4 in Santa ClaraJune 25: D3 in Santa ClaraHow to get World Cup tickets - and their costThe first batch of tickets went on sale at the start of October, with more than 4.5 million fans entering a draw for a chance to buy them.Fifa has not formally revealed a full price list, but they are being listed online by fans who were successful in the draw after spending hours in digital queues.General admission tickets are being split into four categories, with those for the first match in the USA costing between $560 (£417) and $2,235 (£1,662). The cheapest ticket for the 2026 final costs $2,030 (£1,510), and the most expensive is $6,000 (£4,462). Hospitality tickets, meanwhile, are yet to go on sale but will almost certainly be priced significantly higher.Some tickets for matches early in the tournament - in a few of the less prestigious locations - are available for $60 (£44), but stadium map images show they are a tiny proportion of available seats.The third phase of ticketing - the Random Selection Draw - will begin on 11 December and close on 13 January, when fans will be able to apply for single-match tickets based on exact fixtures. Supporters will then be told if they have been successful. A last-minute sales phase will take place closer to the tournament, during which fans will be able to purchase any remaining inventory on a first come, first served basis.Fifa is adopting a 'dynamic' pricing model for the tournament, meaning ticket prices for matches deemed high demand could be raised significantly during later sales periods.Controversially, Fifa also has a resale platform where tickets can be resold at any price, usually much higher than the original cost, with the governing body also adding 15% charges on both the buyer and seller.How can I watch the draw on the BBC?The draw will be broadcast live on the BBC and BBC iPlayer from 17:00 GMT on 5 December.There will also be live text coverage on the BBC Sport website and app.Alternatively, you can listen live on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.You can also tune into the BBC Sport website and YouTube channel after the draw for all the reaction.This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.What is Ask Me Anything?Ask Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.We want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.The team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.We will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.Our coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.More questions answered...",

    "body": "1 hour agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterNetflix is closing in on a deal to buy the film and streaming businesses of Warner Bros Discovery, according to multiple reports.The streaming giant has emerged as the top bidder for Warner Bros ahead of rivals  Comcast and Paramount Skydance after offering $28 (£21) per share, according to several outlets including Reuters and the New York Times.Paramount made an initial bid to buy the whole company, including its cable networks such as CNN, for $24 a share in October which Warner Bros rejected before putting itself up for sale.Paramount's lawyers have questioned the \"fairness and adequacy\" of the sale process this week, in a letter seen by CNBC.Paramount submitted a renewed bid for closer to $27 a share on Thursday, CNN reported.Warner Bros owns franchises including Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, and the streaming service HBO Max.Netflix, Warner Bros and Paramount have been approached for comment.Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the takeover battle was a \"drama for people who make drama\".Speaking to BBC's Today programme, she said it was key to note the difference between the Paramount and Netflix bids, pointing out that Paramount's bid included the parts of Warner Bros business that have been \"dragging on profitability\".\"Netflix bid is only for parts of the business, and those are the parts of the business that are doing well,\" she said.Ms Wall said Paramount had taken an unusual step of accusing Warner Bros of favouring Netflix in the process. Paramount also said the streaming platform's offer was not as good a deal for Warner Bros shareholders because it would require the break up of the business.\"You're sort of tainting your offer if you go into a spat,\" she said.According to CNBC, Paramount's lawyers accused Warner Bros of undertaking \"a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder\".Whichever company buys Warner Bros, Ms Wall said the US competition regulator was likely to get involved.\"Whether Netflix is successful in this part bit or indeed paramount comes back for more, this will create a global mega power in broadcast entertainment which the regulator will want to look at,\" she said.Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis, said it was hard to gauge whether the deal would win regulatory approval, but if it went through it would have a massive impact on cinema.\"Were it to go through it would reorient Hollywood, with a streamer acquiring a business much of which it is existentially the antithesis of - Netflix has always had some limited use for the cinema but generally its offering undermines it,\" he said.Mr Harrington said there was likely to be \"big reductions\" in television and film output from a merged entity, which would lead to resistance to the move from parts of Hollywood and relevant unions.\"HBO, the creative jewel, would be terribly exposed within Netflix, although it has survived difficult owners for a lot of its existence,\" he said.For consumers, Mr Harrington said a merger was likely to lead to higher costs.\"Netflix would get more expensive and even though HBO Max would be shuttered/become non-essential, the greater penetration of Netflix households would likely mean an increase in total overall subscription revenues.\"",

    "body": "The last supermoon of 2025 dazzled bright in the night sky on Thursday night.Appearing brighter and larger than a normal full Moon, the third supermoon of the year was also spotted by some in the UK with an atmospheric phenomenon called a halo.This halo even has its own folklore - 'Ring around the Moon, rain real soon'.It was a perfect opportunity for sky gazers around the world, along with the BBC's Weather Watchers, to get capture some stunning images. Supermoon's occur because the Moon's orbit around Earth is not perfectly circular, but slightly elliptical - meaning it is sometimes closer to us than at other times.When the Moon is in \"perigee\" - or near its closest point to Earth - and that coincides with a full Moon, fully illuminated by the sun's light, we call it a supermoon.The Moon appears larger and brighter in the night sky.Clear skies will also mean a great view of the Moon but sometimes you might also see a ring around the Moon.Known as a 22 degree halo, this occurs when there is a layer of very high, ice cloud in the sky.Light from the Moon passes through the ice crystals where it bends and reflects creating the ring effect.The presence of a the ice cloud in the sky can be an indicator of an approaching weather system and hence why the folklore suggests 'rain real soon'.Early on Friday morning high ice cloud moved in across southern areas of England where the halo was spotted.So, rain real soon?Yes, rain will be spreading to most parts of the UK during Friday with a strengthening wind.",

    "body": "11 hours agoHazel ShearingEducation correspondentBBCListen to Hazel reading this storyNatalie Johnston was scrolling on Facebook a couple of years ago, when she came across a group called, \"One And Done On The Fence\". Seeing it, she felt a sense of relief.\"It was nice to hear someone giving it a name,\" she says.She and her husband have a five-year-old daughter called Joanie but they knew they probably wouldn't have a second child - not because they couldn't, but not out of choice, either: Natalie finds it hard to imagine having the time and money for one.\"You know you'd love that baby, everyone tells you, but there's a little teeny niggle where you think, 'what if I put my first in that position where she can't do the activity she wants to do because I've got to spread money out between two'?\"She adds: \"Is it okay to say you're only having one because they don't fit into modern ways of parenting?\"Getty ImagesPeople aren't 'turning their backs on parenthood', says the UN - some people simply can't afford it. One expert explains that there is a fertility gap - or 'for every three kids wanted… only two are born'Modern parenting, for Natalie, 35, looks like family holidays with Joanie. It looks like weekday evenings hearing about her day at school and helping her with homework. But, with demanding jobs and no family living nearby to help with childcare, it also looks like an expensive childcare jigsaw.But ultimately, deciding whether or not to have a second is a tough decision. \"I think you worry you'd regret it,\" she says.The fertility rate was 1.41 children per woman in England and Wales last year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the lowest on record for a third year running. And the proportion of families with one child has grown since the turn of the century.They made up 44% of all families with dependent children in England and Wales last year, up from 42% in 2000. (Though the peak was 47% in the early 2010s, which then dipped before picking up again after Covid.)The UK's falling birth rate is part of what the United Nations calls a \"global fertility slump\", which it puts down, in part, to money worries.People aren't \"turning their backs on parenthood\", says the UN in a summary of its Population Fund's State of World Population report, which surveyed people across 14 countries. Instead it says they \"are being denied the freedom to start families due to skyrocketing living costs, persistent gender inequality and deepening uncertainty about the future\".Bridging the 'fertility gap'Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said earlier this year that she wants \"more young people to have children, if they so choose\". She pointed to the expansion of funded childcare hours in England as a way the government was trying to recover \"dashed dreams\".Annual nursery costs for a child under two in England did fall this year for the first time in 15 years, according to the children's charity Coram. They are now an average of £12,425, down 22% on the previous year. However they are slightly up in Scotland and Wales, at £12,468 and £15,038 respectively.A study from University College London (UCL) last year suggested two-fifths of 32-year-olds in England want children – or more children, if they are already parents – but only one in four of them are actively trying to conceive.Dr Paula Sheppard, an anthropologist at the University of Oxford, believes parents in the West still think of having two children as \"the norm\".However, she says there is a \"fertility gap\" and that \"for every three kids wanted… only two are born\".\"A lot of this gap is driven by… people starting families later and later in life,\" she explains – often a result of education and career opportunities for women and changing gender roles.\"It becomes a whole lot more difficult to get pregnant [and] it becomes a whole lot more difficult to keep the pregnancy.\"Fewer pupils, less cash for schoolsThe falling birthrate is giving education policymakers a headache.The number of pupils in England has dropped by 150,000 since 2019, and will fall by a further 400,000 by the end of the decade, according to the Education Policy Institute.Schools are given money per pupil, so fewer pupils means less cash. Less cash, in turn, is an issue for those head teachers struggling to fund staffing and resources.Getty ImagesBridget Phillipson said she wanted 'more young people to have children, if they choose to'About a year ago, a post on a UK Reddit thread for teachers raised what one contributor saw as another potential impact of more only children on the education system.The contributor wrote that they had seen a rise in \"spoilt\" children with \"demanding behaviour due to overindulgent parenting\". These children tended to have siblings who were much older or no siblings at all, they claimed.The idea that children without siblings may be selfish or spoiled dates back to research conducted in the late 19th century by psychologists G Stanley Hall and E W Bohannon.\"Selfishness is one of the most striking traits of the only children in families,\" they wrote in their Study of Peculiar and Exceptional Children. \"'The only child' is deficient on the social side.\"Getty ImagesSchools are given money per pupil, so fewer pupils means less cash. Less cash, in turn, can be an issue for head teachers struggling to fund staffing and resourcesBut more recent studies have debunked that idea. \"Numerous studies have disproven these myths that only children are maladjusted, spoiled, and lonely,\" explains Dr Adriean Mancillas, a psychologist and professor in California State University's education department.Only children and academic performanceDr Mancillas has spent her career exploring family dynamics, the development of only children, and mental health intervention in schools - and says most research \"consistently demonstrates advantages of being an only child, particularly in educational and academic outcomes\".This is down, mainly, to a theory called \"resource dilution\". In simple terms, she says this means parents with one child \"are able to be more involved in their child's education\".\"Children with siblings share in parents' time, emotional support, attention, and financial resources whereas the only child does not,\" says Dr Mancillas. \"This singular focus of resources tends to provide academic advantages for the only child.\"She points to some research that suggests many only children did better academically when schools closed to most pupils in lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, \"because of the relative availability of parental resources\".Getty Images'Children with siblings share in parents' time, emotional support, attention, and financial resources whereas the only child does not,' argues Dr Mancillas\"Resource dilution\" is one of three social science theories about the consequences of being an only child, according to University College London (UCL) academics.The second is \"confluence theory\", which also suggests that only children perform better than children with siblings academically because a family's \"intellectual environment\" declines as the number of children grows.Then there is \"socialisation theory\" which, in contrast, argues that siblings help children learn how to share, negotiate and resolve conflict.More from InDepthExisting research, according to the UCL academics, support the first two theories. But, like Dr Mancillas, they say it \"generally does not support the socialisation theory as it finds that only children are comparable to children with siblings (especially those with few siblings) in terms of personality, parent-child relationships, achievement, motivation and personal adjustment\".Dr Mancillas suggests there could be something else feeding into only children's better academic performance, too.\"Studies show that parents with one child tend to have attained higher educational outcomes themselves than parents of multiple children,\" she says.\"Much of the time, parents have delayed having children in order to complete career or higher educational goals. This would suggest that parents who have one child likely place a high value on education overall.\"'Little emperors' and 'one-child dynasties'Earlier this year, Susan Newman, an American psychologist explored so-called only-child dynasties - where parents who are only-children, have one child themselves - in an article to accompany her new book, Just One: The New Science, Secrets & Joy of Parenting an Only Child.One of the most surprising findings from the new research for her book was, she wrote: \"Adult only-children are increasingly choosing to have \"just one\" child themselves.\"The resulting only-child dynasties underscore the trend. Count on seeing more of them, most noticeably without the spoiled, entitled 'little emperors' we heard so much about for so long -despite a lack of evidence to support such misinformed stereotypes.\"The phrase has been used as shorthand to describe the only children born under China's one-child policy, the idea held by some being that it led to a generation of \"solitary children pampered and paraded with a retinue of parents and elders\".Getty ImagesNanny training in China, where there was previously a one-child policyHowever, while the policy did leave a lasting legacy after its end in 2015 - an ageing population, for example, and a gender imbalance because of a traditional preference for male children - research has suggested that the \"little emperor effect\" has not been a part of it. There were \"very few only-child effects\" on children's personality, according to a study of Chinese schoolchildren carried out by American researchers at two Texas Universities.'People feel very alone in this'The phrase \"one and done\" was only just beginning to emerge when New York-based journalist Lauren Sandler began writing her 2013 book, One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One.\"I would be on the subway with my adorable child and someone would say, 'so cute, when are you having another one?'\"There is so little discussion about what it means to have single children, which is incredible to me considering how many there are.\"She adds: \"I think that people feel very alone in this.\"She began to question why some people assumed she would want more children, something she also explored for her work. It used to be that having larger families was how we survived, she points out. \"A family was a workforce, and that was very much a necessity until the industrial revolution.\"Only after the industrial revolution, and the introduction of child labour and welfare laws did that change. \"The opportunity costs and the economic costs of children shifted dramatically,\" she explains.Getty Images'I would be on the subway with my adorable child and someone would say, 'so cute, when are you having another one?' says Lauren Sandler. (Pictured: Gregory Peck filming The Million Pound Note)She also questioned the negative connotations that can sometimes be associated with having one child.\"There's also a lot of research that shows that only children do not take relationships for granted at a very, very young age. So, [it's not the same as when you] fight with your older brother and then just, through exposure, need to make up again. \"These people aren't going to be at the dinner table with you every night. Because of that, there's a lot of care that seems to come into relationships. And so that is sort of the opposite of the selfish stereotype of only children.\"Trump and the $5,000 'baby bonus'So teachers may not really have a generation of \"little emperors\" on their hands. But the impact of the falling birth rate is still very much being felt by some schools, and more widely too.Policymakers, for example, are grappling with the impact of the UK's ageing population on public services, taxes, and the growing cost of state pensions.\"Falling birth rates and an ageing population can create pressures on public services and public finances because the balance between the number of people working and the number of people drawing on age-related services changes over time,\" says Dr Alina Pelikh of University College London, who specialises in demography. \"Governments may need to consider adjustments - whether through pension age, contributions, or other measures - to ensure long-term sustainability.\"AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration raised the idea of a $5,000 'baby bonus' to incentivise people to have more childrenThe concerns are global, and governments around the world are trying to encourage people to have more children.US President Donald Trump has mentioned the idea of a $5,000 \"baby bonus\". Poland has just introduced a policy of zero personal income tax for families with two or more children. And in Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has introduced tax exemptions for mothers.But for all the the statistics and policymaking this is, ultimately, a very personal decision.Natalie couldn't be prouder of her daughter, who has recently been made \"values ambassador\" in her class, encouraging other children to show empathy and respect. \"She has been chosen, not because she's an only child, because they don't know whether she's got siblings or not. She's been chosen based on her personality,\" says Natalie.\"I don't think I was ever worried about not giving her [a sibling], because you can never have a child for somebody else.\"You've got to have a child for yourself, haven't you?\"Lead image: Getty Images (stock picture of a child)BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "11 hours agoMalcolm PriorRural affairs producerWatch: Animal welfare campaigners secretly film one worker urinating in a pen filled with turkeysA turkey farm that breeds premium birds which are then sold at Christmas in high-end stores and butchers has been suspended from a food standards assurance scheme amid allegations of poor biosecurity and animal welfare standards.Hockenhull Turkeys in Lincolnshire is being investigated by Red Tractor after welfare campaigners secretly filmed workers not following biosecurity measures, throwing birds and, in one case, a staff member urinating in a pen of birds.The Spilsby facility supplies young birds – known as poults - to farms, including one that supplies Harrods with turkeys selling for up to £170. Hockenhull Turkeys told the BBC it had suspended workers while an investigation takes place.The footage, which was captured by environmental campaign group Green Britain Foundation in July and August, shows one worker walking into a pen full of live turkeys before urinating. Workers are also seen not following basic biosecurity practices, moving between sheds without changing boots or using foot dips, and throwing and mishandling birds.A spokesman for Hockenhull Turkeys, which is owned by global company Aviagen Turkeys, said they were \"appalled and very concerned\" to see the secret filming which \"does not represent the standards of animal husbandry and biosecurity we expect\".\"High biosecurity and animal welfare standards are of the utmost importance to us and it is clear here that we have failed to live up to that promise,\" he said.He added that the \"vast majority\" of staff \"care deeply\" for the animals in their care and that the footage \"does not represent a typical day at Hockenhull\".Red Tractor, a farm and food assurance scheme that ensures its members meet certain standards for food safety, animal welfare and traceability, has suspended Hockenhull Turkey's certification \"pending an independent investigation\".\"We take breaches of these standards extremely seriously and will always act on credible evidence of non-compliance,\" a spokesman told the BBC.It said it had also sent its own assessor to the site to investigate the issues raised by the footage.Turkeys bred at the site are supplied to farms that use traditional rearing and slaughtering methods to produce higher-quality meat, a standard known as \"farmfresh\".Such Hockenhull turkeys are sold by the luxury department store Harrods.A Harrods spokeswoman said they did not have a \"direct relationship\" with Hockenhull Turkeys itself but that a farm supplier that uses their breed of turkey was \"now thoroughly and urgently investigating any evidence of a breach in standards from the supplier of Hockenhull poults\".She added that the farm supplier adhered to strict standards set by the industry body, the Traditional Farmfresh Turkey Association (TFTA). The BBC has approached the TFTA for comment.Dale Vince, of the Green Britain Foundation, called for Harrods to suspend supplies from Hockenhull and launch an independent investigation, with the findings made public.\"Anything less is not really living up to their reputation,\" he said.The government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), which monitors animal welfare on farms, is also investigating.A spokeswoman said: \"We take breaches of animal welfare legislation very seriously and will always take action where we find this.\"",

    "body": "5 minutes agoSarah TurnnidgeBristolNational HighwaysLogan Smith, 18, died after being hit by a car on the M5 in North Somerset on SundayAn 18-year-old who got out of an ambulance on a motorway was Tasered by police before he was hit by a car and died, the police watchdog has said.Logan Smith, from Weston-super-Mare, died on the M5 in North Somerset late on Sunday evening. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said he was being taken to hospital when concerned paramedics stopped the ambulance on the hard shoulder of the northbound carriageway of the M5. Police were called when Mr Smith walked onto the carriageway, and the officer was captured on bodycam footage discharging their Taser, causing him to fall to the ground where he was hit by a car. Mr Smith was given emergency first aid, but died at the scene. A post-mortem examination has since been carried out ahead of a future inquest.Investigators at the IOPC are now looking into the actions and decisions made by Avon and Somerset Police prior to Mr Smith's death. The watchdog's director Derrick Campbell said his thoughts were with Mr Smith's family and friends, as well as \"everyone affected by this shocking and tragic incident\".\"We want to reassure everyone that we will independently investigate all the circumstances surrounding this incident, including the use of a Taser,\" he added, explaining that initial accounts had been taken from the officer and ambulance staff involved.He said the IOPC met with Mr Smith's family on Tuesday to give their condolences and explain the investigation, including the matter of the Taser being discharged. In a statement given after the incident, Avon and Somerset Police Assistant Chief Constable Joanne Hall said: \"This incident has had a significant effect on our officers and ambulance crews who are understandably incredibly upset by what happened.\"As well as providing support to the man's family, we are also making sure that the appropriate welfare arrangements are in place for our staff and also for those members of the public who were either directly involved or who witnessed the incident.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "15 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporterThe parents of the last dead hostage in Gaza have spoken to the BBC about their desperate wait for his body to be returned.Itzik and Talik Gvili insisted the Gaza peace deal could not progress until Hamas handed over the remains of their son Ran, a 24-year-old Israeli police officer also known as Rani.\"We really hope that all people in the world... want to end this situation and go to the second phase, so Hamas must bring Rani home,\" his mother Talik said, after Israel confirmed the body of Thai national Suthisak Rintalak had been returned on Wednesday.He and Ran were among 251 people taken hostage in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when another 1,200 people were killed.Ran was killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim, and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza as a hostage, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).His parents said he was on medical leave with a broken shoulder at the time of the attacks but went to fight after seeing on television what was happening.\"He couldn't stay at home even though he was injured. He took my car and his uniform... and went to help in the fight against the terrorists,\" said his father Itzik.\"He saved Kibbutz Alumim... and he saved Israel, so Israel has to save him now and bring him back home,\" he added.While the couple have been told by Israeli officials that Ran was killed, they say they are still holding onto \"a little percent\" of hope \"that maybe he's alive, maybe he's survived\".\"We want closure,\" said Talik.Speaking during a visit to London, Ran's parents described their pain over the past 26 months, much of which they have spent campaigning for the return of all the living and dead hostages.Under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, but it has taken weeks for the bodies of the dead hostages to be returned, often only one at a time.\"When Hamas bring one of the hostages home we don't know who it is, maybe it's Rani, maybe it's someone else… It's like roulette. You cannot imagine the fright and the hope and everything. Sometimes it's not a hostage\" at all, said Talik, referring to  several sets of remains handed over that have turned out to belong to dead Palestinians.\"My wish is that no mother will feel what I feel in the whole world. We are strong people, but what is inside, you cannot imagine… They stole my child and I can do nothing - just pray and come to visit people and beg for help.\"Talik said she had not slept for a full night since 7 October 2023.\"You feel that you have 5,000 kilos on your chest. We don't have night. We don't have day. We have nothing,\" she said.While they are now the only people in Israel waiting for a loved one to be returned from Gaza, they said the support around them has grown.\"All the families are together with us and all Israeli people are with us. It [the support] is bigger than before because all Israeli people are now focused on one thing - bring Ran home and then do the second phase [of the peace deal],\" said Talik.The couple said that after Ran's return, they hoped for lasting peace and for Hamas to be dismantled.\"We are very proud of Ran. He's a hero in Israel. Hamas made Ran a hero... We want him back and to try to sleep well and breathe well again.\"Earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also described Ran as a \"hero of Israel\", saying he had \"eliminated 14 terrorists and did so with the utmost bravery\" before being killed in battle.\"We are determined to bring Ran back for a proper Jewish burial and we will spare no effort to do so,\" he vowed.Israel responded to the 7 October 2023 attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,120 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "5 days agoMegan BonarBBC ScotlandPA MediaThe US talk show host was invited to dinner by members of the Royal Regiment of ScotlandA kilt might not be the first thing on your list when you're a TV superstar packing for an autumnal holiday in Scotland.But that's exactly what American comedian and talk show host Jimmy Fallon was left scrambling for when he was unexpectedly invited to a black-tie dinner while on a trip to Aberdeenshire.Luckily, his hotel's night manager was on hand to give him a loan of his own kilt.The comedian was welcomed to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater by officers from the 5Scots regiment who served him Scotch eggs and Buckfast.Fallon rose to fame as a cast member on the comedy sketch series Saturday Night Live before becoming the host of a late-night talk show.PA MediaJimmy dined on Scotch eggs and Buckfast tonic wineSpeaking about his trip, in a video shared on TikTok, Fallon said he travelled to Scotland to take a trip on the Royal Scotsman when he had a chance encounter with some soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland.The comedian was visiting the River Dee near Balmoral Castle when some members of the King's royal guards, the 5Scots battalion, recognised him and invited him to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater for dinner.The invitation, along with its black-tie dress code, left him with a dilemma - where to get a suit or a kilt, at such short notice.He approached staff at the Fife Arms where he was staying who went the extra mile to help their guest.Fallon said: \"I called the night manager and I talked to him. I said 'I need to get a kilt tonight' and he goes 'I'll figure something out', so Muir gave me his own kilt.\"The manager pieced together a full ensemble of kilt, jacket, sporran, hose and brogues.Scotch egg and BuckfastThe SNL actor said his hosts were \"psyched\" he wore a kilt and he \"had the best dinner ever\".He dined on venison Scotch egg washed down with Buckfast tonic wine, which Fallon said had left him feeling a bit worse for wear.He left the evening with his very own kilt, fitted by the battalion's tailor and a Glengarry hat he proudly wore during the video.Major Thomas Blair, commanding officer of 5Scots, said: \"What started as a chance meeting near Balmoral turned into a brilliant evening.\"It's not every day you get to meet a Hollywood A-lister, and we were delighted to welcome him to Scotland - in true Scots style.\"Within 5Scots, Balaklava company has a number of ceremonial roles in Scotland and forms the royal guard at Balmoral.The infantry company welcomed the King to Balmoral when he arrived for his summer residence earlier this year.",

    "body": "5 hours agoThe fallout after a former asylum seeker who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl was mistakenly released from prison dominates Saturday's papers. The Sun calls the blunder \"one out... by mistake\", playing off the government's \"one in, one out\" asylum scheme. The paper reports Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was due to be deported before being released after an \"astonishing error\" by prison staff.The Daily Telegraph says police are scrambling to track down the sex offender who was let out of HMP Chelmsford after being wrongly categorised as a prisoner due to be freed. Justice Secretary David Lammy says he is \"furious\" and has ordered an \"urgent investigation\" into the error, the paper reports. Elsewhere, a picture of Boris Johnson's ex-wife Marina Wheeler is front and centre, who poses the question \"I'm over him, surely Britain is too?\"\"A blunder that beggars belief\" is the Daily Mail's take. Police say Kebatu was last seen asking for directions from locals before boarding a London-bound train at Chelmsford station on Friday, the paper reports. Sharing the front page, the Mail says that Prince Andrew could be asked to leave the Royal Lodge by King Charles III.The Mirror also leads with Prince Andrew's \"advanced talks\" with the King to leave the Royal Lodge after the fallout from his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \"Dislodged\" is the paper's headline over an aerial view of Windsor's sprawling Royal Lodge mansion.A \"stark warning for Starmer\" after Labour suffered a \"crushing\" by-election defeat in its traditional heartland of Wales on Friday, the Guardian reports. The paper says the result highlighted the \"striking collapse\" of the party's vote, with MPs warning a repeat loss in the 2026 May local elections \"could spell the end\" of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's premiership. Alongside, the Guardian previews Claudia Winkleman's \"next steps\" after she and fellow Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly announced they were leaving the show.\"Starmer in firing line\" echoes the Independent's headline on the government's \"historic by-election defeat\" in Caerphilly. The paper reports the PM saying he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the result. Also sharing the top spot is the King's \"royal welcome\" for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday ahead of a summit with European allies in London.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to give more than a million low-paid workers a pay boost in the budget, the Times reports. The paper says Reeves has been warned by businesses the move would risk \"pricing jobs out of existence\".The i follows with more warnings from economists for the chancellor, who say raising the higher rate of income tax would hit \"ordinary workers\", including teachers and junior doctors. The paper reports Reeves is considering \"breaking Labour's manifesto pledge to give herself some breathing space on public spending\".\"Trump sets off fresh tariffs alarm\" is the Financial Times' lead, after Donald Trump \"cleared the way for new tariffs\" on China and halted trade talks with Canada on Friday. The paper says the decisions come ahead of Trump's upcoming trip to Asia, which includes a summit in South Korea with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Finally, the Daily Star is asking their readers who they want as Strictly Come Dancing's next hosts. The top names in the running include presenters Rylan Clark and Zoe Ball, with \"Lettuce Liz Truss\" also making a surge with 8% of the vote.Many papers feature the Epping asylum seeker jailed for sexual assault who has been released from prison by mistake.The Daily Telegraph calls it a \"jail blunder\", with the Daily Mail saying the error \"beggars belief\".The Times quotes the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accusing Labour of \"putting predators back on the streets\", and highlights Sir Keir Starmer's response on X in which he said he was \"appalled by the mistake\".Prince Andrew still features prominently in many newspapers.The Guardian is among those reporting that he is in advanced talks with Buckingham Palace about leaving his 30-room mansion, Royal Lodge, as pressure grows following fresh revelations about him in the posthumous memoirs of Virgina Guiffre.\"Dislodged,\" says the Daily Mirror's headline. Prince Andrew has consistently denied claims by Ms Guiffre that he sexually abused her.The Times reports that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to give more than a million low paid workers a pay rise in next month's budget by increasing the national living wage.But the paper says economists and the hospitality industry have warned it could lead to job losses and it quotes the Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, Simon Roberts, saying it could result in price rises for shoppers.Labour is planning to let trade unions \"barge\" into workplaces under the new employment rights bill, according to documents seen by the Daily Telegraph.  It says a Department of Business and Trade consultation paper states employers with more than 21 workers will face big fines if they block access to officials. A spokesman for the department says it is not true that the bill would allow unions to turn up when they wanted.And a pledge by the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, to abolish business rates for a quarter of a million retailers is the main story for the Daily Express. It says the promise - part of a four-pronged plan - will kickstart a High Street boom if the party were in power to implement it.  Labour says it is also creating a fairer business rates system.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "13 minutes agoGabija GataveckaiteBBC NI Dublin correspondent , RDS, Ballsbridge, Dublin Counting is under way in the Irish presidential election.Voters in the Republic of Ireland went to the polls on Friday to elect the 10th Irish president, who will replace current head of state Michael D Higgins.There are two contenders to become the next president, but voters had a choice of three candidates - Catherine Connolly, Heather Humphreys and Jim Gavin, whose withdrawal from the race came too late to have his name removed from the ballot paper.Ballot boxes opened at 09.00 local time on Saturday and the result is due to be announced at Dublin Castle later.Early unofficial indications have suggested the turnout could potentially struggle to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018.Connolly is an independent politician backed by a number of left-wing parties including Sinn Féin.She has been a TD (member of parliament) since 2016 and previously worked as a psychologist and barrister. She is from Galway.Humphreys is the Fine Gael candidate. She was a TD from 2011 to 2024 and served in a number of senior cabinet ministerial positions, including social protection and justice.She comes from a Protestant background and is from Monaghan.The votes, which will be counted in each of the 43 constituencies, will be tallied by political parties as soon as boxes open and these will give early indications of the result.Some 3.6 million people were eligible to vote in the election, which comes to an end after months of campaigning by both candidates. To get nominated, candidates needed either 20 members of the Oireachtas, the Irish houses of parliament, or four city and county councils, to back them.Connolly was the first to declare her intention to run last July.She has the support of a number of left-wing parties, including Sinn Féin, Labour and the Social Democrats as well as independent politicians.Humphreys was selected to run for Fine Gael after the party's initial candidate, former EU Commissioner Mairead McGuinness, withdrew from the race in August for medical reasons.A third candidate, Jim Gavin, who was selected by the main coalition party, Fianna Fáil, withdrew from the campaign earlier in October after intense controversy over a 16-year-old rental dispute in which he owed €3,300 (£2,870) to a former tenant.However, as his withdrawal came after the close of nominations, the law states his name must remain on the ballot paper.Any votes cast for him will be counted as legitimate and transferred to the two other candidates if necessary.",

    "body": "9 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterChancellor Rachel Reeves should not cut the cash Isa tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget, a group of MPs has strongly advised.  Cuts to the tax-free allowance were unlikely to have the intended effect of promoting an investment culture in the UK, the Treasury Select Committee said in a report.Reeves is expected to announce tax rises or spending cuts in next month's Budget, and is reportedly considering changes to cash Isas.The chancellor said: \"My understanding is that the report says that changes to Isas shouldn't be made in isolation of other policies. I'll be setting out any tax changes in the budget in November. And of course we need to get that balance right.\"Reeves added: \"At the moment, often returns on savings and returns on pensions are lower than in comparable countries around the world, and I do want to make sure that when people put something aside for the future, they get good returns on those savings.\"Earlier this year, the chancellor was thought to be mulling a reduction to the allowance for tax-free cash savings in a bid to encourage people to put money into stocks and shares instead and boost the economy.Those plans were put on hold after strong opposition from banks, building societies and consumer campaigners.Savers can put up to £20,000 a year in Isas in savings and investments, to protect the returns from being taxed. The chancellor has said she intends to keep this limit in place, and it can currently  be spread across products including cash Isas and stocks and shares Isas. The proposed change specifically relates to cash Isas, and earlier this month the Financial Times reported the chancellor was considering reducing their tax-free amount to £10,000. The purpose behind this would be to encourage investment. The chancellor is facing a Budget shortfall of about £22bn, according to a recent estimate.She is expected to raise taxes or cut spending in her November Budget in order to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules of not borrowing to fund day-to-day spending and to get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament.Cash Isas are the most widely used type of Isa. A total of £360bn is held in cash Isas across the country.The committee's report concluded that \"cutting the cash Isa allowance is unlikely to incentivise people to invest their cash in stocks and shares\".Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Dame Meg Hillier, said: \"This is not the right time to cut the cash Isa limit.\"\"The Committee is firmly behind the chancellor's ambition to create a culture in the UK where savers are sensibly investing their money and getting better returns through well-informed financial decisions,\" she said.\"But we are a long way from that point.\"Dame Meg said the government should instead focus its efforts on \"a comprehensive effort to genuinely improve financial education and establish accessible, high quality financial advice and guidance for people\".\"Without this, I fear that the Chancellor's attempts to transform the UK's investment culture simply will not deliver the change she seeks, instead hitting savers and mortgage borrowers.\"Reducing the tax-free allowance for cash Isas would likely be unpopular among many savers, particularly older ones who are less willing to take risks with their money.Instead of cutting the cash Isa tax-free limit, \"the focus should be on improving financial literacy ... so that people can make informed decisions with their savings\", the committee said.The report found that cutting the allowance would have negative knock-on effects for consumers, as building societies depend on cash Isas for their mortgage lending.\"If this was reduced, it would mean a less competitive market for financial products and consequently higher prices for consumers,\" the committee said.BBC News has contacted the Treasury for comment.",

    "body": "9 hours agoRuth CleggHealth and wellbeing reporterGetty ImagesIt's been described as the mineral of the moment.Millions of us are taking magnesium for a whole range of reasons. Can it help us sleep better? Sort our digestion problems? Give our busy brains a moment of peace?In the fast-moving world of supplements, it's magnesium's time to shine.And the industry is booming. The global magnesium market is worth nearly £3bn and that's set to nearly double over the next decade.In a small factory, nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, huge plastic barrels of white powder are stacked up next to giant whirring machines.Workers in hazmat suits carefully weigh out magnesium citrate - a compound made by mixing the mineral with citric acid - into shiny, steel containers.Ruth Clegg/BBCMillions of magnesium tablets are produced in this factory every day\"We are sending our supplies all over the world,\" Andrew Goring, manager director of Lonsdale Health, explains. \"Around the UK, obviously, but also to Australia, parts of Asia, Kuwait, Iraq.\"It's one of our biggest sellers and the market just keeps growing.\"He is shouting over the hum of the pill presser, a machine that resembles a Dalek, which pops out dozens of small white magnesium tablets a second.\"Do we actually need it?\" I bellow back. \"And why now, why has it become so popular?\"\"Influencers, social media - that's what's pushing it,\" Mr Goring explains. \"We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream.\"I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.\"Clever marketing schemes,\" Ms Jackson says, \"magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health.\"But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. The recommended daily amount for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.It might make up less than 1% of us but \"it is involved in over 300 different processes\", Ms Jackson explains.It is \"especially important for our brain and mood,\" she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.Katie CurranKatie says magnesium supplements have helped improve her sleep and calmed her racing thoughtsFor Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.\"A year ago, I was struggling,\" she confides. \"It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later.\"Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, an amino acid with limited evidence linking it to better sleep.After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.\"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle.\"While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with \"commission paid\" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation. The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.\"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die',\" Ms Stavridis says, \"'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.\"Many of us are not getting enough magnesium,\" she continues, \"around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the recommended daily intake.\"But just taking a supplement is not the answer.\"Getty ImagesSeeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are all rich in magnesiumTake sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also affect the absorption rate of magnesium.Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of \"take this\" and you'll be fixed.She recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.If healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in \"expensive urine\", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.For those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.Dietitian Kirsten Jackson also says most people should \"100% look at diet first\".Foods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.She warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.\"One magnesium supplement is not going to sort all that.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "'I just love yapping': Spud sellers, posh-girl comedy and bus-loving gran among  TikTok award nominees9 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsCoco SarelSarel is best known for her Love Island debriefs after each episode When Sarel presses record on her phone, there's no script, no set and no meticulous plan for what she's about to say. \"I'm usually wearing my bonnet, no makeup and I just pick up the phone and start yapping,\" she says. \"I believe in maximum output for minimal effort, so if I have to do more than the bare minimum, I likely won't do it. That's why I just talk to the camera and post.\" In only a few years, Sarel's unfiltered style has turned her from an ordinary voice online into one of TikTok's most distinctive personalities, with more than one million followers on the platform. Famous for her Love Island debriefs, Sarel is among the nominees at the second annual TikTok awards - a celebration of the creators shaping online culture in the UK. There are 72 nominees across 12 categories including education, beauty, comedy, food and sport. The nominees have a combined following of more than 83 million followers.From breakout comedians to beauty innovators, this year's nominees include jacket potato entrepreneurs, tap dancing brothers, a bus loving aunty, a BookTok aficionado and a film location fangirl. Coco Sarel Sarel can't quite believe that the thing she does most naturally - talking - has gained her millions of followers and likes.\"It's mad people want to watch me yap,\" she says. But the simplicity of her process is part of the appeal and \"you really do see 100% of me on the camera\". Her journey has also taken her beyond the screen, and in 2023 she performed at the Edinburgh Fringe festival with fellow TikTok stars. \"I've got a whole new respect for comedians after doing that,\" she says. \"With content, if people don't like it, they scroll away, but if you bomb on stage, the whole room is looking at you like, 'That's terrible'\".With visibility comes scrutiny, and Sarel says it's not always easy dealing with the darker side of social media. \"The hate is always louder than the love,\" she says. \"Five years ago, I'd clap back in the comments, but I'm 31 now and I'm too tired for that so I just block it out and ignore it.\" Because she started sharing later in life, Sarel is still figuring out how much of herself to put online. \"I go off how I feel in the moment, and my audience respects that,\" she says. \"I started off like I was just talking to friends, but now I protect parts of my life I don't want everyone's opinion on.\" While social media is full of people turning major life events into months-long content strategies, Sarel isn't interested in that and even significant milestones tend to pass with little fanfare on her feed. \"I recently got married and I did two videos, then I was like, 'Let's talk about The Traitors.' I've got ADHD, so I move on quickly.\"Henry RowleyHenry RowleyThe 27-year-old was a marketing executive before finding fame on TikTokBest known for his \"husky posh girl\" sketches, Henry Rowley has become one of TikTok's sharpest comedy voices. The Leicester-born performer discovered his now signature characters while studying at Bristol University, where he found himself \"surrounded by a whole new world of posh\" and he couldn't resist turning it into material.\"Some of those posh people were my friends and I found everything they said hilarious, so I started making videos about things they'd say on nights out.\"His sketches, which more recently include impressions of Harry Potter characters as if they were Scottish, has earned him more than a million followers on TikTok. He's also tried to carve a space in stand-up - a move he admits has been challenging. \"It's entirely different doing content and comedy on stage,\" he says. \"Stand-up takes a lot of work and before the Fringe and my tour, there were so many pubs and awful gigs where I did a 20-minute set to zero laughs. It's certainly humbling.\" Despite his rising profile, Rowley protects much of his life from the public eye. \"I mainly post characters and sketches so people who follow me don't know that much about me, which is really nice. I like having that balance,\" he says. His advice for other people starting out creating content is similar to what most of the nominees said: \"Don't try and go viral but instead focus on doing something you are genuinely interested in.\" Bemi OrojuogunBemi, known as Bus Aunty, is nominated for best video of the year which has been watched 49 million timesIf London has an unofficial ambassador for its buses, it might just be Bus Aunty. Often seen smiling beside a passing double-decker, she's turned her lifelong love of the capital's transport network into a viral celebration of city life.\"My love for buses comes from a long time ago, from the early 90s,\" she says. \"I have always taken a picture of myself with buses and one random day I chose to post one on TikTok and it went viral, and now here we are.\" One of her videos, which is nominated for best video of the year, has been viewed amost 50 million times and Bemi now has collaborations with Burberry and Ikea. The mental health nurse has become one of TikTok's most unexpected success stories and she admits \"it's slightly overwhelming that everyone recognises me\".\"I get recognised in the streets sometimes and people say, 'Oh, hello, Bus Aunty.' I never thought people would be stopping me in my wildest dreams and it's taken some getting used to.\" \"To be nominated is amazing,\" she says of her TikTok Awards nod. \"If I'm nominated, it means I deserve to be here, and I really do love buses and love London and hopefully that shows.\" She's also proud to represent a different side of the app's community. \"You're never too old,\" she says firmly. \"I would never have thought I could do TikTok and be nominated for awards, but here I am, having only posted for just over a year.\"Never give up on your dream because what I love about London has got me here.\"Jack Edwards Jack EdwardsIf TikTok has a resident librarian, it's Jack Edwards, who has built a devoted following by sharing his love of reading. But he says his journey into social media stardom began with rejection.\"It was lockdown and I was looking for a job in publishing and no-one wanted to hire me,\" he recalls. \"My inbox was snorkelling in a sea of rejection and every email started with the word unfortunately.\"So I started talking about the books I was reading on social media.\"What began as a side project quickly turned into a full-time career, and Edwards ended up leaving the job he'd eventually secured in publishing. He says his advice to would-be creators is finding what makes their content personal.\"You have so many interests,\" he explains. \"If you were to create a Venn diagram of them all, the crossover in the middle is what you should make content about. For me, the cross-section is books, travel and pop culture.\"Edwards adds that he's careful about how much of himself he reveals to his audience. \"I talk about the books and art I love, but never the people I love,\" he says. \"But of course when you talk about books, you end up talking about everything from trauma, to politics, to sexuality.\"That openness has seen him create a community that stretches far beyond the screen.\"People say, 'Hi' in the street and it's the best thing ever. We have a mini book club right there on the pavement, an instant Jane Austen love-fest, and I know it's so strange but honestly it's really special for me.\"Still, internet fame brings its odd moments. \"Sometimes you get a message saying, 'Oh, hi, I just saw you at the urinal,'\" he laughs. \"Being spotted in those kinds of places never gets normal.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoYolande Knell and Jacob Evans,in JerusalemBBCThree year-old Zain Tafesh died from leukemia earlier this weekSo many lives in Gaza still hang in the balance.In different wards of Nasser Hospital lie two 10-year-old boys, one shot by Israeli fire and paralysed from the neck down, another with a brain tumour.Now that a fragile ceasefire is in place, they are among some 15,000 patients who the World Health Organization (WHO) says are in need of urgent medical evacuations.Amar Abu Said is paralysed from the neck and needs specialist treatmentOla Abu Said sits gently stroking the hair of her son, Amar.  His family says he was in their tent in southern Gaza when he was hit by a stray bullet fired by an Israeli drone.  It is lodged between two of his vertebrae, leaving him paralysed.\"He needs surgery urgently,\" Ola says, \"but it's complicated.  Doctors told us it could cause his death, a stroke or brain haemorrhage.  He needs surgery in a well-equipped place.\"Right now, Gaza is anything but that.  After two years of war, its hospitals have been left in a critical state.Ahmed al-Jadd and his sister Shahd lost their father in the warSitting by the bedside of her younger brother, Ahmed al-Jadd, his sister Shahd says her brother was a constant comfort to her through two years of war and displacement.\"He's only 10 and, when our situation got so bad, he used to go out and sell water to help bring some money for us,\" she says.  A few months ago, he showed the first signs of ill health.\"Ahmad's mouth started drooping to one side,\" Shahd explains. \"One time he kept telling me, 'Shahd my head hurts', and we just gave him paracetamol, but later, his right hand stopped moving.\"The one-time university student is desperate for her brother to travel abroad to have his tumour removed.\"We can't lose him. We already lost our father, our home and our dreams,\" Shahd says. \"When the ceasefire happened it gave us a bit of a hope that maybe there was a 1% chance that Ahmed could travel and get treated.\"ReutersInternational agencies are desperate to increase the number of evacuationsOn Wednesday, the WHO co-ordinated the first medical convoy to exit Gaza since the fragile ceasefire began on 10 October.  It took 41 patients and 145 carers to hospitals abroad via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, with ambulances and buses taking the group on to Jordan.  Some have stayed for care there.The UN agency has called for numbers of medical evacuations to be rapidly increased to deal with the thousands of cases of sick and wounded.  It wants to be able to bring out patients through Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt as it has done previously.However, Israel has said it is keeping the crossing closed until Hamas \"fulfils\" its commitments under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal by returning the bodies of deceased hostages. Israel has kept the Gaza side of the Egyptian border closed since May 2024 when it took control during the war.Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said \"the most impactful measure\" would be if Israel could allow Gazan patients to be treated in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as happened before the war.Top EU officials and foreign ministers of more than 20 countries - including the UK - have previously called for this, offering \"financial contributions, provision of medical staff or equipment needed\".A funeral was held for eight-year old Saadi Abu Taha who died this week from stomach cancer\"Hundreds of patients could be treated easily and efficiently in a short time if this route reopened to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network and the hospitals in the West Bank,\" says Dr Fadi Atrash, CEO of the Augusta Victoria Hospital on the Mount of Olives.\"We can at least treat 50 patients per day for chemotherapy and radiation and even more than that.  Other hospitals can do a lot of surgeries,\" the doctor told me.\"Referring them to East Jerusalem is the shortest distance, the most efficient way, because we have the mechanism. We speak the same language, we're the same culture, in many cases we have medical files for Gazan patients.  They've been receiving treatment in East Jerusalem hospitals for more than a decade before the war.\"The BBC asked Cogat, the Israeli defence body which controls Gaza's crossings, why the medical route was not being approved.  Cogat said it was a decision by the political echelon and referred queries to the prime minister's office, which did not offer further explanation.After the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, Israel cited security reasons for not allowing Gazan patients in other Palestinian territories.  It also pointed out that its main crossing point for people at Erez had been targeted by Hamas fighters during the assault.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that in the year to August 2025, at least 740 people, including nearly 140 children, died while on waiting lists.At Nasser hospital, the director of paediatrics and maternity, Dr Ahmed al-Farra, expresses his frustration.\"It's the most difficult feeling for a doctor to be present, able to diagnose a condition but unable to carry out essential tests and lacking the necessary treatments,\" Dr al-Farra says. \"This has happened in so many cases, and unfortunately, there's daily loss of life due to our lack of capabilities.\"Since the ceasefire, hope has run out for more of his patients.In the past week in the hospital grounds, a funeral took place for Saadi Abu Taha, aged eight, who died from intestinal cancer.A day later, three-year old Zain Tafesh and Luay Dweik, aged eight, died from hepatitis.Without action, there are many more Gazans who will not have a chance to live in peace.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship1 hour agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the world's largest warship to be sent to the Caribbean.The USS Gerald R Ford can carry up to 90 aircraft and its deployment marks a massive increase in US firepower in the region.The US has conducted 10 air strikes on vessels in the area as part of what it says is a war on drug traffickers. US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power. The US does not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?The Pentagon said on Friday that the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organisations\", spokesman Sean Parnell said.Maduro accused the US of seeking \"a new eternal war\" in his address.\"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,\" he told state media.The carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela.\"We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" he said earlier this week.The US has also bolstered its air presence in the region. BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.Military analysts have pointed out that intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroOn Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed in an operation in the Caribbean.He said the boat had belonged to the Tren de Aragua - a transnational criminal organisation which has its base in Venezuela and has been proscribed as a terrorist group by the US State Department.The US air strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. \"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up was intended to \"strike fear\" into the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike was the latest the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean as well.At least 43 people have been killed.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic senators wrote to the White House, alleging the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval. Trump has said he has the legal authority to order the strikes.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC that the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has appeared unwilling to challenge. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group.  ",

    "body": "3 hours agoDearbail JordanUK Ministry of DefenceA view from HMS Severn as it tracks Russia's RFN Stoikiy in the English ChannelTwo Russian warships were intercepted in the English Channel by the Royal Navy, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.In the latest incident involving Russia's ships entering waters around the UK, HMS Severn headed off the RFN Stoikiy, a corvette and Yelnya, a tanker, as they sailed west through the Dover Strait into the English Channel in the past fortnight.Last week, it emerged that the Russian spy ship Yantar was spotted off the coast of Scotland and it used lasers to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its movements.Defence Secretary John Healey branded the Yantar's move \"deeply dangerous\" and warned Russia and its president Vladimir Putin: \"We see you. We know what you're doing. We are ready.\"Healey said last week that there had been a 30% increase in Russian vessels threatening UK waters in the past two years.The MoD said after intercepting the Stoikiy and the Yelnya, the HMS Severn later handed over monitoring duties to a Nato ally off the coast of Brittany, north west Fr.It said the UK ship \"continued to observe from a distance and remained ready to respond to any unexpected activity\".It is not the first time the Stoikiy has been in British territory.In May, the Royal Navy dispatched two vessels and the 814 Naval Air Squadron - also known as the \"flying tigers\" - to shadow the Russian warship as it sailed west through the English Channel to meet the Sparta IV and General Skobelev.The two merchant vessels were returning from the Mediterranean and the group headed back to the Baltic Sea, watched by HMS Hurworth.Healey has said that the rise in Russian activity in UK waters was evidence of increased \"Russian aggression right across the board\" which he says is impacting Europe, not just Ukraine.At a news conference in Downing Street last week, the defence secretary said he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely \"when it is in our wider waters\".Built in 2002, HMS Severn is a River-class offshore patrol vessel. Together with her sister ships, HMS Tyne and HMS Mersey, the Royal Navy says the ships are able to \"escort passing foreign warships, mount fishing vessel inspections and defend the UK border\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsAn Australian man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed Hollywood star Ariana Grande has been deported and banned from Singapore.Johnson Wen, 26, was sentenced to nine days in prison for being a public nuisance and has now been \"barred from re-entering Singapore\", the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) told local media. Wen pushed past photographers and charged at the actress and singer, who was attending the Asian premier for Wicked: For Good on 13 November. Co-star Cynthia Erivo wrestled him away from Grande. Wen has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year.The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, with many accusing him of re-traumatising Grande. The pop star has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her concert in Manchester in May 2017 killed 22 people and injured hundreds.During Wen's trial, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the film's premiere twice, according to Singaporean media.He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and pinned him down.Wen later posted videos thanking Grande for letting him on the carpet and said he was \"free\". Police arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance, to which Wen pleaded guilty. The District Judge Christopher Goh was quoted by Channel News Asia as saying that Wen was \"attention seeking\", adding that he was wrong to think he would not suffer any consequences. Grande has not commented on the case. Erivo spoke about the incident to NBC, saying that she \"just wanted to make sure my friend was safe\".\"I'm sure he didn't mean us harm, but you never know with those things, and I wanted to make sure that she was OK. That was my first instinct,\" she said. ",

    "body": "42 minutes agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, BeirutIsrael's military has killed a senior member of the militant group Hezbollah in an air strike on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, despite a ceasefire.It described Haitham Ali al-Tabtabai, Hezbollah's chief of staff, as a veteran of the group who had held a series of senior positions.Lebanon's health ministry said at least five people were killed and 28 others wounded in the strike, which hit an apartment building in the densely populated Dahieh district.Hezbollah confirmed Tabtabai's death, adding Israel had crossed a \"red line\" in carrying out the strike.The strike is Israel's first on southern Beirut for months.It comes as Israel has escalated its campaign on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group supported by Iran - despite a ceasefire brokered by the US and France that came into effect last November.Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been trying to rebuild its military capabilities, is smuggling weapons into Lebanon and stepping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles, and there are growing fears of an escalation of hostilities.In a statement after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Under my leadership, the State of Israel will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild its power, and we will not allow it to once again pose a threat to the State of Israel.\"He said he expected the Lebanese government \"to fulfill its commitment to disarm Hezbollah\".Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel - which continues to occupy at least five locations in southern Lebanon - to stop the attacks and withdraw from the country, saying the Israeli actions are a violation of the agreement that put an end to 13 months of conflict.The Lebanese government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but the group has rejected calls to discuss the future of its weapons before Israel stops its attacks, fully withdraws from Lebanon, and releases Lebanese prisoners. A Western diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the authorities are under pressure from the Trump administration, which is growing impatient with what they see as the slow progress against the group, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and UK.The latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted after the Lebanese group started firing rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.The US government imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016 and designated him a terrorist. It has a $5m (£3.8m) award on offer for information about him.The US described him as a key Hezbollah military leader who once commanded the group's special forces in Syria and Yemen, adding his actions in these countries were part of a larger Hezbollah effort to provide training, material, and personnel \"in support of its destabilising regional activities\".",

    "body": "17 hours agoBen ChuPolicy and analysis correspondent, BBC VerifyGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming Budget is expected to justify tax increases as a vital measure to keep the UK's national debt under control.Some have argued keeping the national debt down protects the financial interests of younger people. That's because if the country's debt went up drastically, it is younger people who would have to foot the bill to pay for the interest on it. And it would be taken directly from their payslips through higher taxes.Generation Z, or those born between 1997 and 2012, have been hit in the pocket over the past 15 years by benefit cuts and dramatic increases in university tuition fees. Meanwhile, the homeownership rate of those born since the 1990s is well below that of earlier generations, due to the relative difficulty they have faced in getting on the housing ladder.However, most politicians, including the chancellor, are also committing to keep paying for the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees it rises each year by the highest of average wages, inflation or 2.5%.There's growing concern that current tax and spending policies help pensioners but are unfair on younger generations, and that the triple lock in particular will push up public spending and the national debt in the long term.So will this budget really help younger generations? Or could it help saddle them with higher taxes and more debt?BBC Verify has been looking at the numbers.Why is the national debt a concern?The UK's national debt currently stands at just under 100% of UK GDP, which is the value of all the goods and services produced by the economy in a year.The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned it could rise above 250% over the next 50 years unless taxes are raised or public spending is reduced.Some economists doubt such a steep and sustained debt surge would actually materialise, arguing it would likely trigger a bond market crisis long before then and see UK government borrowing costs pushed to extreme levels by private investors, which would instead force a change in tax policy or spending.Yet the OBR says the purpose of its long-term projection is to highlight that the UK's public finances are currently on what it calls an \"unsustainable\" trajectory.The biggest driver of rising long-term spending, and therefore the increase in the national debt according to the OBR, is our ageing population, which means the government needs to spend more money on the NHS, social care and the state pension each year.The number of people over 65 is projected to rise from 13 million to 22 million over the next five decades. That would push up the old age dependency ratio - the proportion of older people over the age of 65 relative to people aged 16 to 64 - from around 30% today to almost 50% by 2070.Today the state pension age is 66, but for people born after 1990 it's likely to be pushed higher to keep people working longer and reduce the old-age dependancy ratio.Even so, the national debt would still likely increase significantly from today's level because of these old age spending pressures.Do younger people lose out on public spending decisions?Since 2010, government policy on benefits has tended to help older generations and to take money away from younger generations.Over the past 15 years, the over 65s have received on average an extra £900 a year, while those under 65 have lost an average of £1,400 a year, according to calculations by the Resolution Foundation think tank.The driving force behind this has been the value of the state pension increasing faster than average wages since 2010 because of the triple lock, alongside government cuts to working-age benefits, including housing benefits, unemployment benefits and universal credit.The OBR projects that the triple lock will continue to push up state pension spending further in the coming decades.If the state pension were only tied to increases in average wages then its share of GDP would only rise from 5% today to 6% in 2070, according to the OBR. But instead it projects the cost of the triple lock will push government spending on the state pension to nearly 8% over the next 45 years.That might only be two extra percentage points, but it equates to around £60bn in today's money, and it would be younger working age people who would have to pay for it through their taxes.Which generations will benefit and lose from the Budget?The impact on different age groups will depend on which taxes increase and which benefits are protected.For instance, if high value homes were to face extra taxes, it would affect older people more as they tend to have greater property wealth.If you look at earnings, pensioners still have to pay income tax but are no longer subject to employee National Insurance.And younger people are deemed to have been hit harder by the increase in employer National Insurance contributions Rachel Reeves introduced in her first budget in October 2024, which appears to have slowed down job hiring rates.All taxpayers have a shared interest in seeing the debt burden brought under control as a share of the size of the economy. Though one of the reasons the government borrows is to pay for investment in infrastructure such as roads and housing. Some economists warn that if ministers reduced that kind of spending and borrowing out of concern over the national debt it could prove counterproductive and ultimately damaging to younger people.As for the triple lock, younger people could benefit from its continuation when they eventually retire themselves - and polling shows that 18-49 year olds are broadly in favour of keeping the policy.Nevertheless, in the context of the past 15 years, many economists argue younger people also have an interest in seeing a rebalancing of the treatment of older and younger generations through the tax and benefit system.",

    "body": "A Ukrainian refugee has become the first person from his country to win an elite-level sumo tournament.Danylo Yavhusishyn - known by his sumo ring name Aonishiki - arrived in Japan as an 18-year-old in 2022 after the Russian invasion of his country.Now aged 21, he is the first Ukrainian to claim the prized Emperor's Cup and the first European in almost eight years to do so.He is now on the verge of being promoted to the second-highest rank of Ozeki, in what would be the fastest promotion in history.Aonishiki finished the 15-day tournament in Fukuoka, Japan, with a record of 12 wins and three losses and went on to win the championship play-off against Yokozuna grand champion Hoshoryu, a 26-year-old Mongolian who won last month's London tournament.In his winning ceremony interview, Aonishiki was asked if he felt satisfied with his results after three years in sumo.\"No, I think this is just the beginning,\" he replied.The name Aonishiki contains the Japanese character for \"blue\" - a reference to the Ukrainian flag.Aonishiki is only the second Ukrainian in the top division in sumo. He first tried sumo aged seven, after also practicing judo and freestyle wrestling.He impressed in youth amateur sumo competitions, and fled to Germany with his family after Russia's invasion.He moved to Japan by himself in April 2022, without knowing the language, with the help of a university sumo club captain he met previously at a youth championship event.Despite only being in professional sumo for a short time, he has gained fans in Japan and worldwide with his impressive skills, constant improvement and competitiveness.He often defeats opponents with seldom-used techniques, receiving praise from both professionals and sumo enthusiasts.Aonishiki, who was one of the most cheered wrestlers at last month's Grand Sumo Tournament at the Royal Albert Hall in London, is tipped by many to become the first-ever European to reach sumo's highest rank of Yokozuna grand champion.",

The Christian Association of Nigeria says they have been reunited with their families.A major military-led search and rescue operation is under way for the remaining 265 children and 12 teachers who were taken with them.Authorities in several Nigerian states ordered schools to shut following the mass abduction in Niger and another smaller hostage-taking in Kebbi state on Monday when 20 pupils were kidnapped from a boarding school.  In another development, 38 people abducted from a church service in Kwara state last week were freed on Sunday, the state governor said.Two people were killed in the attack on Christ Apostolic Church in Eruku.Orders were given for many schools to close in the states of Kebbi, Niger, Katsina, Yobe and Kwara.News of the children's escape brought welcome relief for families and for a country that has been agonising over the fate of hundreds of schoolchildren abducted in Nigeria's northwest. According to a Christian group involved in the case, the pupils managed to escape between Friday and Saturday in what is being described as a brave and risky attempt to flee their captors.The students and teachers were taken from St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state. Earlier reports spoke of 303 students and 12 teachers being taken. Their number surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014.Local police say armed men stormed St Mary's at around 02:00 (01:00 GMT), abducting students staying there.Niger state governor Mohammed Umaru Bongo announced on Saturday that all schools in the area would close, warning that was \"not a time for blame game\".Calling for the release of the abductees, Pope Leo XIV expressed \"immense sadness\" and urged the authorities to act swiftly.Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... It took everybody by surprise.\"One distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13, had been kidnapped, adding: \"I just want them to come home.\"The military, police and local vigilantes are conducting a search for the children, combing nearby forests and remote routes believed to have been used by the gunmen.Authorities in Niger state said St Mary's School had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks. The school has not commented on that allegation.The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs, but it has had little effect.On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kebbi state.Authorities there have now ordered all secondary schools and colleges to close.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu postponed foreign trips - including to this weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address the security concerns.This week's attacks follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria.For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians. The Nigerian government has dismissed this claim.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".In the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority-Muslim north of the country.In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.The militant Islamist group Boko Haram took 276 girls from their school in the town of Chibok in 2014.The incident drew international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.Many have since either escaped or been freed, but as many as 100 remain missing.",

From the Epstein Files to the cost of living, Greene has been vocal in her criticism of the current administration.  It’s notable because MTG has been one of Trump’s most loyal allies and a powerful leader of the MAGA movement, and also because her interventions have been influential. \nSarah, Anthony and Marianna look back at Marjorie Taylor Greene’s rise and why she has been such an influential figure within Donald Trump’s MAGA base. \nAnd, Anthony’s in Tennessee for a special election where a House seat is being contested. We assess the Democratic party’s chances of winning this traditional Republican seat.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

    "body": "Rupert Grint: 'I'll never step out of Ron Weasley's shadow'19 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesRupert Grint has told the BBC he’s unlikely to ever \"step out\" of Ron Weasley's shadow, some 14 years after the release of the final Harry Potter film.\"I'm fine with that. I think it's great,\" he said. \"I love meeting people who really felt this was part of their childhood.\"Grint, 37, who played Ron in all eight of the franchise's movies, also revealed he has written a letter to the child actor playing Ron in the upcoming TV series.\"It's quite strange to have the cycle happening again,\" he said. \"I'm really intrigued what it's going to be like.\"Grint was speaking to BBC News at an event to switch on the Christmas lights in Highgate, north London, on Wednesday.The actor, who lives locally with his partner, actress Georgia Groome, and their two daughters, drew a crowd of fans to the Highgate Literary and Scientific Institution and Highgate Society.Getty ImagesEmma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint were the main stars throughout the film franchiseAs children, Grint and his co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson had their lives transformed by their wizarding roles in the big-screen adaptation of JK Rowling's books between 2001 and 2011.Grint was 11 when he was cast as Ron - who is characterised as one of Harry Potter's best friends at Hogwarts - and now describes the experience as being \"crazy\".\"It changed my whole life quite quickly,\" he said. \"I was a huge fan of the books, so for me it was like stepping into the books, and that was very special.\"Would Rupert Grint step back into the Harry Potter universe?Grint has switched on the Christmas lights in Highgate in the past as well.The festive free event was arranged by volunteers from the local community and funded by local businesses, schools and residents.Since the Potter films ended, Grint has had roles in films including Into the White, and in Apple TV series Servant. He's also appeared on stage, and in a number of Ed Sheeran's music videos.He told us he has \"a couple of things\" coming up next year, though he is not able to talk about them yet.But compared with Radcliffe and Watson, Grint has found it relatively hard to break out of his Potter role.Is he fed up of always being linked to a part he played decades ago? \"No, absolutely not, I love it,\" he said.\"It has a quite deep meaning to a lot of people of my generation, and even more to generations who are finding it now. It's great. It gives me a lot of pride. It was such a huge thing.\"I don't think I'll ever quite step out of his shadow, but I'm fine with that.\"Getty ImagesDaniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint on the set of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2006The three child actors who will play Harry, Ron and Hermione in the new HBO series were announced in May.Earlier this week, Radcliffe revealed he had sent a letter to Dominic McLaughlin, who is taking over the role of Harry.McLaughlin, 11, is also starring in a new iPlayer drama, Gifted, which starts on Monday on CBBC and iPlayer.Grint told us he has also written a letter to Alastair Stout, who will play Ron.\"I wrote him a letter, before they started, passing the baton as it were,\" he said.HBOArabella Stanton, Dominic McLaughlin and Alastair Stout were announced in May as the stars of the upcoming Harry Potter TV series\"It was really just wishing him all the best with it. I had so much fun stepping into this world, and I hope he has the same experience,\" he said.Grint said that when the new actors were announced, it took him \"straight back\" to when he, Radcliffe and Watson were cast. \"I still remember every second of it,\" he said.He sees \"a bit of family resemblance\" between himself and Stout.\"I think it's great that it's a whole new thing. It's going to be its own thing, and I think that will be fun,\" he added.He wouldn't discourage his children if they wanted to take on roles in the TV adaptation in the future, though.\"I don't see why not. It was so much fun,\" he said.Grint added the films were \"still a little bit too scary\" for his five-year-old daughter, named Wednesday, but she has watched some clips. \"And she loves it,\" he added.Getty ImagesRupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson with author JK Rowling at the world film premiere of Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone in 2001While Grint has largely been less prolific since the heyday of the Harry Potter films, in 2020, he was one of several stars of the Potter franchise who distanced themselves from Rowling when the author spoke out against trans activism, which Rowling said had eroded the concept of biological sex.As a row grew, the writer was accused of being transphobic, which she denied, saying she was worried about the effect on women in single-sex spaces.In September, Watson said she still loves Rowling and refused to \"cancel her out\" despite their differences on the subject. But her remarks were met with a stinging response from Rowling, who dismissed her as \"ignorant\".Grint, for his part, declined to comment on the row when we asked him about it on Wednesday.Could the future spell a return to wizardry for Grint? When asked whether he would follow in the footsteps of co-star Tom Felton - who recently returned as Draco Malfoy on Broadway - he said: \"Maybe in the future. Never say never.\"Getty ImagesTom Felton, who also starred in the Harry Potter films, has recently taken on a new Broadway role\"But for now, I think as much as I loved it, I'm enjoying stepping outside of that world,\" he added - even as Ron's shadow looms large.And if that wizardry could offer him the benefit of hindsight, which Hogwarts house would he be sorted into? \"I think I'm probably more Hufflepuff than Gryffindor,\" he admits.\"I like the vibe of Hufflepuff, I think. But Gryffindor is a close second.\"",

'Functional' coffees are hitting the high street20 hours agoGrace DeanGetty ImagesZak Haddad has been kickstarting his day with a cup of coffee infused with lion's mane - a type of mushroom - for the past three years.He says it gives him a \"really clear, focused feeling\", without the \"spike and crash you can sometimes get from strong coffee\".Coffees made with extra ingredients like mushrooms, protein and collagen are known as \"functional coffees\" - which aim to provide consumers with benefits beyond the typical caffeine boost. For years they've been a familiar sight in the aisles of health food stores, but more recently they've been cropping up in high street coffee shops too.So when Zak opened his own coffee shop - Sipp in Chorlton, Greater Manchester - in late 2023, he was eager to include mushroom coffees on the menu.Zak's shop has four different types of mushroom powder on its menu, which he says all have different benefits. Customers can pay an extra £1 to add a mushroom powder or a supplement called collagen to drinks from lattes to cappuccinos.Zak HaddadZak has been drinking lion's mane coffees for three years 'From niche wellness corners into the mainstream'Coffee made with mushrooms, like lion's mane, reishi and chaga, is believed to give people better focus \"without the jitters of regular coffee\", according to nutritionist Eli Brecher, though she notes that research is still ongoing. Over the past year as demand has risen, health food chain Holland and Barrett has almost doubled its range of mushroom coffees, it told the BBC.Even Marks & Spencer has started selling lion's mane lattes at its in-store cafes, nestled on the menu among hot chocolates and jacket potatoes.Coffee giant Starbucks started selling barista-made protein coffee in its US stores in September, with high-protein milk and cold foam. In the UK, you can pick up a bottle of Starbucks' pre-made protein coffee from the fridges at its coffee shops and in supermarkets, where it might be sold alongside chilled protein coffees by other brands such as Jimmy's and Emmi.Food research company Tastewise lists functional coffee as one of its top trends for 2026. It found the number of mushroom coffees on UK coffee shop menus has grown 30% over the past year.\"Functional coffees are shifting from niche wellness corners into the mainstream,\" says Ms Brecher, who herself drinks mushroom coffee. She says people are becoming \"much more interested in wellbeing, stress support and energy stability\", and that adding extra ingredients to a cup of coffee \"feels like an easy upgrade, rather than an overhaul\".Rii SchroerNutritionist Eli Brecher says coffee made with mushrooms is believed to give people better focus \"without the jitters\"The Black Sheep Coffee chain has been offering scoops of protein powder and CBD as add-ons to its drinks for some time, but earlier this year, it launched its \"functional health\" latte range. One, containing prebiotic fibres, aims to improve gut health. Another, with collagen, is meant to help people's skin. But it's the lion's mane latte that is Black Sheep's bestseller, according to Ben Fenton, their chief operating officer. And customer response to the drink has been \"far beyond\" what the company expected.Customers add functional add-ons to about 15% of all coffee, matcha and smoothie orders from Black Sheep, he says.Prices vary by location but at Black Sheep Coffee in Birmingham, adding a shot of lion's mane to your coffee costs 99p, and a shot of collagen costs £1.09. So if you buy a functional coffee every day, rather than your regular one, over the course of a month you'll spend about £30 more. Meanwhile, in the US Starbucks customers are paying $1 (76p) to add high-protein milk or $2 (£1.52) to add high-protein cold foam to their coffee.At Liverpool Street Station in London, not everyone I speak to seems enticed by the idea of paying extra for a functional coffee. And many say they haven't come across the concept of coffees made with ingredients like mushrooms and ashwagandha - a herb some people think helps with stress - before.Someone who is well-aware of the trend, however, is Mariam Begum.Every day, the 31-year-old drinks coffee with a shot of collagen, a protein some people take in supplement form because they believe it will help their skin, joints and hair. And sometimes Mariam adds protein powder, too.The self-described caffeine addict drinks three or four coffees a day. She'll either make them at home with collagen she's bought online or grab an iced coffee or flat white with collagen or protein from a coffee shop near where she lives in London.Unlike Mariam, Lauren Devlin, a former competitive power-lifter, has never bought a functional coffee from a cafe, but says she would if she ever saw them on a menu - even if she had to pay more.For years, she's been drinking both coffee and protein shakes every day. But about five years ago, the 38-year-old started combining the two. She now buys instant coffee containing collagen and protein powder online to make at home, which she says makes her \"feel fuller\" than a regular coffee.Lauren DevlinLauren Devlin likes to start her day with a protein coffeeSo how does functional coffee actually taste? I ordered a lion's mane coffee with oat milk from Black Sheep, dubbed its \"brain blend\", alongside a regular oat-milk latte. Andrew Salter, cofounder of mushroom drinks brand Dirtea, says lion's mane in particular has a subtle taste, and I found there was next to no difference between my functional coffee and the regular one. The mushroom latte was possibly slightly more bitter, but my perception may have been affected because I was expecting it to taste different. The texture and appearance of both coffees seemed identical.There's still a lot of confusion about the purpose of functional coffee -  Mr Salter says when he set up his brand \"99.9% of people asked if they were going to get high\". But the mushrooms used in coffees, like lion's mane, are a different species to magic mushrooms and aren't psychoactive.Grace Dean/BBCMy regular latte (left) and my lion's mane coffee (right) were pretty much indistinguishable Some who regularly drink functional coffees speak highly of their benefits.Ana Richardson, who lives in Cardiff, says lion's mane coffee made her feel like her brain \"just started working\" and it was easier to focus on one thing at a time after drinking it. But the 29-year-old, who ordered lion's mane online to add to coffees at home, found it expensive and switched to drinking lion's mane tincture mixed into water instead.Recently, Ana has also tried coffee with ashwagandha. \"I'm awake, but I'm not jittery,\"  she says of the drink. \"I'm not anxious.\"'An add-on, not a magic fix'Research into the effect of lion's mane's on brain function is still in its early stages, but  it is \"promising\", according to nutritional therapist Rakhi Lad. But she notes most mushroom coffees on the high street use small quantities of lion's mane, and that the quality can vary.As for protein coffee, the general population \"doesn't really struggle\" to get enough protein, says James Fleming, professor of sports nutrition at St Mary's University. In general, only the elderly and professional athletes need to worry about adding extra protein to their diets, he explains.The health benefits of functional coffees \"vary quite a lot and for most people, they're not essential,\" says Bini Suresh, from the British Dietetics Association. Often the doses of functional ingredients in coffees \"are too low to replicate the effects reported in research trials\", she adds.\"At present, there's no robust evidence that lion's mane in typical coffee doses can meaningfully improve memory, focus, or brain health.\" But the research is \"still emerging\", says nutritionist Eli Brecher.\"So if it makes you feel good and you have the budget for it, then go ahead and enjoy,\" she says. \"But the key is to remember that it's an add-on - not a magic fix.\" More weekend picks",

    "body": "In Ukraine's 'kill-zone', robots are a lifeline to troops trapped on perilous eastern front13 hours agoAbdujalil AbdurasulovIn eastern UkraineA robot being sent on a mission by Ukraine's fifth brigade to deliver supplies to troops on the frontline\"The toy is delivered,\" a Ukrainian soldier whispers into the radio.In the dead of night, he and his partner move quickly to roll out their cargo from a van. Speed is crucial as they are within the range of deadly Russian drones.The fifth brigade's new \"toy\" is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), a robot that provides a lifeline for Ukrainian troops at the front in Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine.Russian forces are relentlessly trying to cut off Ukraine's supply routes in the area.Without fresh food and ammunition, Ukraine's frontline soldiers would face a choice of either surrender or a costly retreat.Kyiv has sent special forces, elite assault units and drone groups to reinforce its troops in and around Pokrovsk, but Russia's grip on routes into the city means going in with armoured vehicles would bring almost certain death.Transporting heavy supplies on foot would be just as dangerous.This is where the robot, also known as a land drone, comes in place of traditional troop deployments.The battle of Pokrovsk will probably go down in history as the first in which unmanned ground vehicles were used on a mass scale, largely to deliver supplies and evacuate wounded.The robot is small enough to squeeze into a bicycle lane and looks like a mini tank without a turret.UGVs are difficult to spot, they are harder to jam than an aerial drone and, most importantly, soldiers can operate them remotely from a safer location.They save soldiers' lives and are the future of the army, according to Ihor, the head of unmanned systems for the 7th Corps of the Ukrainian army.About 90% of all supplies for Pokrovsk frontline are now delivered by UGVs, he says.Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to capture the city by choking the supply chains and relentlessly launching remote-controlled drones to target anything that moves in what is widely called \"the kill-zone\".This 30km-wide stretch of territory along the frontline is within reach of drones from both sides.Constant aerial reconnaissance means any movement in the kill-zone is quickly detected and attacked, by drones as well as conventional weapons such as artillery, mortar rounds and aerial bombs.It's a situation that military doctor Vitsik and his land drone operator Auditor know only too well. These are their call signs, not their real names.When they tried to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers from Pokrovsk last month they were quickly spotted and had only seconds to rush to a nearby house to escape the buzz of Russian drones.\"One drone after another attacked us,\" Vitsik recalls. \"As soon as the drone hit the ground and exploded, immediately the next one appeared. They also fired from artillery and mortars trying to kill us.\"The walls Vitsik and Auditor hid behind shook with each explosion. The barrage lasted for 59 minutes and they eventually slipped into a neighbouring building and escaped.Inside Pokrovsk the drone threat from above is ever present.\"We run from one bush to another, from one house to another, from one street to another,\" says Vitsik.Vitsik via BBCCombat medic 'Vitsik' was caught up in an almost hour long drone attack in the \"kill-zone\" when attempting to evacuate the woundedThanks to those \"first-person view\" drones, Russian troops are close to cutting off all routes leading to Pokrovsk.They claim to have surrounded the entire area, but Kyiv has repeatedly denied that.The head of Ukraine's HUR intelligence agency, Kyrylo Budanov, has told local media the situation in Pokrovsk is \"extremely difficult\" but Ukraine is \"still holding on there\".And yet moving troops into and around the city is extremely dangerous and Ukrainian forces have tried to limit rotating people in and out due to the high risks.As a result, soldiers remain in frontline positions for weeks, sometimes even months.It has made delivering supplies an even more pressing task, and that means the demand for unmanned ground vehicles is growing.A single unit of the 5th brigade can carry out several logistical missions with UGVs in one day.Each assignment starts in an old, shabby garage and the mission I watch is delivering water, ammunition and fuel to drone pilots.Vitsikkk via BBCPokrovsk is largely deserted but as a key road and rail junction, it is essential for Ukraine to keep the city from Russian controlSupplies are loaded on a land drone called Termit, capable of carrying about 200kg. The operator drives it by remote control into the back of a van which takes it closer to the frontline to preserve its battery.When it is dark, two soldiers jump out of the van and roll out the UGV.One of them informs the control room via radio that the land drone has been offloaded. Within seconds the operator several kilometres away confirms he is connected to the machine and Termit heads off to its destination.Machines like Termit have been used by some Ukrainian brigades since last year but they have become increasingly popular in recent months.At a workshop for the 79th brigade, engineers who previously made only aerial remote-controlled drones are now tasked with upgrading unmanned ground vehicles for use in combat zones.They apply camouflage, weld new platforms and add hardware for extra communication. But even with these improvements, UGVs are still vulnerable to drone attacks.Engineers are increasingly tasked to make the land drones combat zone ready adding camouflage and extra communication links \"No matter how well it is concealed, no matter what connection you use and how quickly it moves\", the machine can still be detected and destroyed, says a UGV operator with the call sign \"Lawyer\".During one mission to evacuate a wounded soldier from Pokrovsk, his unmanned vehicle hit a landmine damaging its tracks.Another land drone was sent on a rescue mission from a different unit, but it was destroyed too. Lawyer still does not know if the wounded soldier made it out alive.On average just one out of three UGVs manages to reach the city, says Ihor, from the unmanned systems department of the 7th Corps. While the majority of the small robots won't make it, the troops on the frontline are reliant on those that do.",

so who are we to question it now?\" Green added.</p><p>\"He has been that good over such a length of time where perhaps everyone sat in a studio or in the stands, who used to say 'oh no, there goes Jordan ranting again', should just shut up or instead say 'well, perhaps he knows what he is doing'.\"</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Improved-consistency-for-club-and-country\"><span>Improved consistency, for club and country</span></h2><p></p><div><p>For many years, people linked Pickford's on-pitch personality to his performances -

The government no longer publishes official data on the numbers of deaths of homeless people.</p><p>Among those who died was Anthony Marks, 51, who was assaulted in August 2024 near London's King's Cross station while sheltering in a bin shed.</p><p>Two weeks after being released from hospital, he was readmitted following a seizure and died. Four people have been charged over his death. </p><p>\"We shouldn't be surprised that people are dying on our streets,\" said Tim Renshaw, chief executive of the Archer Project, a homeless charity in Sheffield.</p><p>\"We have one of the worst systems in terms of making housing available to the poorest. We are looking at homelessness being related to health factors - trauma, depression, anxiety. And we've increasing levels of poverty.\"</p><p>In November 2024, three homeless women died within 10 days in Sheffield.</p><p>One of those, a woman in her 40s, was buried without a single person attending her funeral.</p><p>She'd been known to homeless services in Sheffield for a number of years, said Mr Renshaw, but the name they knew her by was not her registered name.</p><p>When her funeral was arranged in her official name, no-one recognised her. </p><p>\"It was an absolute tragedy,\" he said. \"We had people approaching us saying they'd liked to have attended her funeral.\"</p></div><div><p>Of the 1,611 people who died homeless in 2024, three quarters were men. Two-thirds of the deaths were of people living in temporary or supported accommodation, while 169 were rough sleeping. Eleven were children, though the Ministry said the true figure was likely to be higher.</p><p>The figures show that 1,142 deaths were in England, an increase of 16% on the year before.  </p><p>London had the highest total number of deaths, but the largest increases were in Nottingham, where the number of deaths doubled to 22, and in Exeter, where they more than doubled from eight to 21.</p><p>In Northern Ireland, deaths increased by more than a third between 2023 and 2024, to 211. Wales saw a small annual decrease, from 97 to 90.</p><p>In Scotland there was an 18% reduction overall from 206 to 168. The Museum of Homelessness found that deaths in both Glasgow and Edinburgh fell by around 40%.</p><p>The figures are compiled by the Museum's Dying Homeless Project.  It says its methodology does not include any estimates and that it is the only organisation collating the figures since the Office for National Statistics stopped doing so in 2022.</p><p>The deaths come as the number of people living in temporary accommodation across the UK is at record levels, while the number of people rough sleeping in England rose 20% in 2024 to 4,667, according to official statistics.</p></div><p></p><h2>Child deaths 'cannot be tolerated'</h2><p></p><div><p>Experts working with homeless people say they have yet to see any real policy differences since Labour took office.</p><p>They welcome Labour's commitment to building 180,000 homes for social rent over the next decade, but they say consistent multi-year funding to tackle the issue is so far lacking.</p><p>\"[Former housing secretary] Angela Rayner and [former homelessness minister] Rushanara Ali leaving their posts in 2025 lays bare the lack of leadership on homelessness and housing at all levels of government in the face of the worst homelessness crisis this country has ever seen,\" said Mr Turtle.</p><p>Homelessness Minister Alison McGovern said that government was \"expanding access to safe accommodation whilst also strengthening support services.</p><p>\"Every loss of a life, especially the death of a child is an abject failure that cannot be tolerated,\" she added.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Family photo Richard Sanders wearing a black T-shirt.

He had been dead nine days by then,\" she recalls.</p><p>The hostel told her they didn't have her next-of-kin details despite, she says, leaving her number with them following a previous visit. </p><p>A post-mortem had been carried out on Mr Sanders before his mother knew he'd died and his clothes were disposed of before she could retrieve them. </p><p>She still doesn't have a clear cause of death. \"I'm livid,\" she said, \"I wouldn't even know now [he'd died] if I hadn't continued to ring.\"</p><p>Mr Turtle said the museum's investigation showed \"how homeless people continue to be deeply failed\".</p><p>\"We are calling for urgent action from the government to alleviate this crisis.\"</p></div></article>",

Futures are agreements to buy or sell the asset at a pre-determined date in the future.</p><p>The US government shutdown, which was triggered by repeated impasses over public spending, is a \"tailwind for gold prices\", said OCBC's Christopher Wong, who is the Singapore-based bank's rates strategist.</p><p>Investors have turned to safe haven assets like gold during previous US government shutdowns.</p><p>It rose by nearly 4% during the month-long shutdown in Trump's first term in the White House.</p><p>But gold prices could fall if the shutdown ends more quickly than some investors are expecting, said Mr Wong.</p><p>Gold's \"unprecedented rally\" in the past month has surpassed analysts' expectations, said UOB bank's head of markets strategy Heng Koon How.</p><p>He added that the rise is also tied to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn1egyn4xo\">weakening US dollar</a> and more non-professional buyers, known as retail investors, purchasing gold.</p><p>Not everyone investing in gold buys the physical precious metal.</p><p>Some investors put their money into financial products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are backed by gold.</p><p>A record $64bn has been invested in gold ETFs so far this year, according to the World Gold Council trade association.</p></div><div><p>Gregor Gregerson, the founder of precious metals dealer and storage provider Silver Bullion, said he has seen customers numbers more than double in the last year.</p><p>Retail investors, banks and wealthy families have increasingly turned to gold, viewing it as a safeguard against global economic uncertainty, he said.</p><p>\"Most of our clients are long-term holders,\" Mr Gregersen added, explaining that the majority of his customers store their gold for more than four years.</p><p>\"Gold will fall at some point, but I believe given the economic environment, it's on an upward trend for a least five years,\" he said.</p><p>As Mr Gregersen highlighted, gold prices fall as well as rise.</p><p>Its price may dip if there is a hike in interest rates or geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties ease, said OCBC's Mr Wong.</p><p>In April, for instance, the price of gold fell by around 6% after Trump backed off from firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said.</p><p>\"Gold is often seen as a hedge against uncertainty, but the hedge can be unwound.\"</p><p>And in 2022, gold's<b> </b>value plunged from $2,000 to $1,600 an ounce, after the US central bank raised interest rates to curb the inflation which was triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, said UOB's Mr<b> </b>Heng.</p><p>A key risk to gold's current rally is a sudden resurgence in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates, he added.</p><p>The recent climb in gold prices reflects expectations that the Fed will lower interest rates, making gold more attractive, said Mr Wong.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump has ramped up pressure on the Fed, publicly criticising Mr Powell for not cutting rates quick enough and attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.</p><p>The president's targeting of the Fed can \"undermine confidence in the [its] ability to act as a credible, inflation-targeting central bank,\" said Mr Wong.</p><p>In such an environment, gold's role as a hedge against uncertainty \"gains renewed importance,\" he said.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>US scientist Dr Fred Ramsdell was on the last day of a three-week hike with his wife Laura O'Neill and their two dogs, deep in Montana's grizzly bear country, when Ms O'Neill suddenly started screaming.</p><p>But it was not a predator that had disturbed the quiet of their off-grid holiday: it was a flurry of text messages bearing the news that Dr Ramsdell had won the Nobel Prize for medicine.</p><p>Dr Ramsdell, whose phone had been on airplane mode when the Nobel committee tried to call him, told the BBC's Newshour Programme that his first response when his wife said, \"You've won the Nobel prize\" was: \"I did not.\"</p><p>To which Ms O'Neill replied that she had 200 text messages that suggested he had.</p></div><div><p>Dr Ramsdell, along with two other scientists, won the prize for their research into <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2knwvpd7vno\">how the immune system attacks hostile infections.</a> </p><p>The winners share a prize fund worth 11m Swedish kronor (£870,000).</p><p>After Ms O'Neill received the messages, the couple drove down to a small town in southern Montana in search of good phone signal. </p><p>\"By then it was probably three o'clock in the afternoon here, I called the Nobel Committee. Of course they were in bed, because it was probably one o'clock in the morning there,\" Dr Ramsell said.</p><p>Eventually, the immunologist was able to reach his fellow laureates, friends and officials at the Nobel Assembly - 20 hours after they first tried to reach him.</p><p>\"So it was an interesting day,\" he said. </p><p>Dr Thomas Perlmann, the secretary-general of the Nobel Assembly, told the New York Times it was the most difficult attempt to contact a winner since he assumed the role in 2016.</p><p>While the committee was trying to reach him, he \"was living his best life and was off the grid on a preplanned hiking trip,\" a spokesperson for his lab, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, said. </p><p>When asked by the BBC whether he thought it might be a trick that his wife might play on him, Dr Ramsdell said: \"I have a lot of friends, but they're not coordinated enough to pull off this joke, not with that many of them at the same time.\"</p><p>It was the latest incident in an often comic history of laureates learning they had won the prize. </p><p>Author Kazuo Ishiguro thought that news he had won the 2017 Nobel Prize for literature was a hoax, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/entertainment-arts-41517550\">until the BBC confirmed it in a call with him</a>.</p><p>In 2020, economist Paul Milgrom unplugged the phone when the Nobel committee called - in the middle of the night - to tell him he had won the Nobel for economics.</p><p>Instead, his co-winner Bob Wilson was forced to walk over to Milgrom's house, dressed in his pyjamas, and deliver the news through the security camera on his front door. </p><p>When a journalist informed the novelist Doris Lessing she had won the 2007 Nobel Prize for literature, she responded: \"Oh, Christ.\"</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><div><p>25 minutes ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Jack Fenwick</span><span>Political correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>A case involving two men accused of spying for China collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat, the UK's most senior prosecutor has said. </p><p>Charges against Christopher Cash, 30, and Christopher Berry, 33 - who both deny the allegations - were dropped by prosecutors last month prompting criticism from ministers and MPs.</p><p>In a rare intervention, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Stephen Parkinson said the Crown Prosecution Service tried to obtain further evidence from the government \"over many months\" but witness statements did not meet the threshold to prosecute.</p><p>Sir Keir Starmer said the government could only draw on the previous government's assessment which dubbed China an \"epoch-defining challenge\".</p></div><div><p>Mr Parkinson said while there was sufficient evidence to prosecute at the time charges were brought in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year had then raised the threshold needed to convict people under the Official Secrets Act.</p><p>China would have needed to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences by Mr Cash and Mr Berry, he said.</p><p>The government has always maintained it is \"frustrated\" the trial collapsed and Mr Parkinson's intervention comes after weeks of speculation about why the prosecution could not continue.</p><p>Sir Keir said that the government's description of China could not change retrospectively and had to be based on \"the position of the last government\".</p><p>Mr Berry, a teacher from Witney in Oxfordshire, and Mr Cash, a parliamentary researcher from Whitechapel in London, were arrested in March 2023 as part of an investigation that involved counter-terror police.</p><p>They<b> </b>were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.</p><p>Under the Official Secrets Act, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy.</p><p>Mr Parkinson said in a letter last month that \"the case could no longer proceed to trial since the evidence no longer met the evidential test\", adding that he could not go into the reasons why.</p><p>In his latest letter, sent to MPs, he said he was taking the \"unusual\" step of sharing more details because \"government briefings have been provided commenting on the evidential situation\".</p><p>The need to describe China as a threat to national security in order to prosecute  emerged during a separate spying case earlier this year of six Bulgarian nationals who had been spying for Russia. They were found guilty under the Official Secrets Act.</p><p>The act says that a person is guilty of espionage if they act in a manner \"prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state\" and passed on information that might be \"directly or indirectly useful to an enemy\".</p><p>Mr Parkinson said this case of the Bulgarian nationals clarified that an enemy under the terms of the Official Secrets Act \"includes a country which represents at the time of the offence, a threat to the national security of the UK\".</p><p>This meant \"further evidence should be obtained\" from the government in order to proceed with the prosecution but he added that the evidence was not \"forthcoming\".</p><p>\"Efforts to obtain that evidence were made over many months, but notwithstanding the fact that further witness statements were provided, none of these stated that at the time of the offence China represented a threat to national security,\" he said.</p></div><div><p>Former chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee and former attorney general Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it seemed \"somebody just missed something\" as at the time the prosecution commenced there \"needed to be focus on whether China was going to be described as an enemy or not\". </p><p>He added: \"It may matter less how you describe it in official government documents if you are prepared to put the evidence forward at a court case to explain why a country in fact constitutes an enemy status. </p><p>\"My impression from reading what the DPP - and from what Keir Starmer - has said is that there simply seems to have been a muddle. When this case started, there was a failure to get to grips with what might be required to be proved in court.\"</p><p>Grieve also spoke about an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://isc.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ISC-China.pdf\">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> report published in July 2023 which said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-66189243\">China has penetrated \"every sector\" of the UK's economy</a>.  </p><p>He added: \"It makes very sensible reading and I think it leaves one in absolutely no doubt that China's activities are on such a scale against the United Kingdom that I would describe them as an enemy.\"</p></div><div><p>The Sunday Times previously reported senior Whitehall officials had met to discuss the trial early last month before the charges were dropped.</p><p>Number 10's press secretary said on Monday \"the suggestion that the government withheld evidence, withdrew witnesses or restricted the ability of a witness to draw on a particular bit of evidence are all untrue\".</p><p>Since last year's general election, the Labour government has shown signs of wanting to re-set ties between the UK and China and is conducting a cross-Whitehall \"audit\" of Britain's relationship with the country.</p><p>In October 2024, David Lammy became only the second foreign secretary in six years to visit China, where he said Beijing and London should \"find pragmatic solutions to complex challenges\".</p><p>The UK's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, one of Sir Keir's most senior advisers and political allies, also visited the country earlier this year.</p><p>The trip, which took place in July, was not announced by the UK government, but became public when the Chinese government released details of a meeting between Mr Powell and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p><p>Beijing said Mr Powell had \"expressed Britain's willingness to enhance dialogue and communication with China to build a stable, practical and long-term partnership\".</p></div>",

    "body": "11 hours agoDearbail JordanAFP via Getty ImagesUS troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against ISTwo US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter have been killed in Syria in an ambush by an Islamic State (IS) gunman, the US Central Command (Centcom) has said.Officials said three other service members were injured in the attack, during which the gunman was \"engaged and killed\". Syria's state news said two Syrian service personnel were also injured.US President Donald Trump wrote on social media that it was \"an ISIS attack\" against the US and Syria and said there would be \"a very serious retaliation\". The Syrian government has issued a statement condemning the attack. The identities of those killed are being withheld for 24 hours until their next of kin have been informed, Centcom said.In a post on X, Centcom, which directs American military operations in Europe, Africa and the Indo-Pacific, said the attack was \"the result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman\", while a Pentagon official said initial assessments showed the attack was \"likely\" to be carried out by the Islamic State group.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security force.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.The ambush occurred in Palmyra, located in the centre of the country, while the soldiers were \"conducting a key leader engagement\", according to Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell.He added the attack is under investigation.A Pentagon official said: \"This attack took place in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"Trump added that the three injured US soldiers were \"doing well\".Getty ImagesUS and Syrian forces were ambushed in Palmyra in central SyriaUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said: \"Let it be known, if you target Americans - anywhere in the world you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"In a post on X, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said the country condemned the attack, and extended its condolences to the families of the victims. Tom Barrack, US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, said: \"I strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist ambush targeting a joint US–Syrian government patrol in central Syria.\"We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.\"Last month, President Ahmed al-Sharaa met with Donald Trump at the White House in a visit that the Syrian leader said was part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.Syria recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.The global coalition is aimed at eliminating the remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.In 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks. The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.",

    "body": "10 hours agoSima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondentandAlex SmithSpecialist rape and sexual offence investigation teams will be introduced to every police force in England and Wales by 2029, the government has pledged.It is part of a long-delayed plan aimed at halving violence against women and girls within a decade.The strategy - which will include funding for undercover units operating online, and a roll out of domestic abuse protection orders - is due to be unveiled on Thursday, after being pushed back three times this year.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the measures will help to \"bear down on abusers, stopping them in their tracks. Rapists, sex offenders and abusers will have nowhere to hide.\"The government says the new teams will have officers with specialist investigation skills for working on rape and sexual offence cases.More than 50% of police forces already have these teams in place, but the government says every force will have dedicated officers by 2029.It says staff will have the right training to understand the mindset of abusers and victims.Announcing the move, the home secretary said: \"This government has declared violence against women and girls a national emergency.\"For too long, these crimes have been considered a fact of life. That's not good enough. We will halve it in a decade.\"Also announced is a roll out of domestic abuse protection orders, which have been trialled over the last year, across England and Wales.They can ban individuals from contacting a victim, visiting their home or posting harmful content online, and can also be used in cases involving coercive or controlling behaviour. Breaching an order is a criminal offence.There will also be almost £2m in investment for special undercover units of police officers operating online - to target those harassing women and girls on the internet.A report released earlier this month found that more than a quarter of police forces in England and Wales had not implemented basic policies for investigating sexual offences.It said sexually-motivated crimes against women in public remained widespread, criticised the limited nature of data on them, and called for urgent action to prevent predators from offending.The publishing of the government's strategy has been long delayed. It was initially expected to be announced in the spring.In Labour's general election manifesto last year the party pledged to use \"every government tool available to target perpetrators and address the root causes of abuse and violence\".On Tuesday, the chairs of three Commons select committees raised their concerns over repeated delays in publishing the plans.The BBC has previously been told that changing attitudes among boys and young men will be at the centre of what is proposed.It is understood it will be built around three goals: preventing radicalisation of young men, stopping abusers, and supporting victims.Some domestic abuse survivors have told the BBC the time for talking is over - and these measures must be implemented quickly.",

    "body": "13 hours agoLaura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergEveryone should \"follow the rules\"  when guidance on single-sex spaces is released, the new head of the equality watchdog has told the BBC. Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), said \"things could be sorted out if there is goodwill and recognition that everybody has rights\", and that \"nobody is expecting there to be a toilet police\".The guidance, for businesses and services, was drawn up after a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in April that legally a woman should be defined by biological sex for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010.The BBC interview, to be broadcast on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, is Dr Stephenson's first in her new role.The EHRC's guidance was passed to the government three months ago, but it has yet to publish it formally, which would give the code of practice legal force.It aims to provide advice to businesses and services - such as women's refuges, gyms, hospitals or shopping centres - about how the Supreme Court ruling should work.Seen by the BBC after it was leaked, the 300-page document says single-sex spaces should only be open to people of the same biological sex, otherwise they cease to be single-sex areas. That would mean, for instance, that a trans woman – a biological male who identifies as a woman - would not be able to use women's toilets and changing rooms.The guidance says it may be legitimate for businesses or services to ask people to provide confirmation they are of the eligible sex \"by proportionate means\".This has all caused controversy and anger among some transgender campaigners.Dr Stephenson told the BBC: \"Nobody is expecting there to be a toilet police. \"But equally if there are situations where there are complaints about regular problems, then people might need to... improve signage, improve explanations, or make sure they have got alternative provision.\"She said she expected both service providers and people using these services to \"follow the rules\". Dr Stephenson was challenged on what facilities trans people should use if there were no alternatives, or what businesses should do if they did not have the space or resources to make extra provision.She said: \"There's often unisex provision and where there isn't, as I say, we need to think more broadly about how we make sure those that those facilities are available…\"If you've got, you know, two self-contained cubicles, one of which is labelled men and one of which is labelled women, then the most sensible thing in those circumstances for a service provider to do is to make both of those unisex.\"Dr Stephenson was appointed to the role in July and she started earlier this month. It was greeted with hostility by some trans campaigners, in part because she had donated money to the case of lawyer Allison Bailey, who won part of a tribunal claim that she was discriminated against because of her gender-critical views.In our interview, Dr Stephenson was adamant she could still be objective when considering trans issues. She said she donated to the case because she was frustrated by situations where \"women were being harassed and losing their jobs on the basis of lawfully held beliefs\". She said she had been concerned by the experiences of some women \"when trying to have meetings to discuss proposed changes in the law\".\"I thought it was important that actually in a democracy, if there is a proposed change to the law, people should be able to meet and discuss those changes without violence or intimidation,\" she said.  \"If that's taking a side, it's taking a side on the side of kind of democratic norms and open discussion and dialogue.\"The full interview will be on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.

    "body": "14 hours agoJames Cook,JerusalemandRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, IstanbulIsrael said it killed a senior Hamas commander on Saturday in a strike on a vehicle inside Gaza.In a joint statement, the Israeli military and security agency Shin Bet announced it had \"eliminated\" Raed Saad, the head of weapons production for Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in Gaza city.Saad had been regarded as one of the most prominent Qassam commanders and led several brigades during Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israeli communities east of Gaza City. The Hamas-run Civil Defence spokesman, Mahmoud Basal, told the BBC that four people were killed in the strike. He said multiple passers-by were also injured by the blast.A local Hamas official in Gaza told the BBC that the strike also killed Saad's aide and another lower-ranking official identified as Abu Imad al-Laban.The BBC is prevented by Israel from reporting independently from inside Gaza and is unable to verify details of the incident. The IDF and ISA joint statement added that Saad had been \"responsible for the deaths of many soldiers\" killed in the Gaza Strip as the result of explosive devices.Saad is believed to be a member of the newly formed five-member leadership military council established since a ceasefire took hold in October. Israel has attempted to kill him on multiple occasions.One of the most notable attempts was during a surprise Israeli operation in Gaza City in March 2024, when Israeli forces reportedly sought to arrest or kill him. Sources at the time said Saad had been inside the targeted complex but managed to escape moments before the raid.He has long been considered one of Israel's most wanted Hamas figures, with Israeli attempts to kill him spanning more than two decades.Saturday's attack happened on the Palestinian-controlled side of the so-called Yellow Line which has divided Gaza since an unstable US-led ceasefire came into effect on 10 October.Israeli forces control the area to the east of the line, which includes just over half of the Gaza Strip.The first phase of US president Donald Trump's 20-point plan for peace in the region required the return of all 20 living and 28 dead hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.About 1,200 people were killed in the attack and more than 250 people were taken hostage.All have been returned except for the remains of an Israeli police officer, Ran Gvili, 24, who is believed to have been killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim.Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action.The diplomatic focus is now shifting to the next stage of President Trump's plan which would require the disarmament of Hamas as part of what it calls the de-radicalisation and redevelopment of Gaza.It envisages Gaza being run by the \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee,\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Trump.Security would be provided by an International Stabilisation Force although its make up remains unclear.The eventual aim is for a reformed Palestinian Authority to take control of the territory, and for Israeli forces to withdraw, after which \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\". Many aspects of the plan are controversial in Israel where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state.Trump is due to meet Netanyahu to discuss the plan in the US on 29 December.",

    "body": "3 hours ago\"Starmer rocked by new Andy Burnham coup plot\" is the Mail on Sunday's top story, detailing the Manchester Labour mayor's apparent \"deal\" to become an MP. Citing unnamed sources, the paper claims Burnham is close to striking \"a deal to fight a by-election to return to the Commons and mount a leadership challenge\" against Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.Relatives of Virginia Giuffre proclaim \"justice has not been served\" after the Metropolitan Police dropped an investigation into Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the Sun reports. The former prince was accused of asking his personal police officer to dig up information about Giuffre. Andrew has consistently denied all allegations against him.Health Secretary Wes Streeting warns \"Britain facing tsuanmi of flu\", writes the Sunday People in its top story. Hospital admissions are up 50% \"with the worst to come\", the paper writes, quoting Streeting.Hospital paediatric units are full due to a \"spike in flu cases\" across the UK, the Independent reports, leading to \"children's operations being cancelled\", including cardiac procedures. Overcrowded wards are \"increasing the risk of medical emergencies\", the paper writes.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch will \"ditch the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars\" if she defeats Labour at the next election, the Sunday Telegraph says. Writing for the paper, Badenoch calls the government's electric vehicles quota an \"economic act of self-harm\", as she vows to unwind the commitment. The paper says Downing Street has insisted it will press ahead with the ban.The Sunday Express leads with its investigation into an alleged government scheme for \"failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals to leave voluntarily\". According to the paper, \"illegal migrants are getting help setting up businesses and are being handed accommodation, food, and travel assistance\" on returning to their \"home country\". A Home Office spokesperson says the claims are \"untrue\", telling the paper: \"This scheme ensures migrants return to their home country, settle and don't re-enter the UK for a fraction of the price.\"\"Home Sec to announce crackdown on violence against women\", writes the Sunday Mirror in its top story, declaring it a \"national emergency\". The paper says offences \"will be disclosed to new partners, all police forces will get specialist units, and squads will track down online predators\".\"Tens of thousands of people have followed the King's advice to check their eligibility for cancer screening\", writes the Sunday Times on its front page. It follows, in the paper's words, King Charles's \"heartfelt speech on Friday about his diagnosis\".The Observer depicts the government's social media debate on its front page as a Shakespearean dilemma: \"to ban or not to ban\". Australia became the first country to impose a 16-year-old age limit on social media earlier this week and the UK government is now \"split\" over whether to pursue a similar measure.\"TV star Jeremy Clarkson reckons he has picked up a swathe of female admirers since he started hosting Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\" according to the Daily Star. The paper calls it the \"unlikeliest showbiz exclusive of the year\".According to the Sunday Times, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has identified a seat at Westminster and wants to return as an MP before May's local elections. The Mail on Sunday calls it a \"coup plot\". The paper says Burnham's strategists have drawn up a potential list of seats including Greater Manchester, which is held by Andrew Gwynne. A poll in the Sunday Express suggests Burnham has backing from the public, with one in three of those questioned saying he would make the best prime minister.ReutersThe Sunday Telegraph leads on the Conservatives' pledge to scrap the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Writing in the paper, the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, says that pressing ahead with the policy puts the domestic car industry at a \"disadvantage\" while giving others the \"opportunity to dominate global supply chains\". The Telegraph's editorial urges the government to \"consider showing some humility\" and adopt the Tory policy.\"No place to hide for sex offenders\", is the message from the Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, in the Sunday Mirror as she announces the expansion of specialist police units to bring them to justice. According to the Sun on Sunday, Mahmood has also told officers and detectives to use counter-terror style technology to target rapists and stalkers. The editorial in the Sunday Express describes the issue of violence against women and girls as a \"true national emergency\", but warns this strategy \"must not just be a public relations exercise\".\"To ban or not to ban\", asks the Observer, as it leads on Australia's decision last week to stop under-16s from accessing social media. The paper says the \"smart course\" would be for Britain to follow suit, saying two-thirds of adults in the UK would support a ban too.The Sunday Times warns that restrictions will not work without the participation of the US, which it says is \"the country at the heart of the problem\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "12 minutes agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, Vilnius, LithuaniaWatch: BBC captures celebrations as Belarus frees political prisonersRumours of a major prisoner release from Belarus had been swirling for a couple of days.But no one would reveal the names on the list, or the exact number, until everyone was safely out, finally free.In total,123 political prisoners have been released, including some of the best-known names among Belarusian opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists.Maria Kolesnikova, the protest leader with a famous red-lipsticked smile, was on the release list.A video of her jumping for joy and hugging other former prisoners, overjoyed to be reunited, was soon flying around social media. Then came another, on a bus out of Belarus, where she thanked everyone who'd helped bring this moment about.\"It's a feeling of incredible happiness to see those who are dear to me, to hug them and realise we are all free,\" Masha, as she's best known, told the camera, her lips already painted red again.The first sunset of her freedom was a thing of great beauty, she said.\"But I also think of those who are not yet free and I await the moment when we can all embrace, when all are free.\"ReutersMaria Kolesnikova (centre) was among more than 100 prisoners handed over to UkraineOut too is Viktor Babaryka, a banker who tried to run for president in 2020 but was locked up before the elections even began.The Nobel Peace prize winner Ales Bialiatski has also been released from a 10-year sentence.All were locked up for their opposition to the authoritarian rule of Alexander Lukashenko, whose security forces crushed the mass protests of 2020 with brutal force. They were the biggest challenge to his rule that he has ever faced. The prisoners' release now is the result of long and complex negotiations led by the US that culminated in a two-day visit to Minsk this week by Donald Trump's new special envoy, John Coale.For Lukashenko, that engagement itself is a win: after years as a political pariah in the West he is clearly happy to be back on talking terms with the US.But he also got US sanctions dropped on a key export for his country, potash, as a further, more tangible reward. EU penalties - and tougher policies - are still in place.It's not entirely clear what Trump has to gain from this. But Belarus is a close ally of Russia, including in its war on Ukraine, and the move comes as the US has been re-engaging with Moscow too, seeking a peace deal.EPA/ShutterstockNobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski was one of the prisoners releasedThe dozens of prisoners Lukashenko agreed to let go were always expected to come here to Vilnius, Lithuania, where a crowd of friends, relatives and fellow activists gathered outside the US embassy in the freezing cold to greet them.Some came wrapped in the red and white opposition flag of Belarus.Tatsiana Khomich, Masha Kolesnikova's sister who had campaigned for over five years for her release, couldn't stop smiling. \"I've just spoken to Masha,\" she told me after a video call.A professional flautist before the disputed 2020 elections, Kolesnikova spent much of her more than five-year sentence in total isolation, denied even letters and phone calls to her family.\"She's fine, she's good. I just want to hug her. I still can't quite believe it,\" her sister said.Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd: a police car, blue lights flashing, was heading towards the US embassy gates, leading a small convoy of other vehicles.But there was no way all 123 ex-prisoners were inside. Instead, we learned, just seven foreign nationals had been brought to Lithuania and only Ales Bialiatski of the Belarusians.'Optimism and activism'The others, including Kolesnikova, had been taken out of Belarus to Ukraine: from prison, into a war zone.Staying in their own country is not usually an option on offer.\"Lukashenko's idea, who else?\" was how one of opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's team interpreted the surprise diversion to Ukraine. It seems he'd decided to play one final power game, so the family reunions, so long awaited, would be delayed.But what of the price paid for that moment? Tikhanovskaya is a friend and political ally of Masha Kolesnikova, but she always calls for maximum pressure on Lukashenko by the West.So has the US gone too far, I wondered.\"This is a process of negotiation. Of course, it would be good for us if nothing is given to Lukashenko, because all those people are hostages of his regime. They are innocent.\"But this is how negotiation goes,\" she replied, before noting that sanctions can always be reapplied if necessary.\"President Trump now uses carrots. He also can use sticks.\"A few steps away, a man waving a giant flag worried that Lukashenko would just take more prisoners. This is not a sign of sudden humanity, he said.After a short time inside the US embassy, Ales Bialiatski emerged onto the street to ecstatic cheers from the crowd.Gaunt, head shaven and still in his padded blue prison jacket, he admitted his head was spinning from all the sensations after four years in jail.\"I was driven across Belarus in a blindfold, from east to west, so I still can't get my head round it. This is so emotional,\" he shared, describing being woken at 04:00 and told by his prison guard to pack.When I asked what he wanted now most of all he didn't hesitate: \"I want to see my wife!\"She's on her way, I was told.Bialiatski's own organisation, Viasna, monitors political detentions in Belarus and the activist reminded everyone that many people like him - only less well known - have been left behind bars.\"It is very important for everyone to continue to work for those political prisoners who are still in Belarusian prisons, to strive for the complete release of all of them.\"Then, lifting the red and white flag from his shoulders, he had a message for Belarusians everywhere.\"Optimism and activism,\" Ales Bialiatski told them, with a sudden smile. \"Never give up!\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosandAlex SmithWatch: King Charles issues update on his cancer treatmentThe King will be \"greatly encouraged and deeply touched\" by the positive reaction  to a television broadcast where he talked about his cancer treatment, Buckingham Palace has said.In a recorded message, broadcast on Friday as part of Channel 4's Stand Up To Cancer campaign, King Charles said his treatment was being reduced, and urged people to take up offers of cancer screening, saying \"early diagnosis quite simply saves lives.\"The King's type of cancer has not been revealed, and he will continue to receive treatment and monitoring.The Palace said the King \"will be particularly pleased at the way it has helped to shine a light on the benefits of cancer screening programmes.\"\"It has long been the King's view that if some public good can come from sharing elements of his personal diagnosis and treatment journey, then it would be his pleasure and duty to do so.\"His thoughts and warmest wishes will remain with all those affected by cancer and those who care for them.\"Charity Cancer Research UK says around 100,000 people have visited its new online screening checker since it was launched on 5 December - a majority of which came after the King's message was broadcast on Friday night.That tool allows people to check whether they are eligible for NHS and Public Health Agency cancer screenings in their local area.The King, who revealed his diagnosis in February last year, is not described as being in remission or \"cured\" but the regularity of his treatment will be significantly reduced in the new year.In his video message, recorded in Clarence House two weeks ago, he said that he was \"troubled\" to learn that nine million people around the UK are not up to date with the cancer screening available to them.\"That is at least nine million opportunities for early diagnosis being missed,\" he said.He added: \"Too often, I am told, people avoid screening because they imagine it may be frightening, embarrassing or uncomfortable.\"If and when they do finally take up their invitation, they are glad they took part.\"A few moments of minor inconvenience are a small price to pay for the reassurance that comes for most people when they are either told either they don't need further tests or, for some, are given the chance to enable early detection, with the life-saving intervention that can follow.\"PA MediaThe King attended a service at Westminster Abbey on Wednesday as he keeps a busy schedule despite receiving weekly treatmentFollowing the broadcast, the King was praised for his candour in talking about his cancer treatment.Clare Garnsey, the associate medical director of the Greater Manchester Cancer Alliance, said his message was \"very powerful\".Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Miss Garnsey said she, \"like the majority of health professionals who work in the cancer field\" was \"really thankful\" for what the King said.\"I think the message was very powerful about the importance of early diagnosis and how important it is that we all attend for our screening,\" she added.She said it is \"really helpful\" to healthcare professionals when people in \"positions of influence\" - such as the King - speak publicly about their experiences with cancer.These messages highlight that it \"can happen to anybody\", she said, and raise awareness of the potential symptoms someone may experience.Royal biographer and friend of King Charles, Jonathan Dimbleby, said the King's message demonstrated the \"unique role of the sovereign\".Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the King's decision to speak openly about his treatment in such \"warm, gentle, thoughtful, kind terms\" was \"quite extraordinary and it has great impact\".He said the King's message will give people \"great reassurance\" to hear of someone who \"has a cancer and lives with that cancer\".\"It makes you recognise [...] that it's not a death sentence,\" he added.Dimbleby's father, broadcaster Richard Dimbleby, died at 52 in 1965.\"When he died, he had been frightened to say, in advance to himself even, that he had cancer,\" he said, adding that the word cancer was \"hardly usable then\".He said it took \"guts\" for the King to share such a personal message publicly, but \"the fact that he came out and did that will save lives, and people will be less frightened of saying 'we must go and get a test'.\"Dimbleby said that when it was announced that the King was having treatment for an enlarged prostate in 2024, there was a considerable surge in searches to the NHS website.\"No-one else could have done this,\" he added.What can be general symptoms of cancer?Different types of cancer all have their own symptoms - but the NHS says general symptoms can include:A new lump or swellingSweating a lot or a high temperatureFeeling more tired than usualUnusual bruising or bleedingUnusual pain anywhere in the bodyUnexpected weight loss or loss of appetiteNeeding to pee more often or more urgently, or pain when you peeRead more on the NHS website.Until now the King has said little publicly about his illness.In his video message, King Charles said he knew how \"overwhelming\" a diagnosis can feel, but stressed that early detection is \"key\" to give patients the \"precious gift of hope\".The NHS has three cancer screening programmes - for bowel, breast and cervical cancer - available to certain age groups.These tests can detect a problem even before someone experiences symptoms.In his message, the King also urged people to use the screening checker online tool.Cancer charity Macmillan Cancer Support said it was \"incredibly grateful\" to the King for sharing his experience \"with such openness and honesty\".\"The King's reminder of the importance of screening and early detection is an important message for us all,\" it added in a statement.The prime minister said the King's message was \"powerful\" and that he was \"glad\" that the King's treatment will be reduced in the new year.According to Buckingham Palace, the King's recovery has reached a very positive stage and he has \"responded exceptionally well to treatment\", so much so that doctors will now move his treatment \"into a precautionary phase\".Meanwhile, Dr Harrison Carter, director of screening at NHS England, said the health service \"fully supported\" the King's call for people to attend screening tests.\"So, when your NHS screening invite arrives, whether it's for cervical or breast screening, or a bowel cancer testing kit through the post, please do make time to take it up.\"",

    "body": "'A nightmare' - The battle over Warner Bros is turning Hollywood upside down 8 hours agoRegan MorrisHollywoodGetty ImagesDisaster, catastrophe and nightmare. That's how Hollywood's creative workers describe the fall of the once mighty Warner Bros, as Netflix and Paramount battle to buy the historic studio and tinsel town braces for more upheaval and job losses.Warner's decline and impending sale – whether it's to Paramount Skydance as a whole, or to Netflix cut up in parts – is being mourned in Hollywood, where a historic production slump has already battered the entertainment industry. The loss of the studio, which has created iconic films ranging from Casablanca and Goodfellas to Batman and Harry Potter, likely means more job cuts and definitely means one less buyer of film and TV projects.Interviews with dozens of actors, producers and camera crews by the BBC reveal an industry attempting to weigh the lesser of two evils: control by a tech giant blamed for killing movie theatres (Netflix) or billionaires seen as too cosy with President Trump (Paramount).\"David Ellison is a right-wing billionaire Trumper,\" a camera assistant said of the Paramount Skydance CEO who is the son of billionaire Oracle co-founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison. \"Netflix is much more historically inclined to not micromanage production.\"If Netflix gets the deal they want, they will buy Warner Bros' crown jewels – the 102-year-old studio, HBO, and its vast archive of films and TV shows – leaving Warners's legacy TV networks, like CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, for another buyer.Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance's $108bn(£81bn) hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros includes backing from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and a fund started by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.It has raised concerns about the possibility of censorship and government overreach.President Trump added fuel to the fire when he said \"it's imperative that CNN be sold\".The Warner Bros deal is the latest in a long line of major shake-ups in Hollywood since the pandemic. Film and TV productions ground to a halt in 2023 during simultaneous actor and writer strikes. Seemingly everyone in Hollywood was working in 2022 as studios and streaming services went into creative overdrive after Covid shutdowns. But when the labour strikes ended, the production boom never returned.The fallout has meant that many media companies have had to close doors - or merge. David Ellison's Skydance Media bought Paramount, another legendary Hollywood studio, earlier this summer, leading to thousands of job losses.When Warner Bros put up a for-sale sign, Paramount launched an eager campaign to buy the company. But the studio ultimately announced a tentative deal with Netflix. A spurned Paramount then went direct to Warner Bros Discovery shareholders with a hostile takeover offer that they say is \"superior\" to the Netflix deal.Getty ImagesWhether they're rooting for Paramount or Netflix or another potential buyer, the one thing people in Hollywood seem to agree on is this story's villain - Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who earned $51.9m last year as Warner Bros lost more than $11bn and the company's stock fell nearly 7%.\"I watched Warner Bros struggle since David Zaslav became the CEO and ran it into the ground,\" says an actor who lost his home after his work dried up. He did not want to be identified because he still hopes to work for Netflix and Paramount.More than one person compared Mr Zaslav to the fictional movie character Gordon Gekko who proclaims \"greed is good\" in the 1987 movie Wall Street.Mr Zaslav took over in 2022 during another massive merger of Discovery, Inc., which he ran, with AT&T's WarnerMedia, creating Warner Bros Discovery. The consolidation saw several thousand jobs cut - and lavish pay packages for Mr Zaslav.\"Zaslav is just Gordon Gekko – he came in, broke it and sold it all,\" says a producer who was working on the Warner Bros lot. \"He said I will make all shareholders rich and who cares what the history of this place is.\"Warner Bros objected to that characterisation. \"Under the leadership of David and the talented team at WBD over the past three and a half years, the studio has regained its leadership position with a unique slate of films led by original content, seen the relaunch of the DC Universe under a single unified leadership team with ten year plan and the streaming service has launched globally and become profitable for the first time ever,\" Warner's head of communications Robert Gibbs said in a statement to the BBC. For many film workers, whoever buys Warner Bros has felt almost irrelevant. They have instead been focusing on how to reinvent themselves as the industry shrinks amid consolidation and the growing use of AI in entertainment.\"Every morning, no matter how much I tell myself to stay positive, I wake up feeling like I've failed in every direction,\" says an actor who is now homeless with his wife and two children, relying on the kindness of friends and food banks while he works odd jobs. He asked not to be identified out of fear it could impact future work.\"I would rather see Netflix purchase Warner Bros then foreign money,\" he says.Others are not so sure. The tech giant has arguably been the industry's greatest disrupter since Warner Bros pioneered \"the talkies\" in 1927.\"I think it's a disaster,\" says a film exhibitor who did not want to be identified because they work with Netflix. \"This is a company openly, proudly saying theatres aren't necessary anymore. That's scary. It's a nightmare.\"Many theatres in the US refuse to screen Netflix movies because of their streaming-first strategy.\"At least with Paramount, we know movies will make it to the big screen. They didn't kill movie theatres,\" said one producer who has worked for all three companies.Netflix has sought to alleviate those fears, saying they expect \"to maintain Warner Bros' current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.\"Many in Hollywood want to believe them.Getty ImagesJohn Evans, a sound technician who dabbles in acting, writing and producing, points to Netflix's loving restoration of The Egyptian Theatre along iconic Hollywood Boulevard as a sign of their good faith.The Egyptian, a classic 1922 theatre, was the site of the world's first movie premiere – Robin Hood starring Douglas Fairbanks – and had fallen into disrepair before Netflix bought the property in 2020 and gave it a $70m makeover.\"I think it's a good sign,\" Mr Evans said, adding that streaming is how many film workers consume movies and TV like the rest of the world.On the backlot at Warner Bros, tourists snap selfies in front of the Central Perk cafe set from Friends, and stroll by facades of buildings that stand-in for New York or Los Angeles. Inside the offices and writers' rooms, for those still working, it's business as usual.\"I've gone through seven mergers,\" a producer working on the Warner Bros lot said while developing a new show, explaining it's sad to lose a studio because it means it will be even harder to get shows made and sold with one less customer. \"But if you make good stuff, you make good stuff.\"The producer spoke on the condition of anonymity on the day that Paramount Skydance announced their hostile takeover bid. They said they were too busy to worry about the sale because they were trying to get a show on air – and they wouldn't be surprised if another billionaire or trillionaire made another offer for the studio by the end of all this. \"I joke about Elon walking in and doing this, but he could,\" they said of the Tesla and X owner. \"When you have people worth a trillion dollars, there are no rules.\"",

    "body": "6 days agoCatherine Burns,Health correspondent,Vicki Loader,Health producerandHarriet AgerholmGetty ImagesHundreds of GPs across England have told the BBC they think mental health problems are being over-diagnosed. One commonly-held view by family doctors, our research suggests, is that society tends to over-medicalise normal life stresses. But they're also concerned about how hard it is to get help for patients with mental health conditions.Earlier this week, the Health Secretary ordered an independent review into the reasons for a rising demand for mental health, ADHD and autism services in England, and where the gaps in support are.BBC News sent a questionnaire to more than 5,000 GPs in England asking about their experiences helping patients with mental health concerns. Their responses give an insight into how challenging this issue is for many family doctors.Of the 752 GPs who chose to took part in our research, 442 said they believed that over-diagnosis is a concern. More said mental health problems were over-diagnosed by a little than over-diagnosed by a lot.Eighty-one GPs who responded felt that mental health problems were under-diagnosed.Over-diagnosis of mental health issues was far from their only concern. Many GPs also told us they were worried about a lack of help for patients.For our questionnaire, GPs answered several questions and were invited to leave anonymous comments.One of the most common themes to emerge can be summed up in this remark from a GP: \"Life being stressful is not an illness.\"Another commented: \"As a society we seem to have forgotten that life can be tough - a broken heart or grief is painful and normal, and we have to learn to cope.\"Yet another argued that giving people labels such as anxiety or depression \"over-medicalises life and emotional difficulties\", and that this was taking resources away from people with severe needs.A small number of GPs were strongly critical of some patients. One described them as \"dishonest, narcissistic… gaming a system free at point of use.\"Overall, one in five adults in England report having a common mental health condition, like anxiety or depression, according to a survey published by NHS England. Rates are even higher in young people. For 16-24 year olds, it's one-in-four.The GPs who took part in our research identified 19-34 year olds as the age group who needed the most support with mental health issues.One commented that young adults \"seem to be less resilient since Covid\", suggesting they're more concerned with getting a diagnosis than finding coping strategies.But other GPs said the real issue was under-diagnosis.\"People need to be accepted, helped and encouraged to live life,\" one said, while another said services were very reluctant \"to fully assess and diagnose\" patients.There are almost 40,000 fully-qualified GPs in England and we cannot know if the group who took part in our research is representative of all family doctors.While the government review will look at mental health, autism and ADHD services,  our questionnaire focused specifically on mental health. Some GPs did comment on neurodiversity too, but we only used comments focusing on mental health.We asked GPs who had been in the job for at least five years how the amount of time they spend working on mental health has changed. Almost all said it has increased.The three main reasons they gave for this were:having to support patients who can't get good quality mental health help elsewherepractical issues like housing, employment or finances impacting patients' mental healthpatients thinking they have a mental health issue, when they're dealing with normal challenges in lifeEarlier this year, the health secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that mental health conditions were being over-diagnosed and too many people were being \"written off\". He now says his comments were \"divisive\" and that \"he failed to capture the complexity of this problem.\"It is thought that 2.5 million people in England have ADHD – including those without a diagnosis. Some NHS services for ADHD have closed their doors to new patients because they are struggling to cope with the demand.Patients have told the BBC about how hard they find it to get proper care and support.All in all, there's a consensus that the NHS is not meeting rising demand in this area.A clear majority of GPs who took part in our research, 508 of 752, said there was rarely or never enough good quality mental health help available for adults in their area.Even more, some 640 GPs, told us they were worried about getting young patients the help they needed.One GP called mental health support \"a national tragedy\". Another said: \"A child literally needs to be holding a knife to be taken seriously and the second that knife is put down, services disengage.\"We also asked GPs if they ever prescribe medication because they worry patients will not get other help, such as talking therapies, quickly enough.The most common answer - from 447 GPs - is that they do this \"routinely\".\"I find myself regularly reaching for antidepressants, which I know may only help short term and won't help prevent recurrence,\" one GP commented.Professor Victoria Tzortziou Brown, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said there's a \"difficult balance\" for family doctors to strike when patients expect a diagnosis for mental health problems, but don't meet the criteria.\"We must be careful, as a society, not to medicalise the full range of normal feelings and behaviours and ensure GPs are not pressured into making diagnoses that conflict with their clinical judgement,\" she said.\"But equally we must avoid dismissing genuine mental health concerns as 'over-diagnosis' which risks discouraging people from seeking help.\"The independent review into demand for mental health services has promised to listen to all the evidence and come up with \"genuinely useful\" recommendations.Minesh Patel, associate director of policy and influencing at mental health charity Mind, said there was \"no credible evidence\" that mental health problems were being over-diagnosed.\"What we do know though is that the number of people experiencing mental health problems has increased, with 1 in 5 adults now living with a common mental health condition according to the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey,\" he said.Additional reporting by Elena Bailey and Phil Leake.",

    "body": "4 hours agoCatherine WyattBBC religious affairsHulu/Disney+Host Stassi Schroeder reunites the cast to explore scandals in the Season 3 ReunionInfidelity, divorce, even \"soft-swinging\" - not words traditionally associated with Christianity, but just some of the themes in the hit US reality show, The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.The TV series follows a group of female influencers in Utah - the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) - as they deal with friendship fall-outs, romantic problems, and their relationship with their faith.\"These Latter-day Saints are no angels,\" last month's trailer for season three declared, setting the tone for what was to come. The show became the most-watched unscripted season premiere of 2024 on Hulu and continues to attract millions of global viewers there and on Disney+. And the cast of women, who previously gained notoriety on TikTok under their \"MomTok\" banner, have gained scores of social media followers.But do Mormons living in the UK think the show gives a fair portrayal of their religion? BBC News has spoken to some, many of whom prefer to be referred to as members of the Latter-day Saints rather than Mormons.\"We're normal people,\" Ben, a podcast producer who lives near Burnley, says.\"So there is still infidelity, there are still extramarital affairs, probably at a significantly lower percentage because we are intentionally trying not to do that. But those things still happen.\"The show is appointment viewing for Ben's wife Olivia, who he says \"loves it\" - having put the new season in their calendar so she didn't miss it.Olivia and Ben say Mormons' lives are not as dramatic as the show suggestsWhen the first series aired last year, Ben, 27, feels there was \"hesitancy\" in the LDS community about it. Now, he says people are mostly supportive of the women on the programme and wouldn't say they are \"embarrassed\" by them - \"because we're not\".\"In the UK, if you spend a week with a Latter-day Saint family, it will probably be generally quite boring and average,\" he says.Ben and Olivia are among the approximately 185,000 LDS members in the UK. The church was founded by Joseph Smith in the US in 1830, who said he received a revelation from God, which he translated to become the Book of Mormon.Members of the LDS believe the Book is the word of God, like the Bible. Unlike other branches of Christianity, members do not believe Jesus is himself God, rather that they are separate beings.They are perhaps best known for their missionary tradition, where every year thousands of young Mormons are sent by the LDS to different locations around the world to recruit others to the religion.In 1837 the first missionaries from the newly founded LDS arrived in the UK in Preston, Lancashire - now home to Europe's largest Mormon temple. Earlier this year, plans to expand the temple, where Ben and Olivia sometimes worship, were approved by councillors.'It's not the way they live their life'Traci says she sometimes worries about how Mormons are being representedIn Buckinghamshire, Traci, 57, tells BBC News after growing up in the LDS, she moved away from the faith aged 17 when her mother died. About a decade later, pregnant with twins, she says she prayed every night, scared and asking for help. When her sons were born, and missionaries knocked on the door, she says she \"felt the Holy Ghost's presence\".Since then, she's been a practising member of the LDS - which, among other things, means abiding by a health code that prohibits drinking tea, coffee and alcohol, and eating meat sparingly.Traci, a psychotherapist based in Olney, decided not to watch the Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, but from what she's been told about it, says \"it's not representative of the women\" she knows in the LDS. \"It's not the way that they live their life.\"She says she understands \"sometimes people do have a curiosity about members of our church, they do want to know what makes us tick\", but adds: \"Sometimes I worry, how are we being represented? How do you see us?\"Disney/Natalie CassInfluencer Taylor Frankie Paul features heavily in a storyline about 'soft-swinging' in the showOne of the major themes of the TV show is the pressure the women feel in their family lives. Jessi, a woman in the show whose storyline revolves around an emotional affair she had, says avoiding to deal with issues in her marriage contributed to infidelity - and blamed Utah's Mormonism for creating \"a lot of pressure to have the perfect relationship, the perfect family and everything's great\".Back in the UK, we also spoke to Ben and Olivia's friend Ashlyn who went to university in Utah and now lives in Burnley with her husband Joe, and their nine-month-old son.She says the show is \"a really accurate representation of the church in Utah, and culturally what Utah looks like, where belief meets cultural practices\".The sheer number of Mormons there means that pressure to have a family comes not just from the Church, but from \"everybody that you interact with\", Ashlyn, 25, adds.\"That pressure is very real. A lot of us call it the Utah bubble.\"Becy/Bell Art PhotographyAshlyn and Joe say there are some differences between the LDS in Utah and the UKBut she says it's not the same in the UK. She describes the show's US cast as \"probably more culturally members\" of the LDS, rather than devout believers.Ashlyn describes her experiences of the LDS as encouraging, rather than pressuring. \"Some people view a lot of the commandments, and what people might label 'rules', as very confining and almost like there's all these gates holding me in,\" Ashlyn says, \"whereas for us, it's viewed a little bit more as safety. It helps direct us in the right way.\"'Soft-swinging' and race issues in the showAnd so-called \"soft swinging\", one of the show's scandals, would \"definitely\" be \"discouraged\" by the Church, she says.Influencer Taylor Frankie Paul was at the centre of the story in series one of the show, when she described her and her then-husband as being sexually intimate - but stopping short of \"going all the way\" - with two other couples at various parties.Ashlyn explains how in the LDS, \"we have something called the law of chastity that says we should really save sexual relations within our marriages\".She says her lifestyle in Burnley is \"very family-centered, very healthy, trying to focus on going to church on Sunday, serving others, being a really good example to others, and helping in the community\".Ashlyn adds: \"I don't think it would be as entertaining if The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives was actually just them bringing cookies to their neighbours and just living very wholesome family lives.\"Another theme in the show centres on Layla, a black member of the LDS, who stops attending because she says the Church didn't \"resonate\" with her any more as a person of colour, having converted to LDS and moved to Utah when she was 16.\"There is an old scripture in the Book of Mormon that states that black skin is a curse. It's something that I am aware of now that I wasn't aware of when I first converted,\" she says in the latest series.In 2013 the LDS \"disavowed\" those teachings, and now believes \"everyone is an equal child of God regardless of race\".BBC News spoke to Naomi, a 'Young Women's President' in her local congregation in London, meaning she looks after girls between the ages of 12 and 18 in her area. She told us how as \"a black female\", she hopes the children \"can see me and my example and know what's possible\".Naomi says she hasn't \"had any negative experiences\" in the Church based on her race, and says the teachings \"have been denounced\".Naomi feels accepted by the LDS despite its old teachings on raceThe members of the LDS in Britain we spoke to had mixed opinions on whether The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives represents their way of life, with most agreeing that parts of it were exaggerated depictions.Ahead of the first series of the show last year, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the UK released a statement titled, \"When entertainment media distorts faith\".While it didn't name the show, it said: \"A number of recent productions depict lifestyles and practices blatantly inconsistent with the teachings of the Church.\"We understand the fascination some in the media have with the Church, but regret that portrayals often rely on sensationalism and inaccuracies that do not fairly and fully reflect the lives of our Church members or the sacred beliefs that they hold dear.\"Naomi, who is a TV producer working on reality shows, knows all too well that it's a classic of the genre that \"things are going to be heightened, things are going to be produced to get the desired effect\".\"I'm very aware of that.\"More on this story",

    "body": "7 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentHedi StantonHaim: \"Being in a rock band is where our heart and soul will always lie.\" (L-R: Alana, Danielle and Este Haim) \"When are you interviewing Haim?\" my sister Emily texts, late one night. \"I wanted you to ask if I can be their fourth member.\"There's just one problem: I also want to be Haim's fourth member. And we're not alone. Taylor Swift and actress Brie Larson have also begged for the position. Fellow Oscar-winner Emma Stone even teamed up with them for a Spice Girls tribute although, sadly, that wasn't a permanent deal.There's clearly something going on. Sisters Este, Danielle and Alana began their career playing gigs at local delicatessens with their parents. Now they're multiple Grammy nominees.Like all the best bands, they're a tight-knit gang. Their videos often show them striding in unison down the streets of Los Angeles. On stage, they play with such unfettered joy you can't help but think, \"I want to be part of that, too.\"\"The amount of times on tour that young girls came up to us and said, 'After your show, I got a guitar, I picked up drum sticks, I picked up a bass',\" says Alana, the youngest of the Haim siblings. \"That's the biggest honour. That's an award in itself. We've done our job if we can inspire young girls to start a band.\"So everyone is invited to be the fourth Haim sister.\"(Emily, you're in!)Getty ImagesThe band's live shows have seen them rise to the top of festival bills around EuropeThe band have called into the BBC from home, where they're resting up after an extensive tour in support of their fourth album, I Quit.They're currently reeling from the news it's been nominated for best rock album at the Grammys - with Haim the first all-female band ever in contention for the prize.\"I watch the nominations every year, so it kind of feels like The Truman Show when your name is read out,\" says Alana. \"I had to call my sisters to say, 'Did I hear this right or am I hallucinating?'\"The significance of the nomination isn't lost on the trio.\"We really set out to make a rock album this time, so it's a huge milestone,\" says Alana. \"But we're just grateful for the women that came before us.\"All we looked up to were women rock artists,\" adds Este. \"That was our world, growing up, whether it be Stevie Nicks, or Joni Mitchell, or Pat Benatar.\"Heartbreak and humourThe record emerged from a period of emotional upheaval. All three sisters found themselves single, and the music inhabits that strange liminal space where you're relieved to be free, but not quite ready to move on.\"Can I have your attention, please, for the last time before I leave,\" sings Danielle, over an Americana-style acoustic guitar on the opening track, Gone. Then: \"On second thought, I changed my mind.\"Este takes over the vocals on Cry, tracking her progress through the seven stages of grief. \"I'm past the anger, past the rage / But the hurt ain't gone.\"There are a lot of departures, a lot of goodbyes. The sisters want love, but not the specific love they've got. You can hear them working out in real time who they want to be, and refusing to be defined by how others see them.\"I love that description, yes,\" says Danielle. \"I Quit is kind of like a mantra. You have to actively work on shutting out the noise and saying, 'I don't give an [expletive] what people think'. \"When we were in our 20s, I wasn't strong enough to say something like that,\" says Alana, picking up the theme. \"I was more like, 'Oh, please love me'. \"But by the time we get to I Quit, I'm like, 'Screw this, I'm done'.  And with that comes an inner strength that I'm very proud to have.\"The group won the BBC's Sound of 2013 poll, and have subsequently scored four top 10 albums in the UKThat toughness required a new sound - more raw and immediate than anything the band had done before.For Danielle, who co-produced the album with Rostam Batmanglij, formerly of Vampire Weekend, that started with the drums.She plays an acoustic kit on every track, often layering multiple takes, recorded in different studios to capture specific tones. On Everybody's Trying To Figure Me Out, she even tuned her snare drum to match the \"iconic\" thwack of U2's Sunday Bloody Sunday.\"Drums are such a nuanced like thing, and I care so much about it, so much,\" she says, as if that wasn't abundantly clear already.\"'Journey of the drum sound' will be the name of our memoir,\" laughs Alana. \"I've said it a million times, our albums don't start until we find the perfect drum sound, and then we can continue on the journey of writing the songs.\"Haim / RostamI Quit refines Haim's signature sound, blending acoustic rock with hip-hop adjacent beats and hooky pop melodies. Danielle says drums are the foundation of every songThe evolution of Haim's sound also helped them grasp songs that had slipped through their fingers over the last decade.I Quit's first single Relationships is a glossy pop earworm that first came to Danielle on a flight home from Haim's 2017 Australian tour. In the intervening years, it went through \"hundreds\" of re-writes, changing lyrics and tempos, before finally \"coming to life\" at Batmanglij's home studio.By contrast, Take Me Back was made up on the spot, as the band shared raucous stories from their high school days - of boys who couldn't perform in bed and friends who lost control of their bowels \"in the back of a truck\".\"That one fell into place so quickly,\" says Alana. \"We didn't even know if it was going to go on the album. \"It was just us riffing from the heart and being like, 'This is the kind of song that we want to make today', with no pressure. We were laughing through the whole experience.\"At the end of it, we were like, 'This is hilarious, we've got to put it on the album'.\"That candour inspired the album's promotional campaign, where the sisters shared some of their dating horror stories. One man broke up with Este when she told him their future children might have Type 1 Diabetes. He was like, 'Then why are we here?'\" she recalls. Alana shared the story of travelling to London to spend New Year's Eve with a musician she thought she was dating, only for him to high five her at midnight.On tour, fans shared their own disaster stories on Haim's video screens. Among them was a girl in Philadelphia who discovered her boyfriend's private safe contained neither money nor passports, but a shrine to his ex... And his mum.\"When you're going through these heartbreaks, you just feel like there's no light,\" says Alana.'So to be able to laugh at those stories and share them with other people, and then have them tell you even crazier stories, it's so amazing.\"We can laugh at all these things, and it's not going to keep us from trying to find love in the future.\"Jono WhiteThe band recently wrapped up a six-month tour, but say they hope to hit the road again in 2026It's not difficult to sense a shift in the band. The first time we met in 2012, they were still wet behind the ears, and giddy from making their debut at London's O2 Arena.As the support act for Florence + The Machine, the sisters were overwhelmed at the realisation they'd just played the same stage as The Rolling Stones.\"I've been crawling on the floor, trying to soak it all up,\" said Alana. \"I think I have a little Mick Jagger in me.\"These days, Haim are more confident of their place in the rock pantheon. They're festival headliners, with two number one albums and an international fan base.Not only that, but they have successful side hustles in acting (Alana has just been \"shot in the head by Sean Penn\" in One Battle After Another) and soundtrack work (Este's credits include The White Lotus and Loot).But Haim will always be their number one priority.\"Me and my siblings have been playing music since I was four years old,\" says Alana. \"It's like there's nothing else that we were supposed to do. And I'm really grateful we've gotten here and we're still kicking.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoAlex TaylorCulture reporterRockstar GamesDan Houser was one of the masterminds behind revolutionary video game series Grand Theft Auto.Now, after leaving Rockstar Games and launching his own company, he's released a debut novel about a very different type of game.A Better Paradise is a dystopian vision of the near future in which an AI-led computer game goes rogue.Set in a polarised world, it finds Mark Tyburn attempting to create a virtual haven for people to find sanctuary and reconnect within themselves against an all-consuming social media hellscape.But it all goes wrong when it ends up unleashing a mysterious, sentient AI bot named NigelDave into society - \"a hyper-intelligence built by humans\" - flaws included.Readers get to see his thought processes as he struggles with \"infinite knowledge and zero wisdom\".\"What would an incredibly precocious child, who remembers everything he ever thought - because computers don't forget things - feel like when he started talking?\" Houser says.Getty ImagesWritten before ChatGPTIt feels a bit like A Better Paradise predicted the future. First released as a podcast, the book comes as AI's continued boom means the sector's big seven companies are now collectively worth more than China's economy.But Houser says he began writing the book \"a good year\" before OpenAI's ChatGPT went live to the masses in 2022, complete with a logo eerily similar to his fictional creation.Instead, it was humanity's technological dependency during Covid - at a scale he'd underestimated - that inspired his thinking.In his novel - which sometimes feels monologue-heavy - Houser envisions a hyper-digital, alienating world where people retreat from deepening political problems into a spiral of social media and generative AI.Enter CEO of Tyburn Industria, Mark, who dreams of building the Ark, an immersive gaming experience users can enter in order to reconnect with themselves. It generates a world and mission tailored to each player's innermost wants and needs.But during testing, the Ark becomes a Pandora's box of addiction. Some players find joy; others encounter terror. One even reconnects with his dead sister.Meanwhile, a rogue AI bot named NigelDave slips into the real world, controlling minds and engineering realities no one can control.Mined for advertising, people are left wondering if their thoughts are genuine. Everything is tracked, and nothing is secure. As climate emergencies intensify, society falls to pockets of civil war.The only way to escape is to \"drift\"- which means hiding from a thousand algorithms by living off-grid, constantly moving and suppressing maddening paranoia that your thoughts are not your own.Mirroring our worldTo the reader, NigelDave feels like a nightmare ChatGPT gone wrong.The AI tool recently reached 800 million weekly active users, according to boss Sam Altman, and Houser believes some people are becoming dependent on the technology's affirming \"human veneer\".Microsoft's head of AI Mustafa Suleyman has warned of a rise in AI psychosis - a non-clinical term describing incidents where people increasingly rely on chatbots like Claude, Grok and ChatGPT and become convinced that something imaginary has become real.In some cases, the chatbot fuels grandiose fantasies about future opportunities. In others, it presents in a romantic connection. More troubling are reports of parents saying bots have encouraged their children to kill themselves.In response to the increased scrutiny, ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently tightened its welfare protocols, with updates designed to ensure its chatbot responds \"safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\".Bloomberg via Getty ImagesMustafa Suleyman, chief executive officer of of Microsoft AIThe dizzying algorithm-fuelled society in which NigelDave is unleashed mirrors ours too.Parents worry about exposing their children to false information or harmful content. Last year national police chiefs described the \"quite terrifying\" misogynistic radicalisation of boys and young men. And in 2014 Facebook admitted manipulating the news feeds of nearly 700,000 users without their consent to manage the emotions they were exposed to.\"As a parent, you always worry about anything that you expose your kids to that is going to either give them false information or simply bombard them with too much information,\" Houser says.But is it bold for a video game creator to be warning of these dangers - given the long history of video games themselves being accused of making young people violent?Houser insists there's a difference.\"We always had the data about game violence, and it was very clear: as people played more video games, youth violence went down.\"Whatever people were claiming, we knew the opposite was true.\"Getty ImagesPsychology professor and game violence researcher Pete Etchells says numerous studies have shown \"no meaningful effect of playing violent games on aggression\".AI models and social media are another matter - a \"new paradigm\" in altering behaviour that gaming never threatened, according to Matt Navarra, social media consultant and author of the Geekout Newsletter.He says dismissing concerns as a GTA-style moral panic \"understates what is changing\".\"We're talking about external systems that can potentially shape people's beliefs or manipulate attention, personalised experiences, nudge behaviour or even influence identity and emotional states.\"Rockstar freedomCould Houser have pushed forward with A Better Paradise at Rockstar? \"I don't know if I would have had the bandwidth to think about it,\" he tells me.He's previously described the fatigue of managing vast open-world sandbox games like Red Dead Redemption and GTA as playing a role in his departure.The goal with his book was to create \"something truly different in this era of crazy media saturation\".Rockstar GamesSo where next? He's already writing the second instalment of the series, and plans are under way to develop a video game, for which he promises the visuals are ground-breaking.A key message, he says, is to not let your device - or AI - \"tell you what to think\". Otherwise, Houser argues, \"you're giving up control to your phone\".His biggest fear, as creator of worlds, is losing imagination because of the endless torrent of algorithms. Sometimes after scrolling for hours, he realises: \"I've not had an idea all day\".\"If you go offline for a bit - sometimes I make myself go for a walk with no phone, you start to have ideas.\"A human is better thinking than not,\" he says. \"Thinking is a privilege.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "First it was K-pop, now it's K-food. Here's how to bring Korean cooking into your kitchen7 hours agoJiji AhnFuture Publishing via Getty ImagesStanding around a kitchen island with a small group of other food writers, I pull on a pair of plastic gloves and begin massaging a bright red paste into wedges of cabbage. We are in Korean-American TV chef Judy Joo's London flat, learning how to make kimchi from scratch.Kimchi - sharp, funky, fermented cabbage - has become a kind of shorthand for Korean food in the UK. Judy calls it \"the cornerstone of Korean cuisine\".\"Traditionally, Koreans eat kimchi 365 days a year,\" Judy tells me. Kimchi recipes are passed down \"like heirlooms\", she adds.The group joke about the chilli under our nails and the smell lingering on the train home, but we're all excited to have a jar of homemade kimchi ready to put in the fridge.Judy, who's known for bringing Korean food to British audiences, was leading a class tied to Ocado's new Korean food aisle. It's part of what appears to be a growing trend of bringing Korean food further into the British mainstream.Judy JooKorean-American TV chef Judy Joo demonstrates how to make kimchi from scratch...Judy Joo... Her class duly rub red paste into wedges of cabbage Growing up as a Korean in London, I was used to my culture turning up at school in the form of food. On \"international day\", my mum would be asked to send in Korean dishes for pupils to try. Teachers were often more curious than students, and there was usually confusion about whether it was another type of Chinese food.Korean food has never been in competition with other Asian cuisines – it simply wants to be seen and tasted on its own terms. As more Korean restaurants have opened, and as I've gone back to Korea and explored its food there, I've watched that shift happen in both places.'Fermented foods, such as kimchi, have become mainstream'Back in 2009, the South Korean government launched a \"Global Hansik\" campaign to raise the profile of Korean food abroad, putting public money into restaurant promotion, chef training and overseas marketing. The programme drew criticism at the time for lacking clear results but, later, government studies suggested awareness of Korean food in major overseas cities rose over the first half of the 2010s.Since then, Korean food has increasingly travelled alongside the broader \"K-wave\" of pop culture. Food-centred drama Bon Appétit, Your Majesty has showcased Korean fusion dishes, while South Korean competition show Culinary Class Wars returns for a second season on Netflix this month after topping the platform's global non-English TV chart in its first run.The shift is also visible on UK shelves. Searches for \"Korean BBQ\" on Waitrose's website are up more than 60% year on year, and sales of its gochujang paste have risen more than 70%. Kimchi is among its fastest-growing international products.\"Fermented foods, such as kimchi, have become mainstream,\" explains nutritionist Emer Lowry. \"They enhance flavour and texture, but also offer benefits including improved digestion and a diverse, healthier gut microbiome.\"And the interest in Korean food didn't just happen overnight - it's driven by curiosity. Analysis by Bibigo, part of food giant CJ, suggests TikTok posts by UK users mentioning Korean food have risen from just under 10,000 in 2023 to more than 17,000 in 2025.Lola LeeDishes at Cálong in North LondonAt Cálong, a restaurant in North London, chef Joo Won is exploring what it means to cook Korean food in Britain. In his early career in a London hotel kitchen, he worked with chefs from France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Thailand. Between shifts, they would take it in turns to cook meals from home for each other and, one day, the others asked him to make something Korean.\"When they asked me to cook Korean food, I realised I couldn't,\" he says. \"As a Korean person and a chef, being unable to cook Korean food was embarrassing.\"He began revisiting the dishes he grew up with, not just restaurant staples but the home cooking most non-Koreans never encounter. \"In Korea, the real foundation of our food is jang,\" he says, referring to fermented pastes and sauces such as doenjang, ganjang and gochujang.Try this BBC Food kimchi recipe: But ingredients in Britain are different. \"We can't get exactly the same ingredients here that we have in Korea,\" he says. \"So a big challenge is: how do we reinterpret the character of British ingredients in a Korean way?\"We're a restaurant that uses Korean techniques and flavours, but we also rely heavily on what's available here in the UK,\" he continues. \"If an ingredient doesn't suit Korean seasoning, there's no need to put gochujang on it. If every dish at an Italian pasta restaurant came out with the same sauce, it would feel strange.\"As the popularity of Korean food grows, Joo thinks chefs may find it easier to source the authentic products they need. \"At the moment, I'd say we're only at the beginning. It feels like we've just reached the starting line.\"Food is the most important part of Korean dining culture. But Yoonsun Chang - who runs a Korean supper club - says Jeong, a deep warmth and care often associated with Korean hospitality, and inyeon, a sense of meaningful connections formed at the table, are also key. \"What I try to give is jeong, but what's created through these gatherings is also inyeon.\"LoKoLi – short for \"Lovely Korean Life\" – is a one-woman project run by Yoonsun, who creates one-off dining experiences built around Korean food and culture. I first came across her on Instagram and was struck by how much of it she was doing alone, driven by her own desire to show a version of Korean life that reflected what she loved.Guests at her monthly clubs, which she usually hosts at home, often say they want more than the obvious elements of K-culture. They already know the music and dramas. What they're seeking is the quieter, domestic side of Korean life: the table setting, the stories behind everyday dishes.She also pays close attention to how Korean food appears outside Korean spaces. She recalls a time when \"kimchi burgers\" in Britain used \"just some generic pickles\". Now, she says, pubs and restaurants increasingly use real kimchi. \"Seeing that makes me feel Korean culture has really spread,\" she says.'The flavour profiles were so different to what we were used to' For British YouTubers Armand and Max, their introduction to Korean food came after taking part in a viral video for the Korean Englishman YouTube channel.  Now in their early 20s, they say that day changed the way they eat.The video, which featured the pair trying Korean street food in their school playground, was seen by tens of millions - and eventually took them to Korea itself, where they tried barbecue, late-night ramyun and school lunches.\"The flavour profiles… were just so different to what we were used to,\" says Max. \"Fermented cabbage, kimchi, we'd never had that. That was delicious. I can't even compare it to anything.\"Korean EnglishmanBack in Judy's kitchen, as cabbages disappear into jars, she explains that proper kimchi needs weeks to ferment, though we were encouraged to taste it as it developed - as people do when making it at home.The jar I made that day is now bubbling away in my fridge. It's not the kind of kimchi my family would have made, but the process - rubbing paste into each leaf, waiting for the tang to deepen - connects back to kitchens thousands of miles away.Korean food in Britain is still young compared with other cuisines. It has not replaced anyone's Friday-night takeaway. But from supper clubs and YouTube channels to supermarket aisles and small flats where people are learning to make kimchi for the first time, it is steadily becoming part of everyday life.More weekend picks",

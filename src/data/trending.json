This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "6 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsGetty ImagesA total of 69 schools in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) will be forced to close on Monday after coloured play sand was recalled due to asbestos risk, the government has said.A recall for the products, which were found to have traces of asbestos in some samples, was issued by Kmart and Target on Saturday. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said there was a \"low\" risk that the asbestos could become airborne or fine enough for inhalation.Inspections of the schools are under way and could \"take days\", said ACT Education Minister Yvette Berry in a post on Facebook. She added that air testing so far has come back \"negative to airborne asbestos\" from all schools.This comes after several schools and preschools in the region were fully or partially closed on Friday, after a warning over asbestos risks in children's sand sold by Officeworks. There were also school closures in New Zealand due to fears over sand products, with at least two other schools set to close for testing on Monday according to the New Zealand Herald. Addressing the new closures, Berry said:  \"Unfortunately, these sand products are even more widely used in our schools than the Officeworks products.\"The Australian Competition & Consumer CommissionState Emergency Service volunteers and school staff have been walking through buildings and \"mapping all coloured sand they see\" over the weekend, she added. The ACT government said that people who have been in contact with the product do not require a clinical assessment. Berry said despite the minimal risk, the government is \"required to eliminate risk as much as reasonably practicable\".Up to 23 schools will remain open as they either have \"small stocks\" of the sand or do not have any of the product. The products set out in the recall notice are labelled as Active Sandtub 14 piece Sand Castle Building Set, and Blue, Green and Pink Magic Sand. Asbestos, once widely used in building materials, can release toxic fibres into the air   if disturbed or processed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer. Importing or exporting asbestos or goods containing asbestos is prohibited under both Australian and New Zealand law.",

James Stephenson, deputy team leader, said the tourist was found outside the initial search area.But the search team were able to get a better idea of his location through police analysis of his mobile phone data. Skye Mountain Rescue TeamSeveral search and rescue teams were involved in the search for Mr BeutinMr Stephenson said: \"Our thoughts are with Matthias' family.\"It doesn't take a lot of thought to imagine how horrible it must be to have somebody missing for some amount of time. This is obviously terrible news.\"Mr Stephenson said it had been \"frustrating\" that they had not found Mr Beutin's body sooner.But he added the team were glad to be able to \"bring him home\" and allow his family to start the grieving process.He said the search had been hampered by testing conditions.\"It's very difficult terrain to search in difficult weather and there are acres and acres of ground you can't easily access,\" Mr Stephenson added. Helicopters and drones only had a limited role in the search but a break in the weather on Saturday gave the team an opportunity to resume their efforts. Skye Mountain Rescue were joined in their search by Kintail Mountain Rescue, Glen Elg Mountain Rescue, members of the Police Scotland Mountain Rescue team and the Rescue helicopter. The Search and Rescue Dog Association and the Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service had taken parts in previous efforts to find Mr Beutin.Blà Bheinn, also known as Blaven, is a popular Munro for walkers and climbers in an isolated part of Skye, on the outskirts of the Cullin Ridge.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPritti Mistry,Business reporter and Marc Ashdown,Business correspondent Nature is not a blocker to housing growth and the government risks missing both its housing and nature targets if it views it as one, a cross-party group of MPs has warned in a new report.The Planning and Infrastructure Bill overrides existing habitat protections, which the government has suggested is a barrier to its target to build 1.5 million houses by the end of this parliament.But in a report published on Sunday, the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) found the measures outlined in the bill are not enough to allow the government to meet its goals.\"Using nature as a scapegoat means that the government will be less effective at tackling some of the genuine challenges facing the planning system,\" the report said.A Ministry of Housing spokesperson said it was fixing a failing system with landmark reforms, which would deliver a win-win for the economy and the environment.The Labour government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029 as part of efforts to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth.Under its housing reforms, it wants to simplify the planning system to speed up house-building on smaller sites by overriding existing habitat and nature protections.If passed, the draft legislation, which is currently making its way through the final stages in parliament, would instead allow developers to make general environmental improvements and pay into a nature restoration fund that improves habitats on other sites.But the EAC has argued that nature is not a \"blocker\" to delivering housing - it is a necessity for building resilient neighbourhoods.The EAC urged the government to instead focus on addressing a skills shortage in ecology, planning and construction.\"The government must not veer down the path of viewing nature as an inconvenience or blocker to housebuilding,\" the report said. \"In most cases, housing delivery is delayed or challenged due to unclear and conflicting policies, land banking and skills shortages.\" The EAC suggested offering people better incentives to build and live in \"carbon-friendly homes\", or to retrofit existing ones.It outlined a series of recommendations aimed at boosting manufacturing viability of green construction products and alter the tax burden to support eco-friendly homes.Environmental group Friends of the Earth said the government needed to set the right priorities.Paul De Zylva, nature campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \"This report shows that the Planning & Infrastructure Bill is bad legislation that neither provides the quality homes people need nor truly protects our already depleted nature.\"Instead of attacking newts, bats and our nature laws to justify its growth-at-any-cost agenda, the government would be better focusing on delivering against its legal targets for nature which are at risk of being missed.\"A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government said: \"The Government inherited a failing system that delayed new homes and infrastructure while doing nothing for nature's recovery.\"We are fixing this with landmark reforms, including the Nature Restoration Fund, that will create a win-win for the economy and the environment.\"This will get Britain building the 1.5 million homes we desperately need to restore the dream of homeownership, and not at the expense of nature.\" ",

Police protecting the compound used tear gas on the crowds.Authorities have arrested 20 people for crimes including robbery and assault, Mexico City security chief Pablo Vazquez told reporters.Protesters waved banners displaying messages including \"We are all Carlos Manzo\", while others wore cowboy hats in tribute to him.EPAManzo was shot on 1 November while he attended a Day of the Dead festival.He was known for speaking openly about drug-trafficking gangs in his town and cartel violence. He had been demanding tough action against armed cartel members who terrorise the country. Sheinbaum has been acting against cartels but resisting calls for another all-out war on drugs. Previous attempts by her predecessors have ended with bloody results.Days before the march took place, the president said the demonstration was being promoted by bots online.\"We agree with freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration if there are young people who have demands, but the issue here is who is promoting the demonstration,\" she said in a briefing. \"People should know how this demonstration was organised so that no one is used.\"ReutersSome protesters paid tribute to Uruapan mayor Carlos ManzoSheinbaum retains approval ratings above 70% in her first year in office, and has made in-roads in clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, Donald Trump.But she has been criticised for failing to halt the violence gripping the country and is facing increased hostility from nearby countries.Earlier this month, Peru's Congress voted to declare Sheinbaum a persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision came days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsFederal agents have descended on the city of Charlotte in North Carolina as part of US president Donald Trump's expanding crackdown on illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said.It announced \"Operation Charlotte's Web\" on Saturday, saying \"criminal illegal aliens\" would be targeted in the Democratic-run city.Local officials, including Mayor of Charlotte Li Vyles, released a joint statement criticising the operation, saying it was causing \"unnecessary fear and uncertainty\" in the community. Since Trump's return to office he has deployed troops to Washington DC, Los Angeles and Chicago to deliver on his promise of \"the largest deportation programme\" in US history.\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.Armoured vehicles and special operations teams could be involved in the North Charlotte crackdown, according to internal government documents seen by the BBC's US partner, CBS News. Several church members doing yard work at a church in east Charlotte fled into woods when agents arrived and detained one man, The Charlotte Observer reported, quoting the church's pastor. \"We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,\" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.Officials said there are \"a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters\".The DHS said they are carrying out the operation because North Carolina has not honoured the nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees - meaning they had been released due to \"sanctuary policies\".Charlotte is not a sanctuary city - cities that have policies in place to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities - but it is a \"certified welcoming city\". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.  \"President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,\" the DHS said.Charlotte is an ethnically diverse city, with about 17% of residents being born outside of the country, according to Data US. DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September is still ongoing. Earlier in the week, US Representative and Democrat, Alma Adams, said she was informed of the operation and was \"extremely concerned\" about Border Patrol and ICE agents coming to North Carolina. The next city on Trump's list is set to be New Orleans, according to CBS, and that as many as 200 agents could be deployed to the city. Operations in previous cities like Chicago and Los Angeles have come under fire over concerns of excessive use of force.",

    "body": "Feud erupts between Trump and ally Marjorie Taylor Greene ahead of Epstein files voteDisagreements between Donald Trump and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene have ballooned into a public feud, signalling a breakdown in relations between the US president and one of his fiercest defenders.On Friday, Trump called Greene \"wacky\" in social media posts and said she should be unseated in next year's elections. On Saturday, he called her a \"traitor\". Greene has in recent days questioned whether Trump was still putting \"America First\" and criticised his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.The feud comes as the House is set to consider whether to release the files to the public, with speaker Mike Johnson saying he would put the bill to a vote this coming week.Known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the aim of the bill is to make the justice department release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials linked to Jeffrey Epstein.US outlet Politico reported a vote could come as soon as Tuesday. \"All I see \"Wacky\" Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" Trump posted on Friday night, claiming that she turned on him after he suggested that she shouldn't run for governor or senator in her home state of Georgia. \"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore,\" Trump said, adding: \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"He pledged to back any Republican opponent that takes her on in next year's midterm elections, when she is up for reelection, before intensifying his attacks in social media posts on Saturday from his home in Florida.\"Marjorie 'Traitor' Green [sic] is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!\" he wrote.The comments follow days of criticism from Greene, who has said that Trump is not doing enough to bring down costs for voters. She also denounced his recent decisions in foreign conflicts and on tariff policies.But she has been most critical of his approach to handling the Epstein files. The turnaround is remarkable for a lawmaker who stood by Trump during multiple scandals, most notably the Capitol riot in 2021 when Trump supporters stormed the US legislature in an attempt to block Trump's election defeat. The US president also vigorously defended Greene when she was accused of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories.Greene is one of only four House Republicans who joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition calling for the release of the Epstein files last week.On Friday, Greene posted on X that Trump was trying to stop other Republicans from voting in favour of the Epstein petition.\"He's coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files,\" she posted, adding: \"It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level.\"She returned to X on Saturday to say Trump had made her a target for threats \"fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world\".\"As a Republican, who overwhelmingly votes for President Trump's bills and agenda, his aggression against me... is completely shocking to everyone,\" she wrote.\"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump,\" she wrote in one post. \"I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people.\"Former Republican pollster and strategist Robert Moran said it was clear the US president did not want the Epstein files to be released and \"is trying to pressure\" Greene. Mr Moran doubted the row would affect Trump's popularity as the electorate was so divided, but said it was inevitable the files would eventually come out. \"Many of his voters are sceptical of power and so they want power to be held to account, and they support the release of these files,\" he added.Trump has long faced criticism from both parties over his handling of the US Department of Justice files related to Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile. Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the US president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.",

    "body": "7 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesNestle has recalled some baby formula products over concerns they contain a toxin which can cause food poisoning.The food and drink giant said specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula were not safe to be fed to babies.It said the batches potentially contain cereulide, which can cause nausea and vomiting when consumed.The company said there had been no confirmed reports of illness associated with the products, but was recalling them \"out of an abundance of caution\".\"The safety and wellbeing of babies is our absolute priority,\" the firm said in a statement. \"We sincerely apologise for any concern or inconvenience caused to parents, caregivers, and customers.\"It stressed that all other Nestle products and batches of the same products that have not been recalled are safe to consume.Nestle promised refunds for affected customers and said the problem was caused by an ingredient provided by one of its suppliers.Batch numbers of the affected products can be found on Nestle's website or through food.gov.uk.Customers are advised to look for the corresponding code on the base of the tin or box for powdered formulas or the base of the outer box and on the side or top of the container for ready-to-feed formulas.Cereulide is a toxin produced by some strains of the Bacillus cereus bacteria that can cause food poisoning symptoms, which can be quick to develop and include vomiting, and stomach cramps. It is unlikely to be deactivated or destroyed by cooking, using boiling water or when making the infant milk, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned.The FSA's head of incidents, Jane Rawling, said parents, guardians and caregivers should not feed infants or young children the affected products.She added: \"I want to reassure parents, guardians and caregivers that we are taking urgent action, helping to ensure all of the affected product is removed from sale as a precaution.\"If you have fed this product to a baby and have any concerns about potential health impact, you should seek advice from healthcare professionals by contacting your GP or calling NHS 111.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "All 116 people injured in a bar fire at a Swiss ski resort have now been identified, officials have said.Forty people were killed when a fire tore through a busy venue in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve, with victims' age ranging from 14 to 39 years old.While the dead had all previously been identified, work had been ongoing to establish who the injured are, some of whom remain in a critical condition. Swiss police confirmed on Monday that 83 people remained in hospital, with the injured including at least 12 nationalities.Most of the injured suffered severe burns, which in some cases meant they could not be identified, police have said.Investigators said 119 people had been injured but that number has been revised down in the latest update. A criminal investigation has been launched into the French couple who managed the Le Constellation bar - a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling were the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Details have begun to emerge about some of those who lost their lives in the tragedy. Among them was Charlotte Niddam, believed to be 15, who was a pupil at two UK schools. Her family wrote on social media: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.\"The mother of Arthur Brodard, 16, confirmed he had died in the fire.She said in a video message: \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light.\"Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as also being among the victims.Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoJack Fenwick,Political correspondentandChris Mason,Political editorThe leaders of West Midlands Police and Birmingham City Council will be grilled by MPs later over a decision not to allow Israeli football fans to attend a match in the city last year.The decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a match against Aston Villa in November was criticised by the prime minister and other politicians, some of whom suggested it amounted to antisemitism.BBC News has obtained a letter from the Dutch police inspectorate in December, which appears to contradict claims made by West Midlands Police about Maccabi fans' previous behaviour, which were used to justify the ban.West Midlands Police maintains it banned fans because of concerns over the safety of local people.The decision to allow the match to go ahead without Maccabi fans was announced in October, three weeks before the fixture.Aston Villa said the decision had been made by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group, who deemed the match a \"high risk\" because of unrest during previous Maccabi matches.Despite criticism from government and opposition politicians, the match went ahead without any away fans present.Craig Guildford, the chief constable at West Midlands Police, and John Cotton, the leader of Birmingham City Council, will both be questioned by Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee on Tuesday.Guildford has been called back by the committee, after previously giving evidence last month.The row over why away fans were banned has been ongoing since October, when the Safety Advisory Group, which includes the council, the club and police, made the decision because of what they said were safety concerns.West Midlands Police have repeatedly mentioned the unrest surrounding a Maccabi match in Amsterdam in November 2024, as part of the justification for the ban.During meetings of the safety group in October, they claimed that 500-600 Maccabi fans had targeted Muslim communities the night before the Amsterdam fixture, saying there had been \"serious assaults including throwing random members of the public\" into a river.They also claimed that 5,000 officers were needed to deal with the unrest in Amsterdam, after previously saying that the figure was 1,200.In November, a representative for the police force in Amsterdam said they did not recognise the claims.Last month, West Midlands Police hit back when a senior officer suggested that Dutch police had only questioned the claims because of political pressure.But a body that oversees the Dutch police has now backed up the Amsterdam officers' account of what happened.In a letter seen by BBC News, the Dutch Inspector General, Liesbeth Huijzer, said \"we do not see any new facts or circumstances that would warrant revising these findings\".Conservative MP Nick Timothy, who asked the Dutch Inspector General to intervene, said they had \"confirmed what we have long suspected\".He added: \"The facts on the ground in Amsterdam do not remotely resemble what West Midlands Police has claimed.\"Leaked minutes from the safety group, first reported by the Sunday Times and seen by BBC News, also reveal that the police said it would favour a ban despite an \"absence of intelligence\".A summary of a closed doors meeting on 7 October said that the police's preference had been determined based on what one officer described as \"conversations with piers [sic] and my professional judgment\".Those present, including representatives from the council, police, fire service and Aston Villa, were reminded that it was a \"confidential discussion\" and \"must not be shared\".The Sunday Times reported that two days later, an official at Birmingham City Council asked the police to provide more evidence for how the ban would help ensure the safety of fans because of concerns that it \"may be wrongly considered as anti-Jewish sentiment\".At a further meeting of the safety group on 16 October, West Midlands Police claimed there was now \"significant intelligence indicating potential for disorder involving Maccabi Tel Aviv fans based on recent fixtures\".West Midlands Police has been approached for comment.",

    "body": "New NHS online hospital to focus on eyes, menopause and prostates 7 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThe new NHS online hospital service being launched in England next year will initially focus on menopause, prostate and eye conditions.The NHS has selected nine different conditions in total for the service which will be available through the NHS app in 2027.The service, which was first announced in September, will allow patients to have assessments, check-ups and follow-up appointments online and will have its own dedicated team of doctors.The aim is to carry out 8.5 million appointments in the first three years – four times more than the average NHS trust.But experts have questioned how it will be staff and paid for.The nine conditions that will be prioritised initially are:glaucomaconditions affecting the retina at the back of the eye (including age-related macular degeneration)cataractsinflammatory bowel diseaseiron deficiency anaemiaprostate enlargementraised PSA levels (not  cancer diagnoses)menopausemenstrual problems which may be a sign of endometriosisThe expectation is more conditions will be added to this list in the future.No patient will be forced down this route though, NHS England said, as they can still choose face-to-face appointments.Patients will have the option of using NHS Online when a GP makes a referral for specialist care. Instead of having a physical site, patients will be able to receive care from doctors around the country, directly through the NHS App.Tests, scans or procedures that are needed will take place at healthcare sites close to patients' homes, while doctors review and assess their notes remotely.The government and NHS England believe the service will provide quicker access to care for patients and help relieve the pressure on in-person appointments, helping to cut waiting lists in the process.Professor Stella Vig, head of elective care at NHS England, said: \"The NHS's new online hospital will see a huge shift in the way we deliver care, giving patients the option to have an online appointment with a specialist anywhere in England.Regarding the nine conditions being prioritised, she said: \"We know that these conditions can be painful and difficult to cope with so providing faster, more convenient access to diagnosis and treatments will have a real and positive impact on people's lives.\"Questions remainPatients can already get test results on the NHS app and have online appointments.But this service builds on that by essentially offering a start-to-finish service digitally, building on some initiatives that have already been piloted.For example, University Hospital Southampton developed a virtual follow-up service for low-risk inflammatory bowel disease, enabling patients to access care and support remotely when they had flare-ups.It meant the NHS trust could cut back on routine follow-up appointments. Three quarters of patients were managed virtually and the initiative was credited in reducing waiting times by 58%.Meanwhile, Moorfields Eye Hospital in London has introduced a virtual system for managing non-emergency eye referrals. More than half ended up being treated in routine clinics without the need for specialist treatment at Moorfields.Moorfields Eye Hospital consultant Peter Thomas said: \"The impact is clear – patients are being seen more quickly in more appropriate settings, and the pressure on NHS services is being reduced.\"Dr Becks Fisher said, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the service will be helpful for some and focussing on menopause and menstrual health \"makes sense\" given the long waits for gynaecology services.But she added \"tricky questions remain\", including how the service will be staffed and paid for.She also said: \"NHS IT infrastructure could also pose a problem, as it will need to enable relevant information – like scan results – to be seen across different NHS organisations, something that is infamously difficult at the moment.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "7 hours agoBBCThe Daily Telegraph, and many of today's papers, leads with deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his words in a New York courtroom: \"I'm a prisoner of war\".The Times reports that as Maduro was making a \"defiant\" appearance in court, 2000 miles away his former deputy Delcy Rodríguez was being sworn in to replace him. At an emergency meeting of the UN security council, US ambassador Mike Waltz described the forceful removal of Maduro as a \"surgical law enforcement operation\". The Guardian also leads on Maduro's court appearance, highlighting its \"brevity and formality\" at \"barely 30 minutes\". This \"belied the far-reaching consequences of the US action,\" it says. Also, following Trump's comments that the US needs Greenland, the papers carries Denmark's warning that any US attack on the vast Arctic island would end Nato.A snap of Maduro hunched over and handcuffed alongside his wife Cilia Flores leads the Financial Times. Shares in US energy companies have surged meaning \"investors profit\" as he faces court, the FT says.After the \"swoop on Maduro\", the Metro asks \"who's next?\" It says world leaders have \"warned Donald Trump to keep his hands off their countries\". A photo of the US president speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One is captioned: \"chuffed\". The Daily Mail leads with the Danish warning that a \"Greenland raid will finish Nato.\" It is \"America's new world order\", the paper says, splashing a photo of Maduro \"shackled\". Trump has \"hinted\" Greenland could be \"next on his hit list\", it writes. But in a \"rare break with Washington\", British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he stood with Denmark.\"Tyrant captured by lunatic\" says the Daily Mirror, headlining with \"Mad Men\". Now that there is \"one president in cuffs\", there are \"fears Trump's set to launch new missions\", it says. The paper also highlights sacked Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim's \"brave face\" after leaving the club.The Independent describes Maduro as \"cuffed but defiant\". He told the New York court: \"I am a decent man. I am still the president of my country.\"The Sun leads with the sacking of Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim. \"When your trophies are nil and you've cost 30 mil... that's Amorim\", it writes, recalling a certain classic ditty. A photo of Trump in a Manchester United training jacket is splashed across the Daily Star's front. The club are dubbed \"Manbaby United\" as the paper asks to \"make red devils great again\".The i Paper reports that over-70s face a driving ban if they fail new eyesight tests. It says that cognitive testing for the age group is also \"under consideration\" as medical self-reporting declines.A new warning over the \"hidden\" danger of salt leads the Daily Express. The average working Briton eats as much salt as there is in 155 packets of crisps a week, it says.Pictures of a handcuffed Nicholas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores being taken to court in New York are on several front pages. The Times says he was defiant. The Daily Telegraph says her lawyer has asked that she be given an X-ray because she'd suffered significant injuries during her arrest.The Financial Times reports that Venezuelan bonds and shares in American oil companies have risen sharply, in response to Maduro's removal and Donald Trump's announcement that there'll be significant investment in oil infrastructure. The paper says Venezuela's government bonds - in default since 2017 - have jumped from 33 cents on the dollar, to 42 cents.\"Tyrant captured by lunatic\" is the Daily Mirror's take, which has the headline \"Mad Men\". In an editorial, the paper says a new reality of vast, continental spheres of influence, ruled by strongmen, has taken over from the old days of the international rule of law. The article concludes: \"It's frustrating, degrading and nauseating to be subservient to gunslinger Trump, but Sir Keir Starmer has no option but to stay on side for now.\"According to the Daily Mail the prime minister risks a rift with the US president by backing Denmark, which is resisting Trump's plans to annex Greenland. The paper says it's been told by a UK defence source that there was a \"30% chance\" that Donald Trump would try to take the territory.The Daily Express warns that millions of us are risking our health by eating too much salt. It highlights analysis by the British Heart Foundation which found that the average working age person in Britain eats 8.4 grams of salt a day - that's 40% more than the recommended daily limit. The paper says most of it is hidden in foods such as bread, cereals and ready meals.And finally, the Sun says the football manager, Ruben Amorim, was laughing all the way to the bank after he was sacked by Manchester United on Monday. The paper says he's cost the Red Devils £30m in pay and compensation paid to his old club, Sporting Lisbon.  Taking inspiration from the song, That's Amore, the headline reads: \"When your trophies are nil and you've cost 30 mil, that Amorim\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterHyundai Motor Group says it will roll out human-like robots in its factories from 2028, as major companies race to use the new technology.The South Korean firm showed off Atlas, a humanoid robot developed by Boston Dynamics, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Monday.Hyundai says it \"plans to integrate Atlas across its global network\", including a plant in the US state of Georgia that was involved in a massive immigration raid in 2025.Other firms that have said they will use humanoid robots in their operations include Amazon, Tesla and Chinese car making giant BYD.The Atlas robots will gradually take on more tasks, said Hyundai. The firm owns a majority stake in Boston Dynamics, the technology company famous for Spot the robot dog.Atlas, which is designed for general industrial use, is being developed to work alongside people and autonomously manage machines.Hyundai said the robots will help ease physical strain on human workers, handle potentially dangerous tasks and pave the way for wider use of the technology.The firm did not say how many robots it would initially deploy or how much the project will cost.Speaking at CES, Hyundai's vice chair, Jaehoon Chang, acknowledged concerns that that human workers could lose their jobs to robots. But he said people will still be needed train the robots, among other roles, the news agency Reuters reported.Monday's announcement came after Hyundai said in 2025 that in would invest more than $20bn (£15.5bn) in the US, supporting President Donald Trump's plans to boost manufacturing in the country.The firm said it would expand car production in the US and invest in autonomous driving technology and artificial intelligence (AI).Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla has also invested heavily in its humanoid robot, Optimus.Hyundai's battery plant in Georgia, which it operates in partnership with electronics giant LG, is one of its key facilities in the US.In September 2025, US immigration officers raided the plant and arrested hundreds of workers, including at least 300 South Korean citizens.The workers had their legs shackled in scenes that sparked outrage in South Korea.President Lee Jae Myung and Hyundai's chief executive José Muñoz warned that the raid could deter foreign investment in the US.Later that month, Washington and Seoul reached an agreement to release the detained workers.Trump said he opposed the raid and that the US had an \"understanding\" with the world on the need to bring in experts to set up specialised facilities and train local workers.Muñoz said in November that the White House had phoned him personally to apologise for the raid.",

    "body": "A former contestant on TV show The Apprentice sent a string of antisemitic, racist and sexist posts on social media, a medical tribunal has been told.Dr Asif Munaf, who is from Sheffield, is said to have posted and reposted the \"seriously offensive\" comments from his X account on various dates between October 2023 and July 2025.He appeared on the 2024 edition of The Apprentice but was dropped from The Apprentice: You're Fired! after he was accused of posting antisemitic comments on social media.The 37-year-old, who has not attended the tribunal and is not legally represented, denied the posts were antisemitic at a previous hearing.On Monday the General Medical Council (GMC) outlined the misconduct allegations against the doctor, who is registered under his full name Mohammed Asif Munaf.According to the GMC, Munaf posted multiple antisemitic statements, including Holocaust denial, conspiracy theories and rhetoric equating Jews with Nazism.Harriet Tighe, lawyer for the GMC, said one post was accompanied by an image of a flag including the Star of David above a swastika.Munaf also reposted a comment which referred to boxer Floyd Mayweather using a derogatory racial slur.In a separate post, Munaf expressed sexist views, arguing that certain professions should be restricted by gender and criticised female empowerment.At a previous hearing, he said the posts were \"not befitting of someone as educated as myself and were said in the heat of the emotion\".He is also accused by the GMC of \"disappearing\" just hours into a locum placement as a cardiology specialist registrar at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust in January 2024 as he walked out without notice or good reason.In a separate allegation, he is said to have provided a sick note to a patient in November 2024 while he was suspended from practice.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing continues.Additional reporting by PA Media.",

    "body": "17 hours agoPeter Hoskins,Osmond Chia,Nick EdserandNatalie Sherman,Business reportersShares in US energy companies have jumped as investors bet that the US seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro will open opportunities to tap the country's oil reserves. Shares in Chevron opened more than 4% higher, after surging more than 7% in pre-market trading, while other firms, including ConocoPhillips and Exxon also gained. Precious metal prices and shares in defence stocks also rose as the intervention increased investors' concerns about geopolitical risks.Gold was about 1.9% higher at $4,412 (£3,275) an ounce, while the price of silver was up by 3.6%, as money was moved into so-called \"safe-haven\" assets.Prices of precious metals such as gold and silver often rise in times of uncertainty as they are seen as safer assets to hold. The gold price saw its best annual performance last year since 1979 after rising by more than 60%, reaching an all-time high of $4,549.71 on 26 December.Those gains were driven by several factors including expectations of more interest rate cuts, major purchases of bullion by central banks and investor concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.Oil prices fluctuated on Monday as investors weighed whether Washington's intervention in Venezuela would affect crude supplies. Brent crude rose more than 1% to nearly $61.50 a barrel, still below highs seen in recent years, as analysts said ample global supplies would offset any disruption.Shares in Chevron, the only US company currently operating in Venezuela, rose 4%, while Spanish energy firm Repsol, among the other few Western energy firms with a presence in the country, gained 2%.Oil services firms also climbed, with Haliburton up more than 7%. US President Donald Trump has vowed to tap into Venezuela's vast oil reserves after seizing Maduro and said that the US will \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\".But industry analysts have said the move is unlikely to have an immediate impact on how much people and businesses pay for energy.Experts have also said it would cost billions of dollars to fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure, which has been in sharp decline since the early 2000s.Venezuela's crude production has been \"lacklustre\" for years and now only accounts for around 1% of global oil output, said investment strategist Vasu Menon from OCBC bank.The former chief executive of BP, Lord Browne, told the BBC's Today programme that for Venezuela to revive its oil production would take \"a tremendous amount of skill investment and time\". While there might be a \"quick pick up\" of some production, he added, output might actually fall while the industry is reorganising.Shares in defence stocks across Europe rose sharply as investors reacted to the US actions in Venezuela.In the UK, shares in BAE Systems rose 5% while Germany's Rheinmetall jumped more than 8%.\"Heightened geopolitical tensions like the ones we've seen over the weekend would normally spook investors, but global markets have avoided a sell-off,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\"Defence stocks often move higher when there are heightened tensions between two countries as investors believe events could spur governments to spend more on military protection.\"It was only natural to see the sector in demand after Venezuela's leader was captured,\" he added.Mining firms also rose following the gain in precious metals prices, with Endeavour Mining and Fresnillo both up more than 4%. Share markets in Asia made gains as investors focused on news unrelated to developments in Venezuela.Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 3% on the first day of trading of the year and new data showed that manufacturing activity stabilised in December.Major indexes in South Korea and China were also higher.The jumps reflect confidence that the fallout from events in Venezuela will remain distant, said Zavier Wong from investment firm eToro.",

    "body": "The Cuban government says 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.It described the dead as members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies were killed \"in combat actions\", declaring two days of national mourning. The armed forces added the Cubans \"fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombardments of installations\"Cuba, a long-standing ally of Venezuela, has for years supplied Maduro with his personal security detail and has personnel throughout the Venezuelan military.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the country had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife \"at the request\" of Venezuela. US spies had been monitoring Maduro's movements for months before US forces struck, according to US General Dan Caine.Gen Caine said that they had learned where the former leader moved, lived, travelled, ate, and worked.The New York Times reported that the CIA had also recruited a \"Venezuelan source\"  who it says informed the Americans of Maduro's exact location.Many of those killed are believed to have been part of Maduro's close security detail, who were with him at the time. Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed, but its armed forces  have said that a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team were among the casualties.An official statement from the Cuban government read: \"Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism\".The total death toll - according to an unnamed Venezuelan official cited by the New York Times - stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report. In the days following the seizure of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because \"Cuba is ready to fall\". He continued: \"I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count.\"On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a \"disaster\" run by \"incompetent, senile men\". \"If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit,\" Rubio said.In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor, Joe Biden, easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation. The White House said it would end \"economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people\".It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced. During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions.His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it. The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since. ",

    "body": "12 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterHigh street retailers Claire's and The Original Factory Shop are being put into administration, risking 2,500 jobs.It comes amid a turbulent time for Claire's, popular with tweens for its brightly coloured accessories, which was seeking a buyer after its US owner filed for bankruptcy last year.Modella Capital, which owns both chains, said the retailers would enter insolvency proceedings across the UK and Ireland. The administration will give them breathing space to find a new buyer.Modella said tough trading conditions and \"alarming\" low Christmas trading left both in a \"vulnerable\" position.Claire's has 154 stores and 1,355 staff, while The Original Factory shop has 140 stores and 1,220 staff.Modella purchased Claire's in September, six weeks after its previous collapse into administration, in a deal which saw around 1,000 job losses at the retailer, while 145 stores closed.The investment firm has owned The Original Factory Shop since early last year.\"This has been a very tough decision,\" said Modella. \"We have worked intensively in an effort to save both businesses, having made last-ditch attempts to rescue them, but neither has a realistic possibility of trading profitably again.\"Modella said that the chains were \"highly vulnerable\" even before it bought them. It also blamed challenges including the climate on the high street, which it said \"remains extremely challenging\", and government policy.The two shops are the latest casualties of a tough trading environment which has seen high street sales fall as shoppers move online, ditching old favourites facing the high cost of maintaining brick-and-mortar stores.\"A combination of very weak consumer confidence, highly adverse government fiscal policies and continued cost inflation is causing many established and much-loved businesses to suffer badly,\" Modella said.The investment firm has become increasingly prominent on Britain's high streets, having bought WH Smith's high street chain last year and taken over arts and crafts retailer Hobbycraft a year earlier.Modella is the latest business to criticise measures by Chancellor Rachel Reeves which have seen operating costs rise, making trading even more difficult as high inflation - the rate at which prices rise - squeezes household budgets.Her last Budget hiked taxes, while her previous Budget increased the minimum wage and raised employer National Insurance contributions.One London pub owner warned he may have to close after tax rises announced in the last Budget. James Fitzgerald, landlord of the Thatched House in Hammersmith, said his costs have risen by £22,000 over the past year - with the increase in National Insurance a major factor.The Treasury was asked to comment.",

    "body": "13 hours agoMadeline Halpertin court in New YorkWatch: What it was like in the courtroom at Maduro's hearingThe sound of clanking leg shackles could be heard moments before Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro walked through the doorway of a New York City courtroom for the first time.He then told packed rows of reporters and the public that he had just been \"kidnapped\". Minutes after his entrance, the Judge Alvin Hellerstein asked Maduro to confirm his identity so the proceedings could start. \"I am, sir, Nicolás Maduro. I am president of the Republic of Venezuela and I am here kidnapped since January 3rd,\" he told the court in a calm Spanish before an interpreter translated for the court. \"I was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela.\" The 92-year-old judge quickly interjected to tell Maduro that there would be a \"time and a place to get into all of this\". During the dramatic 40-minute arraignment on Monday afternoon, Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to drugs and weapon charges. \"I'm innocent. I'm a decent man,\" Maduro said, with Flores adding that she was \"completely innocent\". The 63-year-old and his wife were transferred to a New York jail after they were arrested by US forces at their compound in Venezuela on Saturday, as part of a surprise overnight operation that also saw strikes on military bases.Dressed in blue and orange jail shirts and khaki pants, the two wore headphones to listen to a Spanish translation during the hearing, an attorney sitting between them. Maduro took meticulous notes on a yellow legal pad that he asked a judge to confirm that he could keep with him after the hearing. Watch: Nicolás Maduro and wife en route to New York courtWhen Maduro walked into the room - the same federal courtroom where Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was tried and convicted just months earlier - he turned around to nod at several members of the audience and greet them. He maintained this calm and expressionless demeanour during the proceedings, even at the end, when a man watching from the public area suddenly shouted that Maduro would \"pay\" for his crimes. \"I'm a president and prisoner of war,\" he shouted towards the man in the audience in Spanish. The man was then escorted out of the room in tears.The proceedings were emotional for others in the court as well. Maibort Petit, a reporter from Venezuela who has covered Maduro's administration, said the US missile strikes during Maduro's arrest damaged her family home near Fuerte Tiuna in Caracas.She said it was surreal to watch her former leader escorted into court in prison garb by US marshals. Maduro's wife, Flores, was much quieter, with bandages near her eyes and forehead for injuries her lawyers said she sustained during their weekend arrest. She spoke softly with her blonde hair tied back in a bun while her lawyers asked that she be given proper medical treatment, including an X-ray of potentially bruised ribs and a fracture.  Maduro and his wife did not seek bail during the proceedings, but can do so at a later date, meaning they will remain in federal custody.

    "body": "Snow warnings continue as more wintry conditions on the way14 minutes agoEwan SomervilleandOttilie MitchellGetty ImagesA further 10cm of snow could fall across parts of Scotland on TuesdaySnow and ice warnings remain in place across many parts of the UK, as the Met Office warns disruptive snow could sweep across southern England this week.Parts of northern Scotland will remain under amber warnings of snow until Tuesday night, while less severe yellow warnings cover large swathes of the UK until 11:00 GMT.South-east and central England - areas not currently covered by weather warnings - could see disruptive snow on Thursday and Friday, the Met Office said.The cold snap of Arctic air has caused widespread sub-zero temperatures in recent days, closing hundreds of schools and affecting some flights and trains.Most yellow alerts across the UK will expire by late morning on Tuesday, with the amber warnings for Scotland lasting until 19:00.Heavy snow of 5-10cm has been widely forecast across central and northern regions of Scotland, with some areas set to see up to 15cm.The Met Office has advised those in the area not to drive and to prepare for possible power cuts.The agency says a yellow warning means some disruption is possible but many people can continue with their daily routine, while an amber warning indicates a higher risk of travel disruption, power cuts and the potential risk to life and property, with people advised to take precautions.Schools across the country continue to face closures. More than 170 in Northern Ireland were due to be closed on Tuesday. Getty ImagesCheshire, north-west England, is also covered by a yellow weather warning\"It's as bad as I've seen it,\" principal of St Patrick and St Brigid's College in Claudy, Phillip McCullagh, told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. Aberdeenshire, Orkney and Shetland councils also announced that their schools would remain closed.In Wales, some schools in Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend will be shut.There were delays to the rail network on Monday in some areas - Eurostar trains were unable to reach the Netherlands and Network Rail Scotland warned of \"exceptionally deep snow\" limiting the progress of snow ploughs.LNER has advised anyone travelling between Edinburgh and Aberdeen not to travel until 14:00 GMT Tuesday. Train services in northern Scotland will be disrupted until the end of the day on Tuesday, National Rail said. CalMac Ferries said services on the west coast of Scotland would be disrupted throughout the day.Flights were grounded at Liverpool John Lennon Airport on Monday after its runway had to be closed due to snow and ice. The airport reopened later that day.The cold blast does not seem to be coming to an end anytime soon. Later in the week, strong winds and heavy rain could bring an additional hazard as a deep area of low pressure sweeps across the UK.Getty ImagesThere has been some disruption for roads, rail and flightsThe Met Office said that parts of the south of England - much of which have missed the snow so far - may see some fall on higher ground on Thursday and Friday.Northern and central areas of England could face more snow, rain and strong winds, depending on the path of the approaching Atlantic system.Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said there was a 20% chance the system takes a northern route, which would bring widespread disruptive wind and rain to much of England and Wales, and possibly more snow in northern England, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland.Carl Recine/Getty ImagesMany areas of the UK have felt the wintry weather in recent daysBut he said there was a greater chance that the front moves through northern France, bringing disruptive snow to southern counties in England.The most likely outcome is wind and rain in southern parts of the UK, with central England seeing the risk of disruption from snow, he added.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued amber cold health alerts for England which will run until Friday.The wintry conditions have triggered the government's cold weather payments across 451 postcodes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Under the scheme, households on certain benefits receive £25 automatically if the temperature is their local area is recorded or forecast as 0C or below for seven consecutive days.Getty ImagesParts of Scotland often used to wintry weather have been blanketed in the current cold snap",

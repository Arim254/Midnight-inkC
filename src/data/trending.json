    "body": "16 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentBBCRussia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. Mysterious incidents of so-called \"hybrid warfare\" are mounting in Europe, increasing tensions. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article\"We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now.\" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and Nato countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped.How war could look in the tech-age\"Well that's odd. I've got no signal on my phone.\" \"Me neither. I'm offline. What's going on?\" That scenario, hypothetically, is just one way we could know that a war with Russia had begun, or was about to. (I should add that there can also be other, perfectly benign, reasons for a loss of signal.)That signal interruption could be followed by an inability to make bank payments for essentials like food and fuel. Food distribution would be disrupted, electricity supplies compromised.AFP via Getty Images'We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now,' Putin has saidThere are many ways of fighting a war, and not just the physically destructive wave of drones, bombs and missiles so tragically familiar to the citizens of Ukraine.Our modern, tech-driven society is highly dependent on the network of undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world, carrying data, financial transactions and energy. Covert activity by Russian spy vessels, such as the Yantar, is widely believed to have scoped out these cables for potential sabotage in a time of war, which is why the Royal Navy has recently invested in a fleet of underwater drones equipped with integrated sensors.In a war, these hidden, unseen actions, combined with an almost inevitable attempt to \"blind\" Western satellites in space, would seriously hamper the UK's ability to fight, as well as potentially wreaking havoc on civil society.Getty ImagesIn the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid itAt a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.\"There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,\" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell. \"Medical capacity is limited. Reserve regeneration pipelines are slow… The British plan for mass casualty outcomes appears to be based on not taking casualties.\" With classic British understatement, he says: \"This could be considered an optimistic planning assumption.\"He adds that to fight a long war you need proper back-up. \"It demands a second and even third echelon; personnel, platforms and logistics chains that can absorb losses and continue the fight. Yet this depth is notably absent from current British force design.\"Russia's 'low quality' army\"There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,\" says Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline, a private intelligence company.Two of the biggest military lessons to come out of the Ukraine war are firstly, that drones are now integral to modern warfare, at every level, and secondly, that \"mass\", or sheer volume of personnel and military hardware, matters.Getty Images'There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,' says Justin CrumpRussia's army is generally of a very low quality. Its soldiers are poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Their life expectancy in the deadly \"drone zone\" of eastern Ukraine is short. UK Defence Intelligence estimates that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 Russia's army has suffered more than 1.1 million casualties – that is killed, wounded, captured or missing. Even conservative estimates put the number of Russians killed at 150,000. Ukraine has also suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertain.But Russia has been able to draw on such a massive pool of manpower that it has so far been able to replace its estimated 30,000 monthly battlefield casualties with fresh blood. Russia's economy has also been on a war footing for more than three years now: an economist has been placed in charge of the Defence Ministry, while its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells. According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point. EPA/ShutterstockUkraine has suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertainAnalysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.\"The land war in Ukraine has shown beyond doubt that mass is absolutely vital for anybody that is going to face Russia on land,\" says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House think tank. \"And having deep reserves vastly greater in number than the standing regular armed forces has been shown to be essential.\"How national service conversations backfiredFrance and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. The UK's former Head of the Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, suggested in 2024, the year he retired, that the UK should train what he called \"a citizen army\" to fight a land war in the future. The idea was shot down by No. 10.\"I think it's a cultural thing within the UK,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at Rusi. \"So if you look at the states that are now looking towards [military service] - like Sweden, Germany and France - they are states who culturally still have an institutional memory of when they had that system. \"We haven't had national service since the 1960s and attempts to have that national conversation around it have pretty much backfired.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFrance has recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year olds\"The reality is, our armed forces cannot survive on a diet of government spin, over-the-horizon spending commitments and hollow rhetoric,\" Sir Ben Wallace, who was Defence Secretary in the Conservative government from 2019 to 2023, told the BBC.Responding to this, a spokesperson for the current Labour Defence Secretary, John Healey, told me: \"This characterisation is baseless. \"We increased defence spending by £5bn this year alone, signed 1,000 major contracts since the election and increased MOD spending with British businesses by 6% above inflation in the last year.\"He points to a new defence agreement with Norway, a £300m new investment in the Royal Navy's laser weapon and a £9bn investment into armed forces housing, adding: \"We're a government investing in the transformation of our forces, investing in our British service personnel... to create jobs and growth in Britain's communities.\"Getty ImagesGermany has also introduced voluntary military service for 18 year-oldsBut this is not about party politics. It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition. Billions of pounds have been spent on Ajax, an overdue armoured vehicle project still beset with problems. Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. More from InDepthToday, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia. They are referring to what is known as \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries.But worrying as these are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Getty ImagesA Eurofighter TyphoonThere are several potential flashpoints here, where Nato military chiefs fear that Putin, if he were allowed to achieve his aims in Ukraine, could eventually move on to seek new targets for aggression.One potential target is the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile (100km) stretch of border between Poland and Lithuania, both Nato countries. This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once part of the Soviet Union and were ruled from Moscow. They all voted for independence and have since joined Nato, but all have Russian-speaking minorities and hence there is a risk that Mr Putin could be tempted to send his troops across the border \"to protect them from persecution\".The eastern Estonian town of Narva, for example, is an obvious potential target here, as the majority of its population speak Russian and it sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of Ivangorod. A UK battle group comprising some 900 British military personnel has been stationed in Estonia, about 80 miles west of Narva, since 2017. AFP via Gettty ImagesThe eastern Estonian town of Narva sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of IvangorodIn the event of war, the plan goes, it would be hurriedly reinforced to brigade strength of around 3,000 or more.Another possible flashpoint is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is administered by Norway but where Moscow already has a toehold in the coal mining town of Barentsburg.Litvinenko, Skripal and hostile acts on UK soilThe UK may well be Putin's enemy number one, having been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, and having pushed for more powerful weapons to be delivered to help its defence.Hostile acts on UK soil that have been linked to President Putin include the murder with radioactive Polonium-210 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - a public inquiry concluded that Putin \"probably\" approved his assassination - and the attempted murder of former Russian military intelligence officer turned MI6 agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, using the nerve agent, Novichok.Dawn Sturgess, a mother-of-three, later died after she sprayed the Novichok, disguised as perfume, on her wrists. Putin was \"morally responsible\" for her death, an inquiry concluded last week. Lord Anthony Hughes, the inquiry chair, said: \"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin.\"Russia, which has always denied involvement in the attacks and suggested more than 20 different possible explanations for Ms Sturgess's death, described the report's findings as \"tasteless fairy tales\".Sputnik/ AFP via Getty ImagesPutin accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in UkraineBut the UK is also a core member of the Nato alliance. While questions are certainly raised in private over the reliability of the current US administration in the White House, it is hard to envisage the UK ever having to fight Russia on its own.\"A pure UK-Russia conflict is not likely and can be disregarded, practically,\" says Mr Crump. \"We would definitely fight with allies, although Russia would most likely only launch a conflict if it felt Nato would break.\"The wild card here is US President Donald Trump. While the chairman of Nato's Military Committee, Adm Cavo Dragone recently assured me that the US president was absolutely committed to defending the Nato alliance, others are not so sure. Would Trump, for example, go to war to defend the Estonian town of Narva?Getty ImagesIt is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies\"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to what the United Kingdom is actually capable of,\" concludes Keir Giles of Chatham House, \"because there are so many different situations under which it could be challenged by Russia.\"As a society, the UK – unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States – is unquestionably not ready for war. Even serious preparations for such an eventuality would be both expensive, unpopular and politically risky.But Mr Giles of Chatham House offers some sobering advice to the British public: \"Recognise that the rights and freedoms and prosperity that they take for granted are in fact under threat and that freedom does not come for free.\"\"And understand that lives will have to change. And this is not the fault of the current government or even its predecessors — it's their fault that it is so expensive, but the root cause of the problem is in Moscow.\"Top image credit: Ministry of Defence /PA Wire/ Getty Images.

    "body": "Just nowAoife WalshReutersA federal judge in New York has ruled the US Department of Justice can publicly release grand jury records from Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case. US District Judge Richard Berman's ruling reverses his previous decision to keep the material sealed. He cited a new law passed by Congress requiring the justice department to release files about Epstein.In his latest ruling, Judge Berman said the victims have the right to \"have their identity and privacy protected\", adding that their \"safety and privacy are paramount\".Esptein was charged with sex trafficking in July 2019. He died in a New York prison cell a month later while awaiting trail. Judge Berman in August had denied the justice department's request because of concerns about \"possible threats to victims' safety and privacy\".But in Wednesday's ruling, he said the materials could now be released because of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was signed into law by US President Donald Trump last month. The law requires the justice department to release investigative material related to Epstein by 19 December, including unclassified records, documents and communications.It also allows the department to withhold files that involve active criminal investigations or raise privacy concerns.Judge Berman is the third federal judge to grant similar requests from the justice department since the new law was introduced. On Tuesday, another judge made a similar ruling in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating Epstein's abuse.During her trial, prosecutors argued Maxwell recruited and groomed girls, some as young as 14, between 1994 and 2004, before they were abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year sentence. Last Friday, a judge in Florida granted a different request to unseal grand jury transcripts from another investigation into Epstein from 2005 and 2007. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoMahfouz Zubaide,Afghanistan producerandMattea BubaloFour Afghan men were ordered to report to the Taliban government's department of vice and virtue for dressing in costumes inspired by the TV series Peaky Blinders.The friends were told that their clothing was \"in conflict with Afghan and Islamic values\", a Taliban spokesman told the BBC, adding the values in Peaky Blinders went against Afghan culture.In videos posted online, the men, who have been released, can be seen posing in flat caps and three-piece suits similar to those worn in the series set in England soon after World War One.Since the Taliban seized power in 2021, they have imposed a number of restrictions on daily life in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.\"Even jeans would have been acceptable, but the values in the Peaky Blinders series are against Afghan culture,\" Saiful Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Taliban government's provincial department of Vice and Virtue in Herat city told the BBC.The men, all in their early twenties, come from the town of Jibrail in Herat province. They were ordered to report to the Taliban's \"morality police\" on Sunday, and presented themselves for questioning in Herat the following day.\"They were promoting foreign culture and imitating film actors in Herat,\" Khyber wrote on social media, adding that they had undergone a \"rehabilitation programme\". They were not formally arrested, \"only summoned and advised and released\", Khyber told the BBC's US partner CBS News.\"We have our own religious and cultural values, and especially for clothing we have specific traditional styles,\" he said.\"The clothing they wore has no Afghan identity at all and does not match our culture. Secondly, their actions were an imitation of actors from a British movie. Our society is Muslim; if we are to follow or imitate someone, we should follow our righteous religious predecessors in good and lawful matters.\"The men could be seen thanking officials for their advice and saying they were unaware they had violated any laws in a video released by the ministry after they were questioned - though it is unclear under what circumstances the interview was recorded. \"I have innocently been sharing content that was against Sharia which had many viewers,\" one said in the recording.He said he had been \"summoned and advised\", and would no longer do \"anything like this\".In an interview with YouTube channel Herat-Mic uploaded at the end of November, before they were summoned, the friends said they admired the fashion displayed in the series, adding that they had received positive reactions from locals.\"At first we were hesitant, but once we went outside, people liked our style, stopped us in the streets, and wanted to take photos with us,\" one of the men said, according to a translation by CBS News.",

They were challenged to embed hidden codes and ciphers into their designs.Three winners were selected by a panel of judges across three age groups.The famously tricky puzzles \"aren't meant to be solved alone\", GCHQ said, adding: \"We believe the right mix of minds means we can solve seemingly impossible problems.\"\"Puzzles are at the heart of GCHQ's work to keep the country safe from hostile states, terrorists and criminals; challenging our teams to think creatively and analytically every day\", said GCHQ Director Anne Keast-Butler.She said she hoped the puzzle encourages the next generation \"to explore STEM subjects and consider the rewarding careers available in cybersecurity and intelligence\".Meanwhile, the spy agency's \"Chief Puzzler\", known only as \"Colin\", said the puzzles are designed to test \"the same blend of skills our teams use every day to keep the country safe.\"Answers will be released on Wednesday evening.Question 1:Somewhere on the card is a special seven letter word which has no repeated letters, and no letters which are next to each other in the alphabet. Can you find it? Question 2:There is some driftwood in these streams... but where should it be?Question 3:The robber has to find a route through the house. He can't go through the same coloured door twice in a row, and cannot move against any arrows. Eventually he gets caught by the police. How was he acting?Question 4:My gifts from Santa are wrapped in pairs this year – but which one is missing?Question 5:The letters in TWO UV PAIRS have the values 0,1,2,…,9 in some order, with each letter representing a different digit.What is 1234567 ?Question 6:Solve this code. It has lots of four-letter words!Question 7:Find an appropriate 7-letter word...✓ = letter in right place ?? = letter present, but in the wrong place",

    "body": "How monogamous are humans? Scientists compile 'league table' of pairing up9 hours agoHelen BriggsEnvironment correspondentGettyMeerkats are incredibly social animals and live in large groups known as 'mobs' or 'clans'Humans are a bit like meerkats when it comes to pairing up, according to a study that examined the monogamous lifestyles of different species.In our romantic life, we more closely resemble these social, close-knit mongooses than we do our primate cousins, a \"league table\" of monogamy compiled by scientists suggests.At 66% monogamous, humans score surprisingly highly, far above chimps and gorillas – and on a par with meerkats.However, we are by no means the most monogamous creature. Top spot goes to the Californian mouse - rodents that form inseparable, lifelong bonds.GettyChimpanzees are highly social and form strong bonds but have very different social structures from humans\"There is a premier league of monogamy, in which humans sit comfortably, while the vast majority of other mammals take a far more promiscuous approach to mating,\" said Dr Mark Dyble at the University of Cambridge.In the animal world, pairing up has its perks, which may be why it has evolved independently in multiple species, including us. Experts have proposed various benefits to so-called social monogamy, where mates match up for at least a breeding season to care for their young and see off rivals. Dr Dyble examined several human populations throughout history, calculating the proportions of full siblings – where individuals share the same mother and father – compared with half-siblings, individuals who share either a mother or a father, but not both. Similar data was compiled for more than 30 social monogamous and other mammals.Humans have a monogamy rating of 66% full siblings, ahead of meerkats (60%) but behind beavers (73%).Meanwhile, our evolutionary cousins fall at the bottom of the table - with mountain gorillas at 6% rating, while chimpanzees come in at just 4% (alongside the dolphin).In last place is Scotland's Soay sheep, where females mate with multiple males, with 0.6% full siblings. The Californian mouse came top, at 100%.However, being ranked alongside meerkats and beavers doesn't mean our societies are the same - human society is poles apart.\"Although the rates of full siblings we see in humans are most similar to species like meerkats or beavers, the social system that we see in humans is very different,\" Dr Dyble told BBC News.\"Most of these species live in colony-like social groups or perhaps live in solitary pairs that go around together. Humans are very different from that. We live in what we call multi-male, multi-female groups, within which we have these monogamous, or pair-bonded, units.\"GettySoay sheep are the most promiscuous of all the animals studiedDr Kit Opie at the University of Bristol, who is not connected with the study, said this is another piece in the puzzle over how human monogamy arose.\"I think this paper gives us a very clear understanding that across time and across space humans are monogamous,\" he said.\"Our society is much closer to chimps and bonobos – it just happens that we've taken a different route when it comes to mating.\"The new study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterThe UK's media regulator says a porn company it fined £1m for failing to comply with the Online Safety Act has started to include more robust age checks on some of its websites.On 4 December Ofcom announced the £1m fine of AVS Group Ltd, which runs a number of pornographic websites, for not having good enough age verification methods.An Ofcom spokesperson said since the decision, AVS has now implemented a \"highly effective age assurance method on certain websites\", which was able to tell whether or not a child was using the site.It added the group could still incur fines of £1,000 per day, until the body was \"satisfied\" with the changes it had made across all of its platforms.Ofcom had also fined AVS an extra £50,000 for not responding to its emails since its investigation began in July.When asked if it had since heard from AVS, the regulator said it could not comment on an ongoing open investigation.After last week's £1m fine was announced, BBC News contacted a company called TubeCorporate, the adult content publishing platform behind AVS group Ltd sites, for a response, but is yet to receive one.The address which the firm uses is in the central American country Belize, and appears to be the registered address of a large number of companies - although it does not have physical offices there.The UK's Online Safety Act makes it a legal requirement for websites that host pornographic material to put in place what the regulator determines to be \"highly effective age assurance\" to prevent children from being able to easily access explicit content.Tougher age checks for porn websites were introduced in July, though some people have pointed out these could be easily avoided with a virtual private network (VPN), which reroutes internet traffic via a different country.A recent Ofcom report into the UK's media habits found VPN usage more than doubled after the start of age check requirements, rising from roughly 650,000 daily users before July and peaking at over 1.4 million in mid-August.",

A military source told the BBC two Ukrainian personnel were believed to have died in the incident, and several more were injured.The weapons system being tested was said to be an armed interceptor drone, according to unconfirmed reports.Ukraine's Ministry of Defence has been approached for comment.It is not known what L/Cpl Hooley's role was in the country. This is the first time the presence of paratroopers in Ukraine has been confirmed.The UK government has never disclosed the number of service people in Ukraine, but has previously acknowledged a small number is there to support Ukrainian armed forces and provide security to diplomatic personnel.The Parachute Regiment is an airborne infantry regiment of the British Army.It has not been confirmed in which battalion L/Cpl Hooley served. The first battalion is under the direction of special forces, while others are part of the Army's rapid response formation.It is the first death of a UK service member in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.The Parachute Regiment said it was mourning the death of the 28-year-old, who joined the British Army in November 2015.He joined the Regiment in June 2016 after completing his training at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick in North Yorkshire, it said in a statement on social media.Sir Keir told the Commons he had met Ukraine's President Zelensky in Downing Street on Monday, alongside France's President Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as efforts to negotiate an end to the war intensify.\"We must redouble our efforts,\" he told the House.\"The UK, Europe and our allies will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine, stand up to Putin's aggression and work to deliver a just and lasting peace.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, also speaking in the Commons, said: \"The thoughts of the whole House will rightly be with family of Lance Corporal Hooley, who tragically died supporting Ukraine in her fight for freedom.\"A series of talks to bring the war to an end have taken place in recent weeks, following interventions from US President Donald Trump and a range of European leaders.",

    "body": "US jets tracked circling Gulf of Venezuela as tensions mount4 hours agoMatt MurphyBBC Verify      Getty ImagesTwo US fighter jets were tracked circling the Gulf of Venezuela on Tuesday as tensions continue to escalate between the two countries.The F/A-18 Super Hornets appeared on flight tracking sites near Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city, at around 13:00 (17:00 GMT), before circling the gulf for about 40 minutes.A US defence official told the Associated Press the F/A-18 jets had conducted a \"routine training flight\" in the area.The incident comes amid a wave of US strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea, which the White House said were trafficking drugs to the US from Venezuela. Experts have raised questions over the legality of the strikes, which have killed more than 80 people.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of using the strikes to destabilise the country and oust him from power.In an interview conducted with Politico the day before the jets approached Venezuela's coastline, Trump declared that Maduro's days in power were \"numbered\", and declined to comment on whether US troops could be deployed to the country.A separate jet, an EA-18G Growler, also appeared just before the F/A-18s on the tracking site FlightRadar24. Data shows the jet flew loops just north of Venezuela's coast.They are the latest in a number of unusual US air force activities that have been tracked since September. B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers previously flew up to and along the Venezuelan coast.But the F/A-18s, which are capable of engaging targets both on the ground and in the air, appear to be the first to approach the Venezuelan coastline so publicly in recent months. The F/A-18s came within 20 nautical miles of the coastline, flight tracking data showed, but the US official said the jets remained in international airspace. Neither the F/A-18s or the Growler showed a point of origin or a destination on FlightRadar24, and all three aircraft only turned on their transponders when they arrived near the Venezuelan coastline. Justin Crump, head of the risk consultancy Sibylline, suggested the move was intended to \"support the administration's signalling and put pressure on the [Venezuelan] leadership\".The F/A-18s - which operated under the callsigns RHINO11 and RHINO12 - flew six loops up and down the Gulf of Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Growler jet - flying under the codename GRIZZLY2 - also flew circles along the coast. Greg Bagwell, a former RAF air marshal and president of the Air and Space Power Association, told BBC Verify that the flights appeared to be \"probing\" Venezuelan defence and trying to check for responses such as radio traffic and encrypted signals related to defence systems.\"The Growlers would have been listening for [signals intelligence], whilst the Super Hornets would have been providing air defence cover for the Growlers,\" Baswell said. He said the Growlers would also detect \"active missile sites\".\"It could be construed as the early gathering of intelligence for subsequent operations, or just a warning of such,\" he added.Crump said the jets also had the capacity to test out \"jamming capabilities\", adding: \"This also helps send a message, when successful, potentially indicating to Venezuela's leadership that these systems cannot or should not be relied upon,\" he said.The US has deployed troops, ships and jets to the Caribbean in recent months, which officials have said is to combat drug trafficking in the area.On Tuesday the US Southern Command published photos of an F/A-18 operating from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which has been sent to the Caribbean.Analysis of satellite images and ship tracking websites by BBC Verify has made it possible to identify at least nine military vessels that have been deployed to the region over recent weeks.Satellite images also show that an airbase in Puerto Rico, which was closed in 2004 by the Pentagon, has been re-activated. Repairs have been carried out to the runway at Roosevelt Roads base and F-35s - America's most advanced fighter - have been sent to the base.",

    "body": "Russell Crowe says Gladiator II creators misunderstood what made original 'special'3 hours agoPeter GillibrandandNaomi Clarke,BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesRussell Crowe won the best actor Oscar for his lead role in the 2000 original GladiatorRussell Crowe has criticised the creators of the Gladiator sequel for not understanding \"what made the first one special\".The actor, who played the lead character of Roman general Maximus in the 2000 historical epic, said the \"moral core\" of the story was what drew people into the original.Sir Ridley Scott's highly-anticipated sequel, starring Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal, received mixed reviews from film critics following its release last year. It appears that Russell was among those who were not entertained, as he said the film was a \"really unfortunate example\" of \"people in that engine room not actually understanding what made that first one special\".'You're taking away his power'In an interview with Australian radio station Triple J, he said: \"It wasn't the pomp. It wasn't the circumstance. It wasn't the action. It was the moral core.\"The first film, also directed by Sir Ridley, saw Russell's Maximus forced into slavery  and later dying of his wounds.It won five Oscars, including best picture and best actor for Russell.The sequel is set years later and sees Irish actor Paul play Lucius, who is revealed to be the illegitimate son of Maximus and Lucilla, played by Connie Nielsen.Russell said there was a \"daily fight on that set to keep that moral core of the character\" when he was filming the original. \"The amount of times they suggested sex scenes and stuff like that for Maximus - it's like 'you're taking away his power',\" he said.He also questioned the idea that Maximus had a relationship with his wife as well as with Lucilla, describing it as \"crazy.\"Getty ImagesPaul Mescal plays Lucius in the sequel, who is revealed to be Maximus' secret son  Russell also revealed people had come up to him in restaurants in Europe to complain after the sequel came out, to which he would say: \"It wasn't me, I didn't do it\".The reviews for Gladiator II were mixed, with the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw calling the movie a \"thrilling spectacle\" and describing Paul as a \"formidable lead\".Whereas Variety's Owen Gleiberman said it was a \"solid piece of neoclassical popcorn\" and \"ultimately a mere shadow\" of the original.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Shopaholic series author Sophie Kinsella dies aged 55Sophie Kinsella, author of the bestselling Shopaholic series of novels, has died at the age of 55, her family have announced.The writer, whose real name is Madeleine Sophie Wickham, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2022.A statement posted to her social media accounts on Wednesday read: \"We are heartbroken to announce the passing this morning of our beloved Sophie (aka Maddy, aka Mummy).\"She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy.\"Kinsella's books have sold more than 50 million copies in more than 60 countries, and have been translated into more than 40 languages.Tributes have been paid from around the literary world, including from her fellow authors as well as her agent and publisher.Sarah CresswellKinsella, pictured in 2024, had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancerKinsella announced in 2024 that she had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma two years earlier.The family statement added: \"We can't imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.\"Despite her illness, which she bore with unimaginable courage, Sophie counted herself truly blessed - to have such wonderful family and friends, and to have had the extraordinary success of her writing career. \"She took nothing for granted and was forever grateful for the love she received. She will be missed so much our hearts are breaking.\"'Unique voice'A statement from Kinsella's publisher said she \"defined and elevated romantic comedy by populating her stories with real-life issues that combined wit, emotional depth and societal insight\".Bill Scott-Kerr, her longstanding publisher at Transworld, described Kinsella as \"our author, our cheerleader, our fellow conspirator and our friend\".He added: \"Maddy leaves behind a glorious and indelible legacy, a unique voice, an unquenchable spirit, a goodness of intent and a body of work that will continue to inspire us to reach higher and be better, just like so many of her characters.\"British romantic comedy writer Jill Mansell offered: \"Maddy was a brilliant writer but more importantly a truly lovely person.\"In both respects she brought so much joy to the world.\"Sarah CresswellThe author's agents Araminta Whitley and Marina de Pass described Kinsella as \"an intelligent, imaginative, loving and irreverent woman who valued the deeply connective power of fiction\".\"She had a rare gift for creating emotionally resonant protagonists and stories that spoke to, and entertained, readers wherever they were in the world and whatever challenges they faced.\"They added: \"She also had an unmatched wit and ability to find the funny side. \"Comedy, for her, was both an art form and an intellectual pursuit and she instinctively understood that it is often a tightrope act of balancing light with dark.\"Getty ImagesKinsella wrote last year that she had \"always processed my life through writing\"Kinsella was born in London in 1969, and studied music at New College, Oxford, before switching to philosophy, politics and economics. She wrote her first novel, The Tennis Party, aged 24 under her married name Madeleine Wickham, while working as a financial journalist.\"My overriding concern was that I didn't write the autobiographical first novel,\" she told the Guardian in 2012. \"I was so, so determined not to write about a 24-year-old journalist. \"It was going to have male characters, and middle-aged people, so I could say, look, I'm not just writing about my life, I'm a real author.\"The book was acclaimed by critics and became a top 10 bestseller. She released six further novels as Madeleine Wickham.Five years later, writing as Sophie Kinsella, she published The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic - also known as Confessions of a Shopaholic.It introduced readers to Becky Bloomwood, a financial journalist who is a serial shopper and hopeless when it comes to her own finances, often buying new clothes or shoes on her credit card rather than saving her money.\"I thought, wait a minute, shopping has become the national pastime, and nobody has written about it,\" Kinsella said of her bestselling series.The first two novels in the series were adapted for the 2009 film Confessions of a Shopaholic, starring Isla Fisher.Getty ImagesA film adaptation of Confessions of a Shopaholic starring Isla Fisher was released in 2009After its huge success, Kinsella went on to write eight further Shopaholic novels and a short story, and another 18 books in total, including one young adult novel and four children's books.Kinsella's other works include Can You Keep A Secret? and The Undomestic Goddess.Her books were occasionally referred to as \"chick lit\" - a description she did not fully endorse\"When I hear the term 'chick lit', I feel a pinprick of, not annoyance but of slight resignation,\" she told the Daily Mail in 2018. \"'Oh, this again…' \"I've never had anyone say to my face, 'Your books are inferior,' but if people say, 'Your books are beach reads,' I say, 'Yep, that's fine by me. Read them on the beach!'\"Kinsella's most recent novella, What Does It Feel Like?, published in October 2024, was a semi-fictional account of her cancer diagnosis, written after she had surgery.In an introduction to the book, Kinsella said she had \"always processed my life through writing\".\"Hiding behind my fictional characters, I have always turned my own life into a narrative. It is my version of therapy, maybe.\"Kinsella is survived by her husband Henry and their five children.What is a glioblastoma?Glioblastomas are the deadliest and most aggressive type of brain cancer.About 3,200 people are diagnosed with a glioblastoma every year in the UK. Of these, just 160 survive for five years or more.It's a type of cancer that grows quickly - glioblastomas are likely to spread within the brain and come back even after being removed.Symptoms vary, but can include headaches caused by a build-up of pressure, personality changes, and memory problems. People may also have trouble speaking or experience extreme tiredness, depression, seizures and sight problems.Common treatments include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or if a patient is well enough, a surgeon will try to remove as much cancer as possible during an operation.",

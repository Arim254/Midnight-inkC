    "body": "Great journalism without brilliant photography is like Christmas dinner without roast potatoes.Getty Images' team of award-winning photographers covered more than 50,000 sports events in 2025, from grassroots tournaments watched by a few dozen fans to World Cups seen by millions around the globe.BBC Sport brings you the best sports photos of the past 12 months - and the photographers explain the stories behind them.Ever wondered how you get a picture at the top of the pole vault? What is a 'star filter'? And how much does luck play a part in capturing amazing images?There's a bonus point if you can spot the photographer in their own photo...Image source, Getty ImagesChristian Petersen: It was an honour to be part of the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo, where I set out to capture unique images and fresh perspectives. Noah Lyles' signature pre-race vertical leap inspired me to shoot from high above and behind, creating a new view that highlighted the graphic lines of the track. I was very happy with the result.Image source, Getty ImagesAdam Pretty: I took this picture at the relatively new Surftown wave pool in Munich, where some elite French Polynesian surfers had booked private training sessions. Athletes use the pool to focus on training specific manoeuvres and aerials on the perfectly consistent man-made wave.I photographed Aelan Vaast, the sister of 2024 Olympic surfing gold medallist Kauli Vaast, as she performed a layback hack on the final section of the wave. The image was shot in the early morning before the sun was up. I used a flash to create the silhouette of her against the bright blue water of the pool and the spray she was throwing with her massive turn.Image source, World Rugby/Getty ImagesMolly Darlington: I took this photo after the Women's Rugby World Cup final in the winners' studio, when the emotions were high and the players were super excited. It is my favourite photo I took from the tournament. Zoe Aldcroft and head coach John Mitchell are a perfect combination, summing up what it feels like to win the World Cup. What you can't see in the picture is all the players and staff who piled into the dressing room, throwing confetti and streamers and cheering them on. It was a special moment.Image source, Getty ImagesMahmoud Khaled: I am always searching for grassroots football tournaments in Egypt's villages and working-class neighbourhoods, where spontaneity meets pure passion. The Al-Qudah tournament in Sharqia was one of the most impressively organised I have seen, almost like a professional league match: huge crowds, co-ordinated team entrances, players from the lower divisions, and even referees who officiate in the Egyptian Premier League.What I love most is the journey itself, from discovering the story to reaching the place. The real reward comes afterward, seeing the joy on people's faces when they see their photos published.This frame was taken during the final, capturing the moment a player from Al-Ghaba takes a penalty in the shootout after a 2–2 draw. Al-Numan eventually lifted the trophy.Image source, Getty ImagesPool photo: The image - taken during the most exciting competition of the World Athletics Championships - illustrates Sweden's superstar Armand Duplantis' dominance in the pole vault final.A tiny camera, no bigger than a pack of cards, was mounted next to the support for the bar, and a customised technical solution allowed the photographer to trigger it remotely and receive the frame live on his laptop within seconds.Duplantis cleared 6.30m in this competition, broke the world record for the 14th time and secured his third world title. It is an exceptional achievement by the athlete and a fantastic piece of work by the photographer to capture the very best at the peak of the action.Matthias Hangst, Getty Images director of contentImage source, International Skating Union/Getty ImagesDean Mouhtaropoulos: Living in the Netherlands, I am lucky to cover speed skating, one of our national sports, although most of it is indoors.This event was near the Dolomites in Italy. Shooting such dynamic and talented athletes in an outdoor setting is a photographer's dream. A nearby building cast an afternoon shadow over the track. Once I spotted it, I quickly ran up the stand, hoping the clouds would not reappear. Some fans watching, plus my shadow, left a nice shape on the ice, leaving me to wait for the skaters to enter the frame.Image source, Getty ImagesEmilee Chinn: Geordie Beamish is shown going down after getting caught in the congestion of the early laps of the 3,000m steeplechase at the World Championships.Along with capturing the split second another runner's foot connected with his face during the fall, what makes this image so powerful and moving to me is that Beamish got up, finished second in the heat, and went on to win the gold medal. Moments like this are what make sports photography so rewarding, reminding us how resilience can turn a setback into something remarkable.Image source, Velo/Getty ImagesDario Belingheri: An unusual moment through the Tuscan hills during the one-day race Strade Bianche, where the gravel sectors and dust are its distinctive beauty. I was a bit lucky to catch the right moment when a train passes next to the peloton in a cloud of dust, so it is perfectly blended with nature.Image source, Getty ImagesCameron Spencer: As the northern hemisphere works through winter, we are fortunate in Australia to start the year with a major international event in the middle of our summer, the Australian Open in Melbourne.In this image, Holger Rune is stretching full length to play a forehand against Zhizhen Zhang. I captured it from an elevated position high above the court in a 'catwalk'. Taking a step back, I was able to shoot through the ceiling rafters. These, combined with the harsh shadows cast by the roofline, created an opportunity to capture an interesting shape on the bright blue court, then I waited patiently for Rune to play a dynamic shot behind the baseline.Image source, Getty ImagesMichael Reaves: This photo was taken during a Major League Baseball game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. Often in sports photography you can plan for the big moments and control factors with light, moment and composition, but other times luck comes into play. This is one of those moments.While shooting a mundane at-bat, Henry Davis broke his bat. Usually broken bats explode forward and out of frame, but this one broke on a centre point and created a unique image with the ball still in frame and the split bat floating in time, almost comically.Image source, Getty ImagesMatthias Hangst: This photograph was taken during the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Leipzig. The event was held at the Leipziger Messe, a very functional trade-fair complex and not always the most visually appealing setting. The roof structure was full of steel construction elements with plenty of light reflections, creating a rather distracting background.To work around this, I decided to use a 'star filter' - a layer of glass attached to the front of the lens that refracts light in a specific way. It adds a touch of elegance and helps highlight the dynamics of Sweden's Maya Staahl during her beam routine.Image source, Getty ImagesYong Teck Lim: Photo positions at the World Para Swimming Championships in Singapore were fixed, making it hard to get creative. Still, China's Jincheng Guo was impossible to overlook - competing without goggles, cap and tech suit, and throwing in his trademark bubble technique for good measure.For the first three days he swam only 50m events, leaving me little to capture. On day four the 200m individual medley finally gave me an opening. I went in tight, hoping to catch that bubble magic, and managed this single frame that looks like a UFO. His gold-medal finish made the shot even sweeter.Image source, Uefa/Getty ImagesMaja Hitij: Trophy-lift photos may look simple, but they require a bit of planning. Agencies and photographers divide responsibilities and co-ordinate positions in advance because the entire moment lasts only a few seconds.I wanted to find a different angle after the Champions League final - not the usual spot in front. I tried moving farther back, but the field was crowded with security, TV crews and players, so I settled on a position slightly further to the right, away from most photographers. I got lucky - the confetti was released earlier than expected, covering the whole background as the Paris St-Germain players turned toward Marquinhos.Image source, Getty ImagesJudit Cartiel: During the second half of the La Liga match at Espanyol, Atletico Madrid's Giuliano Simeone started a run down the wing. While following the play from the corner with my camera, I saw Simeone approaching the assistant referee. He collided with him and I quickly decided to keep the focus on the official. I was looking to capture a moment that was unusual in football, where the player usually takes the spotlight.The image shows the assistant completely upside down in an acrobatic posture, with a funny expression on his face, creating a photograph with a comical tone.Image source, Getty ImagesChristian Petersen: Covering alpine skiing is one of the most challenging and rewarding assignments for me. I am always searching for graphic elements to complement the intense action. Slalom's bright gates against the white snow create a striking visual canvas. This image, taken at the Ski World Cup Finals in Idaho, captures that perfectly, blending the racer's motion with a sweep of vivid colour.Image source, Getty ImagesAl Bello: This was an undercard fight before the main event. I like to shoot the undercards because I can try to take more chances with my photo technique. In this case I was shooting tighter than usual, hoping to catch a punch landing. The risk of shooting so tight is that if there is a knockdown you will likely miss the picture. I timed the punch at the exact moment, freezing the full force of the impact on the face.Image source, Getty ImagesHannah Peters: I had been looking forward to the Crankworx mountain biking festival in Rotorua, New Zealand, because it often makes good pictures, but was disappointed when I set off early that morning to clouds and no light.After about 30 minutes' walking and finding a good spot for the warm-up rounds, the sun suddenly broke through for about five minutes. There was only time for two riders to make their runs, so it was a bit of good fortune that Tim Bringer managed to pull off a pretty awesome trick.Image source, Getty ImagesStu Forster: This is the most exciting England cricket team to photograph in my career, with players like Jamie Smith at the forefront. You cannot take your eyes off it for a single ball. Here, Smith shows off his footballing skills to stop the ball from ricocheting on to the stumps during the Lord's Test. It was before this match that I read that the young Smith had been coached in his youth by Matt Holmes, formerly the cricket photography editor at Getty Images. It's a small world.Image source, Getty ImagesAdam Pretty: I have been trying to photograph water polo from the beginning of my sports photography career in 1998, as it has the potential for some amazing images. But it is so difficult to capture them because of the nature of the sport and the unpredictability of the water - the splashes and speed at which the drama happens.This image was extremely fortunate as the timing had to be perfect. I was not in control of anything apart from my camera, which was in an underwater robotic housing at the bottom of the pool. I had to rely on the match beginning at the perfect time, and the athlete diving in just the right way to pass through a tiny pocket of light.Fortunately, everything came together to create the image, and that is what I love about sports photography - it takes a number of elements or layers to create a memorable image.Image source, McKlein Photography/LAT ImagesTom Banks/McKlein Photography: Viera do Minho, a stage of Rally Portugal, features undulating roads and landscape scattered with large, round granite boulders.Having never shot this area myself, we hitched a ride up the mountainside to a remote stretch with the local 4x4 club - an experience in itself. After scouting various vantage points I settled in the valley and awaited the cars. As Adrien Fourmaux blasted into view, the fans delivered a perfectly timed wave of the Portuguese flag - complemented by the arrival of the low-flying TV helicopter.It is one of those moments when everything aligns.Image source, Getty ImagesShi Tang: This image captures a dynamic Tomoka Miyazaki of Japan mid-motion, rendered with a long-exposure effect that transforms her movement into flowing streaks of red light. The blurred trails emphasise the power and fluidity of the action, while the sharpness of her focused expression adds contrast and intensity. Set against a dark background, the vibrant colours and sweeping motion create an almost abstract, dance-like composition.Image source, Getty ImagesDean Mouhtaropoulos: Photographing the best athletes at the height of their powers is one of the many joys of my job. Covering the men's javelin F46 final at the World Para Athletics Championships in New Delhi, I noticed Guillermo Varona Gonzalez with a different pre-throw routine than most. Positioning myself low on the ground before his run-up, he would leap and double click his heels.The power in this leap would be enough to make a strong image, but the red clothing, impressive physique, javelin in hand and black sky all combined to made one of my favourite images of the year.Image source, Sportsfile/Getty ImagesSeb Daly/Sportsfile: For the uninitiated, this is hurling - an Irish sport that is incredibly fast, very skilful and, as this image shows, highly physical. These two players are merely getting to know each other at the start of the match - a little \"pulling and dragging\", as the locals might say, in an effort to throw an opponent off their game, to get into their head, assert a little dominance.All while this is going on, there is also a match to capture. It is a busy, raw, unique, and fantastic spectacle.Image source, Getty ImagesMichael Reaves: This photo was taken during game one of baseball's National League Division Series in Milwaukee. I was excited when they announced the mid-afternoon game time and was hoping the weather would hold off so the roof would stay open. The sun peaked for an inning while Aaron Ashby pitched and, from my position in the first base well, I was able to make a wide frame. I exposed for the highlights and let the shadows of the stadium create a compositionally pleasing frame as he delivered a pitch.Image source, PGA of America/Getty ImagesMaddie Meyer: In professional sports there is often such a distance between fans and athletes. It can feel sterile and as a photographer it can be hard to bring the atmosphere of the crowd and an athlete into one frame. Here Rory McIlroy ran to the adoring Europe fans after his team's win over the USA in the Ryder Cup in New York.He appeared to fully give in to the moment, allowing the fans to embrace him over the barricade. As a photographer it can be challenging to make a well composed image in a chaotic scene, but I like this picture and think it tells the story of Europe's triumph on away territory.",

Powerball did not identify the winner.The largest single-ticket prize remains the $2.04bn jackpot won in 2022 by a player in Altadena, California.In order to win the jackpot, a lottery ticket holder must match all five white balls and the red Powerball selected during a drawing.Tickets for the lottery cost $2 each - and the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, according to game organisers. A winner has an option to choose a lump-sum payment or receive the full amount in an annuity paid over 29 years, but most winners opt for the upfront cash option.The game, which began in 1992, is played in 45 of the 50 US states, the capital city of Washington, and in the US territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.The winnings are subject to federal taxes of between 24% and 37%, and, in most cases, state taxes.",

    "body": "5 minutes agoThe Royal Family dominates the Boxing Day front pages, with pictures of them attending the Christmas Day church service at the Sandringham Estate along with reports of King Charles III's Christmas message. Catherine, Princess of Wales, is pictured waving to crowds on the front page of the Times, while the main story focuses on Chancellor Rachel Reeves' \"mansion tax\" which, it says, tens of thousands of homeowners will have to pay because of inaccurate assessments. According to the paper, properties could be overvalued by as much as £30,000, leading to homeowners being dragged over the £2m threshold. The Guardian leads with its own research, which suggests that fewer than one in 60 public sector workers are sharing leave with their partners when they have a baby. Experts have criticised it as a \"lost decade\" of progress on parental rights. The King and Queen Camilla are pictured on the front as they attend church in Sandringham.A teacher at a school in Oxfordshire says he was referred to the government's counter-terrorism programme after showing videos of US President Donald Trump to his politics class, the Daily Telegraph reports. The teacher says he began a grievance procedure against Henley College and received a £2,000 payoff in a negotiated settlement after he was effectively forced to resign, according to the paper. The school was quoted as saying: \"The Henley College does not comment on individual allegations or ongoing investigations.\" Meanwhile, the paper chose to feature Princess Charlotte on its front page as she joined her family for the church service.  The King's Christmas message leads the Daily Mirror,  saying that he spoke of the \"common values that unite us\". The paper notes that his words come as tensions rise both at home and abroad. High Street shops will net £1bn less than last year on Boxing Day, reports the Daily Mail, citing figures from Barclays Bank. The paper says stretched household budgets will lead people to shun the sales on Friday \"as consumer confidence collapses amid Rachel Reeves' tax bombshells\". The Sandringham service is also featured on the front page, with the paper noting that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie joined the Royal Family in Norfolk while their father stayed in Windsor. The former prince was stripped of his titles after intense pressure over his links to the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.     The appearance of Beatrice and Eugenie leads the Sun, which says the former's \"last-minute\" decision to join her sister with the rest of the Royal Family in Norfolk \"delighted well-wishers\". The paper says their \"show of support\" for the King comes almost a week after the US Department of Justice started releasing hundreds of thousands of documents related to the Epstein case, with Andrew appearing in some of the files. Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. A poll for the Independent suggests that more than a third of Labour supporters say the party would have a better chance of winning the next general election if Sir Keir Starmer were replaced. The paper says 19% of Labour supporters backed Andy Burnham, when asked who should replace the prime minister. The i Paper is leading with analysis of this year's polls by Sir John Curtice, who says Britain is entering \"uncharted territory\" as Labour faces a threat from Nigel Farage's Reform UK and the Green Party under Zack Polanski. The leading polling expert tells the paper that the vote of the two main parties is at a \"record low\", meaning the UK's political landscape has never before \"looked so fragmented\". The Daily Express is celebrating its Christmas appeal on its front page, saying its readers raised more than £100,000 for the children's wheelchair charity Whizz Kidz. The money raised will help buy 20 personalised wheelchairs or other life-changing aids that will give children more freedom, according to the paper. Also featured on the front page is the Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte as they attended the Christmas Day church service.  And finally, the Daily Star decided to feature football royalty on its front page, leading with David Beckham's \"family fracas\". It says that Brooklyn Beckham stayed away while David, Victoria and the rest of the family celebrated Christmas by singing a Spice Girls hit. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has said the US launched a \"powerful and deadly strike\" against the Islamic State (IS) group in north-western Nigeria. In a post on Truth Social, the US president described IS as \" terrorist scum\", accusing them of \"targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians\".Trump said the US military \"executed numerous perfect strikes\", without giving any further details. Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said he was \"grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation. Merry Christmas!\"It is unclear what exact targets were struck and when. In November, Trump ordered the US military to prepare for action in Nigeria to tackle Islamist militant groups.The Nigerian government has not publicly commented on the reported strikes.In his post late on Thursday, Trump said that \"under my leadership, our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\".In his warning back in November, the US leader did not say which killings he was referring to - but claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians have been circulating in recent months in some right-wing US circles.Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.An adviser to Nigerian President Bola Tinubu told the BBC at the time that any military action against the jihadist groups should be carried out together.Daniel Bwala said Nigeria would welcome US help in tackling the Islamist insurgents but noted that it was a \"sovereign\" country.He also said the jihadists were not targeting members of a particular religion and that they had killed people from all faiths, or none.President Tinubu has insisted there is religious tolerance in the country and said the security challenges were affecting people \"across faiths and regions\".Trump earlier announced that he had declared Nigeria a \"Country of Particular Concern\" because of the \"existential threat\" posed to its Christian population. He said \"thousands\" had been killed, without providing any evidence.This is a designation used by the US state department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".Following this announcement, Tinubu said his government was committed to working with the US and the international community to protect communities of all faiths.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people - however most of these have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group which analyses political violence around the world.In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture.Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed - but atrocities have been committed on both sides.Human rights groups say there is no evidence that Christians have been disproportionately targeted.Last week, the US said it had carried out a \"massive strike\" against IS in Syria,The US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.",

    "body": "Pope Leo has urged Ukraine and Russia to find the \"courage\" to hold direct talks to end the war during his first Christmas remarks to crowds in St Peter's square.He called for an end to conflicts around the world during his Urbi et Orbi address, which is traditionally delivered by the pontiff on Christmas Day to worshippers gathered in Vatican City. Speaking about Ukraine, the Pope said: \"May the clamour of weapons cease, and may the parties involved, with the support and commitment of the international community, find the courage to engage in sincere, direct and respectful dialogue.\"His plea comes as US-led negotiations on a deal to end the fighting continues. The US has sought to put together an agreement acceptable to both sides, but direct talks between Russian and Ukraine have not taken place during this latest round of diplomatic efforts.Pope Leo also decried turmoil and conflict plaguing other parts of the world, including Thailand and Cambodia where deadly border clashes have flared up despite a ceasefire in July.He asked that the South East Asian nations' \"ancient friendship\" be restored and \"to work towards reconciliation and peace\".During an earlier Christmas Day sermon in St Peter's Basilica, Pope Leo lamented conditions for homeless people the world over, and the damage caused by conflicts.\"Fragile is the flesh of defenceless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds,\" he said.He said the story of the birth of Jesus showed that God had \"pitched his fragile tent\" among the people of the world. \"How, then,\" he asked, turning his attention to the conditions of Palestinians, \"can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold?\"Gaza has been devastated by Israeli bombardment in a two-year war, triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.Winter storms have compounded the plight of the territory's 2.1m population, nearly all of whom have been displaced and their homes damaged or destroyed.Aid agencies have called for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza. Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's border crossings, has dismissed claims of deliberate aid restrictions, saying almost 310,000 tents and tarpaulins had been delivered since the start of the ceasefire in October.",

    "body": "The jailed ex-president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a successful surgery for a double hernia, his wife Michelle says. The former leader is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brazil's Supreme Court granted permission for the 70-year-old to be transferred from the room in the federal police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to a hospital in the capital, Brasília, for the procedure. Ahead of the surgery, Jair Bolsonaro endorsed the candidacy of his eldest son, Flávio, for the 2026 presidential race. The former president made his decision known in handwritten letter that was read out by Flávio Bolsonaro outside the hospital were his father is being treated.\"During my life, I have fought tough battles, paying a high price with both my health and my family, to defend what I think is best for our country,\" Bolsonaro wrote.\"I hand over what is most important in the life of a father - my own son for the mission of rescuing our country, Brazil.\"Flávio Bolsonaro, a 44-year-old senator, had already announced his decision to run for president for his father's Liberal Party.Ealier this month, he said his father had entrusted him \"with the mission of continuing our national project\". But Jair Bolsonaro's letter, which has been published by Brazilian media, is confirmation the senator has his father's backing.The incumbent, President Lula, has already announced he plans to run again in the presidential election scheduled for October 2026. In 2022, the presidential election went into a run-off, which saw the older Bolsonaro take on ex-President Lula. When Lula narrowly won, Jair Bolsonaro refused to accept the result and plotted with top military leaders to prevent Lula from taking up office. While the plot failed to enlist enough support from the military to go ahead, it did culminate in the storming of government buildings by Bolsonaro's supporters on 8 January 2023.Bolsonaro was found guilty of coup-plotting and sentenced in September this year. Despite the guilty verdict, the older Bolsonaro still wields considerable political influence.Brazil's Congress passed a bill last week to significantly shorten Bolsonaro's sentence but President Lula said he would veto it.  Jair Bolsonaro is expected to be transferred back to federal police headquarters as soon as doctors give the go-ahead. ",

    "body": "Cold health alert as parts of UK set to freeze on Christmas Day9 hours agoThomas MackintoshandJonathan Josephs,Hyde ParkWatch: Swimmers brave the Serpentine for chilly Christmas dipA cold health alert and weather warnings have been issued for parts of the UK on Christmas Day, as forecasters dashed hopes of a white Christmas.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued the yellow alert for south-west England from 18:00 on 25 December to midday on 27 December.A Met Office yellow warning for wind covers south-west England, Somerset and a large swathe of Wales, stretching from Cardiff and Swansea up to Bangor. Gusts hit 68mph (109 km/h) early on Thursday at Berry Head, Torbay.Organisers of some Christmas and Boxing Day swims in Devon and Cornwall have had to cancel events.Other swimming events still took place.Around 400 swimmers entered the chilly water at The Serpentine in London's Hyde Park, with around 100 competing in the annual Peter Pan Cup race.Dave Bill, who took the trophy home this year, told the BBC it was a \"real honour\" to win, adding: \"Swimming in the cold water is one of the most rewarding things. It calms my nervous system.\"Mr Bill said it was a \"real honour\" to win a race that traces its roots back to 1864Meanwhile, the Met Office warning covers 18 of Wales' 22 council areas.In south-west England, temperatures on Christmas morning were between 1C and 4C (34F and 39F) for most, said BBC Weather's Matt Taylor, but it was \"feeling below freezing due to the wind chill\".Winds around coasts and on moors have exceeded 40mph at times, hitting 43mph at Plymouth and 49mph at Liscombe, Exmoor, he added.Met Office spokesman Oli Claydon said it was \"highly unlikely\" the UK would see a white Christmas.\"We've got a very dry picture across the UK over the next few days,\" he added.Although not an official part of the UK, the crown dependency of Jersey experienced snow on Thursday morning.The Jersey Met Section said it was only the third time since records began that snow was observed on the island on Christmas Day and the first time since 1970.PA MediaNot every Christmas Day dip was cancelled and brave swimmers took to the water in Blackroot Pool in Sutton Park, Birmingham Nadezna / BBC Weather WatchersPeople gather to watch the Christmas Day sunrise in PenarthAccording to UKHSA, low temperatures are likely to have minor impacts on health and social care services including \"increased use of healthcare services by vulnerable people\" and a \"greater risk to life of vulnerable people\".The Met Office said east to north-easterly winds would become particularly strong and gusty during Christmas Day.Gusts are expected to peak fairly widely at 45-55mph, with 55-65mph possible along some exposed coasts and to the west of prominent hills.It added that \"given the more unusual wind direction, this may lead to some disruption to transport and power supplies\" and that \"large waves will be an additional hazard on some coasts\".The highest temperatures on Christmas Day were forecast to be around 7C (45F) in north-east England and 6C in south or south-east England.The Met Office added that frost and freezing temperatures were likely in western rural areas overnight on Christmas Day into Boxing Day, with -6C possible in rural parts of Scotland and -4C in rural Wales.Organisers of the Coverack swim in Cornwall said with the weather forecast it would be \"too dangerous\" for the event to go ahead and postponed the event until New Year's Day.Start Bay Inn, in Devon, said it was \"really sad\" to announce its Boxing Day swim had been cancelled, while the RNLI Teignmouth took a similar decision, insisting \"safety considerations must come first\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterandJaroslav LukivUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has given a positive assessment of a conversation he had with US envoys on how to end the Russia-Ukraine war.Zelensky said Thursday's call with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, which lasted nearly an hour, had yielded \"new ideas in terms of formats, meetings, and... timing on how to bring a real peace closer\".He spoke a day after giving details of an updated 20-point peace plan, agreed by US and Ukrainian envoys in Florida. Zelensky said he had asked Witkoff and Kushner to pass along Christmas greetings to US President Donald Trump \"and the entire Trump family\".The Kremlin said it was analysing proposals brought back from the US by a Russian envoy.Trump and his envoys have been holding talks with both Ukraine and Russia in an effort to reach a deal to end the war which was started by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.There appears to have been some progress in recent days with Ukraine's president praising the \"good ideas\" put forward by Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Kushner.Zelensky said it had been an \"active day\" for his country's diplomacy, as he went into details with the US envoys.He conceded that there was still \"work to be done on sensitive issues\" but added that \"together with the American team, we understand how to put all of this in place\".Zelensky added that Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov, the country's top security official, \"will continue discussions with the American team\".The 20-point peace plan agreed by the US and Ukraine is seen as an update to the  initial draft prepared by Witkoff several weeks ago.That draft was widely seen as heavily geared towards Russia's maximalist pre-invasion demands, which Kyiv and its European said meant the de facto capitulation of Ukraine.Describing the updated proposal on Wednesday, Zelensky had said it offered Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarised zone in their place.He said the plan now included security guarantees from the US, Nato and Europeans for a co-ordinated military response if Russia invaded Ukraine again.On the key question of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donetsk region, Zelensky said a \"free economic zone\" was a potential option. Any area that Ukrainian troops pulled out of would have to be policed by Ukraine, he stressed.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. They are collectively known as Donbas.Zelensky has been under heavy pressure from Trump to cede all of Donbas to Russia during ongoing Washington-led peace negotiations.The Ukrainian leader has so far rejected any territorial concessions, and instead demanded iron-clad security guarantees for Ukraine in any potential settlement.Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must leave Donbas or Russia will seize it.On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was studying the proposals brought back from the US by the Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev.\"We are examining this material, and depending on the decisions made by the head of state, we will continue our communication with the Americans,\" he said.While diplomatic efforts to end the conflict inch forward, fighting continues on the ground. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that it had struck one of Russia's key oil refineries in the southern region of Rostov with cruise missiles. The Novoshakhtinsk refinery near the Ukrainian border is critical for supplying fuel for Russian military operations in occupied eastern Ukraine.The Russian defence ministry said its forces had taken control of the settlement of Sviato-Pokrovske in the Donetsk region.Earlier this week, Ukrainian troops withdrew from the embattled eastern town of Siversk.The capture of the town brings Russia closer to the last remaining \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk still in Ukrainian hands in the Donetsk region.",

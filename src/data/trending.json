    "body": "24 hours agoKatya AdlerEurope editorBBCDowntown Munich is best-known for chic shops and flashy fast cars but right now its streets are bedecked with posters advertising next generation drones.\"Europe's security under construction\" boasts the slogan on an eye-catching set of sleek black-and-white photographs, festooned across a scaffolding-clad church on one of this town's best known pedestrian boulevards.Such an unapologetic public display of military muscle would have been unimaginable here just a few years ago, but the world outside Germany is changing fast, and taking this country with it.The southern region of Bavaria has become Germany's leading defence technology hub, focusing on AI, drones and aerospace.Advertisements such as these that say \"Europe's security under construction\" would have been unthinkable in Germany not long agoPeople here, like most other Europeans, say they feel increasingly exposed - squeezed between an expansionist Russia and an economically aggressive China to the east, and an increasingly unpredictable, former best pal, the United States, to the west.According to a recent Eurobarometer poll, more than two-thirds of Europeans (68%) feel their country is under threat.This autumn, Germany's Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance warned for the first time since the Cold War that war is no longer \"unlikely\". While emphasising that this is a safe country, it also recommends that Germans keep food supplies to last three to ten days at home. Just in case.Germany is the number one single donor of military and other aid to Ukraine, now that the US has halted any new direct aid. Opinion polls suggest voters here want to feel better protected at home too.AFP via Getty ImagesGermany is now the single biggest giver of aid to UkraineThe question for this country, along with others in Europe is whether traditional alliances with the US, in Nato and the EU can suffice, or whether they should be diversifying into ad-hoc coalitions alongside other like-minded nations such as Australia, South Korea and Japan?Precarious relationsBy 2029, the German defence budget will be higher than the UK and French equivalents combined, Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte pointed out to me.He described the €150bn they say they will spend on defence as \"a staggering amount\".It's something the United States notices and appreciates, he said. Donald Trump is far from the first US president to insist that Europe do more for its own security, though his tone has been noticeably more threatening than that of his predecessors.The precarious state of transatlantic relations was the main focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) this weekend. It's the world's biggest annual defence meeting, bringing leaders, security experts and defence industries together.Mark Rutte (pictured speaking to Katya Adler), described the E150bn Germany will spend on defence \"a staggering amount\"While it's easy to dismiss speech-heavy get-togethers like this as wind-baggy talking shops, in the turbulent times we live in, they can make a difference - especially the informal private huddles between global decision makers, far away from the glare of the cameras.The most eagerly - and for some the most anxiously - anticipated speech at this year's conference was that of the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who represented the Trump administration here.European leaders and top diplomats were seriously on the edge of their seats. But why was a simple 30-minute address given so much importance?It's because Europe-US relations have never been so frayed as they are now, over the last 80 years since World War Two. And this isn't a bust-up between buddies that will easily blow over.Denmark still furiousIn the just over 12 months since Trump returned to the White House, he has at times insulted and undermined European leaders, slapped big tariffs on their exports, and most shockingly of all to his allies in Nato, threatened Danish sovereignty over its territory, Greenland, refusing for a while to rule out taking the island by force.Speaking at the MSC on Saturday, Denmark's still clearly furious prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Trump's designs on Greenland remained \"the same\" despite ongoing trilateral talks between representatives of Greenland, the US and Denmark.Trump has ruled out taking Greenland by military force for now, and he's backed away (for the moment, at least) from slapping economic sanctions on allies, including the UK, France and Germany, that were getting in the way of the US acquiring the Arctic island. But transatlantic trust was severely damaged.European powers see in Trump a truly transactional president who thinks nothing of leveraging security or economic relations with his closest allies to get what he wants. Just before being re-elected president, for example, he told Europeans that the US would not protect nations that didn't pay their way on defence.It is true though, that Europe has been coasting on America's security blanket for decades. Critics in the US argue that European nations have been able to run generous welfare states for decades while Washington picked up the tab for security spending.AFP via Getty ImagesThe speech by US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio (left) was the most eagerly anticipated at the conferenceGermany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, told me on Saturday: \"We got used to the strong support from the US;  we got used to our comfort zone in which we used to live. This time is over, definitely over,\" he said. \"Washington was right.\"But the crisis over Greenland and other actions by the Trump administration - such as when it temporarily paused intelligence-sharing with Ukrainian forces last March, leaving them blind on the battlefield, in order to pressure Kyiv into engaging in peace talks with Moscow - have left deep scars and a troubling sense of transatlantic wariness.Hence the trepidation in Munich before Rubio took the stage.In the end, his words were laced with a sense of historic kinship. \"We want Europe to be strong,\" he said. \"The two great wars of the last century serve for us as a constant reminder that ultimately our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.\"I found it telling that so many leading European figures in the audience jumped on the warmth of his words, rising to their feet to applaud the US Secretary of State. They were clearly relieved he hadn't threatened or berated Europe as the US Vice President JD Vance famously did at last year's MSC.But for those listening closely, Rubio's speech was loyal to themes close to the heart of the Trump administration and hard for many European leaders to swallow: anti climate action, sceptical of globalisation, multilateralism, migration and pro the building of a new era of Christian western civilisation.Rubio was clear: the US wasn't interested in allies clinging to the old status quo. It wanted to forge a new path, ideally alongside Europe, but only if it shared the same values.This US offer of close partnership was conditional and absent of a sense of compromise.\"A bit like a (psychologically) abusive partner,\" said one European diplomat, speaking candidly on condition of anonymity. \"He reminded Europe how wonderful the (transatlantic) relationship used to be, but he then switched to coercion: If you want things to be good between us in the future, you have to do as I say!\"Another diplomat pointed out that, while talking of shared values, it was telling, he said, that of all the European countries that Rubio could have gone to after making his speech in Germany, he chose to visit Slovakia and Hungary before heading back to the US.They are viewed by Brussels as two of the EU's most problematic members, both with Eurosceptic nationalist prime ministers who oppose sending military aid to Ukraine and who are tough on migration.A fragile new relationshipRubio's softer tone also divided European leaders who had recently spoken as one, in defence of Denmark, at the height of the Greenland crisis last month.The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, underlined a now fragile relationship with the US, despite Rubio's gentler rhetoric. \"Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore,\" she said. \"Europeans have suffered shock therapy.\"But will some countries in Europe grasp what warmness there was in Rubio's speech as an excuse not to rush to boost defence spending as promised? The coffers of most European governments are over stretched already and their voters tend to prioritise cost-of-living concerns over defence budgets.Reuters\"Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore,\" according to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der LeyenRachel Ellehuus, Director-General of defence think-tank RUSI told me she sees a rift opening up across the continent.On the one hand, you have the Nordic and Baltic nations that are geographically close to Russia, and also Germany and the Netherlands, which are all big defence spenders, she says, whereas in southern Europe, there's Spain, for example, that is absolutely unapologetic about refusing to increase defence budgets to the levels demanded by Donald Trump.France and Britain are both verbally committed to boosting defence spending, says Ellehuus, but are still looking for a \"political band aid\" to help them explain to voters the trade-offs that will involve - higher taxes, less welfare or more borrowing.\"Europeans need to get to work yesterday and to focus,\" she says. \"They have 5-10 years to stand on their own two feet in terms of conventional defence capabilities.\"Last week, U.S. Undersecretary of Defence Elbridge Colby couldn't have been more stark in his messaging at a meeting of Nato defence ministers he attended in Brussels: Europe was no longer a US priority, the Indo-Pacific was.\"Under President Trump's leadership, we are reprioritising the defence of our homeland and the protection of our interests in our Hemisphere,\" he said.While he emphasised that the US remained committed to Nato's mutual defence clause, where an attack against one member is viewed as an attack against all, Colby insisted the US would be reducing its capabilities in Europe, becoming \"a more limited and focused\" presence.Europe had to become a partner, rather than a dependent, he said, calling for a new \"Nato 3.0\". The old world order with the West at its core, has faded but the MSC this weekend made clear that what comes next for Europe and the US is still very much up in the air.Marco Rubio called for a new century of western civilisation, Elbridge Colby wants a re-vamped Nato, while the UK's prime minister appealed in Munich for the western alliance to be re-made.Starmer's nuanced approachIn stark contrast to Marco Rubio's insistence on greater national sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer spoke in favour of greater integration between the UK and Europe on defence - to cut re-armament costs, though, he emphasised this did not mean the UK turning its back on the United States.Sophia Gaston, national security expert at Kings College London, told me that in Munich, Starmer was able to better articulate the nuance of Britain's strategic outlook.\"Other allies in Europe may be more willing to speak of divergence from Washington\", she says, \"but for Britain it remains a strategic imperative to triangulate within the Transatlantic relationship. There will also be times when Britain will have to make hard choices, and Starmer appeared more confident in confronting that reality.\"The key is to have a really strong grasp of the national interest and our instruments of power and influence. This requires a much more competitive approach that has not always felt natural to Britain, which has typically pursued much of its diplomacy in elegant, consensus-focused and invisible ways.\"PA MediaKeir Starmer spoke in favour of greater integration between the UK and Europe on defenceIn these fast-moving, unpredictable times, Europe's leaders are increasingly turning to a la carte coalitions, alongside traditional organisations like Nato or the EU, which are larger and therefore often slower to react. These groupings also include non-European nations.Take, for example, the so-called Coalition of the Willing group of countries, led by the UK and France and formed to secure Ukrainian sovereignty in the case of an eventual peace deal with Russia. Turkey has attended coalition meetings, as have New Zealand and Australia.More from InDepthCanada is increasingly working alongside Nordic and Baltic nations that share geopolitical challenges and common values, they say, and want to promote stability and deterrence from the edges of the Baltic Sea, through the Nordic and Baltic states, through the North Atlantic, Greenland and across the Canadian arctic.One European policy-maker who asked not to be named joked to me that Canada was becoming \"more and more European by the day\". Japan and South Korea were increasingly seen as part of the \"like-minded family\" too, he said.Not just defenceThese ad hoc coalitions are not restricted to defence alone. France's President Macron has long called for Europe to increase what he calls its strategic autonomy, in traditional security terms but also energy security, supply chains and new technologies. In Munich he recommended Europe \"de-risk\" from all outside powers.This weekend even saw the president of the European Commission admitting that if the EU failed to move fast enough on improving competitiveness, \"a group of its member states would have to move forward alone\".Attempts by smaller pockets of European powers to work together to advance European strategic independence are by no means always successful. Take the current row between France and Germany over their joint attempt to come up with the next generation of fighter jet with the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).You could also say that for all the talk of building European independence, this weekend's conference was also a reminder of just how dependent Europe remains on US security support - from its nuclear umbrella to intelligence sharing and command and control structures. It was also a reminder of how far Europe trails the US in high tech innovation.But more than short-term mechanisms designed to 'survive' Donald Trump, the changes we are witnessing in Europe, including closer alliances outside the continent, are liable to be longer lasting. The world now seems to dance to the tune of big power politics. And even slow-moving Europe is having to adapt.Top picture credit: AFP / Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes was a potential medal hope in this event but she is not in the final after finishing 16th in qualification. Reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand topped qualification, ahead of the Netherlands' Melissa Peperkamp. The rest of the field were at least nine points behind the pair. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. That was the case in runs one and two too, with Lochner leading Friedrich by 0.80. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, are down in eighth, 0.40 off the medals. Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. He was fifth in qualification. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, and he qualified in third. USA's Mac Forehand and Austria's Matej Svancer were the top two in qualification. Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

All 29 passengers have been rescued, while one of the injured was sent to hospital, police said.Switzerland has experienced heavy rain and snow in recent days, and the country's Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research says the avalanche risk is very high across the alps.\"According to initial findings, an avalanche may have crossed the tracks shortly before the train passed,\" police stated, adding that the public prosecutor's office has opened an investigation.\"Five people were injured. One of them was taken to hospital,\" police added.The regional commuter train was on its way from Spiez to Brig when it derailed.Goppenstein, a key hub for road and rail transport, sits at the exit of the Lotschberg rail tunnel. The train derailed as it was exiting the tunnel, police said.The region is under its second highest avalanche warning - level four of five.Heavy snow also resulted in 50 people being evacuated from the village of Orsieres, near the French border.Skiers have been warned by authorities to stay on the marked slopes, and those walking in the mountains should also check avalanche bulletins before setting off.Last month, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing in the Swiss alps.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentandClaire KeenanEPALocal election administrators have warned that councils face \"an uphill struggle\" to be ready in time for the May local elections after the government reversed its plan to delay some votes. Local Government Secretary Steve Reed had initially approved delays in 30 council elections in England until 2027.But the government abandoned plans to postpone ballots after advice was given that the move could be unlawful. It followed a legal challenge brought by Reform UK.A group that represents electoral officials in the UK said the teams who help to run elections had lost months of preparation time and would struggle to be ready.The government argued that some councils were worried about the cost of running elections for authorities which are due to be abolished in a major reorganisation of local government.Local elections in Norfolk, Suffolk, Blackburn, Lincoln, Thurrock and two dozen more parts of England, will now take place on 7 May, and about £63 million will be made available to local authorities who are undergoing changes.Some organisers said they were still preparing anyway, aware there was a legal challenge to the government's decision to postpone votes in their areas, which was due to be heard in the High Court on Thursday.The Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA) said it was \"extremely disappointed\" that months of \"essential planning time\" had been lost. The AEA's deputy chief executive Laura Lock said returning officers, electoral registration officers, and electoral administration teams would be affected. \"These teams now face an uphill struggle to catch up to where they should be,\" she said.The AEA represents electoral officials in the UK, and provides training. Matthew Hicks, leader of Tory-run Suffolk County Council said: \"Local councils across the country are experiencing whiplash as major government decisions shift repeatedly and without warning.\"Hicks said the uncertainty impacted on the ability \"to plan effectively\" and \"deliver stability for residents\".Meanwhile, the leader of Labour-run Thurrock Council Lynn Worrall said it was \"disappointing that this decision has been reversed so late in the day\".The announcement made on Monday was welcomed by opposition parties, who had called the delays undemocratic.In celebration of his win Farage, writing on X, said: \"We took this Labour government to court and won.\"The government has agreed to pay Reform's legal costs relating to the proceedings, which a party source said would be at least £100,000.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party \"fought tooth and nail to stop this stitch-up and the government has been forced into a humiliating U-turn\".Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said it was \"predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoAna FaguyWatch: 'Integrity in sport is important' - Canadians react to Olympic curling cheating rowA scandal at the Winter Olympics has left the Canadian curling teams on the defensive and Canadians reeling over the crack in their country's polite persona.Over the weekend, Canadian curler Marc Kennedy had an expletive-filled outburst after Sweden accused him of cheating during a match, and later said his team might be the target of a \"premeditated\" attack by their rivals.Kennedy was accused of \"double-touching\" - touching the stone a second time after initially releasing it down the ice. The next day, Canadian women's captain Rachel Holman was accused of using the same move. Both have denied the accusations, but Canada's curling teams, who historically have dominated the sport, now face questions over their tactics. While the curlers have shown their anger over the situation during matches, fans of the sport and Canadians have questioned whether the team acted in the spirit of curling.\"It's a sad day for Canadian sport,\" Tim Gray, from Alberta, told the BBC. \"Integrity in the sport is important, even if you have to call it on yourself.\"An opinion piece in the Canadian news outlet, the Globe and Mail, pointed to some of the frustration: \"These Canadian curling teams are not fun bad guys. They come off like the sort of competitors who need so desperately to win that they will do anything – even things that are pointless – in order to get there.\"Cathal Kelly, the writer of the opinion piece, continued: \"There's an easy way out of this – stop struggling. Stop acting like our curling reputation matters more than our national one. Be the bigger man and woman, even if you don't think you did anything wrong.\"The controversy began on Friday when Swedish player Oskar Eriksson accused Kennedy of double-touching. As the game continued, Kennedy and Eriksson got into a verbal back-and-forth that included expletives. Their exchange quickly went viral as a video appearing to show Kennedy touching the stone on occasion.Kennedy got a verbal warning from World Curling for using foul language, but he was not formally charged with cheating by the governing body. The next day Kennedy said: \"I probably could have handled it better. But we're human out there and there's a lot of emotions. I'm not going to apologise for defending my teammates and standing up for myself.\" \"I've curled my whole life, never once with the intention of getting an advantage through cheating,\" he added. ReutersCanada's Marc Kennedy was accused of double-touching stones when he released themThen, Canadian curling had another instance of purported cheating. Match officials accused the Canadian women's team on Saturday of the same double-touch violation.  Rachel Homan who said there was a \"zero percent chance\" of the violation, as she and her teammates looked on frustratingly. The Canadians lost to the Swiss, 8-7.On Sunday, Great Britain's men's team was accused of the same violation. Both Homan and British men's curler Bobby Lammie had stones removed from play due to alleged violations.Homan later slammed the officials' decision to remove her stone during a defeat to Switzerland, saying it was \"insane\".All of the incidents led World Curling to clarify that double-tapping is not allowed.\"During forward motion, touching the granite of the stone is not allowed. This will result in the stone being removed from play,\" they said.World Curling does not use video to review play, but they did send two officials to monitor how players released their stones in subsequent games. \"Following a meeting with representatives of the competing National Olympic Committees, an update in the stone monitoring protocol has been confirmed, beginning with the evening session on Sunday 15 February,\" World Curling said in a statement.\"This change in protocol will see the two umpires who had previously been actively monitoring athlete deliveries remain available in the field of play, but will now only monitor athlete deliveries at the request of the competing teams.\"AFP via Getty ImagesCanada's Rachel Homan slammed the officials' decision to remove her stoneReaction to the controversy in Canada has been mixed.\"Do I think the finger affects the rock, no I do not,\" Ankara Leonard from the Royal Montreal Curling Club told the BBC. \"Do I think we have to play within the rules? Yes.\"While curling columnist and Olympian Tomi Rantamaki, in an article for The Curling News, warned that Canada's dominance in the world of curling means its players should be mindful of the influence they have.\"Young players in Finland, Korea, Italy, Sweden – everywhere – often copy what Canadian teams do. They copy the athlete's delivery, the sweeping, the tactics, the communication,\" Rantamaki wrote. \"And they copy the behaviour.\"",

    "body": "Teenagers guilty of killing man they lured to beach11 hours agoJoshua Askew,South EastandAdina Campbell,UK correspondentKent PoliceAll three teenagers denied the murder of Alexander Cashford, 49, in KentTwo teenagers have been found guilty of manslaughter after luring a man they thought was a paedophile to a beach where another teenager threw rocks at him.A 16-year-old girl and two boys, 15 and 16, all denied murdering Alexander Cashford in Leysdown-on-Sea, on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, on 10 August last year. The 16-year-old boy previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter.Woolwich Crown Court was told the teenagers believed Cashford, 49, was a paedophile after he met the girl by chance at an amusement arcade two days earlier and gave her his phone number.Using the alias Sienna, the three teenagers had messaged Cashford and arranged to meet him by the sea wall.Danny Robinson KC, defending the girl, told the court the texts started as a \"big laugh\" but might have become a wish to name and shame Cashford.\"It was a childish escapade that got out of hand very quickly with tragic consequences,\" he said.Footage shows the moment Alexander Cashford was attacked on the beachProsecutors said Cashford was chased and hit with rocks and a bottle before he was found lying face down in the mud.A post-mortem examination showed injuries to his face and head, bruises on his limbs and body, alongside a number of fractured ribs that had punctured his lung.The 16-year-old boy had earlier told the court how he and the others had discussed giving Cashford a \"slap\" before the attack.He claimed he attacked Cashford because he thought police \"wouldn't have done anything\" if they had reported the man for trying to meet up with the girl.'Relentlessly pursued'The girl filmed the boys chasing Cashford as she shouted \"get him\", the court heard.After he was arrested, the 16-year-old boy shared footage of the attack with three people. \"This was a carefully pre-planned deliberate and violent attack on someone who was not expecting it and who could not defend himself,\" said Natalie Smith, senior crown prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service. \"Despite his best attempts to flee, he was relentlessly pursued and attacked, even when witnesses reported he was lying on the ground.\"The three teenagers – who cannot be named for legal reasons – were acquitted of murder on Monday.They are expected to be sentenced for manslaughter in April.\"These verdicts will change their lives forever,\" said the judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoHarry SekulichAFP via Getty ImagesA memorial was laid out for Alex Pretti a day after he was shot deadOfficials in the US state of Minnesota say the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has refused to co-operate with its investigation into the death of Alex Pretti.Federal agents shot dead the 37-year-old intensive care nurse during a protest against immigration enforcement in the city of Minneapolis on 24 January.Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) has accused the FBI of failing to hand over any information and evidence from its investigation into the shooting.BCA Supt Drew Evans called the FBI's actions \"concerning and unprecedented\". The FBI has not yet responded.Minnesota's BCA said it would \"welcome a joint investigation\" with federal officials. \"The BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,\" it said in a statement.Pretti's family has also pushed for a joint investigation, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.\"Justice and accountability requires a thorough and impartial investigation to establish the facts. A truly joint state and federal investigation would be a welcome development,\" Pretti's family said in a statement.\"It remains unclear if there will be any co-operation or sharing of information related to those two shootings,\" the BCA said.State and federal officials sparred over the course of Operation Metro Surge, an immigration crackdown launched by the Trump administration.It prompted a wave of national protests opposing US President Donald Trump's migration policy and the tactics of ICE.More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to Homan, including men he said were convicted of rape and other sexual offences.Minnesota's Democrat Governor Tim Walz said the operation left the state with \"deep damage, generational trauma... and many unanswered questions\".",

He said it was \"a very hard blow\" for the region and for tourism.\"Nature as it created the bow, has taken it back\", he added.Passers-by first noticed the absence of the natural landmark on Sunday morning.Officials have suggested severe weather brought by a storm named Oriana - which has battered southern Italy in recent days - accelerated the rock's erosion, causing its collapse.\"We have lost one of our region's defining characteristics, a symbolic asset,\" Puglia's regional president Antonio Decaro told reporters at the site on Monday.\"Unfortunately, natural processes are often accelerated by meteorological phenomena, such as the tail end of storm Oriana\", he said.Decaro said authorities needed to concentrate on attempting to slow coastal erosion and preserving the coast.The Salento region, where the arch was located, is one of Italy's most popular tourist areas.",

    "body": "Ancient bone may prove legendary war elephant crossing of Alps12 hours agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterGetty ImagesHannibal's invasion of Europe has acquired almost mythical statusAn elephant foot bone found by archaeologists digging in southern Spain may be evidence that a troop of war elephants stomped through ancient Europe.It would be the first concrete proof of the legendary Carthaginian General Hannibal's troop of battle elephants, according to academics.Drawings of Hannibal's war against the Romans had long suggested that the beasts were used in fighting, but no hard evidence backed up the theories.Now the creatures' skeletal remains appear to have been found in an Iron Age dig near Cordoba.\"Beyond ivory, the discovery of elephant remains in European archaeological contexts is exceptionally rare,\" says the team of scientists in a paper published in Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.Often considered one of the most successful commanders of classical times, Hannibal led his army from the powerful imperial city Carthage, in modern day Tunisia, into Europe as he battled to control the Mediterranean.It is thought he took soldiers and animals from Carthage through Spain and France to invade Italy, crossing the Alps with 37 elephants in 218 BCE during the second of the so-called Punic Wars.The remains found in Spain are presumed to be from an animal that died before reaching the Alps.The archaeologists, led by Professor Rafael M. Martínez Sánchez, found the elephant's bone beneath a collapsed wall on a site called Colina de los Quemados. Martínez Sánchez et alThe top row is the Iron Age elephant bone found in SpainThey used carbon dating techniques to estimate the age of the 10cm cube-shaped bone. The result led them to believe it is from the Second Punic War.They also compared the bone of modern elephants and steppe mammoths to determine which animal it came from.The team found artillery, coins and ceramics during the excavations in 2020, providing more clues that the place was the site of a battle.\"As non-native species and the largest living terrestrial animals, these imported beasts would have required transportation by ship,\" the academics said.They say that it is very unlikely that dead animals were transported, and the bones are unattractive suggesting they were not decorative or used in craft.But the scientists say it will be very challenging to work out which species of elephant the creature was.\"While [the bone] would not represent one of the mythical specimens Hannibal took across the Alps, it could potentially embody the first known relic − so sought after by European scholars of the Modern Age − of the animals used in the Punic Roman wars for the control of the Mediterranean,\" the scientists conclude in their paper.",

    "body": "5 hours agoEmma Saunders,Culture reporterandOlivia IrelandWatch: Robert Duvall honoured in Hollywood 'hand and footprint ceremony' in 2011Actor Robert Duvall, who appeared in The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, has died at the age of 95.The Oscar winner for Tender Mercies died \"peacefully\" at his home in Middleburg, Virginia, on Sunday, according to a statement sent by his PR agency on behalf of his wife, Luciana.\"To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything,\" she said. \"His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court.\"Godfather star Al Pacino paid tribute, saying it was an \"honour\" to work with Duvall. He added: \"He was a born actor as they say, his connection with it, his understanding and his phenomenal gift will always be remembered. \"I will miss him.\"Duvall was known for numerous tough-guy roles over an impressive six-decade career, such as the mafia consigliere in Francis Ford Coppola‘s The Godfather and The Godfather Part II. He also played a forceful army officer in Coppola’s Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now.He only had a few minutes of screen time but his famous line in the 1979 classic, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\", became legendary.Coppola called his loss \"a blow\".\"Such a great actor and such an essential part of American Zoetrope from its beginning,\" Coppola said in a statement on Instagram, referring to his production company.His Apocalypse Now character was originally meant to be even more over the top but Duvall toned it down and the name was changed from Captain Carnage to Lieutenant Colonel William Kilgore.\"I did my homework,\" Duvall told veteran talk show host Larry King in 2015. \"I did my research.”Getty ImagesTributes began to pour in for Duvall after news broke of his death. American comedian and actor Adam Sandler posted photographs of the two from their time together shooting the 2022 film Hustle.\"Funny as hell. Strong as hell. One of the greatest actors we ever had. Such a great man to talk to and laugh with ... sending his wife Luciana and all his family and friends our condolences.\"Oscar winner Jamie Lee-Curtis also posted a tribute on Instagram with a picture of Duvall as Tom Hagen in The Godfather. \"The greatest consigliere the screen has ever seen. Bravo, Robert Duvall.\" Co-star, Robert Patrick, who played the son of Duvall's character in the 2013 film Jayne Mansfield's Car said he was \"gutted\". \"Over the years I would call Bobby and we'd talk movies and barbecue. He loved barbecue and I'd always let him know when I was having it in Lockhart, Texas.\"\"I will miss Bobby. I will always be proud that I got to play his son. Rest in peace my friend.\" The statement from Duvall's wife continued: \"For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all.\"Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.\"Getty ImagesDuvall (left) appeared opposite Marlon Brando in The GodfatherCBS via Getty ImagesDuvall as Lt Col Kilgore in Apocalypse NowNominated for seven Oscars, Duvall won best actor in 1983 for playing a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies.His other roles included a bullying corporate executive in 1976's Network, and a Marine officer in 1979's The Great Santini, as well as parts in 1990's The Handmaid's Tale and 2014's The Judge alongside Robert Downey Jr.Duvall often said his favourite role was as the Texas Ranger-turned-cowboy Augustus McCrae in Lonesome Dove in the 1989 TV mini-series, based on the novel by Larry McMurtry.He made his screen debut in the 1963 film adaptation of Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, playing the reclusive Boo Radley.\"When he did To Kill A Mockingbird he just destroyed you with his performance of Boo Radley, he used not a single word of dialogue, not a single word, and he just shatters you,\" US actor Alec Baldwin said in a short video tribute to Duvall.The screenplay was written by Horton Foote, who also wrote several other films Duvall starred in, including Tender Mercies, Tomorrow and The Chase.In 1997’s The Apostle, which he wrote and directed, Duvall played an evangelical preacher who begins a new life in Louisiana after committing a crime.British actress Jane Seymour, who worked with Duvall on the 1995 film The Stars Fell on Henrietta, shared a heartfelt tribute on Instagram.\"We were able to share in his love of barbecue and even a little tango,\" Seymour wrote alongside a photo of herself with Duvall. \"Those moments off camera were just as memorable as the work itself.\"",

    "body": "Six of Sarah Ferguson's companies winding down10 hours agoLucy HookerBusiness reporterGetty ImagesSix companies linked to the former Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, are being wound down, documents filed with Companies House show.Ferguson is the director of all six businesses that are due to be struck off the register in ten days - unless legal cause is shown to prevent it.It is unclear what the firms' activities were, although one is related to public relations and another to retail. None appear to be very commercially active.Their closure comes in the wake of further revelations from the Epstein files which suggest the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor told the wealthy paedophile how desperate she felt over her financial difficulties.Email exchanges between Ferguson and Epstein indicate she asked for his financial advice over how to deal with her £6m debt pile while he was still in jail for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.A spokesperson for the former Duchess of York has been approached for comment.The companies that are set to close are S Phoenix Events, Fergie's Farm, La Luna Investments, Solamoon Ltd, Philanthrapreneur Ltd and Planet Partners Productions Ltd, none of which have any public profile.Listings for five of the six companies state there is an \"application to strike the company off the register\". That means the company will stop trading and will cease to exist.The sixth, S Pheonix Events, which also notes the receipt of an application to strike off, lists Sarah Ferguson as the person authenticating the application on behalf of the company.Ferguson is listed as an active director for three other businesses registered with Companies House: Ginger and Moss, set up as a lifestyle brand to sell tea, jewellery and housewares, a \"motion picture production activities\" business called Coat, and Librasol, classified under \"artistic creation\" on the official register for private companies.All the companies being dissolved were set up more than a decade ago. Most are classed as \"dormant companies\", with very little or no reported recent commercial activity.Ferguson is the sole remaining director for all of them.Late last year, documents show she submitted an official change to her details for all the firms from Sarah Duchess of York to Sarah Margaret Ferguson.There have been reports of Ferguson's financial difficulties for many years, but the publication of the files of Jeffrey Epstein's correspondence has laid bare how much pressure she was under.One of the files suggests she told Epstein she was about to \"freak with exhaustion\" at a time when he was still in custody in Florida and that she also leaned on him for emotional support.",

    "body": "11 hours agoCBS via Getty ImagesDuvall played mafia consigliere Tom Hagen in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II Robert Duvall was a distinguished and prolific screen actor who lent a brooding intensity and grizzled authority to seven decades of American film-making.Nominated for Academy Awards on seven occasions, he won best actor for his role as a troubled country singer in 1983's Tender Mercies.His many other roles included a mafia consigliere in The Godfather, a bombastic army officer in Apocalypse Now, and a Texas Ranger-turned-cattle driver in Lonesome Dove.More character actor than leading man, he could be relied upon to inject a feisty, fiery machismo and a cantankerous contrariness into the most mainstream Hollywood offering.Born Robert Selden Duvall in January 1931 in San Diego, California, Duvall was a self-proclaimed \"navy brat\" due to his father's life-long career in the United States Navy.His father expected him to follow him into the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Yet his son instead served two years in the army following his 1953 college graduation.Getty ImagesDuvall and Dustin Hoffman, pictured in 2014, studied acting together in the 1950sDuvall subsequently moved to New York to study acting, working as a postal clerk to make ends meet. His classmates included Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman, who both became lifelong friends.\"A friend is someone who many years ago offered you his last $300 when you broke your pelvis,\" he would later recall. \"A friend is Gene Hackman.\"Duvall began acting professionally at the Gateway Playhouse, a summer theatre in Long Island, where he starred in plays by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and others.His performance in Horton Foote's one-act play The Midnight Caller led the playwright to recommend him for the role of Boo Radley in the 1962 film version of To Kill a Mockingbird.By that time, Duvall had already appeared on television in such shows as Naked City, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Armstrong Circle Theatre.To Kill a Mockingbird, which Foote adapted from Harper Lee's novel, was the actor's first film role and led to appearances in such films as The Chase, Bullitt and True Grit.Getty ImagesDuvall played the reclusive Boo Radley in To Kill a MockingbirdThe Rain People, released in 1969, marked his first collaboration with director Francis Ford Coppola, with whom he would go on to work in the first two Godfather films.Other significant roles around this time included the highly strung Major Burns in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H and THX 1138, the eponymous protagonist of George Lucas's dystopian 1971 sci-fi debut.Duvall's performance as The Godfather's Tom Hagen, the shrewd chief advisor to Marlon Brando's ageing Don Vito Corleone, earned him his first Academy Award nomination in 1973.He reprised the role in 1974's The Godfather Part II, by which time he had collaborated with Foote again in the 1972 film of his play Tomorrow. Network, from 1976, cast him as a venal television producer.Meanwhile, there were appearances with Michael Caine in The Eagle Has Landed, Laurence Olivier in The Betsy, and Muhammad Ali in the boxer's biopic The Greatest.Getty ImagesRobert Duvall (centre) on the Apocalypse Now setIn 1979, Duvall gave perhaps his most memorable performance as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore in Coppola's Vietnam war epic Apocalypse Now.\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" his character famously declared after leading a deadly helicopter attack on a Vietnamese village.The actor was shown to no less domineering effect in The Great Santini, playing a frustrated Marine pilot who hectors and browbeats his teenage children.The scene in which he torments his son by bouncing a basketball against his head was spoofed by Mike Myers' Dr Evil in the second Austin Powers film.Duvall's work in Apocalypse Now and The Great Santini saw him nominated for Oscars in consecutive years. The former also earned him a Bafta and the first of four Golden Globe awards.Yet it was his role as alcoholic singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies that finally saw him land an Oscar, beating an all-British line-up of fellow nominees that included Caine and Albert Finney.Watch: Robert Duvall honoured in Hollywood 'hand and footprint ceremony' in 2011Duvall's other Oscar nominations came for his performances in 1997's The Apostle, 1998 legal drama A Civil Action and 2014's The Judge.In The Apostle, which he also wrote and directed, the actor played an evangelical preacher who begins a new life in Louisiana after committing a crime.In real life, Duvall attended church regularly during his childhood but was reluctant to discuss his faith, merely disclosing he had \"always been a believer\".The staunch Republican was less reticent about his political persuasions and was a guest at President George W Bush's inauguration in 2001.Duvall's other many screen roles included an LA police office in Colors, an astronaut in Deep Impact, and a Nascar crew chief in Days of Thunder alongside Tom Cruise.He was reunited with Cruise in 2012's Jack Reacher, in which Duvall played a former soldier turned gun shop owner.Yet Duvall often looked happiest when riding a horse, be it in the acclaimed TV mini-series Lonesome Dove or in the Kevin Costner Western Open Range.\"I think the Western kind of defines us,\" the actor said in 2016. \"The English have Shakespeare; the French, Moliere; the Russians have Chekhov. But the Western is ours.\"Getty ImagesDuvall was named best actor at the 1984 Academy AwardsHis other passions included football, the tango and the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, a city he professed to love \"more than any place else\".\"A young actor once asked me 'What do you do between jobs?'\" he once recalled. \"I said, 'Hobbies, hobbies and more hobbies'. It keeps you off dope.\"Duvall was married and divorced three times and is survived by his fourth wife, the Argentine actress Luciana Pedraza. He did not father any children, commenting in 2003 that it had \"never worked out\".",

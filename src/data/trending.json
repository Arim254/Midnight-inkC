    "body": "12 hours agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentBBCListen to this article Critics call it \"carspreading\". In the UK and across Europe, cars are steadily becoming longer, wider and heavier. Consumers clearly like them – a lot. Big cars are seen as practical, safe and stylish, and sales are growing. So, why are some cities determined to clamp down on them - and are they right to do so?Paris is renowned for many things. Its monuments, such as the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe. Its broad, leafy avenues and boulevards, its museums and art galleries, its fine cuisine. And its truly appalling traffic.Over the past 20 years, the city authorities have been trying to tackle the problem, by introducing low-traffic and low-emission zones, by promoting public transport and cycling – and most recently by clamping down on big cars.In October 2024 on-street parking charges for visiting \"heavy\" vehicles were trebled following a public vote, taking them from €6 to €18 for a one-hour stay in the centre, and from €75 to €225 for six hours.\"The larger it is, the more it pollutes,\" said the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, before the vote. The new restrictions, she claimed, would \"accelerate the environmental transition, in which we are tackling air pollution\".A few months later, the town hall claimed the number of very heavy cars parking on the city streets had fallen by two-thirds.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesParis is renowned for many things - including bad traffic in certain areasCities elsewhere are taking note, including in the UK. Cardiff council has already decided to increase the cost of parking permits for cars weighing more than 2,400kg - the equivalent of roughly two Ford Fiestas.The Labour-controlled authority said, \"These heavier vehicles typically produce more emissions, cause greater wear and tear on roads, and critically pose a significantly higher risk in the event of a road traffic collision.\"To begin with, the higher charges will only apply to a small minority of vehicle models, but Cardiff plans to lower the weight threshold over time. Other local authorities are mulling similar steps.AFP via Getty Images'The larger it is, the more it pollutes,' argued Paris mayor, Anne HidalgoBut many owners say they are reliant on big cars.Matt Mansell, a father of three based in Guildford, runs a technology company, as well as a property development business, and says he needs his Land Rover Defender 110 for ferrying around clients and children.\"I need to have enough space to put children in, with all of their kit - also, you can fit a door or a three-metre length of pipe in it,\" he says.\"It's very much a utility vehicle, but it's presentable.\"'Chelsea tractors': Rise of the SUVThere is no question cars in the UK and Europe have been getting bigger over the years. Since 2018, the average width of new models on sale here has risen from 182cm to 187.5cm, according to data from Thatcham Research – an organisation that evaluates new cars on behalf of the insurance industry.The average weight, meanwhile, has increased from 1,365kg to 1,592kg over the same period.This is not just a recent phenomenon. Data compiled by the International Council for Clean Transportation shows the average width of cars on European markets grew by nearly 10cm between 2001 and 2020. Length increased by more than 19cm.Some critics argue this is a worrying trend, because there simply isn't enough room on Britain's crowded, often narrow roads or in town centres.Getty ImagesAre cars getting bigger, or are roads getting narrower?The standard minimum width of an on-street parking space is 1.8m in many places. But figures published by T&E, a green transport campaign group, suggest that by the first half of 2023, more than half of the 100 top-selling cars in the UK were fractionally wider than this.Then there is the rocketing popularity of Sports Utility Vehicles, or SUVs, cars that are at least loosely based on off-road vehicles, although in many cases the resemblance is cosmetic, and they lack genuine off-road features such as four-wheel drive. The vast majority will never stray far from the tarmac, hence their rather derisory nickname: Chelsea tractors.There are plenty of different designs out there, including utility models that you can actually use off road, swanky status symbols and legions of suburban family wagons.What they all they have in common, however, is size. Even the smaller \"crossover\" versions, more closely related to conventional cars, tend to be taller and wider than traditional saloons, hatchbacks or estates.Back in 2011, SUVs made up 13.2% of the market across 27 European countries, according to the automotive research company Dataforce GmbH. By 2025, their market share had grown to 59%.Rachel Burgess, editor of Autocar magazine, believes it is their size that makes them so popular. \"Everyone I've spoken to over the years who has bought an SUV says they like being higher up, they like better visibility, and they feel safer on motorways and bigger roads.\"It's often better for people with kids to get them in and out of the car with that extra height; and also, for people who are less mobile, it's much easier to get in and out of an SUV than a lower hatchback or saloon.\"Lucia Barbato: 'On a Monday morning with three boys, three school bags, three sports kits, and a trumpet thrown in the boot, there isn't even room in the car for the dog!'Lucia Barbato, from West Sussex, says her second-hand Lexus RX450 SUV - a hybrid model - is vital for transporting her large family in an area with limited public transport. She runs a marketing agency from home and drives her three sons to the bus stop each day, so they can go to school.\"On a Monday morning with three boys, three school bags, three sports kits, and a trumpet thrown in the boot there isn't even room in the car for the dog!\"Bigger cars, bigger profit margins?The popularity of SUVs doesn't just apply to mass-market carmakers. Porsche is famous for its sleek sports cars but the Cayenne SUV and the Macan crossover are its bestselling models. Bentley's Bentayga SUV accounted for 44% of its sales last year, while Lamborghini is increasingly reliant on its four-wheel drive Urus.Put bluntly, consumers clearly love SUVs. Carmakers, meanwhile, are only too happy to meet that demand, because building bigger cars can be more profitable, argues David Leggett, editor of industry intelligence website Just Auto.Getty Images and Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPorsche is famous for its sports cars but the Cayenne and the Macan crossover are its bestselling models\"Profit margins are generally much higher on larger cars with higher price points. This is largely due to the laws of economics in manufacturing.\"There are, he points out, fundamental costs involved in building any car - for example operating a factory, design work, and the price of the main components. But he explains that with small cars, these costs can make up a higher proportion of the selling price.Daniele Ministeri, senior consultant at JATO Dynamics, points out that many SUVs are closely related to conventional cars, and use the same basic structures.\"For some models, the main differences are limited to factors such as body style, suspension and seating position, allowing them to command an SUV premium price, without comparable cost increases\", he says.The safety debateEven conventional cars have been getting bigger in some cases.Take the current VW Golf hatchback, which is 18cm wider and 26cm longer than the original version introduced in the 1970s. It is also several hundred kilograms heavier.\"If we look back to the early 2000s… safety programmes like Euro NCAP were just starting to deliver the safety message to consumers, smaller vehicles weren't really able to absorb the energy of a crash very well at all,\" says Alex Thompson, principal safety engineer at Thatcham Research.\"As safety measures have improved, a certain amount of weight had to be added on to vehicles to strengthen up safety compartments because they weren't that strong back then.\"\"Manufacturers have had to do things like improve structural crash protection, and fit more airbags,\" agrees David Leggett. \"At the same time, they want to improve interior cabin space and put more features into vehicles, so the net result is rising pressure for bigger vehicle dimensions.\"More from InDepthYet while bigger cars may be safer for their occupants, critics insist they are considerably less safe for other road users.\"Whether you're in another car [or] a pedestrian, you're more likely to be seriously injured if there's a collision with one of these vehicles,\" argues Tim Dexter, vehicles policy manager at T&E. He is also concerned about the implications for cyclists.Research carried out in 2023 by Belgium's Vias Institute, which aims to improve road safety, suggested that a 10cm increase in the height of a car bonnet could increase the risk of vulnerable road users being killed in a collision by 27%. T&E also highlights concerns that high bonnets can create blind spots.Alex Thompson says that taller, higher cars are more likely to harm pedestrians and cyclists, although he emphasises that vehicle design in recent years has \"really prioritised\" protecting vulnerable road users. Some manufacturers have, for example, fitted external airbags to their vehicles.In Pictures via Getty Images ImagesDavid Leggett believes people could potentially be encouraged to buy smaller vehiclesAs for the environmental impact, the International Energy Agency has said: \"Despite advances in fuel efficiency and electrification, the trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs, which emit roughly 20% more emissions than an average medium-sized car, has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet in recent decades.\"The move towards electric vehicles should at least mitigate emissions from daily use significantly over time, although if the electricity they use is generated from fossil sources such as gas, bigger cars may well still pollute more per vehicle than smaller ones. And other concerns about size and weight will still apply – in fact, with electric cars generally weighing considerably more than their petrol or diesel equivalents, certain problems could be magnified.The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says that 40% of SUVs are now zero-emission. Its chief executive, Mike Hawes, has previously said that overall the carbon dioxide emissions of new SUVs have more than halved since 2000, \"helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility\".Penalties, taxes and the France modelBut if there is to be a clampdown, one option is what has already been done across the Channel.France already imposes extra registration taxes on cars that weigh in at more than 1,600kg. Currently, this means a €10 (£9) penalty for every extra kilogramme. The penalty increases in bands, reaching €30 per kg above 2,100kg.While it only applies to a relatively small proportion of current models – and electric vehicles are excluded – it can add up to €70,000 to the cost of buying a new car.T&E argues that a similar levy should be introduced in the UK. According to Tim Dexter, \"At the moment the UK is a tax haven for these large vehicles… We know the impact they are having on the road, on communities, potentially on individuals. It's only fair they should be paying a bit more.\"David Leggett believes people could potentially be encouraged to buy smaller vehicles, particularly for use in cities. \"There are opportunities to tweak tax regimes to make smaller cars relatively attractive,\" he says.But ensuring there are enough runabouts to go around may be tricky. \"There will always be a market for highly manoeuvrable and low-cost city cars in urban areas, but making them profitably is a huge challenge,\" Mr Leggett says.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSeveral relatively low-priced small EVs have recently come on to the market, including BYD's Dolphin SurfHowever, several relatively low-priced small EVs have recently come on to the market, including BYD's Dolphin Surf, Leapmotor International's T03, Hyundai's Inster and the new Renault 5. They will be joined before long by Kia's EV2, and VW's ID Polo.For the moment though, SUVs remain firmly in charge.\"Clearly, people want SUVs, and I'm not sure what the answer to that is,\" says Rachel Burgess. \"But small cars are coming back, as the industry has understood how to make money from small cars in an electric world...\"I do believe everything is cyclical and trends come and go in every part of life, including cars. SUVs won't be around forever.\"Top picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Racism, rape and death threats: One weekend of social media abuse in footballImage source, BBC SportImage caption, Managers are being targeted by abuse more often than players in the Premier League and Women's Super LeagueByNatalie Pirks, Melissa Sharman, Sarah Dawkins and Daniel AustinBBC Sport Warning: This article contains screenshots of and references to offensive language.More than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend, a BBC investigation has found.The analysis - conducted with data science company Signify - focused on posts made during 10 Premier League and six WSL matches on the weekend of 8 and 9 November, and also found messages including racist slurs, homophobia and threats of violence.Managers were targeted more than players, with 82% of abusive posts made on X, formerly known as Twitter.Premier League bosses Ruben Amorim, Arne Slot and Eddie Howe were the most common targets of abuse in the men's top flight, while Chelsea and their manager Sonia Bompastor faced 50% of all abuse in the WSL.A total of 61% of all abusive messages were sent from accounts in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and the data suggests the overall number is on the rise.Media caption, 'It's not acceptable' - Bompastor on online abuse'People have sense of impunity online'\"Abuse is never a good thing, whether it's about me or other managers,\" Liverpool head coach Slot said.\"We expect to be criticised. That is completely normal. I do not have social media so I don't see it, but I'm not stupid, I know it's there.\"Signify operates an artificial intelligence system called Threat Matrix, which scans posts made on social media for abuse. During the weekend of matches selected for the study, it analysed more than 500,000 posts on X, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, and identified 22,389 potentially abusive messages.But those flags can sometimes include examples which aren't abusive. For example, references to Newcastle defender Dan Burn can be flagged as a threat because of his surname.Therefore, a two-stage analysis by humans is conducted, which found that 2,015 of the posts met the threshold for verified extreme abuse - such as threats to life or hate speech - and broke the rules of the platforms they were posted on.What type of messages are being posted?Below we have included screenshots of some of the posts containing offensive language that were found as part of the investigation.We weighed up carefully whether to include them. In the end, we decided that it was important for you to have the option of seeing what was being posted to help our audiences better understand this story.You can view them on the picture gallery below.Image gallerySkip image galleryImage caption, Select to view screenshots of some of the abuse. Warning: contains offensive languageSlide 1 of 8, BBC Sport gallery of screenshots from our investigation, Select to view screenshots of some of the abuse. Warning: contains offensive languageThirty-nine posts - including monkey emojis on black players' accounts and rape threats - were deemed serious enough to warrant further investigation, which in some cases involves reporting to football clubs for potential identification of fans, and possible referral to law enforcement.One post was reported to police, who decided it did not meet their threshold for further action.Only one of the posts flagged to Meta, which owns and operates Facebook and Instagram, was removed. The others remain under investigation.Some of the 37 posts that were flagged to X were removed, while the others had their reach suppressed but were left online.\"If this happened on the street, this would have criminal consequences, potential financially damaging consequences,\" said Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Maheta Molango.\"So why is it that online people have got this sense of impunity? We need to put an end to this.\"Some in the game are resigned to the inevitability of abuse.\"It comes with the territory now,\" Newcastle manager Howe said.\"My advice is always to try and shelter yourself from it and become psychologically strong enough to not need to read it. But, invariably, people will show it to you even if you don't want to see it.\"Meta has implemented systems for helping block and filter abuse, while X has introduced a tool which displays the country or continent in which an account is based.The BBC contacted both X and Meta with questions about abuse on their platforms. Neither provided a comment.'Really horrible, violent content'In an office in central London, Signify's small team quietly sifts through thousands of posts.With every contentious moment during a game, the number of abusive messages rises.Up pop posts containing monkey emoijs and racist slurs, threats of rape to the family members of managers, and even death threats, sparked purely by actions on a football pitch.Every message the AI system deems abusive is checked twice by humans, who only count the messages which break social media platforms' own guidelines as verified abuse.The most significant surge in abusive posts occurred during Tottenham's dramatic 2-2 draw with Manchester United on 8 November, a match that featured two stoppage-time goals, after which both clubs' managers and several players faced concentrated abuse.In messages seen by the BBC, death threats were sent about Amorim, including one saying 'Kill Amorim - someone get that dirty Portuguese'.The Online Safety Act, which came into force in October 2023, puts a statutory duty of care on social media platforms.That means they are legally obliged to proactively identify and remove illegal content such as threats, harassment or hate speech. Ofcom is now the independent regulator responsible for making sure platforms comply.But the social platforms argue that the right to free speech makes them reluctant to censor or remove content. Signify insists that the problem of serious abuse and threats sent online is worsening.\"We've seen around a 25% year-on-year increase in the levels of abuse we're detecting,\" said its chief executive Jonathan Hirshler.\"We understand the platforms' position on free speech but some of the stuff we're talking about is so egregious.\"Really nasty death threats and really horrible, violent content. If the people who are the free speech absolutists out there read some of those messages, they wouldn't question why some of these are being reported and why action needs to be taken.\"Media caption, '25% year-on-year increase' - Can football clubs stop online abuse?Threats and homophobia in WSLControversy during Chelsea's 1-1 draw at Arsenal on 8 November sparked the vast majority of the 97 verified abusive messages posted about WSL matches.More than half targeted Chelsea boss Bompastor, including a threat of violence and a homophobic slur.\"People think they can say anything they want from behind a screen,\" Bompastor said. \"It's scary - I want to raise my voice against that.\"I have a family, including kids. They don't want to see those comments online. They are so young, and people need to realise the effect it can have on them too.\"Threats are a big problem, because the security in the women's game isn't the same as the men's game.\"Abuse can cause real mental problems for players. It can go really far.\"Ex-Chelsea and current England defender Jess Carter was the subject of prominent racist abuse online during Euro 2025, and Bompastor believes the platforms themselves bear plenty of blame.\"The social media companies are not doing their job, not taking the responsibility or accountability,\" Bompastor said.\"If we have to wait for them to act, I think we will be in this situation for too long.\"I'm hoping now that all clubs in the women's and men's games are proactive and protect people as much as possible.\"How are clubs combatting abuse?As frustration with social media companies grows, more clubs are taking matters into their own hands. Arsenal have worked with Signify for the past three years and have seen a 90% drop in the number of affiliated fans sending abuse to their own players, coach and owners. Signify attributes this to the fact that Arsenal have been actively taking action, including implementing education programmes and banning fans from the Emirates who have been identified as senders of abuse.Chelsea women are now also working with the same company.Tottenham, meanwhile, are conducting investigations into season-ticket holders alleged to have posted abusive content.Premier League director of content protection Tim Cooper said: \"We're constantly monitoring around matches where the abuse can happen and looking for trigger instances such as a goal being scored, missed penalties, or even things like yellow and red cards.\"The platforms can do more by changing their algorithms. That would be a step in the right direction.\"The League has a dedicated team that works hard to identify, compile evidence against, and help prosecute perpetrators of such abuse, with more than 4,000 cases of online discriminatory abuse investigated since 2020.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.",

Citing the “fog of war” in a chaotic situation, Hegseth said he “did not personally see survivors” after a deadly strike on an alleged drug boat in the Carribean, amid concerns that US forces may have violated laws governing armed conflict.  \nSarah, Anthony and Justin unpack Hegseth’s explanation, and where it leaves Trump’s ongoing dispute with the Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro.  \nWe also hear Trump’s tirade against Somalian immigrants and why he doesn’t want them in the United States, telling reporters they are “garbage” who should go back to where they came from and that “their country is no good for a reason”. Americast looks at the reasons behind Trump's outburst, and how immigration authorities will now be targeting Minnesota’s large Somali community.  \nAnd - did Trump fall asleep during Tuesday's cabinet meeting? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

Officer Martin said the animal had fallen through one of the ceiling tiles before going \"on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything\". Only one blurry CCTV image of the boozy break-in exists, so it's unknown just how much alcohol the thirsty creature consumed before passing out in the bathroom.In a social media post, the store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter for its professionalism and providing its visitor with a \"sober ride home\".Officer Martin said it was \"just another day in the life of an animal control officer\".

    "body": "4 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondentMetropolitan PoliceVincent Chan first came to attention for filming the children in his careA nursery worker has admitted sexually abusing young children in his care in north London.Vincent Chan, 45, appeared at Wood Green Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to 26 charges including sexual assault by penetration, sexual assault by touching and making indecent images depicting the most severe category of child sex abuse.The investigation into Chan followed a tip-off from a whistleblower and became one of the most \"harrowing and complex\" cases undertaken by the Metropolitan Police, the force said.Chan, of Stanhope Avenue in Finchley, will be sentenced on 23 January.Warning: This article contains distressing detailsJudge David Aaronberg KC told the defendant: \"Mr Chan, you have pleaded guilty to matters which are going to result in a custodial sentence of many years.\"Chan first came to attention for filming children at Bright Horizons nursery,  Finchley Road, West Hampstead. The nursery branch has since closed.When police started to investigate, they found what detectives called \"deeply disturbing material\" on Chan's devices and iPads seized from the nursery.They later found the video evidence of sexual abuse of children at the nursery, some of which had been filmed on nursery iPads.Julia QuenzlerChan was warned by the judge to expect a custodial sentence \"of many years\"Det Supt Lewis Basford, who led the Met Police's investigation, said the offences had caused \"deep shock and distress\".Chan had been advance vetted by the Disclosure and Barring Service, having previously worked as a karate club instructor and in a school.Chan, who was born and raised in the UK and is of Chinese heritage, took on a number of roles at the nursery including art specialist, room leader and nursery nurse. He was entrusted with the care of children aged between two and four.Moment Vincent Chan arrested by Met Police officersFamily members of many of the victims sat in the dock as charges were read out, many of them in tears.Following Chan's guilty pleas, the victims' parents made a joint statement through their solicitor.\"As parents we are still trying to process the sickening discovery that our children were subjected to despicable abuse... We feel that Bright Horizons has failed us, and we want answers.\"How was someone like Vincent Chan employed? And how were such horrific crimes against children able to continue for so long without the staff responsible for safeguarding at Bright Horizons nursery acting?\"We are concerned that failures in management and supervision at Bright Horizons allowed this abuse to go undetected, and we are committed to securing accountability for our children.\"Bright Horizons said it was \"shocked and appalled\" by Chan's crimes, adding that its \"thoughts are first and foremost with the children and families affected\".A spokesperson for the chain said: \"Whilst this individual's actions came to light after a colleague raised concerns and followed our whistleblowing procedures to report him, we fully accept that the evidence shows the individual was able to commit these crimes despite our safeguarding measures.\"In light of this, we have commissioned an external expert in this field to undertake a full review of our safeguarding practices.\"Watch: Victims' parents want answers from nursery, says solicitorHelen Reddy, prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said Chan's actions were \"a heinous breach of trust\" by someone working in a caring profession in what should have been a safe place for children.She added: \"The evidence against him was compelling and the nature and number of offences the CPS charged him with reflects the seriousness of his offending.\"If you have been affected by this story or would like support then you can find organisations which offer help and information at the BBC Action Line Related internet links",

    "body": "5 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editorWhat does the latest round of diplomacy on Ukraine tell us about Russian President Vladimir Putin's mood and intentions?For starters, that he's not ready to sign a peace deal. At least, not right now.And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.But cars need fuel (a constant supply).And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?",

    "body": "The Women's Institute has announced with \"sincere regret\" it will no longer offer membership to transgender women. The change to the organisation - which has thousands of local branches offering events, campaigns and social gatherings across the UK - will come into effect from April 2026. It follows a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that a woman is defined by biological sex under equality law.Until now the Women's Institute has allowed trans women - biological males who identify as women - to join.Melissa Green, chief executive of the National Federation of Women's Institutes, said: \"Unfortunately the legal position as it stands means that we can no longer offer that.\"The decision comes after \"40 years of fellowship and sisterhood with those women\", she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.The Women's Institute describes itself as \"a legally recognised women's organisation and charity\", and to comply with the Supreme Court judgement says it must \"restrict formal membership to biological women only\".The organisation said it would create a new national network of \"sisterhood groups\" alongside Women's Institutes that want to offer a \"trans-inclusive space\" to \"develop that friendship and support for transgender women\". It follows an announcement by Girlguiding on Tuesday that it would ban transgender girls from joining. Under UK law, the 2010 Equality Act sets out the rules for single-sex organisations and spaces being able to exclude members of the opposite sex.In April, the Supreme Court ruled that if a single-sex organisation or space is open to people of a different biological sex, then for the purposes of equality law it can no longer be regarded as single-sex.The equality watchdog, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), has said it will update its guidelines for businesses and services on how to interpret the law.Ms Green said it was a \"difficult decision\" for the Women's Institute, saying the organisation has 175,000 members and some will \"feel very strongly on both sides of this\".She said this was the only option available, adding \"ultimately the WI is a women's organisation\". \"Our council were very clear, the majority of them wish to remain trans inclusive, but that legal option wasn't open to us,\" she said. \"Some of our transgender members have been with us for four decades, they've been part of our family,\" she said, adding she recognises it will cause \"sadness\" for them.\"We intend to be clear that whilst the law restricts membership, it's our firm organisational belief that transgender women are women,\" she said, adding it would continue to \"express our continued sisterhood to transgender women\" through the new network being set up. Ms Green would not go into details on how the restriction on membership would be enforced, saying the organisation is awaiting EHRC guidance. The organisation also declined to say how many trans women were members. But she said any enforcement would need to be proportionate to the setting. \"We could have waited for the EHRC guidance, but I think society needs organisations such as my own to lead,\" she said when asked why the decision had been taken now. Helen Belcher, chair of trans rights organisation TransActual, said: \"This is the second national charity in as many days which has been pushed to force out trans people, against the organisation's will and at great cost.\"If these changes must be forced on organisations, then it's clear this is the result of a handful of extremists imposing their views on groups which have been very happily trans inclusive for many years if not decades.\"\"Our thoughts are with the people who may be outed by their exclusion, or lose access to their vital social groups and support networks at a time when those are more important than ever,\" she added, calling on the government to act \"urgently to rectify the situation\".Helen Joyce, director of women's rights charity Sex Matters, said: \"A group set up for women must be able to keep out all men, even the ones who are very insistent that they feel like women.\"If women – or men – want to join mixed-sex groups, there are plenty available. There are also plenty of charities that solely serve trans-identifying people.\"What is distinctive about single sex groups is obviously lost if people of the opposite sex are admitted.\"",

    "body": "8 minutes agoArchie Mitchell,Business reporterandMichael Sheils McNameeGetty ImagesBritish adults are hiding their outgoings on things like beauty products, gambling and cryptocurrencies from their partners as part of a pattern of \"secret spending\", a new report has found. More than half of adults in relationships spent in secret on a range of products, according to the research by investment platform AJ Bell and pollster Opinium.  The survey of 4,000 adults showed that men, on average, spent £2,545 without their partner's knowledge in the past year.By contrast, women spent an average of £1,769 in secret, the survey found.The most common secret purchase for men and women was clothing - with it being a purchase for 20% of men and 35% of women. For women in relationships, beauty products were the next most common, with a quarter saying they had secretly bought them.Men said their most common secret spend after clothing was on vices such as cigarettes and alcohol, with a fifth (19%) saying they had made the purchases without telling their partner.Men were also found to be more likely to use their cash for gambling or to send gifts to friends and family without telling their partners.Gen Z, those born between 1997 and 2012, are more secretive with their spending than older generations, with an average of £4,303 in the past year. Those over 55, meanwhile, spent an average of just £384 in secret over the same period.AJ Bell's personal finance director Laura Suter said a bit of secret spending \"might sound harmless\" but could potentially highlight \"a much bigger issue around how couples manage, discuss and plan their finances\".She said money being spent in secret could make it \"difficult to budget properly or plan for longer-term goals like buying a home, building an emergency pot or saving for retirement\". Ms Suter warned that gaps between what people say they are spending and what they are actually spending is \"likely to be one of the quickest routes to financial friction in a couple\".She added: \"Ultimately, you don't have to report every time you buy a coffee or get your nails done to your partner, but major costs, recurring habits or anything that risks derailing a joint financial plan should be on the table.\"And finance expert Iona Bain said couples maintaining a degree of financial independence can be \"very sensible\".But Ms Bain warned some partners hide spending from each other \"because they have failed to be honest about their values and priorities at an early stage, and they know deep down that their partner wouldn't approve\".\"This kind of behaviour is understandable but it actually creates more conflict in the long run because it's impossible to do things like buy a house together or have children without being honest about how you spend your money,\" she added.",

    "body": "'Our only son' - Matthew Perry's parents want lengthy sentence for doctor who supplied ketamine2 hours agoNardine Saad,Los Angeles andChristal HayesThe parents of Friends star Matthew Perry have written to a judge who is set to sentence a doctor who prescribed the actor ketamine before his overdose death.His relatives, in two separate statements on Wednesday, said they struggle to understand why Dr Salvador Plasencia repeatedly supplied Perry with the dissociative anaesthetic.His father and stepmother said the loss had \"devastated\" their family as their \"next patriarch\" is now gone, blaming Plasencia - a doctor who Perry's mother and stepfather called a \"jackal\" who repeatedly broke his Hippocratic oath.Plasencia is the first to be sentenced in Perry's 2023 death after pleading guilty last summer to four counts of distributing ketamine.The charges carry a maximum of 40 years in prison, though prosecutors have asked for a sentence of three years. Both victim impact statements were filed in the case ahead of Plasencia's sentencing scheduled around 1400 ET.He is one of five people who were charged in a multiyear federal investigation that examined how Perry, 54, acquired ketamine through an underground drug network in Hollywood. All five have since pled guilty. Perry – best known for playing Chandler Bing on Friends – was found dead in his hot tub in Los Angeles in October 2023 after years of struggling with depression and a drug addiction.\"Matthew's recovery counted on you saying NO,\" his father, John, and step-mother, Debbie, wrote in one of the victim impact statements. \"Your motives? I can't imagine. A doctor whose life is devoted to helping people?\"His mother and step-father, Suzanne and Keith Morrison, in their victim statement highlighted text messages included in court records, where Plasencia called Perry a \"moron\" and wondered how much he would be willing to pay for the drugs.\"Sometimes it's a little easier to understand when a person commits a terrible crime. Maybe in the heat of passion, or because that person makes one very bad decision,\" they wrote. \"But…a doctor? Who trades on respect, and trust?\"They said Matthew had spent time trying to recover and was hoping for another acting comeback. \"He wanted, needed, deserved..a third act. It was ..in the planning. And then, those jackals.\"Ketamine has some hallucinogenic effects and is meant to be administered only by a physician.The actor was taking legal, prescribed amounts of the drug to treat his depression, but then started wanting more than what was prescribed. Court documents as part of the federal investigation show it led him to multiple doctors and a woman prosecutors called the \"Ketamine Queen\" who supplied vast amounts of the drug and others from her Los Angeles home, which they called a \"drug-selling emporium\".Prosecutors say Plasencia - also known as \"Dr P\" - injected Perry with ketamine at his home and in the parking lot of an aquarium in Long Beach, about 25 miles south of Los Angeles. Plasencia taught Perry's assistant Kenneth Iwamasa - who also pleaded guilty in the case - how to administer the drug and sold additional vials for them to keep at home, according to court documents filed for the plea agreement.Prosecutors say between 30 September 2023 and 12 October 2023, Plasencia sold twenty 5ml (100mg/ml) vials of ketamine, ketamine lozenges, and syringes to Perry and his assistant.Prosecutors have said Plasencia and others charged in the case \"took advantage of Mr Perry's addiction issues to enrich themselves\".",

    "body": "Israel has announced it will open the key Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt in the coming days to allow Palestinians to leave the territory.Israeli military body Cogat said exits would be \"facilitated through co-ordination with Egypt, following security approval by Israel and under the supervision of the European Union mission\". It added that this would be \"similar to the mechanism that operated in January\", when the crossing opened during a previous ceasefire.An Israeli security official said it was an expression of Israel's support for the current ceasefire with Hamas, which began seven weeks ago.However, Egypt denied it was co-ordinating with Israel to reopen the Rafah crossing.The State Information Service cited an official Egyptian source as saying that \"if an agreement is reached to open the crossing, it will be in both directions, to enter and exit the Gaza Strip, in accordance with the plan of US President Donald Trump\".Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan states that \"opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism\" implemented under the January ceasefire deal.The crossing has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. Before then, it was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the conflict and a key entry point for humanitarian aid. At least 16,500 severely ill or injured Palestinians in need of lifesaving medical treatment abroad are currently waiting to be evacuated from Gaza, according to the World Health Organization. It says only 235 patients, almost all of them children, have been evacuated via crossings with Israel since the ceasefire took effect.Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that Palestinian Authority (PA) forces would assist in operating the reopened Rafah crossing alongside the EU's Border Assistance Mission.It cited a European source as saying Palestinian representatives had also helped during the previous ceasefire but without wearing PA insignia due to \"Israeli sensitivity\" over their presence in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any role in the future governance of the territory for the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.Haaretz also reported that Netanyahu had so far blocked the reopening of the Rafah crossing because of the delayed return of the bodies of deceased hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza.Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian. In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 345 Palestinians killed during the war.One of the remaining dead hostages is Israeli – Ran Gvili, 24 - and the other is a Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.The Israeli prime minister's office said on Wednesday morning that forensic testing had shown that human remains handed over by Hamas in Gaza the previous day did not belong to either of the two men.On Wednesday afternoon, the military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, said it had recovered the body of a hostage in northern Gaza. The body will be transferred later to Israeli forces via the Red Cross, according to Hamas's military wing.The two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "6 hours agoImran Rahman-JonesTechnology reporterA factory in China which has been accused of making \"childlike\" sex dolls has been placed under investigation by the local authorities and told to immediately halt production.The customisable dolls were reportedly being sold on major online shopping sites and social media platforms.Chinese state-owned news outlet The Paper said that local officials were attaching \"great importance\" to the issue.Last month, online retailer Shein - which started in China but is now headquartered in Singapore - banned the sale of all sex dolls globally after a public outcry over it selling dolls with a childlike appearance.The company said at the time it had \"strengthened its keyword blacklist to further prevent attempted circumvention of product listing restrictions by sellers\".Other e-commerce sites have also faced criticism over the sale of sex dolls which have childlike features. AliExpress has been investigated by French authorities over the issue.Reuters reported in November that the China-based company had banned a seller which sold sex dolls, after it \"repeatedly denied ever selling sex toys on any platform\", AliExpress said.Sweden has also vowed to take action against online retailers selling these types of dolls. \"I now start from the principle that electronic commerce companies assume their responsibilities and do everything possible to end the marketing of sexual dolls that resemble children,\" Social Services Minister Camilla Waltersson Gronvall told AFP.\"If we see that this evolution does not happen, or is not enough, the government will not hesitate to legislate different means.\"Advances in artificial intelligence have allowed for easier customisation of sex dolls ordered online, and some even have the ability to hold a conversation.The Paper reported that the factory which is now under investigation was one of several in southern Guangdong province which were producing customisable dolls with \"childlike pornography characteristics\".",

    "body": "Jeremy Doku was absolutely brilliant for Manchester City in their 3-0 win on Sunday, but Liverpool's tactics were the reason he was able to run riot down their right.Without Mohamed Salah tracking back, Arne Slot's side were always so vulnerable down that flank and I felt sorry for Conor Bradley, who was trying to stop Doku but had Nico O'Reilly to worry about too.Even if Liverpool had found some better balance, and had a winger who gave Bradley more defensive support or condensed City's space, then with the way Doku was playing he would still have been almost impossible to stop.Doku was a pleasure to watch, irrespective of who you support and who you wanted to win. You had to admire his skill, pace, strength and bravery - and his goal was just amazing.The way Liverpool were set up, though, actually helped him shine.He was electric and the game's star man. This was the best I've seen him play in a City shirt, but Salah not being asked to defend made it so easy for him.It became a really productive area of the pitch for City, and was one of the reasons they won so comfortably in the end.'Liverpool ended up being pulled apart'Media caption, How 'electric' Doku helped Man City 'dismantle' LiverpoolI am really surprised Liverpool's potential problem down the right was not identified before the game.Since he broke into the team a year ago, O'Reilly has been a real positive for City from an attacking perspective and frequently ends up in left wing or even centre-forward areas.So City were always going to look for an overload from him and Doku down that flank, and it was down to Liverpool to deal with it.But because Salah stayed high up the pitch when O'Reilly was flying forward, it left Bradley isolated, and with a dilemma - did he commit and stick with Doku, or drop off him and pick up O'Reilly charging forward instead?Image caption, Salah staying so high meant Bradley (red circle, right) frequently had to deal with two City players - Doku (top blue circle) and O'Reilly (bottom blue circle) running at himAs I explained on Match of the Day, Bradley was caught in between both players a lot because he was unsure what to do, but whatever he did it felt like there was always so much space over there for City to exploit.It was hard for Ryan Gravenberch to do much about it, because if he went out there too early he was only leaving space centrally instead, where the likes of Phil Foden and Rayan Cherki were looking for pockets to get on the ball.Ibrahima Konate tried to help Bradley too, but he was having to cover a lot of distance to get over to support his right-back, and being dragged across meant he left space behind him in the middle as well.Image caption, For the move that led to Doku's goal in the second half, Gravenberch cannot help Bradley (red circle, left) because he is picking up Foden centrally. The ball is played out to O'Reilly (bottom blue circle) running to the edge of the Liverpool area, who finds Doku in space to cut in and bend a beautiful shot into the corner of the netLiverpool ended up being pulled part and, like I say, they must have been aware it could happen before the game.The best opposition, with the best players, find your weakness. Chelsea deliberately targeted Liverpool down the right in the same way a few weeks ago, because they knew the problem with Salah existed - but Sunday turned into an even bigger expose of the issue.It is something that cannot go on. Liverpool cannot allow this to keep happening when they play the top sides, especially away from home where they see less of the ball and have less control of the game.Image caption, More than half of City's attacks came down their left, through Doku and O'Reilly. \"It's a very deliberate ploy,\" said Murphy on MOTD.Other things must have concerned Slot tooA lot of people will say that Liverpool have had success for years without Salah tracking back.While Salah did defend more under Jurgen Klopp, he spoke last season about not being given so much defensive responsibility by Slot and how much he was enjoying that. Let's remember Liverpool won the title with him playing that way.But there's a difference between never doing it and sometimes doing it. Last season, when Liverpool won at Etihad Stadium, Salah's defensive performance was among the best I've seen from him.This time, I think it was maybe down to him to look at how Bradley was having a tough time and decide 'I am going to help him out', even if it was just for 15 minutes or half an hour, to help Liverpool get back in the game.I am not saying Salah should now become a completely different player - you don't want him running back every time you lose the ball, because sometimes you want him ready for the transition where O'Reilly is out of position. Salah almost got in a few times like that on Sunday, because of his pace, but there has to be balance.In a game like this one, where you are 20 minutes in and Doku has been running your right-back ragged, then you could drop in for a spell even if you've been told you don't have to. I don't understand why he didn't do it at all.Image caption, Doku was the top player in the match for shots on target, touches in the opposition box, dribbles completed, duels won and fouls wonDecisions did not cost Liverpool the gameThat failure to try to fix things during the game was another disappointing part of Liverpool's display, but there were plenty of other things that must have concerned Slot too.Especially in the first half, they did not press particularly well. They lacked tenacity without the ball and seemed slow when they were in possession. In both areas, they were well below the level we saw in their previous two games against Aston Villa and Real Madrid.Now, of course they played a huge game on Tuesday against Real, one of the best teams in Europe, and put every bit of effort in to get a positive result.I get that, but City also played in the Champions League, a day later, so I don't believe Liverpool can use the Real game as an excuse.Media caption, Liverpool 'completely dominated' by Manchester City in first half, says SlotIf Virgil van Dijk's equaliser against City had been allowed to stand then I suppose things might have been different - Liverpool had started really poorly but moments like that can change momentum in games.I still think it was a poor decision, even when you break down the laws behind it, because Andy Robertson did not affect Gianluigi Donnarumma, but I would emphasise that decision did not cost Liverpool the game - City dominated them in all departments.Are Liverpool still in title race?Media caption, Guardiola beaming after win over Liverpool in 1,000th game as a managerThis result meant a good week for Slot ended badly, especially regarding the Premier League title race.The defeat is not quite as damaging as it could have been, because leaders Arsenal drew on Saturday and dropped points.But Liverpool are still eight points behind the Gunners and the biggest observation for me so far this season is that they are not consistently playing well enough to be able to think they can close that gap.This is a challenging time for Slot and his players but it is so early in the campaign, and there is plenty of time for them to bounce back and find some balance and rhythm, and cut out the mistakes.At the moment, though, all that feels like it is a long way off.City were not just the better team on Sunday who created the better chances, they were dominant for most of the game. Since their blip in August when they lost back-to-back games, they have looked really strong.At the moment Pep Guardiola's side are the ones who look most likely to compete with Arsenal for the title, while Liverpool need to find a way of becoming harder to beat.Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJack FenwickPolitical correspondentThe number of homeless people in England is higher than official government data suggests, according to new research from the charity Crisis.They say that around 189,000 families and individuals who faced the worst forms of homelessness such as rough sleeping, sofa surfing and living in tents were not included in official statistics.Official data is based on people declaring themselves as homeless to a local authority, which Crisis says often does not happen.The government says it is investing £1bn in homelessness services in 2025/26, a £316m increase on the previous year.The charity says the number of people facing the worst forms of homelessness has grown by a fifth since 2022 and now stands at around 300,000.They say that one of the drivers behind the figures is a large increase in the number of people housed in unsuitable temporary accommodation.When someone declares as homeless to the local authority, they can be placed in temporary accommodation while they search for a permanent home.The research from Crisis, which was produced by Herriot-Watt University, says the number of households placed in unsuitable temporary accommodation has jumped from 19,200 in 2020 to 46,700 in 2024.Unsuitable temporary accommodation can include unsafe B&Bs and properties far away from family and friends.They say an additional 18,600 families are living in \"unconventional accommodation\" such as cars, sheds and tents.Crisis says that many of the people included in their research do not meet the threshold set by government and councils to be eligible for homelessness support, such as those sleeping on friends' sofas.Isra came to the UK in 2009 aged six, after her parents fled war in Iraq.For most of her childhood, her family was housed in more than 10 different temporary accommodation locations around London, which she says were often unsuitable.Isra says she and her siblings were sometimes sleeping four to a room and that the places they were housed in were often infested with rats.She says she remembers her mother \"sifting through bags of rice because there were so many rats, we'd found rat droppings in our food\".Isra says the conditions she and her family lived in made it difficult to make friends at school or focus on her studies.Matt Downie, the chief executive of Crisis, said the findings of his organisation's research required a \"rapid response\" from the government.He said: \"No one should be forced to live in unsafe conditions, whether it's children in poor-quality B&Bs or people having to sleep on the streets, in tents or in squats.\"Government data released last month found that almost 330,000 households were at risk of homelessness in 2024, but these figures included people housed in suitable temporary accommodation and others who did not ultimately lose their current accommodation.Last month the government announced a £84m cash boost to help prevent homelessness this winter.Labour's election manifesto last year promised to implement a new homelessness strategy.It said a Labour government would \"develop a new cross-government strategy, working with mayors and councils across the country, to put Britain back on track to ending homelessness\".Some Labour figures have become concerned that no such strategy has yet been launched, but it is expected to happen before the end of the year.A survey of local councils conducted as part of the Crisis research found that 70% had seen an increase in the numbers of people approaching them for homelessness assistance in the last year.A government spokesperson said: \"Everyone deserves a safe place to call home, which is why we are investing more than £1bn in homelessness services and launching a homelessness strategy to tackle this issue.\"This is alongside accelerating efforts to tackle the root causes of homelessness by abolishing Section 21 'no fault' evictions, and expanding access to safe accommodation.\"",

    "body": "A trial begins on Monday for a man accused of carrying out an attack on a Christmas market in the eastern German town of Magdeburg last December in which six people were killed and more than 300 others wounded.The suspect is a doctor from Saudi Arabia, who has been named as Taleb A., in line with German privacy laws.He is accused of driving a rented BMW car at speeds of up to 48km/h (29mph) through the market in the centre of Magdeburg on 20 December 2024.Prosecutors say the attack happened at 19:02 local time when the market was very crowded with Christmas revellers – and lasted just a minute and four seconds.Taleb A., who is now 51 years old, will appear in Magdeburg regional court charged with murdering six people - a nine-year-old boy and five women between the ages of 45 and 75.He is also charged with attempted murder in relation to another 338 people.He faces charges of causing grievous bodily harm to 309 people and causing dangerous interference to road traffic.In a statement, prosecutors in Naumburg in Saxony-Anhalt said Taleb A. \"was not under the influence of alcohol or similar substances during the rampage and apparently acted out of dissatisfaction and frustration over the course and outcome of a civil dispute and the failure of various criminal complaints\".They said his aim seems to have been \"to kill an indeterminate number of people\". They said he planned and prepared the crime in detail over several weeks without the help of accomplices.Taleb A. has been in custody since the day of the crime. If he is found guilty, he faces life imprisonment for murder.A temporary courthouse has been erected in Magdeburg for his trial, because of the large number of victims.Germany's Christmas markets and festivals have come under attack before, mainly from extreme Islamists.At the time of the attack, officials said Taleb A., was an \"untypical\" attacker.A refugee from Saudi Arabia, Taleb A. was described as critical of Islam and he also voiced support on social media for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, hailing the party for fighting the same enemy as him \"to protect Germany\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC News Nell FrizellBetween deadlines, school runs and the constant \"what's for dinner?\" chat, even the best relationships can start running on autopilot.It doesn't mean the spark has gone or that you've stopped loving your partner, but rather that life has got in the way.Writer Nell Frizzell knows this all too well - after 10 years with her partner and two young children, she admits she doesn't have as much time or energy for her husband as she once did.\"I know we're told to focus on quality time, physical touch and gaze into each other's eyes lovingly but actually I am shouting at my husband to turn the eggs off.\" Frizzell says she's at a \"crunch point\" in her life. Her time, body and attention are being pulled in every direction - she's raising children, caring for elderly parents, running the home and working all at the same time.\"And within all of that, where do you have the time to look into someone's eyes and say you're wonderful?\" she asks.Bring other people inBut Frizzell has discovered something that helps keep her relationship connection alive - something she calls a \"third energy\".Not in the bedroom, she laughs, but at the dinner table.\"If we go away, we go with another family and if we go out to dinner, I love having friends there,\" she explains.It's a surprisingly simple idea - but Frizzell says having dinner with another couple, friends or family really does work as the presence of other people naturally changes the dynamic.She says sometimes a so-called date night \"where you're sat across the table with the person you live with and trying to come up with something new to say\" can be intense, so another person can help provide a new conversation starter or a fresh perspective.Frizzell says: \"I find him incredibly attractive when we're with people we don't see all the time as they ask him questions I wouldn't think to ask or tell him things I wouldn't tell him.\"Getty ImagesPsychotherapist Susanna Abse says a little space and variety can be vital to a successful relationship.\"Couples can end up moving around each other but avoiding real contact,\" she says.Truly noticing your partner can make a big difference.  \"Instead of coming downstairs in the morning and getting on with millions of chores, see what state your partner is in.\" Abse recommends asking them questions like how they are feeling or what their day looks like as \"curiosity is key\". Clinical psychologist Dr Amani Milligan says spending quality time together is also important.That doesn't mean a grand gesture and Dr Milligan says it can be as simple as taking a random Thursday off work together or setting rules like no phones before bed so you can catch up on each other's days.Relationships can come with endless distractions from emails and notifications on your phone to endless piles of laundry or dishes that need sorting.Abse says electronic devices can make couples more distant.\"Protest if your partner is on their phone all the time and set some rules you can both agree to.\"Schedule sexIt's near impossible to talk about keeping love alive without mentioning physical intimacy and Frizzell swears by scheduling it.\"It might feel administrative to say 'this is when we'll have sex' but with small children, it's absolutely key and it's something to look forward to.\"Abse agrees with that practical approach and says if you're not having sex \"you have to recognise the risk in that\" if you're both not happy with the arrangement as \"affairs often arise from unsatisfied needs\".When we're time poor or have a lot on, sex can be one of the first things to go but Abse says you should try to \"allow yourself to be persuadable\".\"You don't get into bed feeling very sexual but maybe with your partner's attention that might change.\"Focusing more on each other and seeing her partner anew has improved Frizzell's relationship.The final lesson she has learnt is that it's important to keep a little mystery from each other. \"Close the toilet door and have a bit of separation - by all means have a joint project but that shouldn't be going to the loo,\" she laughs.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThe resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and his head of news Deborah Turness dominate Monday's papers. \"BBC bosses quit in disgrace\" is the Daily Mail's headline. The broadcaster has been under fire over a Panorama documentary that was accused of misleadingly editing a speech by Donald Trump to make it look like he was urging people to attack the US Capitol. The paper quotes Davie's statement saying \"mistakes have been made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility\".The Daily Telegraph describes the double resignations as the BBC's \"biggest crisis in more than a decade\". The paper also features comments by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, saying it was right that the BBC bosses had \"finally taken responsibility\". In her parting statement, Turness says: \"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.\"\"Feels like a coup\", says one BBC source quoted by the Guardian. The paper reports that sources within the corporation are describing a \"mood of dismay\" at Turness' exit, as the hunt begins now to fill \"two of the biggest roles in British media\".The i Paper leads with \"BBC bosses quit over botched Trump film\". The paper says the White House is gloating that Trump \"forced out\" the corporation's director general.The Sun follows with the US president's reaction to the news of Davie and Turness' exits. Posting on Truth Social, Trump writes: \"The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught \"doctoring\" my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th.\"\"Death by a thousand cuts\" is how insiders describe Davie's departure, the Times reports. The paper says a number of issues including complaints over the BBC's coverage of Gaza and trans issues contributed to Davie's resignation. \"Furore over Trump documentary\" says the Financial Times. The paper reports that Davie and Turness' resignations come as the BBC is set to apologise to MPs over the Panorama documentary on Monday.\"Boss quits over BBC doctoring of Trump speech\" is the Daily Express's take. Elsewhere, the paper features King Charles III and Catherine, Princess of Wales, attending Remembrance Day tributes on Sunday. A photo of the princess wiping away a tear during the event shares the top spot.\"Tears of the crown\" is the Metro's headline. A photo of the King saluting at the Cenotaph fills the front page as the paper reports on his \"emotional\" tribute to those who died serving in the two world wars and other conflicts.\"Crisis at the Beeb\" says the Daily Mirror. The paper also previews an exclusive on TV presenter Caroline Flack, who took her own life in 2020 while she was facing trial for allegedly assaulting her boyfriend. The Mirror quotes an ex-Crown Prosecution Service chief who says Flack \"should never have been charged\".The Daily Star profiles \"Britain's tallest Tory\" who the paper says is vowing to become a \"giant of politics\". James McAlpine towers on the paper's front page, standing at 7ft 2in (219cm) tall.Finally, the Independent splashes on their campaign to support missing young people. The paper is pairing up with charity Missing People for a new SafeCall service that will provide a lifeline for those affected by the disappearance of a child.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick Edser,Business reporter and Peter Hoskins,Business reporterChina has lifted export controls on computer chips vital to car production, the country's commerce ministry said on Sunday.Exemptions have been granted to exports made by Chinese-owned Nexperia for civilian use, it said, which should help carmakers who had feared production in Europe would be hit.At the same time, China has also paused an export ban to the US of some materials that are crucial in the semiconductor industry. The announcement marks an easing of trade tensions between Beijing and Washington after President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump agreed in October to reduce tariffs on each other and pause other measures for a year.In October, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but owned by Chinese company Wingtech, to try to safeguard the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other goods.In response, China blocked exports of the firm's finished chips. However, it said earlier this month it would begin easing the ban as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China.While Nexperia is based in the Netherlands, about 70% of its chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.When it took control of the company, the Dutch government said it had taken the decision due to \"serious governance shortcomings\" and to prevent the company's chips from becoming unavailable in an emergency.But when China blocked exports of chips from Nexperia, there were worries that it could create global supply chain issues.In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (EMEA) had warned Nexperia chip supplies would only last a few weeks unless the Chinese ban was lifted.Earlier this month, the EMEA's director general Sigrid De Vries told the BBC that \"supply shortages were imminent\".Volvo Cars and Volkswagen had warned that a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover also said the lack of chips posed a threat to its business.But on Saturday, EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic announced in a post on X that China had agreed to \"the further simplification of export procedures for Nexperia chips\" and it would \"grant exemption from licensing requirements to any exporter\" provided the goods were for \"civilian use\".\"Close engagement with both the Chinese and Dutch authorities continues as we work towards a lasting. stable predictable framework that ensures the full restoration of semiconductor flows.\"In its statement, China's commerce ministry called on \"the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible.\"Meanwhile, the suspension of a ban on exports of \"dual-use items\" related to gallium, germanium, antimony and super-hard materials to the US came into effect on Sunday and will be in place until 27 November, 2026.The ban on the exports of goods and materials that can have both civilian and military uses was announced in December 2024.On Friday, China also announced the suspension of other export controls related to expanded curbs on some rare earth materials and lithium batteries.",

    "body": "John Laws, the veteran Australian talkback radio host dubbed the \"Golden Tonsils\" for his trademark voice, has died aged 90.Laws, whose career spanned more than 70 years, was - during his peak - one of the world's highest paid commercial radio hosts. His resume included interviewing 17 Australian prime ministers and countless celebrities.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described Laws as an \"iconic voice\" while actor and former neighbour Russell Crowe said he was a \"mischievous mate\".In the 1990s, he - along with rival Alan Jones - were found to have breached commercial radio rules in a \"cash-for-comment\" scandal for not disclosing significant payments for on-air endorsements.In a statement on Sunday, Laws' family said their \"beloved father/grandfather/uncle\" had died peacefully at his Sydney home earlier that day.\"While fame and prominence had become a mainstay of his life, for us he was always the person who meant so much, away from the microphone, the cameras, and the headlines,\" the statement said.Hugely successful but also polarising, Laws retired last November after various stints at a number of Sydney radio stations including 2UE and 2GB before his final 13-year run at 2SM. His shows were broadcast across Australia with a loyal following, especially in rural areas in New South Wales. At the height of this career, he had two million listeners tuning into his morning radio show, according to Australian Associated Press, which he opened with his signature greeting, \"Hello world\".In 2003, to mark his five decades as a radio host, his employer at the time 2UE gave him a gold-plated microphone, which was stolen several years later. Among the tributes to Laws was former Australian prime minister John Howard who described him \"a dominating presence on Sydney and national radio\". Russell Crowe, who lived next to Laws for more than two decades, said Laws \"worked hard, played harder and loved completely. A legend, in the very best, most Australian, sense of the word. I loved him and I'll never forget him\".But his career was also marked by several controversies including asking a woman who had been a child sex abuse victim if she was to blame.In 2000, Laws was also found guilty of contempt of court for interviewing a juror after a murder trial and was handed a suspended jail sentence. A few years later, Laws and another presenter on radio station 2UE were found guilty of breaking homosexual vilification laws for referring to a young gay couple using derogatory language.And in 2021, Laws again breached industry regulations by calling a listener \"mentally deficient\" and asking them to \"say something constructive, like you're going to kill yourself\".Born in Papua New Guinea in 1935, Laws and his family moved to Australia during World War Two. He grew up in Sydney and started his radio career in regional Victoria in 1953 at the age of 18. His career came at a time when new broadcasting laws allowed telephone calls to be aired, with many saying he went on to pioneer how talkback radio worked. For decades, he dominated the medium, with his influence channelled by prime ministers and politicians, especially during elections, to get their party messages to the wider public.Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating once said that Laws ability to reach the masses was crucial for any politician and that \"if you could convince John Laws, you could convince Australia\".Laws also branched out into television - hosting shows as well as being a talk show panellist - and the silver screen, starring in the 1970 film Ned Kelly which featured Mick Jagger.During his career, Laws was inducted into the Australian Media Hall of Fame and he received the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to broadcasting and charity. The award was later upgraded to the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said Jones' family will be offered a state funeral.",

    "body": "9 hours agoGeorge Wright and Andre Rhoden-PaulReutersIDF soldier Hadar Goldin was killed in Gaza in 2014Israel has received the body of Lt Hadar Goldin, a soldier killed in an ambush by Hamas in 2014 and whose body has been held in Gaza since then.The Israeli military said Lt Goldin, who was 23 when he died, was formally identified and will now be buried. He left behind parents, a sister, two brothers, and a fiancée.Hamas's armed wing had said on Sunday that it would hand over Lt Goldin's body as part of a ceasefire deal.Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages, and 24 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of the deal.On Sunday, Lt Goldin's father Simcha Goldin said in a statement: \"Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog both said they had kept a picture of Lt Goldin in their offices for the past 11 years. Netanyahu said \"we didn't give up\" on bringing him home.\"I know the agony that his family's been through, I know the longing for his return that united the people of Israel and today we're united in bringing him finally to his parents, to his family, to a grave in Israel.\"Efforts to retrieve Lt Goldin \"involved extensive intelligence efforts, alongside operational activities on the ground\" over the past decade and during the last two years of war between Israel and Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.The military expressed \"deep condolences to the family and continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement\".Herzog said the government would \"continue to act tirelessly\" to bring home all the hostages.Of the four hostages who remain in Gaza, three are Israeli and one is Thai.ReutersLt Goldin, from Kfar Saba, is the only deceased hostage whose remains were being held in Gaza before the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the latest war. He was killed in combat on 1 August 2014, not long after the start of a ceasefire in that year's war between Israel and Hamas. He was among a group of Israeli soldiers patrolling an agricultural area near Rafah in southern Gaza when they were attacked by a group of Hamas fighters. The Israeli military determined that Lt Goldin was killed along with two other soldiers in a firefight, and that his body was then dragged into an underground tunnel by the Hamas fighters.The Israeli military unleashed massive firepower to try to prevent Hamas from taking Lt Goldin hostage. Scores of Palestinian civilians were killed in the bombardment of Rafah, which continued for four days, including after Lt Goldin was declared dead.Nine years later, the Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. At least 69,176 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable.During the ongoing first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Before Lt Goldin's body was returned, Israel had also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of 20 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.On Saturday in Gaza, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said two people had crossed the yellow line marking the line of Israeli control and posed an \"immediate threat\".Separately, one Palestinian was shot dead in Gaza by Israeli fire and another was wounded on Saturday, local medics and the Israeli military said.Gazan medical officials said the person who died was killed by Israeli fire east of Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. Civil defence rescuers said the injured Palestinian was wounded by Israeli gunfire in Khan Younis.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Gaza health ministry.",

    "body": "Typhoon moves away from Philippines after killing two1 hour agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, Aurora, Philippines, Lulu Luo,Aurora, Philippines  and Koh Ewe,SingaporeThe BBC's Jonathan Head says the Philippines is braced for an \"absolutely massive storm\"A weakened Typhoon Fung-wong is now passing over the South China Sea and expected to head to Taiwan, after leaving two people dead in the Philippines.Some 1.4 million in the Philippines had been preemptively evacuated before Fung-wong made landfall on Sunday as a super typhoon, carrying winds of 185km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph).It hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT) and weakened to a typhoon hours later.Fung-wong comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left nearly 200 people dead. Philippine authorities are reporting less severe damage than expected - though a number of communities are still cut off by the floods.By daybreak, the winds from Typhoon Fung-wong which had howled all night had died down, and people came out to see the damage.There was plenty of damage to buildings, but good preparation appears to have prevented a repeat of the casualties seen after Kalmaegi hit the central Philippines last week.The country's meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and \"high-risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.Hundreds of flights were cancelled, buildings were secured and residents in low-lying and coastal areas had been urged to move to higher ground. At a shelter in central Aurora, parents brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013.\"We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,\" Jessa Zurbano had earlier told the BBC.Another evacuee Patry Azul said: \"Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe.\"Getty ImagesMany neighbourhoods have been flooded and some are now isolated from the rest of the countryThe winds Fung-wong brought were not as strong as in some previous storms, and its destructive power quickly weakened after it made landfall.Two deaths were reported, according to the civil defence office: one person drowned, while another woman was found dead under debris in Catbalogan City. Two others were injured. Still, many neighbourhoods have been flooded, and some are now isolated from the rest of the country after roads and bridges were cut by the high water levels.Aurora officials told local media on Monday that four towns have been blocked.Power is down in much of the main island of Luzon.ReutersThe Filipino government had declared a state of calamity across the country in preparation for Typhoon Fung-wong and in the wake of Kalmaegi.This gives government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year, left at least 204 people dead in the Philippines, while more than 100 are missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?",

    "body": "Two pitchers for the Cleveland Guardians have been accused of taking bribes to rig pitches they threw at Major League Baseball games.The pitchers, Emmanuel Clase de la Cruz and Luis Leandro Ortiz Ribera, have been charged in connection to the sports betting and money laundering scheme, federal prosecutors and the FBI announced on Sunday.Prosecutors allege that the scheme drew hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal wagers.\"The defendants' alleged greed not only established an unfair advantage for select bettors, but also sullied the reputation of America's pastime,\" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia said in a statement. The two players have denied any wrongdoing. The indictment alleges that Mr Ortiz and Mr Clase co-ordinated in advance with co-conspirators, allowing the co-conspirators and sometimes themselves, to place hundreds of fraudulent bets at online sportsbooks. Prosecutors say Mr Clase, who they allege joined the scheme around May 2023, and Mr Ortiz, who they allege joined around June 2025, each received kickbacks or bribes from the bettors in exchange for the advanced information. For example, before a game on 27 June 2025, bettors paid Mr Ortiz $7,000 to throw a rigged pitch and paid Mr Clase the same amount for arranging the rigged pitch, prosecutors allege. Prior to the game, Mr Clase took out $50,000 in cash and gave $15,000 to a co-conspirator who used it to bet on the pitch, the indictment alleges.In total, Mr Ortiz's rigged pitches helped his co-conspirators win at least $60,000 from the illegal wagers, while Mr Clase's helped his co-conspirators bring in at least $400,000, prosecutors allege. \"The defendants deprived the Cleveland Guardians and Major League Baseball of their honest services. They defrauded the online betting platforms where the bets were placed,\" US Attorney Joseph Nocella, Jr, alleged in a press release. \"When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us,\" Mr Nocella added.Mr Ortiz was arrested in Boston on Sunday, and Mr Clase is not currently in US custody, authorities said. Both players had been placed on non-disciplinary paid leave over the summer while during an MLB investigation involving sports gambling.The two have been charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy.In a statement, the Cleveland Guardians said it is fully cooperating with law enforcement and the league in their probes. Luis Ortiz's lawyer, Chris Georgalis, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that his client \"is innocent of the charges related to two pitches he threw\".\"He has never, and would never, improperly influence a game—not for anyone and not for anything,\" Mr Georgalis told CBS. The BBC has also contacted Mr Clase's representative, Kelvin Nova.While the investigation into Mr Clase was still ongoing prior to the indictments, Mr Nova told Cleveland.com that his client \"told me he doesn't bet\".Both The charges come just weeks after the FBI announced dozens of arrests in connection to two similar sports betting and money laundering schemes that involved a professional NBA player and coach as well as members of New York crime families.

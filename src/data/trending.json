    "body": "5 hours agoAndrew Harding,Paris correspondentandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterGetty ImagesUp until now French police would rarely intervene to stop crossings, due to the perceived risk to officers and civiliansFrance has agreed to start intercepting small boats in the Channel, following months of pressure from the UK.The change in policy comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wrote to President Emmanuel Macron urging him to back the plan and saying we currently \"have no effective deterrent\" in the Channel, according to a report in Le Monde.French security forces will be allowed to stop the small boats at sea, but only before they've picked up their passengers, the maritime police force has confirmed to the BBC.  French police have rarely intervened to stop the overcrowded boats leaving the coastline because it is considered too great a risk to both officers and civilians.Le Monde reported Sir Keir's letter as reading: \"It is essential that we deploy these tactics this month... We have no effective deterrent in the Channel.\"Now, a French maritime police spokesperson says officers will start intervening at sea, with the aim of safeguarding human life.Notably, the spokesperson ruled out the use of nets to intercept boats, which Le Monde has previously reported could be used to snarl the propellers of the boats.The decision to intervene at all is a significant step forward, following a short-lived change towards a more aggressive approach this summer, driven by former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.The BBC reported in March that Retailleau wanted these interceptions to begin - but had conceded it was a difficult issue for his government to solve because of their maritime policing rules.In the run-up to July's summit between Sir Keir and President Macron, the BBC witnessed French police wading into the sea south of Boulogne to slash the sides of a boat.But the French authorities insisted that incident did not reflect any broader change in strategy, and on the UK side there seems to be surprise that it has taken so long to resolve the problems Retailleau had already identified and said he would fix.Now French authorities will again be allowed to intercept boats before they pick up migrant passengers from the beaches of northern France, although it's not clear how the small boats will be stopped. Strong winds are currently delaying the start of interceptions and the people-smuggling gangs will be looking for ways to adapt to avoid interception, as they have done so often in the past.A UK government spokesperson said: \"We continue to work closely with our French partners on the shared challenge of illegal migration, and we have already worked to ensure officers in France review their maritime tactics so they can intervene in the shallow waters.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "Brisbane is not a city to give England some much-needed Ashes optimism.After defeat by Australia in the first Test, the tourists must stir themselves for a trip to the Gabba, a ground where England have not won since 1986.Men wearing three lions have habitually been lambs to the slaughter at the Gabbatoir.Among a recent history of broken English hopes, dreams and bodies is a source of inspiration delivered by a shining knight.It is exactly 15 years since Sir Alastair Cook conquered the Gabba with a career-defining 235 not out, saving the first Test of 2010-11 and setting England on course to their only Ashes series win in Australia in the past 38 years.It was the beginning of Cook's triumphant circumnavigation of Australia; three hundreds and 766 runs. Wally Hammond is the only Englishman to score more runs in a series in this country.After that first Test draw at the Gabba, England won 3-1, with all victories by an innings They have not won a Test here since.\"You forget the tough times, the nervousness and anxiety that went into that,\" Cook tells the Test Match Special podcast.\"I look back with pride. I played a significant part in a series when England won 3-1 in Australia and all three games were won by an innings. That just doesn't happen. One day, I need to sit down and watch some of it.\"Cook's road to his Australian epic began 18 months earlier, at the end of the 2009 Ashes in the UK. England won, but the opener averaged less than 25 with just one score above 50.He wanted more.\"Cricket is a team game, but the individuality does make you feel like you want to pull your weight,\" he says. \"The stats are very clear. I wanted to be part of an Ashes series I did well in, then it would have meant more.\"I wanted to judge myself against the best and my game wasn't stacking up against the best bowlers in the world.\"Two days after the celebrations I was back hitting hundreds and hundreds of balls in the nets with Graham Gooch, trying to groove something very unnatural, thinking in the long run it would be better for my technique.\"The initial results were encouraging. Cook made three hundreds on the 2009-10 winter tours to South Africa and Bangladesh.When Cook returned to England for the 2010 summer, the left-hander had a \"stinker\". In eight innings against Bangladesh and Pakistan, his highest score was 29.On nought not out at the end of the second day of the third Test against Pakistan at The Oval, Cook was convinced he was playing his last Test innings before being dropped.\"I was sitting in the bar, trying to find the answer in the bottom of a beer bottle,\" he says.\"I made the promise to myself: 'Don't get out defending tomorrow'. That was where I was at.\"It was a clearing of the mind. I decided to go back to my old technique. I attacked and had 76 by lunch on the third day.\"Cook's 110 guaranteed his seat on the plane to Australia, albeit via an infamous team-bonding trip to Bavaria dreamt up by England coach Andy Flower and captain Andrew Strauss.Players carried bricks uphill and did hundreds of press-ups. James Anderson suffered a cracked rib in a boxing session. Luckily for Cook, he missed almost all of it.\"I was at my brother's wedding,\" he says. \"I turned up for the last day. The most broken men were Strauss and Flower. I thought it served them right because they organised the thing.\"I'm genuinely disappointed I did miss it. For the next little while there were always references back to that camp. At the time it was horrendous, but the fact we were still talking about it years later shows it had its worth. I think people really opened up around the camp fire every night.\"Well-drilled on and off the pitch, England continued their preparations by winning two and drawing one of their warm-up games in Australia - Cook scored a century against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval.Come the first Test at the Gabba, they were hit by Peter Siddle's hat-trick, then hundreds from Mike Hussey and Brad Haddin.An hour before the end of the third day, Cook and Strauss opened England's second innings with a deficit of 221 runs. They reached 19-0 at stumps and followed up with a performance etched in Ashes folklore.\"I don't remember the messages, anything of what we spoke about,\" says Cook. \"We had an experienced team and the pitch had no demons. We just had to show some fight.\"The left-handers added 188 for the first wicket. Strauss made 110. When the captain fell, Jonathan Trott eased into Cook's slipstream for an unbeaten 135.Cook's 235 not out was the highest score by an Englishman in Australia for 82 years, beaten by his own 244 not out in Melbourne seven years later. England racked up 517-1 to save the Test and put Australia on the back foot.\"It was my 14th Test hundred, but the first time when it felt like I had really contributed and made a difference,\" says Cook.\"It gave us a lot of belief the Australian team were there for the taking. We got out of jail, but in a way that gave us a lot of confidence.\"England capitalised on an astonishing first morning of the second Test in Adelaide. Simon Katich was run out by Trott's direct hit from the fourth ball of the match and Australia captain Ricky Ponting was out first ball to Anderson.When Anderson also nicked off Michael Clarke, Australia were 2-3 and never recovered. The home side spiralled to 245 all out, leaving England one over to bat at the end of the first day.\"We got into the changing room and Flower asked if we were having a nightwatchman,\" says Cook.\"If Jimmy Anderson opened the batting, got out, then I went out to bat, imagine the stick I'd have got from the Australians when they were pumped up.\"Straussy usually took the first ball, but I said to him 'I'm going out there now and will face the first ball. You do what you want'.\"He said 'OK. I'll do it as well'.\"Cook followed up his Brisbane heroics with 148 in a Test remembered for Kevin Pietersen dismantling the Australian attack in his 227. Off-spinner Graeme Swann took five wickets in the second innings to bowl England to victory just before the heavens opened on the fifth day.\"After struggling the whole last summer, I was hungry for runs, and there's no better place to be hungry than a flat Adelaide pitch in 40-degree heat,\" says Cook.\"The KP double hundred was a real marker of dominance, of taking Australia down. He led it, the team got ahead of the game. He hammered Australia into the ground.\"England could have retained the Ashes in Perth, only for Mitchell Johnson to foreshadow the havoc he would cause four years later.England bowled out Australia for 268 and reached 78-0 in reply before Johnson got going. The left-armer took nine wickets in the match and England lost by 267 runs.\"We had a team meeting straight after and I wasn't sure it was the right thing to do,\" says Cook.\"It turned out to be the right move. Flower wanted us to look at how we lost the game.\"Did we take our eyes off what we were doing and started to think about the end result? Did we think we had done all the hard work and were going to win? Maybe we were thinking about retaining the Ashes there in Perth. I don't know.\"There were questions we maybe didn't have the answer to, but it was important to get them out. We went to Melbourne and the Perth game was buried. It was 1-1 and it became a two-match series.\"Australia were flying, there were pictures of Ricky Ponting all over the newspapers, people were saying we were done.\"What followed was perhaps England's single greatest day of Ashes cricket in Australia.At the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the 100,000-seater cathedral of Australian sport, and on Boxing Day, the highlight of the calendar in this country, the home side were blown away for 98. England - Cook and Strauss - were 157-0 at the close.\"If Carlsberg did Boxing Days, it was that. There was disbelief at the end of the day,\" says Cook. \"Me and Strauss cleared the MCG with our batting - most people wanted to go home when we were batting together.\"The Aussies are very proud of how many people they can get to the MCG on Boxing Day. By the end there were only 20,000 English people watching me and Strauss grind it around Melbourne.\"If I could go back through my career and play any one day over again, that would be right up there because of what we did as a group.\"Trott made 168 and England won by an innings and 157 runs. They celebrated retaining the Ashes with a sprinkler dance on the MCG outfield.\"I felt a little bit uneasy doing it, because we hadn't gone there to retain the Ashes - we'd gone there to win,\" says Cook.\"I enjoyed the dressing room in Melbourne and a few of the lads went out and enjoyed a night with the Barmy Army, but we hadn't finished yet.\"A result of 2-2 would have felt a bit of an injustice. However good Melbourne was, we still had Sydney.\"Fuelled by the focus to win the urn, Cook was at it again at the Sydney Cricket Ground. His 189 lifted England to 644, their highest total in a Test in Australia.The question was not if England would win the match and the Ashes, but when.\"The fourth evening, Chris Tremlett bounced out Brad Haddin and brought Mitchell Johnson to the wicket,\" says Cook.\"The song the Barmy Army sang, I've never heard anything like it. I spoke to Tremmers and he said 'I'm just going to bowl this as fast as I can'. He bowled an absolute jaffa to Johnson, and it bowled him. I've never heard noise like it.\"England took the extra half an hour on that fourth evening, but could not get over the line.The fifth morning was a victory procession. The Barmy Army and the rest of the travelling supporters were joined in the SCG by every ex-pat and backpacker in Sydney for an English Ashes party.\"The atmosphere was incredible,\" says Cook. \"It felt like an age, I was desperate to take the final wicket.\"When Tremlett got Michael Beer out to win the match, it was a moment of pure elation, just incredible.\"It was so early in the day, we had so much time to soak it in. I don't know when we left the ground, but we stayed for absolutely ages, on the outfield and in the changing rooms. It was very, very special.\"Cook was player of the series. The remaining seven years of his Test career were illuminated by other milestones: a starring performance in the 2012 series win in India, winning the Ashes as captain in 2015 and breaking the England records for most Test runs and hundreds.There were low moments, too, most notably the humiliating 5-0 defeat in Australia when he was captain in 2013-14.Following his international retirement in 2018, Cook was knighted for services to cricket. That service was best delivered on the 2010-11 tour of Australia.\"I couldn't have played any better,\" he says. \"I was very lucky to have been part of that team, achieving something rare for England in Australia.\"When you win games of cricket, it is unbelievably special. It was hard work, but international sport is hard work.\"It was such a good team to be part of. Flower and Strauss were tough, and that regime was very regimented, but we had the time of our lives there.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoAndrew HeadandJonathan Coffey,BBC PanoramaBBCAlison Porter-Garroch (L) went to help put out the fire at Mike Chesworth's home (R) - only for her own to then catch fireTwo residents who had been involved in a long-running dispute with a holiday park company saw their homes destroyed by fire on the same day.Their mobile homes, situated on opposite sides of Wyre Country Park in Lancashire, went up in flames within 90 minutes of each other in August.Both residents had appeared in a BBC Panorama programme last year that alleged some mobile home owners had been cheated out of their life savings.Exclusive Resorts Ltd, which owns the site, said in a statement that Panorama was presenting a narrative that appeared to insinuate, without foundation or evidence, that the company may have been involved in an arson attack. \"This suggestion is wholly untrue,\" it said.According to the company, a concern was raised with the police that one fire might be connected with an insurance claim.Lancashire Police said the fires had been investigated as potential arson, but no definite cause had been identified.\"We investigated as far as possible but all enquiries have been exhausted at this time,\" the statement said. \"The victims are aware this will now be filed as closed until such time as any further evidence becomes available to identify a suspect.\"Mike Chesworth was the first resident to lose his mobile home. He and his wife had left the park and were travelling to see a relative on 5 August when he got a call to say his home was on fire.\"I turned around as quick as I could and drove back to the park,\" he told the BBC. \"When I got there, my lodge was absolutely ablaze and lots of fire engines were turning up.\"The second resident affected by the fires lived on the other side of Wyre Country Park.Alison Porter-Garroch said she was at home when she saw the smoke coming from Mike Chesworth's unit and went to help people who were trying to put out the fire.She then went to visit another resident on the park, who spotted that Alison's home was also ablaze.\"I remember running over to my lodge, opening the front door because I had my mum and dad's ashes in there. It was just black smoke, and I couldn't see anything. I got the ashes out but I could just see my home going. It was just horrendous.\"Both homes were left uninhabitable by the fires.Wyre Country Park only has a holiday park licence, which means caravan owners are not supposed to live there full time.But last year, half a dozen residents told Panorama the site owner had told them they could live on the park full time when they bought their caravans.They said they had been sold the properties under false pretences and cheated out of their life savings by David Welch - the director of Exclusive Resorts Ltd.No definitive cause for the fires has so far been establishedThe programme then sent in an undercover reporter, posing as a potential customer who wanted to buy a home on the park.Both the sales manager and Mr Welch told the undercover reporter she could live on the site all year round.Mr Welch later told Panorama that the sales agreements and signs at the park made it clear the caravans were for holiday-use only.Following the programme, relations between Mr Welch and some residents, including Mr Chesworth and Ms Porter-Garroch, deteriorated further in a dispute over electricity payments.This July, the company commenced eviction proceedings against Mr Chesworth and his wife.The Chesworths owned their mobile home and had signed a lease allowing them to live on the land at Wyre Country Park.The eviction notice terminated that lease and required them to leave by 4 August, the day before the fires. The Chesworths had refused to leave.Exclusive Resorts said Mr Chesworth and his wife had been required to vacate their home because of \"serious and persistent\" breaches of their licence, including harassment.The company said it has \"co-operated fully and transparently with all lawful investigations\". It also said that the matters are now under the control of the relevant authorities and it would be inappropriate and irresponsible to infer baseless wrongdoing against the company.",

    "body": "Scientists believe they have recorded electrical activity in the Martian atmosphere for the first time, suggesting the planet is capable of lightning.Nasa's Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology and has spent the last four years exploring the Jezero Crater region.Electrical discharges nicknamed \"mini lightning\" were picked up from audio and electromagnetic recordings made by the rover's SuperCam instrument.Scientists hope new instruments for measuring atmospheric discharges and more-sensitive cameras could be sent to Mars to try to confirm the findings.A team of researchers from France analysed 28 hours of microphone recordings made by the Nasa rover over two Martian years (or 1,374 Earth days).They found that electrical discharges were normally associated with dust devils and dust storm fronts.Dust devils are small whirlwinds that form from hot air rising from the ground, and their internal movements can give rise to electrical discharges.Lead author of the research Dr Baptiste Chide told news agency Reuters: \"These discharges represent a major discovery, with direct implications for Martian atmospheric chemistry, climate, habitability and the future of robotic and human exploration.\"He and other scientists at the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in France believe that Mars now joins Earth, Saturn and Jupiter as planets known to have atmospheric electrical activity.Particle physicist Dr Daniel Pritchard wrote in scientific journal Nature that, although the recordings would \"provide persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges\", because the discharges were only heard and not seen, \"some doubt will inevitably remain as to whether this really was Martian lightning\". He added: \"Given the history of this field, the debate is likely to continue for some time.\"In September this year, scientists found rocks with unusual markings on Mars. The intriguing markings, nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds, contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient microbes.It is possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found.Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life.Perseverance was dispatched to the Jezero Crater because it showed qualities that may have meant it was once conducive to life, including signs it was once a delta when Mars could sustain liquid surface water.",

    "body": "Zelensky's chief of staff resigns after Ukrainian anti-corruption raid on his homeJust nowPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor andJaroslav LukivReutersYermak has for years been Zelensky's closest aide and has played a key role in talks towards ending the warUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned following an anti-corruption raid on his home.Yermak, 54, has been Zelensky's closest adviser throughout Russia's full-scale war, but has come under increasing pressure over an escalating scandal - even though he has not been accused of any wrongdoing.Zelensky recently appointed his chief of staff to head crucial negotiations, with US President Donald Trump leading a new drive to end the war with Russia.In a stark address to the nation outside his presidential office, Zelensky called for unity, warning: \"We risk losing everything: ourselves, Ukraine, our future.\"Ukraine's two anti-corruption agencies raided Yermak's apartment in Kyiv's government quarters early on Friday and the chief of staff said on social media that \"from my side there is full co-operation\".\"I'm grateful to Andriy that Ukraine's position on the negotiating track was always presented as required: it was always a patriotic position,\" Ukraine's president said during his video address in Kyiv on Friday.Zelensky said he would start consultations on Saturday on who would replace Yermak as his top adviser: \"When all the attention is focused on diplomacy and the defence in a war, inner strength is required.\"\"Russia wants Ukraine to make mistakes – there won't be any mistakes from our side. Our work continues, our fight continues. We have no right... to retreat, to quarrel [among ourselves].\"Yermak's departure from Ukraine's leading circle will come as a major blow for Zelensky, with US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll due to arrive in Kyiv by the end of this week as part of Trump's draft peace plan. US officials are heading to Moscow next week.Even hours before the raid on his flat, Yermak underlined the significant influence he held in Ukraine's leadership, conveying his government's position as it comes under US pressure to make territorial concessions to Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\"As long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory,\" Yermak told The Atlantic website.Russia has demanded that Ukraine hand over territory it still controls in the eastern Donetsk region, including several strategically important cities. \"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Putin said on Thursday.Yermak admitted during his interview he was under \"enormous\" pressure to stand down, adding \"the case is fairly loud, and there needs to be an objective and independent investigation without political influence\".Zelensky's own position has been weakened by the domestic corruption scandal, which has rocked Ukraine for weeks.Investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector.Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sap) said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.Zelensky has already fired two ministers and several suspects have been detained in the scandal. One of the president's former business associates, Timur Mindich, has fled the country.Mindich was co-owner of the TV studio Kvartal 95 where Zelensky's acting career took off before he was elected president.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentChancellor Rachel Reeves has said that people whose only income comes from the state pension will not have to pay tax.The state pension is set to rise above the normal level for paying tax in April 2027, due to increases in payments and tax thresholds being frozen.But Reeves has confirmed that anyone who receives the state pension but no other income will not have to pay income tax before 2030.The announcement has raised questions over the winners and losers of such a policy. Most pensioners have other pension payments which means they already pay tax, and experts say the move could add further complexity to the system.Anyone solely receiving the new flat-rate state pension - for those who reached state pension age after April 2016 - will get £12,547.60 next year.That is just below the income tax threshold of £12,570. That threshold is frozen and highly likely to be breached by the state pension from April 2027, meaning the portion of pension income over this threshold would be taxed.Small tax sums would normally be collected by the Simple Assessment process where HM Revenue and Customs does all the calculations and sends the pensioner a tax demand at the end of the year.But the chancellor said in her speech that, if this was the only source of income people had, then they would not face the administrative hassle.She later told Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, that \"in this Parliament, they won't have to pay the tax\".The Conservatives made a similar pledge during the last general election campaign.About three-quarters of pensioners already pay income tax because they have additional income to the state pension.They include 2.5 million pensioners - including widows and widowers - whose state pension operates under the pre-2016 system. They receive a basic pension and a SERPS pension, which means they pay tax.Steve Webb, partner at pension consultants LCP and former pensions minister, also highlights those with a very small private pension who would have to pay tax.Workers on the same income as the level of state pension would also be taxed, while pensioners would not be.\"There is a real risk that pensioners on the new system will be more favourably treated,\" Mr Webb said.\"There is no costing for this policy in the Budget documents which suggests that it is still very much an idea rather than a firm plan.  But it will be incredibly difficult for the Treasury to come up with something that is workable and fair.\"Rachel Vahey, head of public policy at investment platform AJ Bell, said: \"Collecting the little bits of tax owed from millions of pensioners was always going to be an administrative headache for the government. \"It's no wonder they've put their tax collecting thinking caps on to find ways to avoid it, but we will have to wait and see what process they come up with and whether it will indeed make pensioners' lives simpler.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick ThorpeBudapest correspondentEPAOrban has met Putin several times since the start of Russia's full-scale warHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has met President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, days before Russia holds talks on a US push to end the war in Ukraine.Orban is seen as one of Putin's closest allies in Europe and he has consistently angered his Nato and EU allies by undermining solidarity against Russia.\"We are aware of your balanced position on the situation in Ukraine,\" Putin told Orban in remarks carried by Russian state TV.Putin also thanked the Hungarian prime minister for proposing Budapest as a potential venue for a Russia-US summit with President Donald Trump.\"Trump immediately said: ''We have good relations with Hungary, you have good relations with Viktor, and I do too, so I suggest this option.' Of course, we happily agreed,\" Putin said.Plans for a Budapest \"peace summit\" were proposed last month, but it was shelved reportedly because the Russian side had refused to compromise on Putin's maximalist demands for an end to the war.The Hungarian leader's Fidesz party faces parliamentary elections in April and polls suggest that for the first time in 15 years it could be defeated at the ballot box. If he were to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, it could help boost his chances of re-election.Orban, who last visited Moscow in July 2024, has repeatedly challenged EU attempts to end European imports of Russian oil and gas.He billed Friday's visit as the second leg of a strategy to ensure Russian energy supplies this winter, for Slovakia and Serbia as well as Hungary.Earlier this month in Washington, he secured exemption from US sanctions on Russian fuel - but only as long as he remains in power.Ever since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Orban has claimed to have been on the side of peace and told Hungarian state radio last week that \"Europe has decided to go to war in Ukraine\".He has strongly backed Trump's 28-point peace plan to end the war and during frantic diplomacy after it emerged, the Orban government and pro-Orban media have accused EU leaders of \"war-mongering\" for trying to adapt the plan to take account of Ukraine's objections.Joining Orban and Putin in the Kremlin were leading Russian officials, including Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, who is part of Russia's negotiating team with the US.In a letter this week to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the Hungarian leader called for immediate, unconditional peace talks, for the EU to launch direct negotiations with the Kremlin. He stressed his opposition to further EU funds for Ukraine, and rejected the use of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukrainian defence.Now, with little sign of Russian willingness for compromise on Ukraine, Orban is focusing on Russian energy. Deals he struck in Washington to buy US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and start buying US nuclear fuel, mean Hungary will buy less of both from Russia, potentially annoying his Russian hosts.Orban argues that without deals with the US and Russia, heating prices would triple next month.Hungary is under pressure from the EU to end all imports of Russian energy by 2027 and is likely to use any agreement in Moscow to continue to defy Brussels.Hungary currently receives over 80% of its oil and gas, and 100% of its nuclear fuel from Russia, and total Hungarian trade contributes approximately $5bn annually to the Russian budget.A \"deal\" in Moscow does not appear difficult. Like Trump, Putin has made clear he wants Orban to win next April's election, so another diplomatic \"triumph\" for Orban would serve the interests of both sides. At this year's Valdai Forum in Sochi on 29 September, Putin praised Orban personally, and saluted \"nationally-oriented political forces\" gaining ground in Europe.\"If these forces in Europe continue to grow stronger, then Europe will be reborn,\" Putin said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterEPAThe Spanish football giant Barcelona has told fans it has \"no connection whatsoever\" with the digital coin offered by its new crypto partner, following criticism over the deal.Clubs often pick up sponsors in unusual areas to bring in extra money - with Arsenal bringing in Persil as its fabric care partner in 2023, and Kellogg's becoming Manchester City's breakfast cereal partner that same year.But far less is known about Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), which signed a three-year sponsorship deal in mid-November with Barcelona.ZKP then announced a cryptocurrency, prompting concerns Barcelona fans could be led to invest in it - leading the club to distance itself from the coin.\"The club has no responsibility for, or involvement in, the issuance or management of this token, nor does it use the associated technology,\" the club said in a statement on its website. Little is known about ZKP, which also announced a similar sponsorship deal with Australian rugby league team Dolphins in early November.On its website, it says the project has been founded and developed by \"a pseudonymous collective\" based across \"multiple jurisdictions\".In other words, the firm is not revealing the names or locations of those behind it.University of Sussex professor Carol Alexander said the Barcelona brand gives enormous visibility to crypto firms like ZKP - but there is \"substantial risk for supporters who buy the tokens\".\"Sponsorship creates an aura of credibility, even when the underlying project is opaque,\" she told the BBC - saying this meant fans and supporters should be \"very cautious\". \"Before buying any crypto asset they should ask who controls it, where the documentation is, and what recourse they have if it fails,\" she said.\"With ZKP, none of those answers are clear.\"'Substantial risk'Details about ZKP are few and far between, with the firm even claiming it has no single headquarter.But the Financial Times reported an earlier version of the company's terms listed an office located in Apia, the capital of Samoa.The ZKP name is also the term used to describe a type of technology designed to enhance the privacy of a blockchain - a digital record of transactions which underpins cryptocurrencies.From Bitcoin to blockchain: Key crypto terms and what they meanIts deal with Barcelona comes as the football club is reportedly facing an uphill struggle to raise revenue and relieve its debt. \"Barcelona's finances in recent years have been perilous, so the club appears to have adopted a strategy of 'bank the money first, ask questions later',\" said football finance expert and author Kieran Maguire.He told the BBC \"crypto products seek legitimacy and normalisation from those that speculate on their products\".To partner with a football club, particularly one as well-known as Barcelona, \"helps achieve those ambitions,\" he said.And former Barcelona youth player Xavier Vilajoana, who reportedly is bidding to be its next president, called on the club to clarify how the deal had come about in a post on X.He also asked the club about ZKP's relationship with self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate - one of only three X accounts the crypto firm follows on the platform.The BBC has approached Barcelona for a response.",

    "body": "A search is under way for a British man who fell overboard from a cruise ship off the coast of Tenerife. The Spanish coastguard said it had been coordinating search and rescue efforts for the 76-year-old since 09:48 local time (09:48 GMT) on Thursday.The incident happened on the Marella Explorer 2, operated by TUI, while it was located just north-west of the Spanish island.TUI's Marella Cruises said the man was \"seen entering the water while the ship was on passage to La Gomera\", adding that it was supporting his family and working with local authorities.In a statement, the coastguard said the ship participated in the search before docking in Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the early hours of Friday. Rescue boats, two helicopters and a specialist search and rescue aircraft have been deployed to the area.Lesley-Anne Kelly, a passenger on the ship, recalled the moment an alarm sounded while she was having breakfast with her mother on Thursday morning.She said the alarm was followed by an announcement of \"man overboard\".Mrs Kelly said the captain told passengers the ship had to stay in place until the coastguard allowed it to leave, and later announced that the search had been stood down due to darkness.\"It was pretty sombre last night, especially after the announcement that they were standing down the search,\" she said.Passengers were told that witnesses were being interviewed, she added.Mrs Kelly said she believed people \"had clearly seen it happen\", adding: \"It was breakfast time. Everybody was up and about. It was pretty bright, so yeah I can imagine if someone had gone in at that time of the day they would have been seen by multiple people.\" Local media reports say the ship was on its way back to the Canary Islands from the Portuguese island of Madeira when the incident happened. It is believed to have departed Tenerife on 21 November for a seven-day tour around the Canaries and other nearby islands.The Foreign Office said it has not been approached for consular assistance in this instance.The Malta-registered Marella Explorer 2 holds up to 1814 passengers across its 14 decks and 907 cabins, according to TUI's website.",

    "body": "'This was preventable': Anger and unanswered questions after Hong Kong fire8 hours agoKoh EweandKelly NgVideo shows how fast fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseShock is giving way to anger in Hong Kong after a massive fire ripped through a densely populated subsidised housing estate on Wednesday, killing at least 128 people and critically injuring dozens.Authorities say substandard mesh and plastic sheets on the buildings' windows may have spread the blaze, which raged for more than a day.Firefighting operations have now ended, with dozens of residents still unaccounted for.Questions are mounting as to how the fire at Wang Fuk Court spread so rapidly and who is responsible, with many calling it a \"man-made disaster\".Three people in charge of renovating the blocks are under arrest for manslaughter, and authorities have launched a corruption inquiry.A post that has gone viral on social media in the wake of the blaze reads: \"It's not an accident.\"Several residents have revealed in interviews that the fire alarm did not sound when the fire broke out. Authorities said on Friday that they had checked the fire alarms in all eight blocks and found that they were not working properly. Kiko Ma, who owns an apartment at Wang Fuk Court, says the alarms had been turned off amid renovation works, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to get in and out of the building. Ms Ma lives in Canada with her family, but visits the Hong Kong apartment several times a year.\"This was preventable... A lot of people did not do their duties,\" the 33-year-old tells the BBC, claiming that the renovation firm used \"poor quality, flammable materials\".Residents often saw construction workers smoking and found cigarette butts along their window ledges, she adds.\"People kept asking what would happen if there was a fire. Everyone was very worried about this.\"Getty ImagesThe blaze spread rapidly and went on for more than a day in some blocksThis is Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years - already having surpassed the toll of the August 1962 inferno in the Sham Shui Po neighbourhood, which killed 44 people and displaced hundreds.Built in the 1980s, Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's north-eastern Tai Po district comprises eight 31-storey buildings, seven of which went up in flames. The apartments here are sold at subsidised prices, but day-to-day affairs in the estate are managed by privately appointed firms.According to the 2021 census, the complex was home to about 4,600 people - nearly 40% of whom were 65 or older. The city's fire department on Thursday said firefighters faced major challenges trying to rescue residents, including high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments.Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have, on average, a living space of just 14.1 square metres. It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out, but the more recent census figures suggest it is home to around 4,600  residents. Hundreds of them have been evacuated to temporary shelters, and some are being allocated emergency housing units.Police are investigating whether mesh netting, plastic and canvas sheets used during renovations met fire safety standards. In a presser on Friday they attributed the rapid spread of the fire to styrofoam blocks placed outside the windows of the apartments, apparently to \"protect\" them from the debris and dust.Some experts also believe the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks helped fuel the inferno. Such scaffolding is an iconic sight across Hong Kong, and widely used in construction.Earlier this year, authorities announced plans to phase out bamboo in favour of sturdier, fire-resistant steel, citing bamboo's combustibility and deterioration over time.Getty ImagesHundreds of residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters while emergency housing units are being allocated to someResidents at Wang Fuk Court had expressed unease about renovation plans when they were announced last year. Reports of those concerns have now resurfaced online, sparking accusations around a lack of transparency.Another homeowner who was abroad when the fire broke out said the plans were \"fundamentally shady\". \"[Those in charge] used small favours to encourage unsuspecting elderly residents to support their plans,\" they wrote in a comment on Instagram.Mr Lai, a sales associate who the BBC agreed to refer to by his last name only, says Wang Fuk Court residents had earlier questioned the high cost of renovation works. Calls from some residents to re-elect the estate's management committee went unheeded, he added. This week's fire is not an isolated incident, Mr Lai said, claiming that construction companies \"often prioritise cost efficiency\" over safety. He noted that a building in Hong Kong's Central district went up in flames last month after its bamboo scaffolding caught fire.\"When similar incidents happen, they raise the question of whether [there are] systemic weaknesses.\"Hong Kong authorities on Thursday ordered inspections of all housing estates undergoing \"major repairs\" to check for the \"safety of scaffolding and building materials\".",

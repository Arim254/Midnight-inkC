The video has received significant attention from figures like JD Vance and Elon Musk since being uploaded, prompting the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to declare the agency would target \"blatant fraud that seems to be rampant in Minnesota\".\nDespite the administration’s response to the story, some mainstream media outlets have not found evidence of fraud, while some conservatives feel the story has not had enough attention in the wider media. What’s the truth behind Nick Shirley’s claims and what does it mean for Minnesota and its Somali community?\nAnd, Zohran Mamdani has been sworn in as New York mayor. He delivered a speech outside City Hall promising to show the world that America’s political Left can govern. What are the obstacles he’ll face in that journey as mayor, and how much will it hinge upon his relationship with Donald Trump?\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "4 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterPA MediaJunk food adverts will be banned on television and online from Monday as part of a drive to tackle childhood obesity.  The UK-wide ban will stop food and drinks high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) being advertised on TV before 21:00 and at any time online.It applies to products considered to be the biggest drivers of childhood obesity, including soft drinks, chocolates and sweets, pizzas and ice creams.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said it is committed to helping people eat healthily and has been voluntarily abiding by the new restrictions since October.As well as more obviously unhealthy foods, the ban will also cover some breakfast cereals and porridges, sweetened bread products, and main meals and sandwiches.Decisions over which products fall under the ban will be based on a scoring tool, balancing their nutrient levels against whether they are high in saturated fat, salt, or sugar.Plain oats and most porridge, muesli and granola will not be banned under the crackdown, but some versions with added sugar, chocolate or syrup could be affected.Firms can still promote healthier versions of banned products, which the government hopes will lead to food makers developing healthier recipes.The ban only covers adverts in which unhealthy products can be seen by viewers, meaning fast-food firms will still be able to advertise using their brand name.Previously, HFSS food and drink adverts were banned on any platform where more than a quarter of the audience was under 16.Firms that do not comply with the new rules risk action by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).NHS data shows almost one in 10 (9.2%) reception-aged children are now living with obesity, while one in five children have tooth decay by the age of five.It is estimated obesity costs the NHS more than £11bn every year.Evidence shows children's exposure to ads for unhealthy food can influence what they eat from a young age, in turn putting them at greater risk of becoming overweight or obese.The government estimates the ad ban will prevent around 20,000 cases of childhood obesity.Katherine Brown, professor of behaviour change in health at the University of Hertfordshire, said the ban was \"long overdue and a move in the right direction\".She said: \"Children are highly susceptible to aggressive marketing of unhealthy foods and exposure to them puts them at greater risk of developing obesity and associated chronic diseases.\"Ms Brown called for the government to make nutritious options \"more affordable, accessible and appealing\".The FDF said manufacturers are \"committed to working in partnership with the government and others to help people make healthier choices\".It added: \"Investing in developing healthier products has been a key priority for food and drink manufacturers for many years and as a result, our members' products now have a third of the salt and sugar and a quarter of the calories than they did ten years ago.\"",

    "body": "Mother and daughter named as sea tragedy victims2 hours agoEmma PetrieEast Yorkshire and LincolnshireFamily HandoutGrace Keeling and Sarah Keeling went into the sea off the East Yorkshire coast on Friday with passer-by Mark RatcliffeA man who died trying to save two people from the sea in East Yorkshire on Friday was attempting to rescue a mother and her teenage daughter, Humberside police said.Officers said 67-year-old Mark Ratcliffe entered the water at Withernsea to try and save 45-year-old Sarah Keeling and 15-year-old Grace Keeling.In a tribute, Mr Ratcliffe's family said he was \"a true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".Police said the bodies of Sarah Keeling and Mark Ratcliffe were recovered on Friday evening, and officers were still searching to locate Grace.Mr Ratcliffe's family said: \"So many lives are now shattered that you're gone. You were loved by so many people, and we will all miss you forever.\"A loving husband, father, son, brother and the best grandad anybody could ever wish for. Sleep tight, we love you, we miss you.\"Mr Ratcliffe's son, in a Facebook post, thanked the RNLI, HM coastguards and the emergency services who had done \"all they could\" and worked tirelessly and relentlessly in awful weather conditions.\"Bye Dad, I miss you and I will never forget the true hero and role model you were,\" he wrote.Police said both families were being supported by specially trained officers.BBC/Joe BiltonThe police said officers were continuing to search for Grace KeelingAt 15:10 GMT on Friday, the coastguard responded to reports of \"a number of people in difficulty\" in the water.What followed was a huge search and rescue operation involving about 100 emergency workers, a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington, Skegness and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.The coastguard stood down their search at 16:00 on Saturday afternoon.The RNLI thanked members of the public who they said had \"assisted and supported\" the emergency services.\"This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the families, friends and all those impacted,\" they said in a statement on Sunday.BBC/Becki BowdenFloral tributes have been placed close to the scene on the promenadePaul Whitehead, owner of Castle Cafe on the promenade said he had handed three minutes of CCTV footage taken from the front of the cafe over to the police.Mr Whitehead said several people ran across to help including two members of his staff. He said a lifebelt at the foot of the towers on the seafront was thrown into the sea to help the young woman but the undertow took her away.\"It's just an accident,\" he said, \"a tragic accident, and it has affected the town deeply.\"Mr Whitehead said he had lit three candles in St Matthew's Methodist church on Sunday, one for each of the three victims.Services took place at the church earlier to allow people to reflect on what had happened. People have also placed flowers on the promenade.  Janice Holgate, who travelled from Hull, said it had been \"absolutely devastating\" to hear what had happened.\"I had to pay my respects just to let the families know that people are thinking about them,\" she said.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this story",

    "body": "5 minutes agoThomas MackintoshAFP via Getty ImagesThe King said he was \"privileged and proud\" to have known Eva SchlossKing Charles has led tributes to Anne Frank's step-sister and Holocaust survivor Eva Schloss who has died aged 96.Mrs Schloss was the co-founder and honorary president of the Anne Frank Trust, which Queen Camilla is Patron of.In the 1940s, Mrs Schloss and her family were chased from their home in Austria. They lived as refugees in the Netherlands before they were captured and sent to the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp.In a tribute posted on social media, the King wrote: \"My wife and I are greatly saddened to hear of the death of Eva Schloss.\" He continued: \"The horrors that she endured as a young woman are impossible to comprehend and yet she devoted the rest of her life to overcoming hatred and prejudice, promoting kindness, courage, understanding and resilience through her tireless work for the Anne Frank Trust UK and for Holocaust education across the world.\"We are both privileged and proud to have known her and we admired her deeply.\"May her memory be a blessing to us all.\"AFP via Getty ImagesEva Schloss took part in a candle lighting ceremony alongside Queen Camilla in January 2022 to mark Holocaust memorial dayThe Anne Frank Trust said Mrs Schloss died in London on 3 January.\"As a girl, Eva Schloss-Geiringer lived on the Merwedeplein in Amsterdam, opposite Anne Frank's home,\" the trust said. \"Like Anne, Eva and her family had to go into hiding from the Nazis, and after two years spent underground they were tracked down, arrested and deported. Eva survived Auschwitz.\"By the time Mrs Schloss and her family were liberated by the Soviet army in January 1945, Ms Schloss and her mother Elfriede Frank were barely alive. Her brother and father both died in captivity.Repatriated to Amsterdam, Elfriede - who was known as Fritzi - married Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank, who had also managed to survive internment by the Nazis.Over the past 40 years, Mrs Schloss dedicated her life to trying to prevent history from repeating itself.As co-founder of the Anne Frank Trust UK, she preserved Anne Frank's memory and educated people about the Holocaust.Frank's widely-read diary - a first-hand account of life for Jewish people under Nazi occupation - has sold more than 30 million copies, has been translated into 70 languages and is required reading in schools around the world.Mrs Schloss often travelled in Europe, speaking to young people in particular and spreading a message not to hate. \"I have worked very, very hard to change people's attitudes,\" Mrs Schloss told the BBC in June 2021.\"Each person you convince not to be racist is a positive.\"In 1951, Mrs Schloss moved to London to study photography.It was there she met her husband, Zvi Schloss, a German Jew who during the war, after his father was imprisoned at Dachau concentration camp, fled to Palestine, which at the time was ruled by Britain through a League of Nations mandate. The couple made London their home and became UK citizens.Mr Schloss died in London in 2016. The couple are survived by their daughters, sons-in-law and grandchildren, the trust said.",

Image source, BBC Weather Watchers/ chrisx30Image caption, Locals in Llanberis, Gwynedd, north west Wales, woke up to a deep covering of snow on SundayStrong winds causing driftingMet Office amber weather warnings have been issued for snow across Shetland, Orkney and parts of northern mainland Scotland from 1800 on Sunday until 1000 on Monday.Heavy snowfall over recent days has resulted in over 40cm reported in parts of Moray already. Strong winds have been causing drifting, with Network Rail Scotland reporting snow drifts up to 1.2m (4ft) on the line between Aberdeen and Dundee. Scottish regional airline Loganair has cancelled flights from Aberdeen and Inverness airports on Sunday and Monday following heavy snowfall.As the snow showers become heavier and more frequent during Sunday night, the Met Office is warning for the potential of another 20 to 30cm of snow.Further road and rail closures are possible and disruption to power is likely in some areas too.The Met Office also warned mobile phone coverage could be affected.Hundreds of schools in northern Scotland will stay shut after the Christmas holidays on Monday.The return of pupils has been delayed in Aberdeenshire, Shetland and Orkney, while schools in Aberdeen will have a later start.A number of schools in Northern Ireland will also be closed on Monday. A full list is available here.Image caption, Most areas of the UK are covered by Met Office snow and ice warnings on MondayNumerous yellow weather warnings for snow and ice have also been issued in each of the four nations, with the Met Office highlighting the risk of longer journey times by road and rail on Monday and Tuesday morning, as well as the potential for slips and falls on pavements and cycle routes.Parts of Scotland have a yellow snow and ice warning in place until the end of Tuesday.Most parts of the UK will be fairly sunny by day, but light snow flurries will affect the far north of Scotland, west Wales and some eastern counties of England.Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / frazmanscoopImage caption, There were no signs of drivers on this snow-covered country road in OrkneyHow long will cold weather last?Clear skies on Saturday night brought plunging temperatures as England and Wales registered their coldest night of winter so far.  The mercury dropped to minus 9.3C at Benson in Oxfordshire and minus 7.3C at Sennybridge in Powys.Sunday night into Monday morning could be even colder as temperatures are forecast to drop to minus 10 or minus 11C in some rural parts of Scotland and Wales.Although temperatures will slowly lift through the rest of this week, cold health alerts from the UK Health Security Agency remain in place across all of England until Friday. The HSA warns that the prolonged cold spell could lead a rise in deaths, particularly amongst the elderly or those with underlying health conditions.In Plymouth, four city centre churches have opened their doors to the homeless due to the drop in temperatures, and will offer hot drinks, clean bedding and specialist support.Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / silver surferImage caption, Houses in Whitby, North Yorkshire, provided a splash of colour amid the snowfallWill snow, sleet or rain fall?Atlantic weather fronts are likely to bring more snow through this week. The difficulty for forecasters will be pinpointing the fine temperature boundaries that dictate where snow, sleet or rain falls.The coldest air is likely to persist over the northern half of the UK and bands of snow of varying intensity could cause disruption.Image caption, The position of a low pressure system later this week will be key to where we will see snow, sleet or heavy rain Towards the end of the week, a greater temperature contrast is expected across the UK as a deep area of low pressure swings in, fired up by an active jet stream overhead.It is too early to say exactly when and where this area of low pressure will cross the UK, however. The track will be crucial as there is likely to be a spell of heavy snow on the northern edge of the low and heavy rain to the south. Strong winds may also bring some disruption too.Keep up to date with the latest BBC Weather forecasts on the app and online.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAleks PhillipsandNikos PapanikolaouGetty ImagesThessaloniki Airport closed entirely after air traffic communication was knock outThousands of passengers are stranded across Europe after a communications failure forced Greece to close its airspace, causing widespread cancellations and delays.Officials are working to understand why radio communications were disrupted on Sunday morning, prompting the temporary suspension of arrivals and departures.Some departures have since been allowed to resume - though inbound flights are still being told to divert or return to their point of origin. Athens' main airport is among the worst affected, while Thessaloniki airport has closed entirely.The timing of the disruption has raised fears that travellers will not be able to get home before the start of the working week.\"I was supposed to fly to London, via Stockholm, with SAS,\" one passenger at Athens International Airport told Greek broadcaster Mega TV. \"I'm working on Newport Hospital tomorrow morning. I'm not going to be there on time, I don't know what else to say. \"Who is going to pay for the additional cost this travel will cost me? We still don't know if and when we're going to leave, no one is telling us anything.\"More than 90 flights have been affected in and out of Athens airport alone - though some flights have since been able to resume.A member of staff in the airport told the BBC that 35 aircraft an hour were now being allowed to take off, but it was still unable to take inbound flights.Flights departing from Dublin, Barcelona and Paris were earlier ordered to return to their airports of origin, while services from Copenhagen and Malta were cancelled altogether. Other arrivals into Athens were placed on standby, while flights in and out of other Greek airports have also been affected. Three flights out of Heraklion airport on the island of Crete, including one to Munich, have been delayed, according to public broadcaster ERT.Most inbound flights are being diverted to Turkey if not cancelled outright, it reports.Reuters / Flightradar24Greek airspace was nearly empty earlier on Sunday due to the technical faultThe disruption comes at a busy time for air travel in and out of Athens, which typically sees more than 600 scheduled flights per day, as people return from winter holidays.In the chaos, some passengers have complained of a lack of information. One told news site Flash: \"We have no updates. They told us that we will be able to leave but I don't think this is true. On the departures board I can't see my flight, and I'm supposed to leave shortly.\"Another, who had been on a flight to Rhodes when it turned around and headed back to Athens, told news agency Reuters: \"From that moment until now we have no information whatsoever.\"Domestic travellers may have the option of getting home on Greece's rail network, but this would take significantly longer.The issue that caused the disruption is thought to concern the radio system used by air traffic controllers to communicate with planes in their airspace.Panagiotis Psarros, chair of the Association of Greek Air Traffic Controllers, told ERT that all frequencies were \"suddenly lost\", adding: \"We could not communicate with aircraft in the sky.\"The broadcaster later reported than an initial investigation by the Greek security services suggested the problem may be due to the failure of an antenna in the Gerania Mountains near Athens. Italy, Turkey and Cyprus are assisting Greece in managing the situation.",

    "body": "10 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture correspondentThe composer of the musical Wicked has said he will not appear at the Kennedy Center after its board voted to include US President Donald Trump's name in the name of the venue.Stephen Schwartz said in a statement that appearing at the centre \"has now become an ideological statement\", adding: \"As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.\"But Richard Grenell, the center's president, wrote on X that the reports of him pulling out of a gala in May were \"totally bogus\" and that he had never been signed to attend.The Oscar and Grammy-award winning composer is the latest artist to say they will no longer appear at the national cultural institution over the recent changes.Schwartz told the BBC that at the end of 2024 he was asked by the artistic director of the Washington National Opera to participate in the May event with them.He said that he had agreed, but that he had received little communication since last February and assumed it was no longer taking place.The composer explained that, on Thursday, he was contacted by a reporter saying that the gala was announced on the Kennedy Center schedule and asking if he would be participating.He had been listed on the centre's website as appearing in the gala, but this was removed from the website on Friday afternoon, according to CNN.\"The Kennedy Center was founded to be an apolitical home for free artistic expression for artists of all nationalities and ideologies,\" Schwartz, 77, said.\"It is no longer apolitical, and appearing there has now become an ideological statement. As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.\"But Mr Grennell hit back: \"The Stephen Schwartz reports are totally bogus. Shame on the woke high school reporters repeating it.\"He was never signed and I've never had a single conversation on him since arriving.\"He himself said last February he hadn't heard anything on it.\"Two musical acts cancelled their appearances at the centre earlier this week.The Cookers, a veteran jazz band, said they cancelled two New Year's Eve shows. The group did not mention Trump or the Kennedy Center in a statement, but said the decision had \"come together very quickly\".Another group, Doug Varone and Dancers, said they would not perform two shows in April because of the name change, adding: \"We can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution.\"Mr Grenell called the cancellations \"a form of derangement syndrome\".Prior to them, jazz percussionist Chuck Redd called off a Christmas Eve gig he had hosted annually since 2006 at the centre over the name change.Mr Grenell called it a \"political stunt\" and threatened to seek $1m (£740,000) in damages.The Kennedy Center's board, which Trump filled with allies, voted to rename the institution the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in December. New signage appeared on the building's exterior the following day.Some US lawmakers and legal scholars have argued that, because the centre was named in a 1964 law, Congress must have a say on any name change.Some members of President John F Kennedy's family have denounced the move. The centre was named in Kennedy's memory shortly after his assassination.Joe Kennedy III, a former US House of Representatives member and grandnephew of the late president, said the venue was \"a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".\"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he added.",

    "body": "8 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture correspondentBBCFormer Little Mix star Jesy Nelson has revealed that her twin baby daughters have been diagnosed with a rare genetic condition which means they will \"probably never walk\".The singer gave birth to Ocean Jade and Story Monroe Nelson-Foster prematurely last May with musician Zion Foster.On Sunday, Nelson said in an Instagram video that the girls have Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), which she described as the \"most severe muscular disease\".\"It does affect every muscle in the body, down to legs, arms, breathing, swallowing,\" she said.In the video, she explained that her daughters had not been showing as much movement in their legs as they should be, and were struggling to feed properly.\"After the most gruelling three, four months, and endless appointments, the girls have now been diagnosed with a severe muscular disease called SMA type 1,\" she said.\"Essentially, what it does is, over time, it kills the muscles to the body, and if it's not treated in time, your baby's life expectancy will not make it past the age of two.\"Nelson said that the girls were assessed at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.There, she said, she was told that her daughters were \"probably never going to be able to walk. They probably will never regain their neck strength, so they will be disabled\".She added that they have since had treatment, which she was \"so grateful for\".\"Because if they don't have it, they will die.\"Nelson said she had to act as a nurse and put her daughter on \"breathing machines\" since the diagnosis.\"The reason I wanted to make this video was because the last three months have honestly been the most heartbreaking time of my life. I literally feel like my whole life has done a 360.\"But she said she believed her daughters would \"defy all the odds\" and that with the right help, \"they will fight this\".She added that she wanted to share the diagnosis to help other children to get diagnosed as fast as possible.After resharing Nelson's story, partner Foster posted a smiling image of the twins with the caption: \"Still smiling through all the challenges. Daddy loves you so much.\"Getty ImagesThe singer wants to help other children get a diagnosis as fast as possibleNelson, 34, gave birth to her twins prematurely at 31 weeks, having previously revealed she had experienced rare complications during the pregnancy.In an Instagram post in October, she said she had \"never felt prouder\" of her body following the birth of her girls, adding that becoming a mother made her \"realise how incredible my body actually is\".Nelson left Little Mix in December 2020, and has since released music as a solo artist, including the single, Boyz, featuring Nicki Minaj, in 2021.SMA is a progressive muscle-wasting disease that can cause death within two years if untreated.In 2021, a life-changing gene therapy drug called Zolgensma was approved by the NHS to treat babies with the disease.According to SMA UK, the drug delivers a healthy copy of the affected gene to the body, but timing is critical because irreversible damage may have already occurred in the nervous system.At present, screening for SMA is only carried out on those who have a sibling with the condition.SMA UK wants the disease to be added to a blood spot test that already checks newborn babies for 10 rare but serious conditions.According to the charity, an estimated 47 babies were born with the condition in the UK in 2024, although about one in 40 people carry the altered gene that can cause the disease.",

    "body": "The 'happy little town' left reeling from sea deaths2 hours agoKevin Shoesmithin WithernseaKevin Shoesmith/BBCThe Reverend Clive Hall says Withernsea is pulling together following Friday's sea tragedyAfter a sea tragedy which left a man and a woman dead, with a teenage girl still missing, the small East Yorkshire resort of Withernsea is a community in mourning. Residents speak of their pain but also of their resolve to support one another and the families affected.The contrast is as stark as the wind driving snow into the faces of rescuers - wrapped-up families carrying buckets and spades heading to the beach to build snowmen, as weary coastguard officials in blue overalls and hi-vis jackets search for a missing person.On Friday, two people died after being pulled from the water at Withernsea - a town with a population of just 6,500.The victims were 67-year-old Mark Ratcliffe, who died trying to save the others, and 45-year-old Sarah Keeling.Her daughter, Grace Keeling,15, remains missing, although HM Coastguard confirmed the sea search for them was called off at 16:00 GMT on Saturday.Kevin Shoesmith/BBCFamilies trudge through snow on Withernsea's promenade From our vantage point next to the castellated entrance to a former pier, which was destroyed by storms and ship collisions in the late 19th Century, the Reverend Clive Hall, from the town's St Matthew's Church, also spots the families on the promenade. \"Withernsea is a fun place,\" he says.\"It's a place people come to enjoy themselves, even in winter. It's a lot smaller and quieter than Bridlington further up the coast.\"We are very close-knit here. But now we have tears and heartbreak. The mood is sombre.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCThe tragedy is said to have happened near to The Towers, a local landmark in WithernseaMr Hall tells me how the town's five churches have come together, with clergy converging on Withernsea Methodist Church, which has become the focus for prayers.On Sunday, services reflected the town's loss.\"People are already talking about a special service. That will be something to consider at a later point,\" Mr Hall says.Angie Smith, 51, from Hull, is walking with her family. She too associates Withernsea with happy memories.\"It's always been a happy little seaside town,\" she says.\"What an awful start to the year this is.\"Like us, those people [those who died] will have gone to the seaside for a walk and then this happened.Kevin Shoesmith/BBCCoastguard officials search the beach in a snowstorm for the missing person Darrin Stevens' photographs showing the initial search and rescue efforts have been  widely published.Now, he stands - without a camera - on the promenade, reflecting on events, as a woman lays a bouquet of flowers. \"The balcony of my home overlooks the sea,\" he says, pointing to it.\"Within minutes, all I could see was a wall of flashing blue lights.\"Mr Stevens did not see anyone in the water, with the seawall saving him from witnessing the tragedy.Like Mr Hall, he describes a town that supports each other.\"So many people came down on to the promenade on Friday evening,\" he says.\"They weren't there taking pictures for social media; they were there to show support.\"My neighbours brought coffees and teas for the rescuers. People just wanted to help in any way they could. It was remarkable for all the wrong reasons.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCWithernsea-based photographer Darrin Stevens captured the initial emergency response to the tragedyJason Catlin, 45, who lives opposite the town's RNLI station, agrees with those sentiments.\"Even though something like this does not directly affect everyone, everyone feels it,\" he says.\"It feels really sombre.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCJason Catlin says the town \"feels sombre\"Friends David Lewis, 69, and Neil Finn, 63, know this stretch of coastline well, and they tell of the dangers.Gesturing to the road that runs parallel to the promenade, a good distance from the sea, Mr Lewis says: \"I used to be a road sweep for the council and I'd often find pebbles and wood, thrown up by the sea, scattered all along here after a storm.\" Mr Finn adds: \"I've seen the sea come up over the towers before.\"The sea can be very dangerous.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCNeil Finn and David Lewis say the sea can be perilous even to those walking on the promenadeDownload the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this storyRelated internet links",

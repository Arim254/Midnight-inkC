    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liverpool have lost three successive games by a margin of three goals for the first time since December 1953ByEmily SalleyBBC Sport journalistIt would have seemed unthinkable six months ago, but Arne Slot's position as Liverpool manager is starting to come under question.A humiliating 4-1 defeat by PSV Eindhoven at Anfield on Wednesday was the Reds' ninth loss in 12 games - their worst run in 71 years.The Dutchman guided Liverpool to their 20th league title in May and spent almost £450m on new talent in the summer, including a British record £125m for Alexander Isak.However, as December approaches the Reds are 12th in the Premier League and 13th in the 36-team league phase of the Champions League.Liverpool are \"not a sacking club\", according to former defender Jamie Carragher - but how much time will Slot be given to turn things around?'I would be gutted if they sack him' The 3-0 defeat by Nottingham Forest at home on Saturday was bad but the loss against PSV was arguably the low point of Liverpool's season. \"Liverpool seem to keep finding ways to hit new lows under Arne Slot, and of course, that is leading to questions around the manager's future,\" Josh Sexton of Liverpool fan group the Anfield Wrap told BBC Sport.\"He will accept that as part of the pressure that comes with such a reputable job, but now the biggest question has become 'is he the right man to actually rescue a team from such a slump?'\"Slot faced the unenviable task of replacing Jurgen Klopp in 2024 but defied expectations by winning the title at a canter last term.That has earned the Dutchman significant credit among Liverpool's fanbase. There is also sympathy for Slot after a tumultuous summer that saw the exits of key players including Trent Alexander-Arnold and Luis Diaz, an influx of new signings and the death of Portugal attacker Diogo Jota.  \"I do not mind giving him the chance to have a go [at fixing this],\" Sexton said.\"I just think, given what he achieved in such a short space of time and how that had this team so far ahead of their timeline, his bosses should keep the faith that he can get back on that road - back to where we belong.\"Liverpool cruised to the league title in Slot's first season in charge, finishing 10 points clear of second-placed Arsenal.\"If they were to sack him, I would be gutted that the man who brought me such brilliant days watching my team lift the league title last season could not work it out, but I would equally understand and try to trust the decision that had been taken,\" Sexton added.\"I would hold reservations about the people sacking him being the same ones involved in the decision-making that led to such an imbalanced squad as it is at present. \"But if I did not trust the process, there would be no point in any of this, really, would there?\"'I am feeling safe'Speaking after the PSV defeat, Slot said his job was not under threat but he did understand why there was growing noise about his position. \"I am feeling safe, I am OK, I have got a lot of support from above,\" he said. \"It would be nice to turn it around and get a victory of course but if you are working as a coach and not doing well then it is normal that questions are asked. \"I am OK with my position. It is not the first time I've been in a difficult position but it is about time that we turned it around.\"Liverpool's next three fixtures offer Slot a promising opportunity to right the ship, starting with a trip to 17th-placed West Ham on Sunday before matches against promoted sides Sunderland and Leeds.Asked about his conversations with the Liverpool hierarchy, Slot added: \"We talk a lot. They are helpful to the team and to me and we have those conversations but they don't call me every single minute of the day to say they trust me. \"In the normal conversations we have I feel the trust. But I haven't spoken to them after this game yet so let's see.\"'It gets to a stage where it's untenable'Media caption, Liverpool 'lack of intensity' exposed by PSVFormer Reds defender Carragher, who made 736 appearances for the club, said he was frustrated with Liverpool's players.\"I have always been in the camp that you stick with the manager... I'm angry with the players, if I'm totally honest,\" Carragher said on CBS Sports.In the past, Liverpool have tended to show patience with their managers rather than sacking them at the first sign of trouble.\"Liverpool's not a sacking club,\" Carragher added. \"Liverpool are different from almost every club in European football - the manager is the king, the manager gets time.\"But it does get to a stage for any manager at a club where it's untenable. It can't go on any longer.\"I'm not quite there yet, but I know others are.\"'Slot looks out of his depth' - Liverpool fan viewsSean: Arne Slot won the league with Jurgen Klopp's side. He ripped it apart in the summer and look where we are now. They look clueless. He has to go, I'm afraid.Mark: Getting silly now. I have no idea where this ends. Slot's got to have until Christmas, but if things don't improve soon then I can't see him being in a job in 2026. The players' confidence has just evaporated.Graham: Stunned to be honest. Another early goal and Liverpool seem to just give up. I have never seen a team make so little effort in a match bar a couple of players. If Liverpool aren't careful, we could be headed for relegation this season. Absolutely shocked.Jan: Woeful. Disorganised. No plan. How much more time will be given to a manager who is lacking any idea on what to do? The players should hang their heads in shame - Dominik Szoboszlai and Hugo Ekitike are honourable exceptions. A dreadful game once more.Paul: No fight and players out of position. The buck stops with Slot and his coaching staff. Same mistakes week in week out. Don't like to see managers get sacked but he looks out of his depth. Need to change it now!Chris: A decade of solid development destroyed in 12 games. Motivation has gone and it is not down to the new players as it's almost every aspect of the team. Dominik Szoboszlai is the standout player and he is out of position. What is going on? Where are the leaders? Where is the effort? Where is the soul? We are very much walking alone.Colin: We only looked good playing fast and direct. Slot's plodding possession game doesn't work for us, especially with our poor defence.",

    "body": "Track UK's latest migration numbers - including asylum, visas and small boats2 hours agoBBCNet migration to the UK - the number of people arriving, minus those leaving - has fallen close to pre-Covid levels, according to government figures published on Thursday.How does that sit alongside other key migration measures, including overall immigration, small boat arrivals and visas granted? Scroll down to find out more about the latest key figures, and get answers to key questions on a range of topics.Produced by: Rob England, Libby Rogers, Jess Carr, John Walton, Becky Dale, Allison Shultes, Chris Kay, Steven Connor and Scott Jarvis. Graphics by: Jez Frazer and Zoe BartholomewAbout the data*The figure for net migration will not sum exactly to the total of immigration minus emigration, because it is published as a rounded figure by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Figures from government or other official sources used in this report can be revised retrospectively between publications. This page only displays data as it is presented in the latest release.ONS figures for immigration and emigration are update twice per year.Small boats figures from the Home Office are updated daily. Asylum, returns and visa figures from the Home Office are updated every three months. The number of people appealing against a refused asylum decision is updated every three months by the Ministry of Justice at a different time to other government figures on asylum. Immigration, emigration and net migrationFigures for net migration come from the ONS and use the internationally recognised definition of a long-term migrant: \"a person who moves to a country other than that of their usual residence for at least a year.\"Visas for legal migrationData for total entries via visas only includes those granted. It does not include people coming to the UK on a visitor visa or those on a transit visa - whose final destination is not the UK.Visa figures do not show if or when an individual arrived in the UK, but marks the point at which they were granted permission to do so.If someone was granted more than one visa within the year shown, each one is counted separately.The work category refers to new individuals linked to visas and permits, or the extension of an existing permission. This includes sub-categories such as seasonal, health and care, domestic and youth mobility visas.Study visas include all sponsored individuals by approved education providers in the UK, and those on short-term study visas.Family visas lets someone come to the UK or stay longer so they can live with close family members who are already here. It includes joining a spouse, partner, child or parent, or coming to care for a relative.The Other category refers to miscellaneous visas outside the categories of work, family and study. It includes humanitarian routes such as the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme and the British National Overseas route.It also includes family permits for people from countries in the European Union or European Economic Area.Asylum applications and hotelsFigures for asylum seekers in hotels are published by the Home Office under the \"contingency accommodation - hotel\" category.The number of people in all other forms of accommodation includes those in non-hotel contingency accommodation, plus initial, dispersal and \"other\" accommodation.A scale is used to determine how close a local authority is from the average share of the population for an area in the UK. It compares the share in that area to the share across all areas in the UK that use that form of accommodation.Less than half = more than 50% below the average share of the populationLower than = between 25% to 50% below the average share of the population About the same as = within 25% of the average share of the populationHigher than = between 25% to 100% above the average share of the populationMore than double = more than 100% above the average share of the populationFigures on the backlog of people waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application include both applicants and dependants.The number of open appeals against refused asylum applications refers to individuals.Small boat crossings and other illegal arrivalsThe figures for small boat crossings and the average number of people per boat are derived from the UK Home Office's daily timeseries.Entering the UK without permission is an offence under immigration law, but asylum seekers are generally not prosecuted for doing so if they claim asylum on arrival. In some cases, people have been prosecuted for entering the UK without permission alongside other offences, such as people smuggling or re-entering after deportation.The International Organization for Migration (IOM) collects figures for people who died or went missing while crossing from mainland Europe to the UK.These reports are based on  French and UK officials (such as police or coastguard) or media sources, and are considered an undercount by the IOM due to a lack of official statistics.The figures can include people who died in the Channel while crossing, but also those who died at any point while en route to a crossing point.Data for modern slavery only includes final decisions. Modern slavery includes any form of human trafficking, slavery, servitude or forced labour.Figures for other entries without permission are the sum of all irregular arrivals that were not by small boat, including inadequately documented air arrivals, recorded detections at UK ports and other recorded detections in the UK.Returns and deportations from the UKFigures on people who come to the UK but are denied entry at that point and then leave the country are not included in the number of returns in this page.People being returned after being convicted of a criminal offence includes people who are not British citizens who have been convicted in the UK of any criminal offence, or convicted abroad for a serious criminal offence.Returns involving the government include the Home Office categories of enforced returns (also known as deportations) as well as assisted and controlled voluntary returns.Independent returns are referred to by the government as other verified returns.UK migration compared with other countriesSea arrivals figures are taken from the UNHCR European sea arrivals dashboard and combined with UK Home Office figures for small boat arrivals.Asylum applications, immigration and emigration figures for European countries is the latest available data from Eurostat for the following countries:Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Norway, Switzerland and Croatia.Population figures for the UK are from ONS, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency 2024 mid-year estimates, and for Europe from Eurostat data as of 1 January 2024.In order to account for smaller populations and make European data comparable with the UK, when calculating figures for net migration and asylum applications, European countries with a population of less than one million have been excluded.Additionally, when calculating net migration, only countries which include asylum seekers or refugees in their immigration figures are included, these are:Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKate McGoughEducation reporterThe government has hit back at claims that its plans to include the cost of supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in wider education spending could lead to less money for schools.The Department for Education (DfE) said projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) were \"incorrect\" and did not take into account the reforms it will set out in the new year.The government said it would take all Send spending away from local authorities by 2028 - a forecasted £6bn of extra costs.Councils welcomed the change, saying rising costs had made Send spending \"unsustainable\", but teaching unions echoed the OBR's warning of an impact on school spending. Local authorities currently receive a ring-fenced grant from the DfE to pay for special needs support, known as the dedicated schools grant.But rising demand has led to local councils spending billions more overall on Send than they get from central government.The number of young people with council-funded education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which set out the support they are entitled to, has doubled across England since 2016.Since 2020, those Send debts have been kept off local authority books by a \"statutory override\" – which had been extended to 2027-28. Without it, many councils have warned they face rising costs and even bankruptcy.The OBR has forecast that councils will have cumulative deficits of £14bn by the end of 2027-28, when the statutory override expires. It is not clear how much responsibility for paying this back will stay with councils.It was announced in Wednesday's Budget that the full cost of Send provision will be absorbed within departmental budgets by 2028-29, which means the future cost pressures of the Send system will sit on the government's books, rather than councils'.But the OBR warned that no savings have been identified yet to offset the estimated £6bn of costs they said this move will create.If that money had to be taken from existing school budgets, it said it would lead to a 4.9% fall in mainstream school spending per pupil, rather than the 0.5% increase planned by government.But the DfE strongly refuted those predictions, with a spokesperson saying they \"do not account for the much-needed Send reforms this government will bring forward\".\"We inherited a Send system on its knees and our changes will make sure children get support at the earliest stage, while bringing about financial sustainability for councils,\" they added.Full plans for reforms to the Send system are due to be laid out early next year.Until then, it is unclear how the government will manage the struggle between rising Send needs and ballooning costs.Cllr Matthew Hicks, chair of the County Councils Network, said the government's commitment on Send spending was a \"positive step in limiting councils' exposure to unsustainable expenditure\", but said there was still uncertainty over what would happen to council Send debts accrued before 2028.The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio said any fall in school spending \"would clearly have a catastrophic impact on educational provision\".\"It is imperative that the government sets out how it intends to address this issue as a matter of urgency,\" he added.The National Education Union (NEU) has said it will consider strike action if the concerns around school funding are not addressed, with an executive meeting on Saturday planned to \"decide next steps\".Anna Bird, chair of the Disabled Children's Partnership, said there was a \"lack of clarity\" about how Send costs will be met, adding that she was \"concerned that the government is unrealistic about the amount of time it will take to turn round the Send system\". Luke Sibieta, from the independent thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the government had three main options for addressing the Send funding gap:Slowing the growth in Send spending through reforms - \"though changes will take time to be felt\"Topping up the overall schools budgetReducing mainstream school funding to pay for high needs fundingThe government has recently pushed back its white paper setting out Send reforms until the new year, saying it will take more time to consult with parents and other groups.The government is under pressure from backbench Labour MPs not to cut Send provision, and avoid a similar backlash to the one in response to proposed welfare cuts earlier this year.Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott told BBC Politics Live the government \"has got to be honest\" about where the £6bn to pay additional Send costs will come from.\"Either it's going to be a cut to schools, or it's going to be a cut from the Send budget,\" she said.Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Munira Wilson said the £6bn funding gap was \"a damning indictment of this government's failure to get a grip on the system\", adding that ministers \"must not solve this crisis by raiding the budgets of mainstream schools\".The National Audit Office described the wider Send system as \"broken\" in a wide-ranging report last year, and said it was \"not delivering positive outcomes for children and young people\" despite huge increases in funding.",

    "body": "Biffy Clyro 'angry' as visa error delays US tour6 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentBBCSinger Simon Neil apologised to the band's US fans in an Instagram videoScottish rock band Biffy Clyro have postponed their US tour less than a week before it was due to begin, due to a mix-up in their visas.Starting on 2 December, the group were supposed to play a string of intimate shows in support of their 10th album Futique, which topped the UK charts in September.But singer Simon Neil announced the tour was being pushed back to next year, blaming an admin error for the delay.\"Some [expletive] genius put the wrong start date into our work visa, so when we received our visas in the last couple of days, we realised it doesn't begin until after our tour is meant to finish,\" he said in an Instagram video, adding: \"We are so angry about this.\"\"We've been in touch with four or five immigration lawyers, we've been in touch with Congress. \"There's [nothing] any of them can do to help,\" he continued. (Warning: link contains strong language).The singer said the dates would be rescheduled for April or May 2026, and told fans existing tickets would be honoured.However, he acknowledged that fans may already have booked flights and accommodation to see the December dates, and apologised to anyone left out of pocket.\"I completely understand if you want to get refunds and you've lost faith in us,\" he said.\"I get it and I'd be raging at us too. You can't be any madder at us than I am... Thanks for your time and sorry for wasting it,\" he added.Later in the video message, Neil said that the band felt \"slightly cursed\" when it comes to touring America. In 2022, they had to scrap the last date of their US tour when the singer caught Covid.Biffy Clyro / InstagramFans offered the band messages of support and encouragement in the comments below Neil's videoThe postponement of their latest tour comes just days after Biffy Clyro announced the biggest show of their career - headlining London's Finsbury Park in July 2026.The trio have been one of the UK's biggest rock bands since their formation in the early 2000s, with eight top-five albums – four of them number one – amassing over a million sales.Their international breakthrough came with 2009's Only Revolutions - which went platinum in the UK and received a Mercury Prize nomination. The album contained two of their biggest hits: The soaring, anthemic Bubbles; and the windswept ballad Many Of Horror, which later became a number one hit for X Factor winner Matt Cardle (under the title \"When We Collide\").Futique, released in September, is the band's first album in four years - following a hiatus where the band briefly considered calling it a day.Its title is a portmaneau of the words \"future and antique\" - a word the band coined to describe songs and emotions that might seem ordinary in the moment, but that will eventually become valuable artefacts to be cherished and studied.The record received rave reviews, with the NME calling it on of Biffy's \"most personal and definitive records to date\"; and Mojo magazine saying the trio had found a renewed sense of purpose.\"Band kiss-and-makeups can seem contrived, unconvincing; but this one feels genuine and sparky, [with] Biffy's urgent, passionate music oxygenated by time away.\"",

    "body": "Social media companies and the Australian government should be using their resources to remove predators and harmful content from platforms rather than banning under-16s, teenagers challenging the law have said.From 10 December, social media firms - including Meta, TikTok and YouTube - must ensure that young Australians cannot hold accounts on their platforms.Campaigners and the government say the law is necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms that can promote it to users.But the policy is being challenged in the nation's highest court by two 15-year-olds, backed by a rights group, who say it robs them of their right to free communication.One of them, Noah Jones, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were bad things online but that did not mean banning under-16s was the right answer.\"We shouldn't be using the resources and money of these social media platforms to try to avoid fines from our government,\" he said.\"They should be using this money and resources to try to get rid of the predators and harmful content out there.\"Macy Newland, who is bringing the challenge alongside Noah, admitted that she believed there were problems with social media, gaming and screen time in general.But she told the BBC they also brought \"so much good\", such as education, communication and inclusion with society.Ms Newland said that, rather than a blanket ban, what was needed was better education about online harms, enhanced safety measures - such as age verification - and resources about how to use social media appropriately.The pair argue the ban would impact their relationships and particularly their sources of knowledge about politics.\"Democracy doesn't start at 16 as this law says it will,\" Ms Newland said.The Digital Freedom Project (DFP), which is led by New South Wales parliamentarian John Ruddick, announced the case had been filed in the High Court on Wednesday. After news of the legal challenge broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told the Australian parliament that the government would not be swayed.\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she said.Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut children off from connections with peers, while others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.",

    "body": "47 minutes agoSimon JackBusiness editorGetty ImagesNot a single measure in the government's policy-packed Budget will change the growth forecast for the next five years - that was the damning assessment of the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Reponsibility (OBR).For a government that has declared economic growth as its top priority it is surely a disappointment.Worse than that, although the OBR upgraded its growth forecast for this year – it downgraded them every year thereafter till 2030.Although businesses were relieved they didn't get clobbered the way they did at the last Budget - at which they were handed a £25bn employer national insurance hike – genuinely significant pro-business measures were thin on the ground.Little wonder many business leaders are asking: \"Where is the growth?\"Even the sectors that did get a mention as receiving special help – such as High Street retailers and hospitality – insist their costs of doing business are going to rise significantly through higher business rates and labour costs.Business rates are a tax on non-domestic properties such as shops, pubs and offices.The government said it would calculate business rates for 750,000 High Street retail and hospitality firms using a lower percentage of the rateable value of premises, but this lower tax rate wasn't as generous as expected.At the same time, many firms have seen their rateable value increase and face the phasing out of a Covid-era 40% discount from April. The net result is that, despite some transitional relief, lots of them will see significant increases in their business rates bill.An 8.5% pay rise for 18-20 year olds on the national living wage is good news for young people in work and an incentive for those who aren't to find a job, but on top of 16.3% rise for the same group last year, it may put employers off taking on new people.As one FTSE 100 boss told the BBC: \"They are hurting the very people they are trying to help and it will mean fewer jobs, fewer hours, fewer premises, lower growth.\"The cap on salary sacrifice arrangement will hit both workers and businesses, who may reduce future pension contributions, pay rises or investment in growing their business.Budget 2025One measure that got little attention but could prove important is expanding schemes that give tax breaks for investors in young companies – the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trusts – and allow them to invest in companies that have grown bigger.The OBR did give the government some credit for this.A Treasury spokesperson said the economy was \"already outperforming forecasts\" and it was driving growth \"with billions of pounds in new capital spending, strong private investment and bold planning reforms\".\"This Budget doubles down on our long‑term plan to grow the economy and create good jobs,\" they added.The truth is that any government or chancellor's ability to \"unleash\" growth is pretty limited. Most people just want not to be over-molested by tax and regulation and allowed to get on with their lives. On that score, this Budget is a big improvement on last year's.By building in a lot more wiggle room in her tax and spending plans over the next five year, Rachel Reeves has reduced the likelihood we will need such a bewildering smorgasbord of policies next year. Stability can be a powerful fertiliser for growth.The former chief economist of the Bank of England Andy Haldane may have over egged it by saying that the \"fiscal fandango\" - the months of speculation before this year's Budget - was the single biggest reason for growth to flatline for the second half of the year, but it sure didn't help.Ahead of the Budget, Steve Rigby, the boss of large private company Rigby told the BBC, \"we just hope [it] isn't too catastrophic for business and we can get on with it\".Test passed he says - but that's a pretty low bar for a government desperate for growth.",

    "body": "10 hours agoScott PikeThe Ness of Brodgar lies on a narrow strip of land between two Orkney lochsArchaeologists are to resume digging at the Ness of Brodgar on Orkney after 3D radar technology led to an \"extraordinary discovery\".The dig team at the Ness, one of the most important Neolithic sites in the British Isles, are not revealing what they believe the find to be until more work is done.But they say it is like nothing else ever found at the site – and may not even be Neolithic.The Ness of Brodgar – a strip of land between two lochs - was the scene of 20 years of excavations until work officially ended in 2024.Hugo Anderson WhymarkThe buildings previously unearthed date back as far as 3,500BC, with \"Structure 12\" built about 3,100BC The digs uncovered 40 structures making up a cluster of buildings which showed it  was a significant settlement in prehistoric Orkney.However, a further phase of work using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was carried out this summer - producing three-dimensional images of the whole site for the first time.The scientific study produced an unexpected discovery which the team describe as \"totally dissimilar to anything else we've uncovered\".The only clue from the excavation team is that Ness is \"a site that can be seen to be defined by straight lines and rectangular forms, from the architecture down to the art\".Archaeologist Nick Card - who worked on the digs from 2004 and will return for the latest work - told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme: \"We think this is so unusual that it could add a new chapter to the history of the Ness.\"It's at a bit of the site where there doesn't seem to be any deep archaeology, so it's not like we're getting into another 20 years of excavations.\"The archaeology that will be uncovered will be quite different. Don't expect three-dimensional Neolithic buildings. Possibly it is not Neolithic, I think probably later, but it could be contemporary.\"Archaeologist Nick Card said the latest discovery was unlike anything previously found at the NessThe Ness lies just south-east of the Ring of Brodgar, the neolithic stone circle which can be seen as Orkney's version of Stonehenge.The website of the Ness of Brodgar Trust, says it is \"without parallel in Atlantic Europe\".The structures already uncovered at the three hectare site were built in waves between roughly 3,500BC and 2,400BC.Excavation work had been carried out between 2004 and 2024 before the site was covered upThe latest work has again been made possible by funding from Time Team, for a new programme they will be making next year.It will, according to Nick Card, involve \"keyhole surgery\" to open a small trench to investigate \"this anomaly\".He added: \"We always said that when we put the trenches to bed, that was the end of the fieldwork.\"But last summer we conducted several types of geophysics and what that has showed up is something quite extraordinary.\"This was the first time this particular form of GPR had been used in Scotland.\"The preliminary results have just been amazing but we still have to get more analysed.\"All of this then needs to be stitched together and we'll create 3D models of the site which will give us a much better understanding of the development of the Ness.\"The latest excavation will be open to the public for four weeks in July 2026.But buildings previously on show prior to 2024 will remain covered up for preservation reasons.",

    "body": "10 minutes agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterPA MediaHouseholds are facing a \"truly dismal\" increase in their disposable income following the Budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank has said.Average disposable income is expected to grow by \"only\" 0.5% a year over the next five years, according to the government''s official forecaster.National Insurance is also set to increase as a result of the cap on salary sacrifice pension payments and the freezing of tax thresholds, which IFS director Helen Miller said she considered \"a breach of the manifesto\".Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC his party made \"a number of commitments in our manifesto, which we have kept\".Ahead of last year's general election, Labour promised not to increase taxes on \"working people\", including National Insurance, Income Tax and VAT.The prime minister accepted he was asking \"everybody to make a contribution\", which he said was \"fair and necessary\".\"I absolutely wanted to bear down and reduce the cost of living because for most... that will be the single most important thing.\"Ms Miller said the growth in disposable income - which measures the amount of money people have left to spend after taxes have been paid - was disappointing \"especially when compared to the more than 2% per year we achieved across every parliament from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s\".According to the IFS, average disposable income per person is expected to rise by nearly £104 a year for the next four years, under current inflation forecasts.\"Before this Budget, the UK was faced with lacklustre economic growth, stagnating living standards, and a dizzying array of fiscal pressures,\" Ms Miller said.\"The same is still true after this Budget.\"Her comments were backed up by the Resolution Foundation think tank, which predicted that the growth in living standards in this parliament would be the second worst on record.In her Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves chose to extend the freeze on income tax thresholds for a further three years beyond 2028. She also imposed a £2,000-a-year cap on the amount put into pensions from 2029 through a salary sacrifice arrangement before National Insurance payments are due.Reeves also denied the Budget broke manifesto pledges but admitted her policies would have \"an impact on working people\".She told the BBC this contribution had been kept \"to a minimum\" because of other changes such as increasing taxes on online gambling, properties worth more than £2m and income from dividends or renting out property.Budget 2025The chancellor also highlighted other measures aimed at cutting the cost of living, including freezing NHS prescription charges and regulated rail fares in England, as well as scrapping green levies added to energy bills.Asked if she would apologise for breaking her promise not to increase taxes on working people, Reeves said she had made \"fair and necessary choices\" to cut NHS waiting lists, lift children out of poverty and reduce the cost of living.In the run-up to the Budget, there was much speculation about the UK's finances and the outlook for the economy, and how the chancellor faced big gaps in meeting her fiscal rules on borrowing, leading to uncertainty in financial markets.Giving her analysis of the Budget, Ms Miller noted how the OBR's \"overall forecast downgrade was minimal\" and there was \"no big fiscal repair job\" to do.In an interview with the BBC, she also said the government appeared to have ignored its stated number one mission to boost economic growth.\"We shouldn't expect every Budget to solve all of our problems, but I think it's reasonable to expect that for a government that makes such a big deal of having growth as its number one mission, they would be doing more to drive up growth,\" she said.Ms Miller said Reeves could have reformed the tax system to boost the economy and that the government also has \"hard yards\" to do in areas such as competition policy, regulation and education.",

I'm back making TikTok content in my parents' house. Bad news, I can't do it upstairs, because I've just had my second below-knee amputation.\"She added: \"There's a lot to unpack for everyone involved.\"The 29-year-old built a following posting on TikTok, before being cast in Netflix horror series The Midnight Club, her TV debut.More recently, Celebrity Traitors viewers saw Codd share her correct suspicions about fellow player Jonathan Ross, before being murdered on the show.Codd had spoken previously about intending to have her latest operation in an interview on YouTube channel FFTV.\"The way I use my crutches means I'm always up on my tippy-toes,\" she told host Grace Neutral.\"With the second one, it was just the same situation.\"My quality of life, it's never going to get any better from this point.\"Celebrity Traitors viewers saw Ruth Codd share suspicions about fellow player Jonathan RossCodd appeared in a live-action remake of How To Train Your Dragon earlier in 2025.She played Phlegma the Fierce, a Viking warrior without part of her leg.Around the film's release, Codd said she was proud to play a \"strong, capable\" character with a limb difference.\"The amount of health problems I've had the last year haven't stopped me doing anything,\" she told FFTV.\"But I feel like it has hindered me and made my ability to do my job more difficult.\"I've been through it once before, so I think with two prosthetics, I'll be pretty unstoppable.\"",

    "body": "A woman has died and a man has been seriously injured after they were attacked by a shark while swimming at a remote beach in the Australian state of New South Wales.Police said the woman, believed to be aged in her 20s, died at the scene, while the man, also believed to be in his 20s, was airlifted to a hospital in Newcastle in critical condition. Paramedics had been called to Kylies Beach, in Crowdy Bay National Park about 300km north of Sydney, early on Thursday morning local time, police said. Authorities praised a bystander who put a makeshift tourniquet on the man's leg before the paramedics arrived, which \"potentially saved his life\".\"The courage from some bystanders is amazing in this situation,\" NSW Ambulance Superintendent Josh Smyth told reporters.\"To put yourself out there is heroic and obviously it did give us time to get to that male patient.\"The shark involved was likely a \"large bull shark\", the Department of Primary Industries said. Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are \"one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people\", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.The beach has now been closed and \"smart\" drumlines - which lure sharks with baited hooks so they can be tagged and re-released - were being deployed.Surf Life Saving NSW said surrounding beaches would also be closed for 24 hours while drones surveilled the area.\"This is a terrible tragedy and our deepest condolences go to the families of the woman and man involved,\" Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steve Pearce said.\"For now, please remain clear of the water at beaches in the vicinity and follow the direction of lifeguards.\"This is the fifth fatal shark attack in Australia this year. The most recent was less than three months ago, when a man was killed in a rare shark attack in Sydney's northern beaches.",

    "body": "Winter officially begins on 1 December but Thursday has bucked the trend of colder weather with much milder conditions.But this switch is accompanied by unsettled weather with Met Office yellow weather warnings for strong winds into Friday.And it will stay changeable into the weekend with heavy rain and strong winds across England and Wales.It is also likely to turn colder again with the threat of snow and 'frost days'.Temperatures on Thursday morning were up to 17C higher than those on Wednesday morning. And through the day they will be a good 5 or 6C above average for the end of November.However, the milder air - being transported all the way from the Azores - is driven by a deep area of low pressure to the north of the United Kingdom.This brings strong winds, especially across the north and west of Scotland.A Met Office yellow warning for wind here is valid from 16:00 GMT Thursday to 11:00 GMT Friday.Wind gusts of 60-70 mph are likely, with more exposed places perhaps seeing gusts up to 80mph.This is likely to bring some disruption, particularly to ferry services in and around the Northern and Western Isles.Tree branches may come down and there is a risk of some power cuts in some communities.The strong winds will eventually subside later on Friday morning.On Saturday a developing weather system will sweep across England and Wales bringing heavy rain and the possibility of strengthening winds.There are still uncertainties with the detail as there are differences in some of the weather computer models on the exact track and development of this system.Heavy rain though is likely to persist around eastern England in particular.And a strong north to northeasterly wind will develop later on Saturday into Sunday, especially in eastern England where gusts of up to 50-60mph are possible.While the wind won't be as strong elsewhere across the UK, the resulting northerly airflow will bring colder conditions again.Maximum temperatures on Sunday will only be around 3-9C.But, in Scotland the temperature for some may not rise above freezing - called a 'frost day'.There will also be some wintry showers coming into the north and east of Scotland.Further - more temporary - snow will fall on Monday in the Highlands as rain spreads in across the UK with milder prevailing southwesterly winds.After the hottest summer on record for the UK along with one of driest springs, droughts with hosepipe bans were declared in many regions.The National Drought Group met at the end of October where the Environment Agency suggested that England needs at least 100% of average rainfall up to the end of March to largely recover from drought.The good news is that recent months have been pretty wet with data from the Met Office Hadley Centre showing that up to the 25 November, most of the UK has had near to above average rainfall for autumn.On Thursday, Yorkshire Water said that the current hosepipe ban is expected to end  \"within the next few weeks\" and earlier than initially thought as there has been plenty of rain.In September the whole of the north-east England area, which covers Yorkshire, had 152% of its normal rainfall with 90% falling in October. Up to the 25 November there has already been 145% of normal rain.A spokesperson from Yorkshire Water said reservoir levels were recovering well, now standing at 84.6% full, up from 80.5% last week.Meanwhile, Hull aquifer levels were at 49.4% - up from 46.6%.Helen Wakeham, chair of the National Drought Group said \"recent rain is very welcome, but it needs to be sustained over the next six months...to fill up our rivers, reservoirs and groundwater levels\".",

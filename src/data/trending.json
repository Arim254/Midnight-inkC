    "body": "Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Hearts have an eight-point lead after nine games of the seasonByBBC Scotland's chief sports writer at TynecastleMaybe the time is nigh to reimagine what is possible and what is impossible in Scottish football. After this resounding Hearts win in what was deemed the biggest test of their mettle this season, talk of an era ending and a new one beginning may not be as outlandish as so many of us have been programmed into believing.For 40 years the Old Firm hegemony has held. Everybody has become a fatalist. If it wasn't Celtic, it was Rangers. Many - perhaps every - supporter in the land has long since resigned themselves to never seeing a team from outside the big Glasgow two winning the top league. It was just accepted, like night following day.Occasionally a pretender has exploded out of the blocks in early season, winning games, throwing shapes, threatening to upset the way of things, but they've always been cut down by the Glasgow goliaths. And now?Painfully early in the season, it's true. Only nine games played and 29 left to play, as Brendan Rodgers pointed out later, in a somewhat revealing comment about the way he sees the lay of the land. There's still time to catch up was his gist. This is new territory for the Celtic manager.'Hearts clearly best team in country'The evidence of our own eyes right now is that Hearts are clearly the best team in the country. That's all we can go on. They've beaten Celtic and Rangers and have beaten them well. They're out-playing, out-scoring and out-defending everybody.They won this game not just because of the effervescence of their attack and the holy trinity of Alexandrios Kyziridis, Lawrence Shankland and Claudio Braga - goalscorers and goal creators yet again - but also in their togetherness and work-rate and absolute desire and self-belief.On a day of noise and colour, Hearts fans goaded their counterparts with their own version of the Celtic Poznan - all linking together, backs to the pitch, bouncing up and down - when Shankland made it 3-1.They did that and more. Cheering every Hearts touch for a spell, belting out 'We shall not be moved' in other moments. Their every utterance was akin to a 'is this all you've got?' message to their visitors. And, yes, that was all Celtic had.Hearts have now scored three goals in three of their last four games and in five of the nine they've played in the Premiership. Against Celtic, they beat their seasonal average shots on target (seven as against a previous average of 5.7). Celtic's Kasper Schmeichel made more saves than in any other league game this season. It wasn't a rout, but it was emphatic. It was an answer to those wondering about Hearts' capacity to live up to the pressure of their biggest game of the season. They did that - and then some.Derek McInnes is building something weighty here. He knows it but he's got far too much savvy to crow about it. He's measured and meticulous and mightily impressive right now. Hearts are great to watch - and from McInnes you get a sense that there's a lot more to come. More new players arriving, others just coming back into the team after injury. Not bit-parters, but big-timers, or so he hopes.There were many moments that stuck in the mind's eye. The relentless nature of the way Hearts began the game, going at Celtic's jugular in a way that only teams with true belief really can.They got their reward with a goal, Dane Murray panicking and hoofing the ball into his own net instead of making a clearance that should have been routine.Celtic put it up to them in the 15 minutes that followed. They scored and should have scored again, but didn't. They'd regret it. You can't fake confidence. You either have it or you don't. The way Hearts roared back and won was the greatest illustration of their merits we've seen so far.And a signal of Celtic's weakness. Showing Kyziridis the inside and inviting him to have a crack is a fool's errand, but that's what they did and that's how they fell behind again.Making jumpy decisions when under the cosh is not the way to survive a trial at Tynecastle, but that's what Murray did when bringing down Braga for Shankland's penalty.In the preamble, Rodgers said that he was including Murray along with Colby Donovan and Jonny Kenny because sometimes youth has no fear. It did here. Murray was exposed and Kenny was a bystander.'Why shouldn't Hearts folk dream?'Media caption, Can Hearts win the title? Derek McInnes answersIf you were to forget that Hearts - or any other non-Old Firm club - are not supposed to win the league, you can only conclude that McInnes' side are the real deal and that Rodgers' huff and puff champions are in real trouble.They haven't looked this good since George Burley was in charge two decades ago, that particular Hearts challenge getting snuffed out not by the Old Firm but by the folly of the club's owner at the time, Vlad Romanov.Some might say it's unwise for Hearts folk to dream because it's too early in the campaign. But why not? Isn't football about dreaming of what might be? They've known plenty of misery in these parts in recent times. Telling a Jambo to calm down as their team strides into an eight-point lead at the top of the table is to be the worst kind of killjoy.They have not won the league since 1960. Long road ahead. Danger ahoy, no doubt. Pressure and injury and bumps on the way, but these are exhilarating times.And what might, just might, make it sustainable - is that the infrastructure of the club is everything that Celtic's and Rangers' is not.Highlights: Hearts v Celtic26/10/25It's solid. It's focused. It's underpinned by the money and wisdom of Tony Bloom, the Brighton chairman, who has invested £10m for a minority stake in the club.It's underpinned, also, by the work of Jamestown Analytics and their ability to find the likes of Kyziridis, an uncapped Greek who was playing in Slovakia, and Braga, who was operating in the second tier of Norwegian football.The club is now aligned on and off the pitch after many years of being a troubled place. Celtic and Rangers wouldn't mind such stability.People entrenched in Scottish football see things as they have always been and can never see them changing. Perhaps that view will still hold true at the end of the season. Perhaps. The fact there is a considerable doubt is exciting enough for now.People like Bloom, watching here from the stand, are a breath of fresh air. He's already said that Hearts can win the league in a decade. That kind of chat from an underdog is usually laughed off in Scotland. Usually.Tynecastle was alive on Sunday. Another test passed with flying colours. Glorious maroon, of course.Get in touchSend us your views on Hearts",

    "body": "Health leaders are warning that NHS services and jobs in England will have to be cut unless up to £3bn more in funding is allocated to cover unexpected costs. The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers, representing trusts and other health organisations, said in a joint statement that the cost of covering redundancies and strikes, along with paying more for medicines, was not included in the budget this year and will need extra cash from the Chancellor.Talks between the Department of Health and the Treasury are ongoing, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has confirmed. Responding to the statement, the Department of Health said the government was committed to \"properly funding\" the NHS.Cuts to NHS services and jobs could mean fewer tests, appointments and operations being carried out. Senior managers say that demands from the government for significant job cuts in regional health boards and NHS trusts have been made without any promise of extra funding to cover at least £1bn of redundancy payments. The merger of NHS England and the Department of Health will also involve staff reductions which have to be paid for.The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers say that the doctors' strike in England in July led to £300m of costs for NHS trusts, including covering rota gaps. The cost is likely to be the same again during the next planned strike in November, they claim. They go on to argue that a likely deal with the United States over higher medicine prices could cost the NHS around £1.5bn. The US administration and major pharmaceutical companies have been pushing the UK government to raise the amount paid for drugs. The drug companies argue that investment in UK research and development of new medicines could be cut if a deal is not agreed.Health leaders have also warned that progress on reducing waiting lists will be affected if there is no Treasury help in making up the financial shortfall. Some argue that uncertainty over redundancy plans is distracting staff and managers from the task of turning round the NHS.Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: \"The threat from un-budgeted redundancy payments, higher drug prices and renewed industrial action risks derailing progress on key waiting time targets and the wider reforms that are essential to getting the NHS back on track.\"Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \"Redundancies cost money, making it harder to make long-term savings without government support. \"As the government prepares its Budget it's time for an honest assessment and discussion about what the NHS can really achieve this year in these challenging financial circumstances - and about what is 'doable'' to meet ministers' ambitions in their 10-year plan for health.\"A Department for Health and Social care spokesperson said: \"This government has delivered a record-breaking £29 billion investment in our NHS – including up to £10 billion on digital and technology transformation and £750 million for urgent capital repairs – demonstrating our unwavering commitment to properly funding the health service that we all rely on.\"However investment alone isn't enough - it must go hand in hand with reform. That is why we're doing things differently: not just fixing the NHS but moving it forward through our Plan for Change\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBC\"Billions 'wasted' on hotels for migrants\" is the Daily Mail's top story in what it calls a \"new asylum fiasco\". A \"bombshell\" report by MPs criticises the Home Office's handling of the immigration system, describing it as a \"manifest failure\". The paper also marks singer Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's romance, captioning a photo of the pair \"it's official!\"The Telegraph also writes that \"billions\" have been wasted in \"migrant hotel chaos\" following an investigation by the Home Affairs committee. Home Office \"failings allowed firms to reap 'excessive profits' from taxpayers\", it says, citing the committee's report. The paper also carries a splash of Perry and Trudeau hand in hand, with the caption \"Trudeau, madly, deeply\".The Times also headlines on the \"billions lost\" on \"hotel deals for migrants\". The Home Office has \"squandered\" the money \"due to incompetence\", it quotes the report, noting that \"a series of failures by the department\" saw contracts with hotels \"increase from £4.5bn to £15.3bn\". In global economic news, the \"prospect of an all-out trade war between the world's largest economies has receded\" according to paper, after the US said a \"framework\" for a deal between the US and China has been agreed.The Guardian takes a different tack to many of today's front pages, instead detailing warnings to Chancellor Rachel Reeves that the NHS needs an \"extra £3bn to avoid rationing care\". Its bosses say patients \"will wait longer for treatment\" without an \"emergency injection\" of funding, the paper reports. A photo of the \"Epping sex offender\" being led through Finsbury Park by two officers takes up much of the front page after his arrest on Sunday. Hadush Kebatu was mistakenly released from prison after being sentenced for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman while living in an asylum hotel.Metro has \"Worried Wes\" across its front page, carrying comments from the health secretary who says there is a \"growing sense of despair within the governemnt\", and \"warned colleagues\" that time to \"win back the public's trust was running out\".US officials \"expect China to delay introducing sweeping export controls on rare earths\", the Financial Times reports. This follows a weekend of negotiations in Kuala Lumpur which \"raised hopes\" Donald Trump and Xi Jinping would agree to extend a trade truce, it adds. The FT also writes up the arrests of two suspects in the Louvre heist, including one at Charles de Gaulle airport, after \"four burglars made off with eight pieces of royal jewellery\".For the Daily Express, its headline reads \"tax rises will result in higher food prices\". Supermarkets Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, M&S and Waitrose were among those \"imploring\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves to exempt shops from a new business surtax, it writes. A promise from Justice Secretary David Lammy that \"migrant sex attacker will be deported 'this week'\", also features on the paper's front.Union sources say they are \"open to compromise on plans to give workers 'day one' protections against being sacked\", writes The i Paper. The government is \"in talks\" about probation periods with unions and businesses, the paper understands, with No 10 arguing that \"day one\" rights will \"provide financial security for those without it\", it adds.The Independent shares a \"special dispatch\" from a \"secret location\" in Ukraine, titled \"on the frontline with Zelensky's killer drone unit\". One of its reporters has been watching a team deploy typhoon drones \"to hunt down and pick off enemy soldiers in a deadly nighttime attack\" from a hidden underground bunker south of Zaporizhzhia.The Sun reports that Prince Andrew is \"demanding both Wills & Harry's ex-homes\" to leave Royal Lodge. The paper writes that Andrew has told the King \"he needs one for him... and one for Fergie\".The Daily Mirror carries a story about a mum who was \"killed by a black market weight loss jab she bought for £20\". Karen McGonigal's daughters have shared a warning to others about the \"beauty salon injection\".It will be \"trick pour treat\" come 31 October, writes the Daily Star, adding that the weather forecast is \"hellish for Halloween\". A \"400-mile-wide storm\" will sweep in with rain and \"freezing temperatures\", it adds.Related Internet Links",

They returned exhausted but delighted. Mission accomplished.\"Following a trial at the Old Bailey, Bravery was found guilty of attempted murder and was jailed in 2020 for at least 15 years.More on this story",

    "body": "10 hours agoThomas Mackintosh and Euan O'Byrne MulliganWatch: Kebatu expected to be deported this week, Lammy saysA migrant who was mistakenly released from prison and then re-arrested will be deported \"this week\", David Lammy has said.Hadush Kebatu was arrested in the Finsbury Park area of north London at 08:30 GMT on Sunday, bringing an end to a 48-hour manhunt that began after he was let go in error from HMP Chelmsford.Kebatu, who was sentenced last month for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping while living in an asylum hotel, was due to be deported when he was mistakenly set free by prison staff.Justice Secretary Lammy said he would outline the terms of reference for a full independent inquiry into the release in Parliament on Monday.Earlier, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said an investigation was already under way, adding: \"We must make sure this doesn't happen again.\"Kebatu's initial arrest in July sparked protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, where he had been living since arriving in the UK on a small boat.The Met Police said Kebatu was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of being unlawfully at large and would be taken to a London prison.One eyewitness said he was walking his dog in Finsbury Park when he spotted Kebatu being led away by a number of officers.Eyewitness Jack Neill-Hall, 40, told the PA news agency: \"I knew that he'd last been seen in the Hackney area and I thought 'oh, that looks awfully like that guy, he's not wearing the same clothes but it looks like him'.\"\"He wasn't struggling, he was walking quite calmly, a bit dejectedly, he was staring down, he had his hood up, but it was a calm situation,\" he added.\"It was a leisurely stroll out of the park with him with his hands cuffed but he wasn't trying to get away.\"Watch: Moment Kebatu is arrested in Finsbury ParkThe Met said a member of the public tipped off police that they had spotted a man they believed could be Kebatu at a bus stop near Finsbury Park station at 08:03 on Sunday morning.Officers were sent to the area and found him 16 minutes later.Kebatu was seen being led away in handcuffs by police wearing different clothes to the prison-issue grey tracksuit he had last been spotted in on Friday evening. Essex PoliceHadush Kebatu posed a \"significant risk of reoffending\", the judge said during sentencingEssex Police were first made aware that Kebatu had been released in error on Friday at 12:57 on Friday but Kebatu had already boarded a train to east London 16 minutes earlier.Kebatu was also filmed in Chelmsford city centre speaking to members of the public shortly after he was released, and police confirmed he approached several people seeking assistance.The Met Police also established that Kebatu made a number of train journeys across the capital.Officers issued CCTV images of Kebatu at a library in the Dalston area on Friday evening. He was still wearing a prison-issue grey tracksuit and carrying a white bag with pictures of avocados on it.Met PoliceKebatu was picked up on CCTV inside a library in Dalston SquareIn September, Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu tried to kiss a teenage girl on a bench and made numerous sexually explicit comments.The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her. He also sexually assaulted a woman who had offered to help him draft a CV to find work.Kebatu gave his age as 38 during a court appearance, but a judge said he had seen information indicating he was 41.He denied the charges against him but was found guilty of five offences last month and sentenced to 12 months in custody, including the time he had already spent in jail awaiting his trial. In total, he spent 108 days in prison.Kebatu was also given a five-year sexual harm prevention order, which banned him from approaching or contacting any female, and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years.The father of the 14-year-old victim said Kebatu's mistaken release had caused her \"so much stress and anxiety\" and condemned the error as \"unbelievably irresponsible\".In a statement read out on his behalf by Shane Yerrell, an independent councillor at Epping Forest District Council, the father said his daughter feared seeing Kebatu and being recognised by him.Speaking earlier from Wood Green police station in north London, Lammy said Kebatu's victims had been contacted by police liaison officers over the last 48 hours. During his trial, the court heard it was Kebatu's \"firm wish\" to be deported. Under the UK Borders Act 2007, a deportation order must be made where a foreign national has been convicted of an offence and has received a custodial sentence of at least 12 months.Watch: 'Huge relief' that Kebatu has been arrested says StreetingHM Prison Service has instructed governors in England and Wales to implement additional checks before inmates are released by Monday.A prison officer has been suspended pending investigation but a senior prison staffer told BBC News the release was \"down to a series of mistakes probably because staff are overworked and in short supply\".They continued: \"It's not just one prison office who's to blame. That would be unfair.\"A report from His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service said 262 prisoners in England and Wales were released in error between April 2024 and March 2025, up from 115 in the previous 12 months.Asked why figures for wrongful releases were rising, Lammy, who is also deputy prime minister, said the Labour government \"inherited a system that was collapsing [from the Conservatives]\".Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC the arrest was a \"huge relief\" and said Kebatu will \"now be deported\".He continued: \"The justice secretary has ordered an investigation into how on earth it was that a dangerous man who was due for deportation was instead released onto our streets. \"That work is under way, we will be open and transparent with the public about what went wrong and what we're going to do about it.\"He had earlier said the Prison Service was under enormous pressure \"but even against that backdrop it doesn't explain or excuse the release of people on our streets who have no business being there\".Former Conservative Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said an inquiry was necessary in order \"to learn lessons\", and suggested the incident was symptomatic of wider problems with the prison system.He told BBC Breakfast: \"The entire annual budget of the Ministry of Justice is spent by the Department for Work and Pensions in two weeks.\"My constant plea is to try to ensure the prison service gets the resources it requires to ensure we are recruiting and retaining people with skills and experience to make sure these problems don't happen.\"The Liberal Democrat MP for Chelmsford, Marie Goldman, said Kebatu \"must now be deported\" and also pushed for a national inquiry.Earlier, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the incident showed that the UK's \"once-trusted institutions\", including the police and prisons, were \"disintegrating before our eyes\".",

    "body": "Food assistance used by more than 40 million Americans will not be distributed from November due to the ongoing US government shutdown, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the department said in a notice on its website, which also blamed Democrats in the Senate for the impasse.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) is used by one in every eight Americans, and plays a vital role in many grocery budgets. Earlier this month, the Trump administration declined to draw on a contingency fund that would have continued benefits, saying the money was needed for potential emergencies such as natural disasters.Democrats have condemned President Donald Trump for refusing to use the contingency fund.\"This is perhaps the most cruel and unlawful offence the Trump administration has perpetrated yet,\" Congresswomen Rosa DeLauro and Angie Craig said in a joint statement on Friday.They also criticised Trump for providing assistance to Argentina and building a new White House ballroom during the shutdown.According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families, the contingency fund would only cover about 60% of one month of benefits, however.In a letter sent to the agriculture department on Friday, Democratic House members said there was still \"significant funding available in Snap's contingency reserve – which Congress provides precisely for this reason – that can be used to fund the bulk of November benefits\".They asked Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to release the reserves and then transfer other available money in her department to fully fund the programme for the month.In a memo obtained by US outlets, Rollins said the reserve can only be used for \"true emergencies\", mostly natural disasters.Earlier, in its published plan for the shutdown, her department had said it would keep a small number of employees from being furloughed to operate the programme, noting Congress had created \"multi-year contingency funds\" to ensure states could continue to distribute benefits.Snap works by giving people reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy essential grocery items.A family of four on average receives $715 (£540) per month, according to CBPP, which breaks down to a little less than $6 (£4.50) per day per person.The states administer the programmes, with much of the funding coming from the federal government. Several states have pledged to use their own funds to cover any shortfall, however the federal government has warned that they will not be reimbursed.Some, including Massachusetts - where one million people are expected to lose benefits - have said they do not have enough money to make up for the lack of funds.Many states are working with people in Snap to try locate charity food pantries and find alternative sources for meals, and California is deploying its National Guard to help distribute food. The US government shutdown entered its 26th day on Sunday, making it the second-longest shutdown in history.",

    "body": "Three people have been killed and at least 32 others injured in an overnight Russian air attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the city's mayor has said.Two high-rise residential buildings were hit in the strikes, Vitali Klitschko said, adding in a Telegram post that six children were among the injured.Meanwhile, Russian air defences destroyed two drones heading towards Moscow on Sunday, according to the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin.The latest Russian bombardment comes as Moscow has stepped up attacks on civilian targets and energy infrastructure ahead of winter, with Ukrainian authorities saying nearly 1,200 drones have been launched in the past week alone.Officials in Kyiv said the three people were killed when a drone struck a nine-storey residential building in the Desnianskyi district to the north-west of the city, with 24 others injured in the same attack.Damage was also reported to at least three other residential buildings in Kyiv. Seven people including two children are being treated in hospital, officials said.Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022, and it currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.There has been marginal movement along the front lines as fighting on the ground continues, while Ukraine has sought to hurt Russia's warfighting ability by striking its military production plants and oil facilities that are essential to its economy.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has recently called on allies to supply his armed forces with long range weapons to continue doing so.However, he came away from a recent meeting at the White House and subsequent EU summit empty-handed.US President Donald Trump did announce new sanctions targeting Russia's largest oil companies this week - the first time he had done so in his current term - as did the EU.Trump said that talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin \"don't go anywhere\" as he shelved plans for the two to meet in Budapest over the war in Ukraine.On his way to Asia over the weekend, Trump said he had a \"great relationship\" with Putin but that recent events had been \"disappointing\", suggesting a meeting between the two was conditional on a peace deal being likely. Trump has appeared increasingly frustrated with Russian conditions for bringing the war to a close, with a summit in Alaska in August failing to yield any tangible results.The US president had previously said fresh sanctions on Moscow were contingent on European allies cutting their Russian energy imports. The EU has pledged to do so by 2028.Zelensky has agreed to a US proposal to cease fighting along the current front lines so peace negotiations can begin - though this falls short of Russian demands that Ukrainian forces completely withdraw from the eastern Donbas region.However, senior Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met US officials in Washington on Friday and Saturday, told CNN that he believed Russia, Ukraine and the US were close to a diplomatic solution to end the war.\"It's a big move by President Zelensky to already acknowledge that it's about battle lines,\" Dmitriev said.\"You know, his previous position was that Russia should leave completely so actually, I think we are reasonably close to a diplomatic solution that can be worked out.\"Meanwhile, Russia said it conducted a test of an experimental nuclear-powered missile on Sunday, which has been hailed as having a potentially unlimited range and the ability to evade missile defences.",

    "body": "Russia has tested the nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, Moscow's top general has said.\"We have launched a multi-hour flight of a nuclear-powered missile and it covered a 14,000km (8,700-mile) distance, which is not the limit,\" Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov told President Vladimir Putin in a televised meeting.The low-flying experimental weapon, first announced in 2018, has been hailed as having a potentially unlimited range and the ability to evade missile defences.Western experts have previously cast doubt over missile's strategic value and Russian claims of having successfully tested it.Putin said a \"final successful test\" of the weapon had been held in 2023, but the claim could not be independently verified. Of at least 13 known tests, only two had partial success since 2016, according to an arms control campaign group.Gen Gerasimov said the missile was in the air for 15 hours during the test on 21 October. He said the missile's vertical and horizontal manoevreing were tested and were found to be up to specification, according to Russia's Tass news agency.\"Therefore, it demonstrated high capabilities to bypass missile and air defence systems,\" Tass reported Gen Gerasimov as saying.The missile's utility has been the subject of intense debate in military and defences circles since it was first announced in 2018.A 2021 report by the US Air Force's National Air and Space Intelligence Center concluded: \"A nuclear-powered cruise missile would give Russia a unique weapon with intercontinental range capability.\"However, as the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) noted the same year, Russia faces significant challenges in making the weapon viable.\"Its entry into Russia's inventory arguably hinges not only on overcoming the considerable technical challenge of ensuring the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit,\" IISS analysts wrote.\"There have been numerous flight-test failures, and an accident resulting in several deaths.\"A Russian military journal quoted in the IISS report claims the missile has a range of between 10,000 and 20,000km, allowing \"the missile to be based anywhere in Russia and still be able to reach targets in the continental US\".The same journal also says the missile can fly as low as 50 to 100 metres above ground, making it difficult for air defences to intercept.The missile, code-named Skyfall by Nato, is thought to be powered by a nuclear reactor, which is supposed to activate after solid fuel rocket boosters have launched it into the air.An investigation by news agency Reuters last year identified a facility 475km (295 miles) north of Moscow as the likely launch site of the weapon.Using satellite imagery from August 2024, analyst Decker Eveleth told Reuters he had identified nine horizontal launch pads under construction at the site.",

    "body": "We will not 'be held to ransom' by striking doctors, says minister11 hours agoAmy WalkerBBCThe government will not \"be held to ransom\" by striking doctors, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said.A five-day walkout by resident doctors is due to take place between 14-19 November, in a long-running dispute over pay.Streeting told the BBC there was a deal available to increase the number of speciality training places and provide support for things like exam fees.But he said: \"I can't do that if I'm spending a quarter-of-a-billion pounds meeting the costs of strikes.\"The British Medical Association (BMA) said Streeting could prevent strikes \"by bringing credible proposals to the table and not play[ing] politics with doctors who dedicate their lives to the health of the nation.\"In an interview on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Streeting said the strike action had \"little to no public support\", and would be \"inflicting more harm and delays to patients\".He added that the deal, which does not include negotiating on pay rises, remained on the table.But he told the programme: \"What we will not do, however, is be held to ransom and what I will not do is allow those costs of strikes to be inflicted on other NHS staff who are working constructively with us, or on patients in terms of the services that they receive.\"The strike - the 13th in the pay dispute since March 2023 - is expected to cause significant disruption, including in hospitals.The BMA and the government have been in dialogue throughout the summer and early autumn since the last walkout at the end of July, but talks broke down earlier this month.Streeting has maintained he would not negotiate on pay after resident doctors, the new name to junior doctors, received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years.Talks had instead focused on career progression, working conditions and out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees.But the union argues that resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account. They have also said they wanted the government to address what they say is a shortage of jobs after the second year of training when resident doctors move into speciality training.This year there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs at this stage, although some will have been doctors from abroad.Streeting said the current government offer, which would provide additional training places and help with out-of-pocket expenses, would \"be a win-win scenario where together we motor ahead with the progress we're making in the NHS\".But the BMA said the government had not presented \"any proposals to us which will see the real change needed to fix the jobs crisis this year\".It added that it had requested \"as little as £1 per hour more over the next few years\"  in terms of a pay deal for resident doctors.\"Mr Streeting should be honest with patients: we are losing doctors to other countries and professions because they can't find work in the UK - despite training here and wanting to work here,\" the statement added.Streeting also partly blamed previous industrial action for an increase in NHS waiting lists. Latest figures show about 6.26 million patients were waiting for treatments to be carried out at the end of August, up from 6.25 million patients at the end of July.\"We had industrial action by resident doctors, that had an impact and set us back, as I feared it would and said it would at the time,\" Streeting told the programme.\"We've also seen demand outstripping growth in activity.\" He added that he believed the NHS would \"begin to see improvement again on waiting lists in the coming months.\"",

    "body": "13 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterWes Streeting: \"I think what she (Sarah Pochin) said was a disgrace. I think it was racist\"Health Secretary Wes Streeting has criticised Reform MP Sarah Pochin for what he called \"racist\" language after she complained about adverts being \"full of black people, full of Asian people\".The Runcorn and Helsby MP apologised for her remarks, which were made during a TalkTV phone-in on Saturday, saying they were \"phrased poorly\" but maintained that many adverts were \"unrepresentative of British society\".Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Streeting claimed Pochin had only said sorry \"because she's been caught and called out\".BBC News has contacted Reform to ask the party and Pochin for a response. Justice Secretary David Lammy called on the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to \"sack\" Pochin from the party for her \"mean, nasty and racist\" remarks.Lammy said he was \"disgusted\" by what she said, adding \"our country is so much better than this\".Watch: Reform MP's comments about adverts 'mean, nasty and racist', says LammyThe Liberal Democrats have also called on Farage to suspend Pochin from the party.The row erupted after Pochin said she agreed with a caller on TalkTV  who complained about the \"demographics\" of advertising.Pochin said the viewer was \"absolutely right\" and \"it drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people\".She said \"it doesn't reflect our society\" and \"your average white person, average white family\" is not \"represented anymore\".Pochin blamed the situation on the \"woke liberati\" in the \"arty-farty world\".\"It might be fine inside the M25, but it's definitely not representative of the rest of the country,\" she said.In a social media post later on Saturday, Pochin said her comments \"were phrased poorly and I unreservedly apologise for any offence caused, which was not my intention\".She said she was intending to say the advertising industry had gone \"DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] mad\" and were now \"unrepresentative of British society as a whole\".In her statement, Pochin cited a Channel 4 study which found that the proportion of adverts featuring black people jumped after the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, from 37% in 2020 to 51% in 2022.\"Representation should reflect the diversity of modern Britain, but it should also be proportionate and inclusive of everyone,\" she said.On Sunday, Reform UK's head of policy Zia Yusuf said Pochin was \"right to apologise\" but said she was raising \"a very valid point we must be able to talk about\".Before Streeting's interview was broadcast, Yusuf told Sky News Pochin was \"a lovely person\" and her point had been \"statistically borne out by a Channel 4 study\".Streeting rejected her apology, saying she was \"only sorry because she was caught and called out and said the quiet bit out loud\".Asked about Pochin's comments, Streeting said: \"What she said was a disgrace, I think it was racist.\"What we have seen is a return of 1970s and 1980s-style racism I thought we had left in the history books. \"The only way we are going to defeat this racism is to call it out and confront it for what it is.\"He accused Reform of failing to speak for the whole country, saying: \"They think our flag only belongs to some of us who look like me, not all of us who built this country and built its success.\"Streeting also condemned Farage's lack of public comment about Pochin, accusing him of \"deafening silence\". Pochin was previously criticised by Yusuf, who was party chairman at the time, for suggesting a ban on the burka during a speech in Parliament.Posting on social media on Sunday afternoon, Pochin told Streeting, \"I am sorry you feel that way\" before attacking his and other Labour politicians' past statements.Asked about her comments, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said he would not \"call her racist\" and said \"there are legitimate concerns the public have about mass migration that need to be addressed\".\"It's certainly not language that I would use and I don't think politicians should speak in those terms,\" he added.The Liberal Democrats have called on Farage to withdraw the whip from Pochin over her comments and called criticised Philp for \"refusing to call out blatant racism for what it is\". Party spokesman Max Wilkinson said: \"Nigel Farage keeps insisting that racism has no place in his party. \"Now is his chance to prove it - he must withdraw the whip or concede that Reform tolerates blatant racism.\"",

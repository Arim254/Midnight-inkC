    "body": "10 hours agoIan AikmanRUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA/ShutterstockFatima Bosch said Nawat Itsaragrisil was \"not respectful\" at a pre-pageant ceremony on TuesdaySeveral contestants have walked out of a Miss Universe event after an official from host nation Thailand publicly berated Miss Mexico in a tense confrontation. At a pre-pageant ceremony, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil told off Fatima Bosch in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.Video of the incident, which was live streamed, has been shared online. The Miss Universe Organisation (MUO) has condemned Mr Nawat's \"malicious\" behaviour, for which he has since apologised.The Miss Universe contestants, who are the winners of national pageants in their home countries, attended Tuesday's event in their sashes and gowns.Some can be heard shouting back at Mr Nawat in the video, after he raises his voice to reprimand Ms Bosch and repeatedly tells her to stop talking. As many of them stand to show support, Mr Nawat says: \"If anyone wants to continue the contest, sit down. If you step out, the rest of the girls continue.\"Despite this, the majority of the women in the video appear standing, with several heading towards the door.After leaving the event on Tuesday, Ms Bosch told the press the 60-year-old executive was \"not respectful\" and said he had called her \"dumb\". Mr Nawat has disputed this, claiming his words had been misunderstood. He is widely reported to have called the 25-year-old a \"dumbhead\". But at a press conference he later claimed he was saying she had caused \"damage\".His conduct prompted a stern rebuke from the MUO, which has sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.In a video statement, MUO President Raul Rocha said Mr Nawat had \"forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\". He said the Thai official had \"humiliated, insulted and showed a lack of respect\" to Ms Bosch, and committed the \"serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenceless woman\".Mr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited \"as much as possible\" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking \"legal actions\" against him.\"I wish to reiterate that Miss Universe is an empowerment platform for women so that their voices can be heard in the world,\" Mr Rocha said.RUNGROJ YONGRIT/EPA/ShutterstockThai businessman and media personality Nawat Itsaragrisil has apologised for the incidentAmong those to walk out on Tuesday was reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. \"This is about women's rights,\" she said as she left the event. \"This is not how things should be handled. To trash another girl is beyond disrespectful... That's why I'm taking my coat and I'm walking out.\"Ms Bosch later said in an interview: \"I just want to let my country know, I'm not afraid to make my voice heard. It's here stronger than ever. I have a purpose. I have things to say.\"We're in the 21st century. I'm not a doll to be made up, styled and have my clothes changed,\" she added. \"I came here to be a voice for all the women and all the girls who fight for causes and to tell my country that I'm completely committed to that.\"Video of Mr Nawat has outraged fans of the pageant, with many heavily criticising his actions and praising Ms Bosch's response.In a social media video statement, Mr Nawat said: \"If anyone feels bad, uncomfortable, or affected, I apologise to everyone. I especially apologised to the girls who were present, around 75 of them.\"The Miss Universe competition has pressed on despite this controversy, with contestants taking part in a welcome event in Bangkok on Wednesday.The winner will be crowned the new Miss Universe on 21 November.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondent and Michael Sheils McNamee,Business reporterDrivers of electric vehicles (EVs) could be facing a new tax in next month's Budget.With pressure on the chancellor to find tens of billions of pounds in additional revenue, the BBC understands there have been \"conversations\" within government about the possibility of a new levy on EVs.A government spokesperson told the BBC: \"Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there's no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers.\"The statement follows a report in the Daily Telegraph, that the Budget would include a new pay-per-mile charge for electric vehicles. According to the Telegraph EV drivers could be charged 3p per mile, on top of other road taxes, amounting to an extra £12 on a journey from London to Edinburgh. Drivers of hybrid cars would also be charged, but at a lower rate.The paper says the idea is that owners would have to estimate, and pay for, their road usage for the year ahead. If, at the end of the year, they had driven fewer miles they would have a credit to carry over, but if they had driven more they would face a top-up charge.Drivers of petrol and diesel vehicles pay fuel duty, so the transition to electric vehicles leaves a shortfall in government revenues, which are already under significant pressure.Since April of this year, electric cars stopped being exempt from vehicle excise duty, due to a change made in the 2022 Budget. \"We want a fairer system for all drivers whilst backing the transition to electric vehicles,\" a government spokesperson told the BBC. \"It is right to seek a tax system that fairly funds roads, infrastructure and public services,\" they added.However, the government was still backing the transition away from petrol and diesel, they said, pointing to £4bn in support already given, including grants to cut upfront costs by up to £3,750 per eligible vehicle, \"We will look at further support measures to make owning electric vehicles more convenient and more affordable,\" they said.There has been growing concerns about the emerging \"tax gap\" from more petrol and diesel cars coming off the roads. That has put pay-per-mile systems in the spotlight, but there has been push back from some quarters. Edmund King, AA president, said while the government was losing fuel duty revenue, it should \"tread carefully unless their actions slow down the transition to EVs\". He added that car sales indicated that the government's own zero emissions target would not be met this year, and that the detail of the proposal was needed \"to ascertain whether these new taxes will be equitable or a poll tax on wheels\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoYasmin Rufo and Michelle RobertsGetty ImagesHeadaches are something almost all of us deal with at some point.They can last from a couple of minutes to days and the pain can be sharp, dull, throbbing or stabbing and sometimes spread beyond your head to your scalp, face or even your neck.Dr Xand van Tulleken, who hosts the BBC's What's Up Docs wellness podcast, knows the feeling all too well and says he gets headaches once a month or every six weeks and it \"feels like someone's drilling into my eyeball\".While it's easy to panic about what might be behind a bad headache, Dr Katy Munro, a GP and expert at the National Migraine Centre, says it's rarely something serious.\"It's natural to worry that something is seriously wrong, but the chances of that are actually very small,\" she explains.She advises that if it's your \"first or worst headache, get it checked out by a doctor,\"  but if you're getting a pattern of milder, recurring headaches, there are a few simple things you can try at home as well as seeing your GP.1. How big was the impact on your day?Dr Xand says understanding your own headaches can be surprisingly helpful as they  often don't have a single cause so keeping a diary can help you spot patterns and triggers.For some people, weather such as thunder and lightning could trigger it, while for others it might be sensitivity to light.\"The worst time for me is when we're driving in the autumn and the sun is low and the sun is flickering through the trees...it really aggravates,\" says Dr Munro.It's worth noting down things like:What you were doing when the headache startedWhat you ate or drankHow well you sleptThe weatherFor women, track your menstrual cycle, as headaches can be linked to hormonal changesBut, Dr Munro cautions that you shouldn't overdo it.\"I made the mistake of making mine very detailed, which was depressing. Instead keep it simple and maybe write a number from one to 10 to summarise the impact it had on your day.\"It's also useful to track how many crystal-clear days you have, not just the bad ones.Your doctor can then review it to help identify patterns.2. Use caffeine wisely You might think that caffeine is something you should instantly avoid if you have a headache but Dr Munro says the truth is more nuanced. In small, careful doses, it can make painkillers more effective if you are not having too much caffeine on a daily basis.\"Caffeine is a co-analgesic which means it can boost the effect of a painkiller,\" Dr Munro explains, but avoid it in the afternoon and evening as it can disrupt your sleep.It's worth also thinking about your caffeine consumption more broadly - consuming lots of it every day can cause a caffeine overuse headache and if you suddenly stop, you might get a withdrawal headache.3.  Don't skip mealsWhat you eat and when may make a difference if you're suffering from headaches.Dr Munro recommends following a diet similar to the Mediterranean one that is rich in protein, healthy fats and complex carbs which can help stabilise your energy levels.You should avoid quick-release sugary snacks and definitely don't skip meals as that can be a common trigger.Dr Munro says she found her headaches were helped by cutting out dairy and gluten, though that's not universal.\"I also found eating regularly and taking lunch to work made a difference,\" she says.As well as thinking about food, Dr Munro says regular exercise, good sleep, stress management and staying hydrated can also help reduce headaches.You should drink enough during the day so your pee is a pale clear colour and you don't feel thirsty. 4. Avoid painkillers with codeine\"There are lots of things, like painkillers or anti-nausea tablets, you can buy over the counter that may be helpful to manage headaches\" says Dr Munro.She cautions that you should avoid \"anything containing codeine\" as it can make some headaches occur more frequently and can worsen symptoms like nausea. \"Painkillers can work extremely well but it does depend on how severe your headache is.\"If they're becoming more frequent or intense, your GP can help you find a more suitable medication.\"Make sure you don't regularly take painkillers on more than two days a week as this will reduce your risk of rebound headaches.Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

And he handed me a letter,\" Huang told the BBC, speaking after receiving the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering in a ceremony at St James's Palace.The letter was a copy of the speech delivered by the King in 2023 at the world's first AI Summit, held at Bletchley Park. In it the monarch said that the risks of AI needed to be tackled with \"a sense of urgency, unity and collective strength\".\"It was his speech on AI safety. He obviously cares very deeply about AI safety,\" Mr Huang said.Mr Huang said the King wrote in his speech that he believed in the \"incredible capability\" of the technology to transform the UK and the world.\"But he also wants to remind us that the technology could be used for good and for evil, and so to make sure we do everything we can to advance AI safety.\"In the King's address he describes the development of advanced AI as \"no less important than the discovery of electricity\".On Wednesday, Jensen Huang received the the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering alongside six other foundational figures in AI, including Professors Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, who have warned that the technology poses an existential threat to humanity.But US president Donald Trump has urged the AI sector to make rapid rather than cautious advances in the technology, and the AI Safety Summit was rebranded the AI Action Summit earlier this year.Jensen Huang received the award along six other laureates - in the back row (L-R)  Yoshua Bengio; the King; Yan LeCunn; Geoffrey Hinton and front row, (L-R): Jensen Huang; Fei-Fei Li; Bill Dally; and John HopfieldSenator Howard Lutnick has discouraged the use of the word safety on the grounds that, \"It makes us sound like we're afraid\".Mr Huang's company, Nvidia, was valued at $5tn this week. It specialises in advanced computer chips including those which power AI.Mr Huang added that in his view the UK is in a good position to take advantage of what he described as \"an industrial revolution that's happening right now.\"\"It's your opportunity to grasp,\" he said.Large US tech firms including Nvidia are investing billions of dollars in building AI infrastructure in the UK, in the form of enormous data centres, which Jensen Huang has called \"AI factories\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoWill GrantCentral America and Cuba correspondentMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City. In the video, a man approaches her from behind and attempts to kiss her on the neck and place his hands on her body. Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken. The offender has been arrested.\"My view is, if I don't file a complaint, what will happen to other Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what will happen to all women in our country?\" Sheinbaum said at a news conference on Wednesday.\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" she said. \"I have experienced it before, when I wasn't president, when I was a student.\"She added that she had decided to press ahead with bringing charges against the suspect as he had allegedly harassed other women in the crowd.\"A line must be drawn,\" she said.Women's rights groups and feminist commentators have said the incident shows the extent of ingrained machismo in Mexican society, where a man believes he has the right to accost even the president if she is a woman. Femicide is also a huge problem in Mexico, with a staggering 98% of gender-based murders estimated to go unpunished.Sheinbaum promised to tackle the issue as a candidate, but so far in her administration there has been no discernible improvement in that area of violent crime.The incident also comes amid discussions about presidential security and the wider safety of politicians.As president, Sheinbaum has broadly followed the approach of her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in having close and regular contact with her supporters on the streets or in campaign events. On occasion, that has presented security concerns for her team. However, she confirmed in her new conference she had no intention of changing her policy of interacting with her supporters.The incident also happened just days after the murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, a municipality in the violent state of Michoacan, at the local Day of the Dead celebrations.Manzo had called on Sheinbaum for greater federal support in Uruapan in the fight against drug cartels. Around 35 candidates were killed in the lead up to the general election last year in what was considered the bloodiest campaign in modern Mexico.Since taking office, Sheinbaum has made in-roads in improving the country's dire security situation, particularly clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, President Trump.",

    "body": "14 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East correspondent, GazaWatch: BBC's Lucy Williamson taken to east of Gaza City in IDF-led visitFrom an embankment overlooking Gaza City, there's no hiding what this war has done.The Gaza of maps and memories is gone, replaced by a monochrome landscape of rubble stretching flat and still for 180 degrees, from Beit Hanoun on one side to Gaza City on the other.Beyond the distant shapes of buildings still standing inside Gaza City, there's almost nothing left to orient you here, or identify the neighbourhoods that once held tens of thousands of people.This was one of the first areas Israeli ground troops entered in the early weeks of the war. Since then they have been back multiple times, as Hamas regrouped around its strongholds in the area.Israel does not allow news organisations to report independently from Gaza. Today it took a group of journalists, including the BBC, into the area of the Strip occupied by Israeli forces. The brief visit was highly controlled and offered no access to Palestinians, or other areas of Gaza.Military censorship laws in Israel mean that military personnel were shown our material before publication. The BBC maintained editorial control of this report at all times.The remains of Shejaiya, an eastern neighbourhood of Gaza CityAsked about the level of destruction in the area we visited, Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani said it was \"not a goal\".\"The goal is to combat terrorists. Almost every house had a tunnel shaft or was booby-trapped or had an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] or sniper station,\" he said. \"If you're driving fast, within a minute you can be inside of a living room of an Israeli grandmother or child. That's what happened on October 7.\"More than 1,100 people were killed in the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, and 251 others taken hostage.Since then, more than 68,000 Gazans have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry there.The bodies of several hostages had been found in this area, Lt Col Shoshani said, including that of Itay Chen, returned to Israel by Hamas this week. Searches are continuing for the missing bodies of another seven hostages.The Israeli military base we travelled to is a few hundred metres from the yellow line – the temporary boundary set out in US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which divides the areas of Gaza still controlled by Israeli forces from the areas controlled by Hamas.Israel's army has been gradually marking out the yellow line with blocks on the ground, as a warning to both Hamas fighters and civilians. There are no demarcations along this part of the line yet - a soldier points it out to me, taking bearings from a small patch of sand between the grey crumbs of demolished buildings.EPAHamas fighters pictured on Wednesday in Gaza City (image brightened for clarity)The ceasefire is almost a month old, but Israeli forces say they are still fighting Hamas gunmen along the yellow line \"almost every day\". The piles of bronze-coloured bullet casings mark the firing points on the embankments facing Gaza City.Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire \"hundreds of times\", and Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry says more than 240 people have been killed as a result.Col Shoshani said that Israeli forces were committed to the US-led peace plan, but that they would also make sure that Hamas no longer posed a threat to Israeli civilians, and would stay as long as necessary.\"It's very clear to everyone that Hamas is armed and trying to control Gaza,\" he said. \"This is something that will be worked out, but we're far from that.\"Moose Campbell/ BBCBuildings in Gaza City have been reduced to grey, dusty rubble (image brightened for clarity)The next stage of the US-led plan requires Hamas to disarm and hand over power to a Palestinian committee overseen by international figures including President Trump.But rather than give up its power and weapons, Col Shoshani said, Hamas was doing the opposite.\"Hamas is trying to arm itself, trying to assert dominance, assert control over Gaza,\" he told me. \"It's killing people in broad daylight, to terrorise civilians and make sure they understand who is boss in Gaza. We hope this agreement is enough pressure to make sure Hamas disarms.\"Israeli forces showed us a map of the tunnels they said that soldiers had found beneath the rubble we saw – \"a vast network of tunnels, almost like spider's web\" they said – some already destroyed, some still intact, and some they were still searching for.What happens in the next stage of this peace deal is unclear.The agreement has left Gaza in a tense limbo. Washington knows how fragile the situation is - the ceasefire has faltered twice already.The US is pushing hard to move on from this volatile stand-off to a more durable peace. It has sent a draft resolution to UN Security Council members, seen by the BBC, which outlines a two-year mandate for an international stabilisation force to take over Gaza's security and disarm Hamas.But details of this next stage of the deal are thin: it's not clear which countries would send troops to secure Gaza ahead of Hamas disarmament, when Israel's troops will withdraw, or how the members of Gaza's new technocratic administration will be appointed.President Trump has outlined his vision of Gaza as a futuristic Middle Eastern hub, built with foreign investment. It's a far cry from where Gaza is today.Largely destroyed by Israel, and seen as an investment by Trump, the question is not just who can stop the fighting, but how much say Gazans will have in the future of their communities and lands.More on the Israel-Gaza war",

    "body": "4 hours agoHafsa KhalilBBC NewsAFP via Getty ImagesPrince William with Kylie Minogue at the awards ceremony The Prince of Wales has revealed the five winners of this year's environmental Earthshot Prize, calling them an \"inspiration that gives us courage\".Prince William said their work was \"proof that progress is possible\" during Wednesday evening's awards ceremony in Rio de Janeiro's Museum of Tomorrow.Winners include a project for making South America's Atlantic Forest financially viable and a global ocean treaty initiative aimed at conserving marine life. Brazilian football legend Cafu, Olympic gymnast Rebeca Andrade and former Formula 1 driver Sebastian Vettel were among the award presenters.A performance by Kylie Minogue featured a medley of hits - including Padam, Padam and Can't Get You Out of My Head. Singer Shawn Mendes and Brazilian queen of pop Anitta also got the jubilant mood swinging. Earthshot Prize supports eco-friendly projects from around the world, and annually awards each of the five winners with a £1m grant to scale up their ideas aimed at repairing the world's climate.Organisers of the initiative were inspired by former US President John F Kennedy's Moonshot project, which challenged scientists to get astronauts to the Moon and back safely.Hosted by award-winning Brazilian broadcaster Luciano Huck, the awards ceremony was addressed by Prince William, the Earthshot Prize's president.Political guests at the ceremony included Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband and London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan.ReutersThe Prince of Wales and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer\"When I founded the Earthshot Prize in 2020, we had a 10-year goal: to make this the decade in which we transformed our world for the better,\" he told attendees.\"We set out to tackle environmental issues head on and make real, lasting changes that would protect life on Earth.\"There are five Earthshots or goals: Protect and Restore Nature; Clean Our Air; Revive Our Oceans; Build a Waste-free World; and Fix Our Climate.The future king has committed himself to it for 10 years, with Rio marking a halfway point for the venture.This year saw nearly 2,500 nominees submitted from 72 countries. Out of them, 15 finalists were selected, from which the five winners were chosen.Earthshot Prize 2025 - Full list of winnersProtect and Restore Nature: re.green, in Brazil, is making protecting one of the world's most important ecosystems, the Atlantic Forest, financially viableClean Our Air: The city of Bogotá, has shown how public policy can bring lasting change, through means such as clean air zones and re-greening degraded areas in the Colombian capitalRevive Our Oceans: The High Seas Treaty is a global ocean initiative that will set out clear measures to conserve marine life, among other things, and will go into effect from January 2026Build a Waste-Free World: Lagos Fashion Week, in Nigeria, is redefining the industry, with each designer wishing to showcase required to show their commitment to sustainable practice Fix Our Climate: Friendship is dedicated to helping vulnerable communities across Bangladesh for a multiude of things from access to public services, health, education and preparing for natural disastersPA MediaThe Prince of Wales was joined by artists Seu Jorge, Anitta, Kylie Minogue and Shawn MendesCEO of re.green, Thiago Picolo, said that winning the Protect & Restore Nature prize puts the organisation \"on the right path\".\"Winning a prize likes this is validation for us, helps us know we're going in the right direction, facilitates conversations we need to have with banks, capital providers, corporates,\" he said.Referring to the winners as \"innovators\", Prince William called the Earthshot Prize a \"mission driven by the kind of extraordinary optimism we have felt here tonight\".\"There's a great deal we can learn from their determination, their vision for scale, and their unyielding belief that we can create a better world.\"The chair of the board of trustees, Christiana Figueres, said they were building a \"global legacy\".\"These winners are proof that the spirit of collective action born here in Rio continues to grow stronger, more determined, and more urgent than ever. \"Their 2030 aims are deeply ambitious - but their impact to date, their plans in place and their tenacity fuels my optimism.\"Daily Mirror/PALondon Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan also attended the ceremony in Rio de JaneiroEarlier in the day, Prince William met the 15 finalists during a visit to the Christ the Redeemer statue, where he posed for a photograph on the same spot his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, did 34 years ago.But much of the prince's five-day visit to Brazil has been focused on climate and the environment.On Tuesday, he criticised criminals for their involvment in the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest during a speech at the United for Wildlife conference.He also travelled to the small island of Paqueta, where he met locals, learnt about mangrove conservation and planted tree saplings.On Thursday, he will be travelling to Belem in the Amazon rainforest, where he is scheduled to give a speech at COP30, the UN's annual climate change meeting.",

    "body": "8 hours agoVicki Loader, Nick Triggle & Catherine BurnsBBC NewsBBCSpecialist ADHD services for adults in England are stopping taking on new patients as they struggle to cope with demand, a BBC investigation has shown.The BBC has identified 15 local areas that have closed waiting lists and another 31 that have introduced tighter criteria, making it more difficult to access support.Reacting to our investigation, Prof Anita Thapar, chair of NHS England's ADHD taskforce, said the findings were \"disturbing\", adding there were \"enormous risks\" for patients.It comes as she prepares to publish her report into the state of ADHD services on Thursday, which is expected to recommend an overhaul of the way people are supported.ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - affects the way the brain works and can cause people to act impulsively and become easily distracted.It is thought to affect 5% of children and 3-4% of adults, although many remain undiagnosed.Getting a diagnosis and treatment, which can include medication and psychological therapy, can be life-changing, experts say.But NHS data already shows average waits of eight years for adults once someone is on a waiting list.And now a BBC investigation has found a significant number of areas are restricting access to those waiting lists.The BBC received information from 59 services, which accounts for the majority of those providing support in England, after submitting freedom of information requests. The responses showed: 15 trusts had halted all or part of their referrals - some cover large areas and have closed their waiting lists to just some placesIn Cheshire, the service for adults has been closed to new patients since 2019Of the remaining trusts, 31 were rationing care by bringing in exclusions, such as by age or severityOne trust, Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust, is being threatened with legal action for restricting adult assessments to people under 25 onlyIn some areas, people referred for support by GPs can use something called 'right to choose' to go onto another NHS list or ask for private support, which would provide an alternative option if their local NHS has stopped taking on new referrals.The BBC investigation also found examples of areas that are innovating. One of those is Surrey where the local service, which has 11,000 adults on its waiting list,  is piloting a scheme to train a group of private GPs to carry out assessments and treatment.'I find daily life hard'Louise has been waiting years for an assessment for ADHD Louise Nichols, who suspects she has ADHD, is just one of many people affected by the rationing. Even when she was at primary school she struggled. She was diagnosed with school phobia and ended up being home schooled for a while, and has since found it hard to stay in a job.The mother-of-one says it is frustrating to see everyone else managing, while she finds daily life hard. \"I need a way of helping me function to the best of my abilities. Whether that's medication or whether that's support,\" she says.\"I'm hoping to get a part-time job. I want to be part of my community.\"The 45-year-old lives in Derbyshire, but as this area does not have its own service,  she was on the waiting list with the neighbouring Sheffield trust for two years.But she was taken off that list in October last year because Sheffield stopped doing assessments for people who live outside their borders, as it's struggling to keep up with demand. There are more than 3,700 people in the county in the same position.She said it was really disappointing. \"I can't understand why a national health service isn't  across the whole nation. \"Patients at riskProf Thapar said the problems being encountered by people like Louise were unacceptable and showed the \"historic neglect\" of ADHD by the NHS.She called the BBC's findings \"disturbing\", adding: \"There's enormous risks. It's not a trivial condition.\"With the right support, she said people with ADHD can thrive,  but there were \"high, high risks\" that without that support, people's conditions can become much more complicated.This, she said, can include mental health problems, substance misuse, unemployment and getting in trouble with the criminal justice system.And Dr Jessica Eccles, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said services were having to make difficult decisions because \"rising demand was outstripping capacity\" in many parts of the country.\"There are unacceptably long waiting lists,\" she added.'Diagnosis transformed my life'Sam's life has been transformed by getting his ADHD diagnosis Patients who have received support say it has transformed their lives.Sam Stone is an example of that, but he had to battle to get help.The 33-year-old, who lives near Gloucester, paid for a private diagnosis on his health insurance, but his GP wouldn't accept it and he had to go back on an NHS waiting list to get it confirmed.He is angry at how complicated the system is. \"I almost struggle to think about it as a system, to be honest, because it feels like there's such a cacophony of routes that it almost feels like you're constantly trying to hack the system.\"Sam said the diagnosis has been life-changing. He had been on and off anti-depressants since the age of 16, but he is now on medication for his ADHD.He said it was like having a cloud hanging over him removed. \"It's massive, it's huge,\" Sam says.Additional reporting by Elena Bailey and data analysis by Rob England",

    "body": "6 hours agoLana LamSydneyPeter MumbyThe Great Barrier Reef has suffered mass bleaching events in recent yearsThe Great Barrier Reef is headed for a \"grim future\" and will suffer a \"rapid coral decline\" by 2050 but parts may recover if global warming is kept below 2C, a new study has found.Researchers at the University of Queensland (UQ) used modelling to simulate the lifecycles of certain coral species and found that some were better at adapting to warmer oceans and could help new coral grow.Reefs near cooler-water currents were also more resilient, giving a \"glimmer of hope\" to the natural wonder, which has suffered severe climate-induced heat stress in recent years.The study warned that curbing carbon emissions was crucial to allow coral to recover and avoid a \"near collapse\" of the reef.Dr Yves-Marie Bozec, who led the research, said the modelling of more than 3,800 individual reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef looked at their \"eco-evolutionary dynamics\". This included how corals interact with each other, how they deal with warmer water and corals in naturally cooler areas.\"We ran all of those factors with the most up-to-date climate projections - and the news was not good,\" he said.\"We forecast a rapid coral decline before the middle of this century regardless of the emissions scenario.\"The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems, stretching more than 2,300km (1,400 miles) off Australia's north-east coast.It has suffered four significant marine heatwaves between 2016 and 2022, causing much of its coral to expel the algae which gives them life and colour - a process called bleaching, which is often fatal.A recent report found that parts of the Great Barrier Reef had suffered the largest annual decline in coral cover since records began nearly 40 years ago.Dr Bozec said some parts of the reef \"may partially recover after 2050, but only if ocean warming is sufficiently slow to allow natural adaptation to keep pace with temperature changes\".\"Adaptation may keep pace if global warming does not exceed two degrees by 2100. For that to happen, more action is needed globally to reduce carbon emissions which are driving climate change.\"Dr Bozec said: \"The window for meaningful action is closing rapidly but it hasn't shut\".Under the Paris agreement, almost 200 nations have pledged to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and to keep them \"well below\" 2C above those recorded in pre-industrial times, generally considered to mean the late 19th Century.Prof Peter Mumby, who also worked on the study, said they found \"many reefs could persist under the Paris agreement target of two degrees of warming\".\"However, higher emissions leading to faster temperature rises would drive most reefs to a near collapse,\" he said. Prof Murphy said reefs in areas \"where the water doesn't heat up so dramatically because it is well mixed, fared better than others\" and reefs close to populations of corals that can regenerate were also healthier.Identifying areas of the reef network that are more resilient will mean efforts to protect the reef can focus on \"strategic parts\" of the ecosystem, he added.Watch: Can you un-bleach coral?

    "body": "11 hours agoRobbie Kalus,in St Ives and Phil Shepka,CambridgeshireDave Scott said he drove at the alleged attackerA father has told how he used his car to hit a man suspected of stabbing 10 people on a train.Dave Scott, 57, was waiting to collect his daughter at Huntingdon railway station in Cambridgeshire on Saturday evening when a man holding a knife tried to get in his car.He said: \"It was a case of fight or flight, and I just powered away as quick as I could, also taking him with [me].\"Soon after Mr Scott's intervention, police officers arrested the man, British Transport Police confirmed. Anthony Williams, 32, has been charged with attempting to murder 10 people on board a train.Passengers on the 18:25 GMT Doncaster to London King's Cross LNER service were attacked shortly after the train left Peterborough.It was diverted to Huntingdon - an unscheduled stop - where Mr Scott was waiting  in the car park.He said he saw people running along the platform, which he initially thought was \"just a bunch of teenagers who'd been pratting around\".He then witnessed more people fleeing the station before seeing \"a large male\". PA MediaDave Scott's car was inside the police cordon and remained at Huntingdon station on Tuesday\"He was under the light at the time so it sort of shadowed him out and he was just heading straight for me. At that point I could see he had a knife in his hand,\" said Mr Scott.\"He came straight to my car and, if I remember rightly, he tried the door, couldn't get in and he started chopping down on the top of my car.\"Mr Scott drove off and spun his BMW around \"thinking that if I can I was probably going to hit him again if he was up or not, but at that point the police just appeared from everywhere\".He said he was yards away from where police made the arrest, and he left his car in position lighting up the area so officers could see better.After the arrest Mr Scott, from nearby St Ives, said the \"adrenaline was still pumping\", and when he phoned his daughter Helena, it was a \"massive relief\" to learn she was not on that train.Her train had been stopped elsewhere in Cambridgeshire and they made alternative arrangements to get her home.On Tuesday, British Transport Police, which is leading the investigation, said rail worker Samir Zitouni was still \"critically unwell\" in hospital.Rail operator LNER has described his actions as \"nothing short of heroic\", after he reportedly protected a girl from being stabbed. Three other people remain in hospital.CCTVThe BBC has obtained an image of Anthony Williams in Peterborough on FridayMr Williams, of no fixed abode, appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday and was remanded until the next court date on 1 December.As well as being charged in relation to Saturday's incident, he is also accused of carrying out a knife attack earlier in the day on another train in east London.Cambridgeshire Police is also reviewing three other knife-related incidents being investigated for possible links to Mr Williams, including an alleged attack on a 14-year-old boy.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sam Darnold (l) and Drake Maye (r) have had great starts to the season but it's been tough for Patrick MahomesByPaul HighamBBC Sport JournalistNine weeks down and nine to play in the NFL, so time to take stock and reflect on the first half of the 2025 season.No team has been really dominant this year, all of the 32 sides have had at least two defeats and most of the eight divisions are still pretty much wide open.So just who will be contending for the Super Bowl in Santa Clara in February is still very much up for grabs - although a few sides have already played their way out of contention.Here's our pick of the best and worst from the first half of the season.Who are the Super Bowl favourites?The bookmakers still have the Kansas City Chiefs as at least joint-favourites with Buffalo, but after the Bills beat them on Sunday the favoured Super Bowl match-up right now would be the Bills against the Philadelphia Eagles.But they're by no means the only two standout teams in the NFL right now - quarterback Josh Allen is playing great but the Bills are still second in their division, while the Eagles have had a few dud performances early on.However, the Eagles are the champions and have a growing lead in the NFC East, plus they made some big moves on trade deadline day so remain the team to beat.Who are the main contenders?Image caption, Most of the NFL's eight divisions are wide open at the halfway stageThe Denver Broncos and New England Patriots look the most solid challengers in the AFC after the Indianapolis Colts had a nightmare on Sunday - with consistency throughout the league tough to come by.The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are quietly going about their business but have a tough run coming up, while the Green Bay Packers lead the NFC North but have also thrown in some dodgy defeats against the Cleveland Browns and Carolina Panthers.The Detroit Lions will be thereabouts again but also need some consistency while the NFC West is stacked with contenders as the Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers all have six wins and are all in play-off spots as it stands.Biggest surprise packages so farThe New England Patriots are well ahead of schedule at 7-2 after two successive 4-12 seasons, with new head coach Mike Vrabel's side on the joint-longest winning streak in the league with six in a row - including a statement primetime win over the Bills in Buffalo.The Pats have the sixth best defence in points allowed and the seventh best scoring offence so are really well balanced, and second-year quarterback Drake Maye has been the most accurate passer in the league so far.Nobody expected too much from Daniel Jones in Indianapolis but the much-maligned former Giants quarterback was superb in leading the league's top scorers for eight weeks.It all came crashing down against Pittsburgh in week eight, with Jones doubling the team's season totals for interceptions and fumbles, so they need to show who the real Colts are as their schedule starts to hot up.And could the tide finally be turning in Carolina? The Panthers are 5-4 and chasing a first winning season since 2017. Only one of those victories came against a side with a winning record, but it was the Packers on Sunday in what could be a statement success.The Panthers will need to improve on their average 18.9 points a game on offence to make that more than a one-off, but the signs are positive at least.Biggest disappointments this seasonThe Baltimore Ravens have had huge injury problems, not least with Lamar Jackson, but they would still have hoped for better than a 3-5 start.The one bright spot is that the AFC North is dodgy this year and they aren't far behind the Steelers, who they still have to play twice as two of five divisional games that could yet see them somehow rescue their season. Quarterback injuries to Joe Burrow and Jayden Daniels have also hampered the Cincinnati Bengals and Washington Commanders in their poor returns - although even Burrow would struggle with Cincy's woeful defence.Dallas Cowboys fans may be disappointed but would they really be surprised? While Atlanta and Houston will have wanted more than three wins at this stage.Big storyline - could Chiefs miss the play-offs?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Patrick Mahomes was hit a record 15 times in the Chiefs' loss at the Buffalo BillsThey've made the Super Bowl in six of the past seven seasons, winning three, but could the Kansas City Chiefs actually miss out on the play-offs?Their run of nine consecutive AFC West titles is certainly under threat with in-form Denver leading the way and the tough Chargers in second.Patrick Mahomes has improved in recent weeks but losing to the Bills was a big blow, and they now have a bye week off before facing the Broncos in what is verging on a must-win.They have to play Denver twice, the Chargers again and the 7-2 Colts as well, so currently in third in the division and outside of the play-offs as it stands, it's by no means certain they can play their way out of trouble.It's almost unthinkable but a growing possibility.Best division? NFC West set for Sunday showdownIt's all happening out west, as the AFC West has three top teams in along with the NFC West, with the Seahawks, Rams and 49ers all on six wins ahead of a Sunday where all four sides play each other.Arizona go to Seattle after beating the Cowboys and the Rams head to the 49ers for what should be two bone-crunching games.San Francisco have battled away despite big injury problems so you wonder how long that can last, but you wouldn't be surprised if all three of them made the play-offs.Best NFL rookies so farMedia caption, Record-breaking RookiesGiants quarterback Jaxson Dart became the first rookie in NFL history with a touchdown pass and rushing touchdown in four consecutive games on Sunday and continues to thrill with some of his play.He's a great character, a fighter and a leader and could have a great future as the leader of the franchise. He's certainly fun to watch.Bucs wide receiver Emeka Egbuka has been incredibly productive in Tampa Bay, while running backs Ashton Jeanty and Quinshon Judkins have also had fine first half-seasons in the league.Colts tight end Tyler Warren looks to have a great career ahead of him and so far this season only Travis Kelce has more receiving yards at his position.Who are the half-season MVP candidates?Reigning MVP Allen will always be mentioned given his consistency, but the likes of  Maye, Baker Mayfield and even Bo Nix have been mentioned as possibles.Sam Darnold has been magnificent for the Seahawks so has to be up there in the conversation, while his top receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba is on pace for the first ever 2,000-yard receiving season in NFL history.Christian McCaffrey has been carrying the 49ers along and looks back to his dual-purpose best - sitting seventh in receiving, ninth in rushing and first in combined yardage. He can also score from anywhere at any time.Jonathan Taylor is the top rusher, second behind McCaffrey in combined yards and has been a touchdown scoring machine - both of those could go close if they replicate this form in the second half of the campaign.NFL play-off picture - as it standsImage caption, The Chiefs are currently outside of the play-off pictureSo as it stands the Chiefs are on the outside looking in, but only a brave man would back against them finding their way in.The Eagles look to have the most comfortable division lead, while the Bills and Patriots will fight it out for the title with the Jets and Dolphins already waving the white flag.Baltimore looking to catch Pittsburgh could be one worth watching while that NFC West battle will be a fascinating watch down the stretch.The Colts may already have a big enough lead in the AFC South but the Packers are not sitting comfortably at all in the tough NFC North.It's all to play for as we head into the second half of the campaign.",

    "body": "Democrats hit back and a winning message - four election night takeaways14 hours agoDonovan Slack and Gareth EvansWashingtonWatch: US election night’s big winners… in 90 secondsAfter sealing decisive wins in the New York mayoral election and governor races in Virginia and New Jersey, it is clear the Democratic Party will be buoyed by a big election night on Tuesday. It is a far cry from the scenes after last year's presidential election, when the party was left searching for answers after Donald Trump and the Republicans scored a hugely dominant victory. The results also mark a year until vital midterm elections. So with the picture of the night becoming clearer, here's what we've learned from the results.1. Democrats get their energy backThe Democrats notched key victories as they swept the first major elections of Trump's second term.There were joyous celebrations at the various candidate headquarters, a stark contrast to the downbeat scenes after the party's bruising 2024 defeat.Abigail Spanberger won in Virginia, flipping the governorship from Republican, while Mikie Sherrill was elected governor in New Jersey. Both won decisively, securing more than 56% of the vote.In New York City, Zohran Mamdani beat independent Andrew Cuomo and became the first candidate to pass one million votes since 1969.FOLLOW LIVE: Updates and analysis after election nightBarack Obama's former deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told the BBC that Mamdani had \"changed the electorate\" by urging young people and immigrants to vote.\"He most importantly built a movement,\" he said.The series of decisive victories may well boost a party that has at times struggled to counter President Trump's rapidly-enacted second term agenda, and rebound from its 2024 defeat.\"The Democrats are back and we're winning,\" said Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin on Wednesday. \"We've got the momentum going into the midterm elections.\"Of course, much could change before those 2026 elections and there is no guarantee the same patterns seen on Tuesday will play out again.2. Cost of living a winning messagePledging to bring down the cost of rent, food and childcare was at the core of Mamdani's left-wing campaign, but it was also a winning issue for the more moderate Democrats elsewhere.Sherrill in New Jersey and Spanberger in Virginia both made tackling the high cost of living front and centre in their governor campaigns. And it was seemingly top of voters' minds, too.Exit poll data from the major US networks indicated that in all three races the most important issue for voters was the economy and affordability.And tellingly, according to exit poll data from the BBC's US partner CBS News, a majority of voters who named the economy as their most important issue voted for the Democratic candidate in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.It may well give the party a message to coalesce around ahead of the crucial midterm elections next year - and pose a challenge for Republicans to counter.\"I can't see into the future, but I see Republicans losing the House if Americans are continuing to go paycheck-to-paycheck,\" Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene told Semafor recently.\"It's clearer than ever that affordability needs to be the centrepiece of the Democrats' message going into the midterms,\" political communications expert Andrew Koneschusky told the AFP news agency.\"The affordability message cuts across demographics and highlights a major vulnerability for Republicans,\" he said.3. A stark shift in the Latino voteWhen Trump scored his decisive victory over Kamala Harris last year, he racked up huge support from Latino voters who had been a key part of the Democratic voter base for decades.Trump saw a huge 14 percentage-point increase in support from that demographic compared to the 2020 election, according to exit polls. No Republican presidential candidate had ever won a higher percentage with Latino voters.And while he wasn't on the ballot on Tuesday night, there were some potentially concerning signs for his Republican Party. The winning candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey both had wide leads of around 30% with Latino voters, according to exit poll data.There are interesting shifts, too, when examining the results more closely.Passaic County in New Jersey - which census data shows is almost half Latino - is often cited by analysts as a bellwether for Trump's support among those voters. He won it by 3 percentage points in 2024, yet Sherrill won it by 15 on Tuesday over her Republican opponent.Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant who specialises in Latino voting trends, suggested the cost of living and messaging around the economy again played a key role.\"No poll taken anywhere in the country in the past month has anything other than the economy as the top issue for Latinos,\" he said.Zohran Mamdani: From immigrant roots to mayor of New York City4. Democratic differences were on displayIn liberal New York, Mamdani ran as a democratic socialist who will tax millionaires and corporations to the tune of $9bn (£6.9bn), in order to pay for policies such as free childcare and buses.It was a different story, however, in the governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia, where Republicans have had far more electoral success in the past. In those states, the two Democratic candidates were establishment-backed moderates who emphasised pragmatic policies more likely to appeal to voters less liberal than those in New York City.The night itself illustrated the broad differences in the party between its left-wing and centrists, and raised questions over how it will approach elections and candidate selection in the future.Koneschusky suggested Democrats needed to field candidates who reflect the specific electorate, rather than taking a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach.\"In some cases, that may mean fielding progressive candidates. In other cases, it may mean moderate or centrist candidates,\" he said.New York City comptroller and Mamdani ally Brad Lander echoed this point, telling the BBC's Nada Tawfik that Democratic leadership must acknowledge different things will work in different parts of the country and they should allow the primary process to play out.",

    "body": "'England is the Super League of Europe' - how Premier League is dominating eliteImage source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal have won all four of their games in this season's Champions League without conceding a goalByGary RoseBBC Sport journalistUpdated 6 hours agoEnglish clubs appear to be bossing things in Europe as, for the second time in this season's Champions League, five sides from the Premier League won in a single round of fixtures.Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham all won their games this week, with the first four of those sides now sitting inside the top eight - the positions they need to be in to qualify automatically for the knockouts.Only Chelsea failed to take all three points as they were held to a surprising 2-2 draw by Qarabag on Wednesday, but they are still handily placed at the halfway stage of the group stage as they sit 12th.Before this season the Champions League had never seen five teams from one country all win in a single round of matches. Now teams from England have managed it twice.\"In five years' time we will look at this period of the next five years as the domination of England, I don't see it any other way,\" Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague told BBC Sport.\"Bayern are doing really, really well and they can disrupt that. PSG will have their moments, I think Barcelona and Real Madrid are lagging behind, but there is nobody else.\"So following this dominant start, are English teams favourite to win the Champions League? And how likely is a fourth all-English final?Why are English teams doing so well?Arsenal are hoping to win the Champions League for the first time and, while it is still early days, they have made a hugely encouraging start.Themselves, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan are the only sides with a perfect record so far in the league phase, sitting joint top with 12 points from a possible 12.As well as keeping a clean sheet in each of their four games so far they have also scored 11 goals - a scoring record bettered only by Bayern Munich, Paris St-Germain (both 14), Borussia Dortmund (13) and Barcelona (12).Collectively, English teams are outperforming those from other countries, winning 17 of their 24 games, scoring a total of 56 goals - 14 more than any others - and conceding just 17, a record only bettered by teams from France, who have three clubs in the competition compared to six from England.So why are English teams doing so well? A significant factor is the financial muscle they are able to flex compared to teams from the rest of Europe, enabling them to spend more on transfer fees and wages to attract the best talent.TV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.This summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.To highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent this year was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.More money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big this summer to increase their strength in depth as they lead the way in the Premier League and sit joint-top of the league standings in the Champions League.\"Obviously in a knockout competition anything can happen but in terms of money, talent, coaching, facilities and even the talent in the offices, England are the super league of Europe,\" Balague added.\"I am not saying this perhaps with the jealousy of Spanish football in general, it is just a reflection of what is happening.\"Could a record number of English clubs progress?This is the first Champions League season to feature six clubs from one nation and history will be made if all six of England's representatives go through.Back in 2017, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed, making England the first country to have five teams in the knockouts of the competition.However just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.In the final, Liverpool were beaten by Real Madrid.According to Opta's predictions, Arsenal have a 99.8% chance of progressing to the knockouts, with Manchester City on 97.4% and Liverpool on 95.5%.However, the predictions model is a little less confident over the automatic progress of the other three sides with Newcastle on 82%, Chelsea on 80.8% and Tottenham on 72%.Former Liverpool midfielder Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport: \"I'd say at the moment it is [significant what English teams are doing], but it doesn't matter what goes on at the moment because we saw what happened last year, when Liverpool were dominating and finished top of the league stage - and then they were suddenly knocked out by PSG who had been rubbish up until then.\"So I just don't see at the moment, unless you get knocked out, what effect it is going to have and it does not mean the English teams are going to get through the knockout stages because it all depends on the draw, and how you are set up later in the competition.\"Which other teams are doing well?Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Bayern Munich's Harry Kane has five goals in four Champions League gamesBayern Munich, led by the in-form Harry Kane, boast a perfect record so far in the league phase.No team has scored more than their 14 goals so far - with Kane accounting for five of those - while they have conceded just three. It is currently mostly the usual suspects occupying the top eight slots - the positions sides need to finish to qualify automatically for the knockouts - with Inter Milan, Paris St-Germain and Real Madrid joining Bayern and the four English sides in those positions.Azerbaijani side Qarabag are showing that money isn't everything after they held Chelsea to a draw on Wednesday and currently have seven points from four games, putting them well on the way to sealing at least a play-off spot.What will likely be needed to reach knockouts?Taking last season - the first to utilise the league phase format - as a barometer for what is needed to finish in the top eight, then around 16 points from the eight games should be sufficient.It means teams are likely going to need to win five of their eight games, which this season's Premier League sides are on course to achieve.There is a lot more leeway to secure a play-off place, which goes to the sides who finish between ninth and 24th. Last season, Club Brugge secured the final qualifying spot for the play-offs, winning just three of their eight games on their way to a total of 11 points.Who has the best chance of going all the way?Media caption, Merino scores twice as Arsenal thrash Slavia PragueIt is still early days but Arsenal's superb start has them rated as the most likely to go all the way and win the competition.Opta predictions give them a 23.4% chance of winning the Champions League, while Manchester City are predicted to be the second most-likely English team to reach the final at 12.5%. Liverpool are third favourites from England with 11.3%.But former Everton midfielder Leon Osman believes the true test of the Premier League teams' capabilities will come in the knockouts.He said: \"It is great [what English teams are currently doing], but it is only when you then get to the knockout stages, where it is literally one team through and one going home, that is the true test and that is when the big-hitters turn up.\"But Osman added that while it is early days, there could be signs that Premier League teams are now getting the balance right between being able to be competitive at home and abroad.\"We have probably expected this [dominance] for years, but it hasn't quite materialised before,\" he said.\"Maybe that is down to the competitiveness of the Premier League, which makes it hard to combine the two, but maybe this year, they are starting to get the balance right.\"What chance is there of an all-English final?Of the 31 seasons of at least one English side in the Champions League, 16 of those campaigns have seen every Premier League representative progress beyond the group stage or first group stage.Of those 16 occasions there have been 11 appearances in the final from English sides, with 2007-08, 2018-19 and 2020-21 having all-English finals.But according to Opta predictions the most likely final at this stage would see an English side face a German side, with Arsenal (38.8%) and Bayern Munich (27.3%) the favourites to get there.",

    "body": "6 hours agoTom EdgingtonBBC Verify, Washington DCGetty ImagesPresident Donald Trump was swept to power for a second time on the back of a central campaign promise to tackle inflation.The steep rise in the cost of living was top of voters' minds and Trump blamed President Joe Biden.He also made sweeping promises to bring down prices for Americans \"starting on day one\".One year on from his victory, BBC Verify revisits some of the president's claims.Groceries\"When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One,\" Trump declared at an August 2024 news conference surrounded by packaged foods, milk, meats and eggs.Official data - which includes a four-month period when Biden was still president - shows grocery prices rose by 2.7% in the 12 months to September 2025, with some items seeing significantly sharper increases:Coffee: 18.9%Ground beef (minced beef): 12.9%Bananas: 6.9%Since Trump took office in January, the data also shows that apart from one recorded fall in April, grocery prices have risen each month.\"The president of the United States has very little control over the price of food, especially in the short term,\" food economics expert Professor David Ortega told BBC Verify.Trump's tariffs are driving up prices of certain foods, he said - a third of coffee  consumed in the US comes from Brazil and therefore has a 50% tariff.Trump's illegal immigration crackdown may also have had an impact, Ortega adds, especially in farming where as many as 40% of workers are estimated to be undocumented, which is close to a million people.\"As you know, farmers and companies have to raise wages in order to attract more labour. But trying to quantify those impacts in terms of price increase is almost impossible at the moment.\"Diane Swonk, the chief economist for KPMG, believes tariff and immigration policy changes have contributed to higher costs.\"There's no question that those shifts are now starting to show up as inflation pressures,\" she said.But she adds that other factors, including weather events, have contributed.\"On coffee you had climate issues for a very bad growing season and that was exacerbated by a tariff on Brazil and also Colombia,\" she said.Getty ImagesA White House official told BBC Verify President Trump did not control weather patterns in South America and coffee prices hikes were a global phenomenon.Data that tracks the cost of coffee shows prices have risen globally, peaking in February, but are now falling.The same official said the president was addressing rising beef prices by temporarily increasing imports.While grocery prices are up overall, not every item has become more expensive.When Trump succeeded Biden in January, the price of a dozen large eggs was $4.93 (£3.79), rising to a record high of $6.23 (£4.78) in March following bird flu outbreaks.Since then prices have fallen to $3.49 (£2.68) a dozen.\"President Trump's supply-side policies are taming Joe Biden's inflation crisis,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said.Other items that have fallen in price over the past 12 months include: butter and margarine (-2%), ice cream (-0.7%) and frozen vegetables (-0.7%).ElectricityDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to cut electricity bills sharply.\"Under my administration we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months,\" he told a rally in August 2024.Since he became president, prices have risen.The latest figures show average residential electricity rates reached 17.62 cents per kWh (kilowatt hour) in August 2025 - up from 15.94 cents per kWh in January 2025, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\"It was technically impossible [to halve prices] at the time he made the promise,\" according to Professor James Sweeney from the Stanford Precourt Institute for Energy.Electricity prices not only reflect the cost of generation but also the expense of delivering it through \"the wires and the transformers and everything else\", he explained.Prof Sweeney attributes the increase to both demand and supply issues.\"We have a surge in demand mostly driven by data centres. People creating images using artificial intelligence are using significant amounts of electricity.\"Getty ImagesProf Sweeney says there has been a surge in demand for electricity mostly driven by data centres.He added that cuts to renewable energy subsidies and tariffs on imported steel - which raise the cost of building new power generators - have also pushed up prices.Swonk agreed that the AI boom is pushing up prices, especially for those on lower incomes.\"It exacerbates inequality because consumers that have more access to solar panels and renewables tend to be wealthier households,\" she said.In response a White House official said that Trump was expanding coal, natural gas and nuclear power, which was \"the only viable way to meet the growing energy demand and to lower energy prices\".CarsAt a campaign rally in September 2024, Trump extended his grocery pledge to cars, telling supporters: \"We're going to get the prices down… groceries, cars, everything\".However, the average price of a new car topped $50,000 (£38,411) for the first time ever in September, up from $48,283 (£37,092) in January according to Kelley Blue Book, a US vehicle valuation research company.Car prices typically rise 2-3% a year, explained Erin Keating from Cox Automotive.\"Tariffs, which have been the biggest factor in the automotive industry over the last 12 months, have been nothing but inflationary.\"She explained new car prices are increasing by about 4% a year, with tariffs contributing at least one percentage point.\"We really think in 2026 that's going to go higher because most of the manufacturers are holding their fire on raising prices directly due to tariffs, but they're going to have to come in at some point.\"Keating did point to tax breaks for people in Trump's spending bill, which she believes may incentivise people to buy new cars.When asked about the rising price of cars, a White House official told BBC Verify the administration had taken historic regulatory actions to \"reverse the left's radical energy scam and save billions annually\".Getty ImagesA White House official said the administration had taken historic regulatory actions to \"save billions annually\".Gasoline",

    "body": "10 hours agoEd Thomas,UK editor, Patrick Clahane and Rebecca WearnWatch: \"Why are you facilitating illegal working?\" BBC confronts Shaxawan after he is filmed by our undercover reportersA man at the centre of an organised crime network has been secretly filmed telling BBC undercover reporters how he can help to erase fines of up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers.The self-described \"accountant\" is among a group of Kurdish men, first exposed in a BBC investigation on Tuesday, who enable migrants to work illegally in mini-marts, by registering the businesses in their own name.The man, who goes by the name of Shaxawan, told the two journalists that he and his associates could help migrants - including asylum seekers - to set up businesses illegally and \"confuse\" immigration enforcement.Operating from a solicitor's office in Huddersfield, he said he had \"customers in every city\".In Companies House listings, Shaxawan is named as Kardos Mateen, a British resident in his 30s, and has been the director of 18 businesses across the north of England.When later confronted by us, with details of his claims, he denied any wrongdoing.Trading Standards confirmed it had found illegal cigarettes being sold in many businesses registered under the name Kardos Mateen, and the BBC was sold counterfeit tobacco in four mini-marts where he was listed as the director.The BBC News two-part investigation has revealed the sophistication and scale of criminal networks profiting from undocumented working on UK High Streets. Loose regulation of Britain's labour market is acting as a pull factor for those entering the UK illegally, the government has acknowledged.Shaxawan made several claims to our reporters:He could set up a company and provide bank cards and a card machine to accept payments from customers for one of our undercover reporters, believing him to be an asylum seekerHis network could \"confuse\" Immigration Enforcement teams which \"won't have the time\" to check detailsFake directors would be paid to register mini-marts in their own names, while illegal workers, including asylum seekers, would actually run the businessesIn separate deals, other people referred to as \"ghost names\" would be paid to put their names to large fines for illegal workingAn \"English woman\" in the network would help reduce hefty fines to \"zero\" and deal with other issues like electricity, gas and bailiffsOur reporters also spoke to a paralegal, with Shaxawan present, who offered to \"make documents\", including \"business agreements\", to avoid fines.'I'll make sure you have no issues'It took months to set up the first meeting with Shaxawan.He pulled up at a busy Manchester retail park in a white 4x4 BMW, in the belief he was meeting an asylum seeker who was looking to run a mini-mart and sell illegal cigarettes.In fact, he was meeting Saman (not his real name), a Kurdish journalist working undercover for the BBC.In a cafe, Shaxawan freely shared details of what he and his associates were able to offer: \"We are a group. Each of us provides a service and works together,\" he said.He explained how he worked with an \"English woman who dealt with electricity, gas and bailiffs\". And when Immigration Enforcement issues a fine, he added, \"she makes it zero\".\"I will… set up your company, provide the [card] machine, get you electricity, speak to your landlord,\" Shaxawan assured him. \"I'll make sure you have no issues.\"Shaxawan told our reporter he could help him set-up a mini-mart illegallyHe told Saman that he should register a mini-mart business in the name of someone else - what is sometimes known as a \"ghost director\". This would cost £400 per month, and getting access to a business bank card would require a one-off payment of £140, he said.The ghost director would be the one to \"take the risk\" if the shop was raided by law enforcement and fines issued, he explained.\"That's why you're paying,\" he said.To show he was genuine and to provide reassurance, Shaxawan called someone he said could act as ghost director.Saman explained to the man on the phone that he did not have asylum status.\"Don't worry\" came the reply. \"As Mr Shaxawan says, send the money at the end of the month.\"ID documents sent to Saman by phone swiftly after his meeting with Shaxawan, revealed that the potential ghost director was a 28-year-old from Iran called Bryar Mohammed Zada.Mr Zada has racked up company directorships for 20 car washes and mini-marts from Newcastle upon Tyne to Essex in the past 12 months, according to Companies House records.Undercover journalists found illegal cigarettes being sold at four of Mr Zada's businesses.Mr Zada did not respond to the BBC's questions.Criminal network behind UK mini-marts enables migrants to work illegally - BBC investigationSaman later called Shaxawan asking for a second meeting, and Shaxawan suggested they meet at RKS Solicitors in Huddersfield.The firm is registered with the Law Society and has branches in Dewsbury and Sheffield.The meeting was arranged on the premise Saman needed help to deal with an illegal working fine which had been given to a family member.There is no mention of the names \"Shaxawan\" or \"Mateen\" on the firm's website.But Saman had called Shaxawan when he was outside the solicitors, and Shaxawan opened the front door, and welcomed him in.He led our reporter upstairs to an office, where he outlined how Saman's family member could avoid the fine, transferring company details to someone else for a fee.RKS Solicitors told the BBC it had no connection to any alleged immigration or fine-related misconduct.Fines turned to 'zero'We later got our second undercover reporter, \"Ali\", who is also Kurdish, to investigate further by calling the same RKS Solicitors branch - but without mentioning Shaxawan.Posing as a Kurdish mini-mart owner, he told the woman who answered the phone that he had received a £60,000 fine from Immigration Enforcement for employing two people without the right to work.He was given an appointment with Zohaib Hussain, who is listed on RKS's website as a paralegal - someone who can advise on legal matters but is not a qualified solicitor and works under supervision.As Ali was arriving for his appointment with Mr Hussain at the RKS offices, he came across Shaxawan outside. On the street, Shaxawan repeated the claim he had made to Saman - that he could make fines go to \"zero\" with no comeback from authorities.Shaxawan again referred to the \"English woman\" he mentioned in the earlier meeting, and said she could make sure that fines for illegal working were reassigned to other people, as if they were the culpable business owner.Shaxawan said these would be Hungarians who \"live nearby\". They would be paid between £2,000-£3,000 and their names would be used to assume liability for the fines.He did not give any more details, but an immigration lawyer we spoke to suggested this could work much like receiving a speeding fine, and giving the name of someone else on the paperwork as the person who was driving - and therefore liable to pay the penalty.Shaxawan said the overall cost to Ali would be about £4,600 per illegal worker. He said he had done this successfully in \"Manchester, Birmingham, Blackpool and Leeds\", with the process usually taking about four weeks.He added Ali's company would then need to be closed, reopened and re-registered under a new name.Ali was then let into the RKS branch, and Shaxawan came inside too. Inside an office, Shaxawan showed him documents on his phone detailing the people he claimed to have helped before.Shaxawan claimed the scam would confuse Immigration Enforcement officers who would not have time to check the details.Ali was then introduced to the paralegal, Zohaib Hussain. Shaxawan stayed in the room throughout the meeting.Watch: Undercover filming of alleged negotiation to fix a fineSpeaking quickly and in a hushed tone, Mr Hussain fired questions at our reporter about his cover story - the mini-mart and the immigration fine.\"How many illegal workers? So how much is the fine? How many times did they catch you?\"Then, with a chuckle, he asked what was sold in the mini-mart: \"Do you sell vapes? Legal or illegal? Bit of both as well?\"When Ali said his mini-mart was registered under someone else's name, Mr Hussain said: \"Very clever then, already very clever.\"The first step, Mr Hussain said, would be to deal with the fine.If Ali was not let off the fine, he continued, \"we will look at certain other things that we have to do as precautions\".\"Sometimes we might have to make documents,\" said Mr Hussain, such as \"business agreements\".Ali then asked if the fine would be transferred to someone else's name. Mr Hussain said that would be \"the last resort.\"Before the meeting ended, Mr Hussain warned that the immigration authorities would want to jump on the fine straight away - making a cutting-motion across his throat.He said his charges would be £3,500 and he \"would look after us\". He then asked Ali to share any future Immigration Enforcement letters with Shaxawan.Immigration lawyer Bryony Rest says it was likely \"fraud and immigration offences\" were taking placeWe showed our undercover filming and translations to senior immigration lawyer Bryony Rest, who told us Hussain was \"clearly offering to falsify documents\".There were \"likely fraud and immigration offences\" taking place, she said, and she would expect law enforcement to investigate.When we later contacted Mr Hussain for comment he replied by email saying he denied \"all allegations, insinuations, and claims\" we had put to him.\"For clarity, the individual named in your correspondence, Mr Shaxawan Jawad, is not associated with me in any capacity; professional, personal, or otherwise.\"In a statement to the BBC, RKS Solicitors said the company was carrying out an internal review and \"the individual concerned\" had been suspended pending further investigation.\"We are already informing\" the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), it added.\"Mr Hussain is employed as a paralegal under strict supervision… The individual is not authorised or instructed to provide immigration and tax advice.\"The firm did not comment on Shaxawan Jawad. It said it did not condone unlawful conduct and was committed to the \"highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and public service\".Shaxawan, otherwise known as Kardos Mateen, told us by email that he categorically denied \"every allegation, insinuation and claim made\" in our reporting, and said that he was \"not employed by, associated with, or acting on behalf of RKS Solicitors in any capacity\".Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the Home Office would investigate the BBC's findings. \"Illegal working and linked organised criminality creates an incentive for people to come here illegally. We will not stand for it,\" she said. Additional reporting Phill Edwards and Kirstie Brewer",

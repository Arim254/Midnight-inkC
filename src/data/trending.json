    "body": "A woman has died and a man has been seriously injured after they were attacked by a shark while swimming at a remote beach in the Australian state of New South Wales.Police said the woman, believed to be aged in her 20s, died at the scene, while the man, also believed to be in his 20s, was airlifted to a hospital in Newcastle in critical condition. Paramedics had been called to Kylies Beach, in Crowdy Bay National Park about 300km north of Sydney, early on Thursday morning local time, police said. Authorities praised a bystander who put a makeshift tourniquet on the man's leg before the paramedics arrived, which \"potentially saved his life\".\"The courage from some bystanders is amazing in this situation,\" NSW Ambulance Superintendent Josh Smyth told reporters.\"To put yourself out there is heroic and obviously it did give us time to get to that male patient.\"The shark involved was likely a \"large bull shark\", the Department of Primary Industries said. Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are \"one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people\", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.The beach has now been closed and \"smart\" drumlines - which lure sharks with baited hooks so they can be tagged and re-released - were being deployed.Surf Life Saving NSW said surrounding beaches would also be closed for 24 hours while drones surveilled the area.\"This is a terrible tragedy and our deepest condolences go to the families of the woman and man involved,\" Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steve Pearce said.\"For now, please remain clear of the water at beaches in the vicinity and follow the direction of lifeguards.\"This is the fifth fatal shark attack in Australia this year. The most recent was less than three months ago, when a man was killed in a rare shark attack in Sydney's northern beaches.",

    "body": "6 hours agoScott PikeThe Ness of Brodgar lies on a narrow strip of land between two Orkney lochsArchaeologists are to resume digging at the Ness of Brodgar on Orkney after 3D radar technology led to an \"extraordinary discovery\".The dig team at the Ness, one of the most important Neolithic sites in the British Isles, are not revealing what they believe the find to be until more work is done.But they say it is like nothing else ever found at the site – and may not even be Neolithic.The Ness of Brodgar – a strip of land between two lochs - was the scene of 20 years of excavations until work officially ended in 2024.Hugo Anderson WhymarkThe buildings previously unearthed date back as far as 3,500BC, with \"Structure 12\" built about 3,100BC The digs uncovered 40 structures making up a cluster of buildings which showed it  was a significant settlement in prehistoric Orkney.However, a further phase of work using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was carried out this summer - producing three-dimensional images of the whole site for the first time.The scientific study produced an unexpected discovery which the team describe as \"totally dissimilar to anything else we've uncovered\".The only clue from the excavation team is that Ness is \"a site that can be seen to be defined by straight lines and rectangular forms, from the architecture down to the art\".Archaeologist Nick Card - who worked on the digs from 2004 and will return for the latest work - told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme: \"We think this is so unusual that it could add a new chapter to the history of the Ness.\"It's at a bit of the site where there doesn't seem to be any deep archaeology, so it's not like we're getting into another 20 years of excavations.\"The archaeology that will be uncovered will be quite different. Don't expect three-dimensional Neolithic buildings. Possibly it is not Neolithic, I think probably later, but it could be contemporary.\"Archaeologist Nick Card said the latest discovery was unlike anything previously found at the NessThe Ness lies just south-east of the Ring of Brodgar, the neolithic stone circle which can be seen as Orkney's version of Stonehenge.The website of the Ness of Brodgar Trust, says it is \"without parallel in Atlantic Europe\".The structures already uncovered at the three hectare site were built in waves between roughly 3,500BC and 2,400BC.Excavation work had been carried out between 2004 and 2024 before the site was covered upThe latest work has again been made possible by funding from Time Team, for a new programme they will be making next year.It will, according to Nick Card, involve \"keyhole surgery\" to open a small trench to investigate \"this anomaly\".He added: \"We always said that when we put the trenches to bed, that was the end of the fieldwork.\"But last summer we conducted several types of geophysics and what that has showed up is something quite extraordinary.\"This was the first time this particular form of GPR had been used in Scotland.\"The preliminary results have just been amazing but we still have to get more analysed.\"All of this then needs to be stitched together and we'll create 3D models of the site which will give us a much better understanding of the development of the Ness.\"The latest excavation will be open to the public for four weeks in July 2026.But buildings previously on show prior to 2024 will remain covered up for preservation reasons.",

I'm back making TikTok content in my parents' house. Bad news, I can't do it upstairs, because I've just had my second below-knee amputation.\"She added: \"There's a lot to unpack for everyone involved.\"The 29-year-old built a following posting on TikTok, before being cast in Netflix horror series The Midnight Club, her TV debut.More recently, Celebrity Traitors viewers saw Codd share her correct suspicions about fellow player Jonathan Ross, before being murdered on the show.Codd had spoken previously about intending to have her latest operation in an interview on YouTube channel FFTV.\"The way I use my crutches means I'm always up on my tippy-toes,\" she told host Grace Neutral.\"With the second one, it was just the same situation.\"My quality of life, it's never going to get any better from this point.\"Celebrity Traitors viewers saw Ruth Codd share suspicions about fellow player Jonathan RossCodd appeared in a live-action remake of How To Train Your Dragon earlier in 2025.She played Phlegma the Fierce, a Viking warrior without part of her leg.Around the film's release, Codd said she was proud to play a \"strong, capable\" character with a limb difference.\"The amount of health problems I've had the last year haven't stopped me doing anything,\" she told FFTV.\"But I feel like it has hindered me and made my ability to do my job more difficult.\"I've been through it once before, so I think with two prosthetics, I'll be pretty unstoppable.\"",

According to witnesses, there was nothing to suggest that hours later, 134 people - including babies, children and the elderly - out to watch Liverpool FC's victory parade would become victims of his \"act of calculated violence\". After months of denials, Doyle changed his pleas to guilty at Liverpool Crown Court, moments before the prosecution was set to open its case.The former Royal Marines Commando turned cyber security expert is now facing many years in prison after admitting multiple counts of causing and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.According to people who knew Doyle, he shunned drugs and alcohol, was heavily into running and cycling and was well-liked by his neighbours - stopping for chats as he walked his dog around the estate.  That picture stands in stark contrast to what police and prosecutors were preparing to argue in front of a jury, moments before Doyle unexpectedly folded on Wednesday.Act of 'calculated violence'Footage of the incident was shared onlineAccording to Chief Crown Prosecutor Sarah Hammond, speaking after the hearing, the guilty pleas meant Doyle had \"finally accepted that he intentionally drove into crowds of innocent people\". \"Dashcam footage from Doyle's vehicle shows that as he approached Dale Street and Water Street, he became increasingly agitated by the crowds,\" she said.\"Driving a vehicle into a crowd is an act of calculated violence. This was not a momentary lapse by Paul Doyle - it was a choice he made that day and it turned celebration into mayhem.\"Neighbours say Doyle seemed 'genuinely nice' man  In the quiet Croxteth cul-de-sac where Doyle moved in with his wife Alison, a local teacher, and three sons about 10 years ago, residents were mystified at how a \"very good neighbour\" had come to cause such carnage on 26 May. \"He had been out in the front garden all that morning messing with the trees, he was always out gardening,\" said one woman living nearby, who did not wish to be named.\"He genuinely seemed like a nice man.\"I was going out with my son and he said 'hello how are you?' and so on. He always let on.\"Asked if anything seemed unusual with his demeanor that morning, she said: \"Nothing at all.\"Neighbours in Burghill Road said they recognised the Ford Galaxy Titanium on the news after footage of the chaos on Water Street began to filter through. \"I couldn't believe it\", one said. \"I didn't want to watch. I think maybe he panicked?\" One man said: \"His wife had come out the next morning and one of our other neighbours asked her 'was that your car?'\"She burst into tears and said 'yes', and you didn't really see her after that.\"I feel sorry for them, it's not their fault and it's ruined their lives.\"No signs of explosive temper, say colleaguesHandoutPaul Doyle, pictured in 2005, was described as \"a mentor\" by a former colleagueOne former work colleague, who met Doyle when they worked for an IT firm in Merseyside around 13 years ago, described bonding with Doyle over their shared military background and told the BBC: \"He was a mentor to me really. \"I was new to my career, I was exploring avenues on what I wanted to do, and he was a great teacher and mentor, with a great sense of humour. \"We both share military background so I think we had a shared humour.\"Another former colleague at a separate Liverpool company, who worked with Doyle back in 2005, described him as \"very competitive\". HandoutPaul Doyle, pictured here in 2005, was described as 'friendly, chatty and competitive' by his former colleaguesHe said he travelled to Kenya with Doyle on a group excursion to trek up Mount Kilimanjaro in neighbouring Tanzania, claiming \"when he did anything he always wanted to do it the best way.\"When we were up there, coming down, I think a couple of French guys started running down and he didn't want them to beat him so he ran down after them.\"He barely broke a sweat.\" Both former colleagues said they were never aware of Doyle ever drinking heavily or using drugs, and had no sense he had the kind of explosive temper that led to the events in May. In total Doyle admitted 31 offences, including 17 of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, nine of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, three of wounding with intent, one of dangerous driving and one of affray. The charges related to 29 victims, aged from six-month-old Teddy Eveson to 77-year-old Susan Passey. Sentencing will begin on 15 December.

    "body": "Biffy Clyro 'angry' as visa error delays US tour2 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentBBCSinger Simon Neil apologised to the band's US fans in an Instagram videoScottish rock band Biffy Clyro have postponed their US tour less than a week before it was due to begin, due to a mix-up in their visas.Starting on 2 December, the group were supposed to play a string of intimate shows in support of their 10th album Futique, which topped the UK charts in September.But singer Simon Neil announced the tour was being pushed back to next year, blaming an admin error for the delay.\"Some [expletive] genius put the wrong start date into our work visa, so when we received our visas in the last couple of days, we realised it doesn't begin until after our tour is meant to finish,\" he said in an Instagram video, adding: \"We are so angry about this.\"\"We've been in touch with four or five immigration lawyers, we've been in touch with Congress. \"There's [nothing] any of them can do to help,\" he continued. (Warning: link contains strong language).The singer said the dates would be rescheduled for April or May 2026, and told fans existing tickets would be honoured.However, he acknowledged that fans may already have booked flights and accommodation to see the December dates, and apologised to anyone left out of pocket.\"I completely understand if you want to get refunds and you've lost faith in us,\" he said.\"I get it and I'd be raging at us too. You can't be any madder at us than I am... Thanks for your time and sorry for wasting it,\" he added.Later in the video message, Neil said that the band felt \"slightly cursed\" when it comes to touring America. In 2022, they had to scrap the last date of their US tour when the singer caught Covid.Biffy Clyro / InstagramFans offered the band messages of support and encouragement in the comments below Neil's videoThe postponement of their latest tour comes just days after Biffy Clyro announced the biggest show of their career - headlining London's Finsbury Park in July 2026.The trio have been one of the UK's biggest rock bands since their formation in the early 2000s, with eight top-five albums – four of them number one – amassing over a million sales.Their international breakthrough came with 2009's Only Revolutions - which went platinum in the UK and received a Mercury Prize nomination. The album contained two of their biggest hits: The soaring, anthemic Bubbles; and the windswept ballad Many Of Horror, which later became a number one hit for X Factor winner Matt Cardle (under the title \"When We Collide\").Futique, released in September, is the band's first album in four years - following a hiatus where the band briefly considered calling it a day.Its title is a portmaneau of the words \"future and antique\" - a word the band coined to describe songs and emotions that might seem ordinary in the moment, but that will eventually become valuable artefacts to be cherished and studied.The record received rave reviews, with the NME calling it on of Biffy's \"most personal and definitive records to date\"; and Mojo magazine saying the trio had found a renewed sense of purpose.\"Band kiss-and-makeups can seem contrived, unconvincing; but this one feels genuine and sparky, [with] Biffy's urgent, passionate music oxygenated by time away.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoJames ChaterWatch: US President Donald Trump says alleged gunman was Afghan nationalThe US has suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, after an Afghan man was identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services said the decision was made pending a review of \"security and vetting protocols\".The suspect of Wednesday's shooting, which left two National Guard members critically injured, is said to have arrived in the US from Afghanistan in September 2021.US President Donald Trump said the attack was an \"act of terror\", adding that he would take steps to remove foreigners \"from any country who does not belong here\". Tens of thousands of Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections following the chaotic US withdrawal from the country in 2021 under former President Joe Biden.The Department of Homeland Security named the suspect in a press release as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, \"a criminal alien from Afghanistan\". It said Lakanwal had entered the US during the presidency of Joe Biden in September 2021, under a programme for Afghans named called Operation Allies Welcome.At the time, the Taliban had taken back control of Afghanistan following a chaotic withdrawal of US forces.  An official told the BBC's US news partner CBS that Lakanwal had applied for asylum in 2024, and that his application had been granted earlier this year. Lakanwal's is reportedly 29 years old, and he is said to not be co-operating with authorities' investigation.Trump said following the shooting that the US \"must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden\".The Joint Task Force DC, which is co-ordinating the National Guard deployments to the nation's capital, said the attack took place at around 14:15 EST (19:15 GMT) on Wednesday near the Farragut Square Metro Station.The soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets - a busy lunch spot for office workers.Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Jeff Carroll said the suspect \"came around the corner\" and \"immediately started firing\", adding that the soldiers had been \"ambushed\".Other National Guard members nearby heard the gunfire and intervened, holding the suspect down until police arrived, he said.The suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS.One witness described to the BBC his experience of hearing gunshots, as people ran in panic and tried to take shelter in a nearby shop.Another witness, who was in his car close to the metro station, showed the BBC footage he took of the two soldiers lying on the street in their uniforms while being treated by medics. Details on the identities of the soldiers have not yet been provided by officials.A third person, apparently the alleged gunman, was also seen on the pavement being treated.In the wake of the attack, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had asked him to send 500 more National Guard members to the American capital.\"This will only stiffen our resolve to ensure that we make Washington DC safe and beautiful,\" the Pentagon chief said.There are currently nearly 2,200 National Guard troops in the city.They are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.The troops were deployed in August to tackle what Trump called \"out of control\" crime in Washington.Overall crime in the city has fallen since the force was sent, which Trump credits to the troops' presence on the streets.There have been similar deployments in other Democratic-led cities across the US, which have faced legal challenges by opponents who accuse the Trump administration of overreach.Watch: How the shooting of two National Guard members unfoldedTrump imposed a travel ban on nationals of Afghanistan - and 11 other countries - earlier this year.Afghan nationals holding Special Immigration Visas - available to those who worked directly with the US military and feared retribution from the Taliban as a result of that co-operation - were among a few exceptions to the sweeping bans. The Taliban returned to power following the US withdrawal in 2021.Trump has also ended a programme that granted deportation protections for thousands of people from Afghanistan.The temporary protected status programme allowed migrants to get work permits if the US government deemed it unsafe for them to return to their home countries due to war.Additional reporting by Tom BatemanFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "13 minutes agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisEPAPresident Macron said the new form of voluntary service was an \"act of trust in our youth\"A limited form of military service will be re-introduced in France in response to growing fears of a confrontation with Russia.More than 25 years after conscription was phased out, the plan will see young men and women volunteering for a paid 10 months of military training.\"The only way to avoid danger is to prepare for it,\" President Emmanuel Macron said while announcing the plan at an infantry base near Grenoble in south-east France. \"We need to mobilise, mobilising the nation to defend itself, to be ready and remain respected.\" The new \"national service\" will be brought in gradually from next summer, mainly for 18- and 19-year-olds, who will receive at least €800 (£700) a month.\"In this uncertain world where might triumphs over right, war is in the present tense,\" said Macron. The armed forces would benefit from motivated young French men and women, he added: \"It is an act of trust in our youth.\"Initially, numbers will be restricted to 3,000 next year, but this should rise to 50,000 by 2035.France currently has around 200,000 military personnel and a further 47,000 reservists. The new scheme should usher in a three-tier structure, comprising professionals, reservists and volunteers.The change brings France in line with other European countries that have launched military service schemes - with varying parameters - because of fears of Russian aggression.Belgium and the Netherlands have introduced a voluntary military service, and Germany is planning something similar.Only this month, the Belgian defence ministry sent letters to 17-year-olds inviting them to volunteer for about €2,000 (£1,750) a month.Further east, Lithuania and Latvia have compulsory schemes, with cadets chosen by lottery. Sweden, which recently joined Nato, has started a nine- to 15-month military service with selection on merit.Some European countries, like Finland and Greece, have never stopped military service, while the Swiss are to vote on Sunday on replacing mandatory service for men with compulsory civic duty for all.Others countries, including the UK and Spain, currently have no plans to re-introduce it.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance began phasing out conscription in the late 1990sFrench military chiefs are broadly in favour of the new measure, which they hope will create a reservoir of trained personnel able to back up professional soldiers and replace them in non-frontline tasks.  It is also hoped many volunteers will stay on to lead full military careers.\"The new military service moves us in the direction of hybridisation of the armed forces,\" Thomas Gassilloud, president of the National Assembly's defence committee, said. \"We went too far in the direction of the all-professional.\"The threat of a looming, if ill-defined, stand-off with Russia has become part of France's national discourse. The government has regularly raised the alert over below-the-radar incidents or attempts by Moscow to poison opinion via social media.Recently, the newly appointed chief-of-staff, Gen Fabien Mandon, took the alarm to a new level when he said French military planning was built around the assumption of a confrontation with Russia in the next three or four years.ReutersGen Fabien Mandon prompted an outcry when he said French opinion had to be prepared for \"losing children\" at warHe went further last week, telling a gathering of mayors that what France lacked was the spirit of sacrifice, urging them to prepare opinion for the possibility of \"losing children\" in war.Immediately condemned by the far-left and part of the far-right, the remarks were also seen as unhelpful by the government, with Macron reassuring the country last weekend that there were no plans to send young recruits to fight in Ukraine.Polls show a large majority of the public in favour of voluntary military service. An Elabe survey this week found that 73% supported the measure. Young people – aged 25-34 – were the least supportive, but even in this age group there was a 60% majority.In a random BBC test of opinion on Paris streets, a similar picture emerged.\"It's a good thing,\" said Louis, a 22-year-old student. \"It can help make the army bigger, but it's also a way to love your nation more.\"Eilan, another student, said: \"In military service you meet people from everywhere. You learn new ways of seeing things... You learn to talk and trust and co-exist with other people.\"\"From what I read in the newspapers, our army is not that powerful - so if we have to prepare for the future, maybe it's a good idea,\" said set-designer Brigitte.But Lalie, a 21-year-old shop assistant, disagreed: \"I think there are more important issues. It's a pity the president is not really interested in young people – their mental health, their financial situation, and instead is focusing on this military service.\"It was in 1996 that then-President Jacques Chirac took the decision to end military service, as part of the peace dividend from the fall of the Soviet Union.Compulsory military training for young men had been part of national life since the French Revolution, which created the idea of the citizen-soldier.A 1798 law setting up conscription read: \"Every Frenchman is a soldier and is bound to the defence of the homeland.\" And after defeat by Prussia in 1871, Republican leader Léon Gambetta said: \"When in France a citizen is born, he is born a soldier.\"The Algerian war of independence was the last conflict fought by French conscripts, with more than 12,000 killed.By the 1990s, service had been reduced to 10 months, with options for civilian work instead.Since the last conscript passed out in 2001 there have been various, nebulous attempts to retain something of the spirit of military service, which proponents said fostered a sense of cohesion and equality.Lycée (high-school) students still have to attend a Day of Defence and Citizenship, where they are given lectures on rights and duties, and attend a flag-raising ceremony.In his first term, Macron also established a Universal National Service – a four-week course in civic responsibilities and practical training – which was supposed to build national solidarity following the terrorist attacks of the 2010s. But the scheme was panned as an expensive and ill-attended form of holiday camp, and was dropped earlier this year.Though this new scheme appears to enjoy a broadly favourable reception, there are still questions over its funding – with a debt crisis looming over the country and parliament still unable to approve a 2026 budget.",

    "body": "9 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesA major ransomware attack crippled most of Asahi's factories in JapanJapanese beer giant Asahi revealed on Thursday that a massive cyber-attack in September has potentially leaked the personal information of more than 1.5 million customers.The drinks company published a statement on its investigation into the ransomware attack, which had crippled its operations across its factories in Japan and forced employees to take orders by pen and paper.Asahi said it found that personal details of people who had contacted its customer service centres were likely exposed and that those affected would be notified soon.The firm added that it would delay the release of its full-year financial results to focus on dealing with the fallout of the attack.Asahi did not state the attacker's identity or demands. Ransomware group Qilin - which has previously hacked other major firms - had claimed responsibility for the Asahi attack.The beer maker said in its preliminary findings that it discovered a disruption at one of its data centres on 29 September.It said that although the system was quickly isolated, investigators found the attacker had already infiltrated the network, encrypted its data and deployed ransomware - a virus that blocks access to files until a ransom is paid.Some data in the affected computers, along with personal information stored in the hacked servers, were also potentially exposed, said Asahi.The only confirmed cases of data exposure involved 18 items of employee-related personal information, which were stored on company-issued laptops, Asahi told the BBC.All other personal information involved is regarded as being at risk of possible leakage, it added.It includes personal details of more than 1.52 million customers, specifically their names, gender, addresses and contact information.Data belonging to about 107,000 current and former employees and 168,000 family members of staff were also potentially leaked.The name and contact details of 114,000 external contacts that had communicated with the firm were also linked.Credit card details were not included in Asahi's list of leaked data.The company added that it has not confirmed any evidence of the data being released and that the impact of the attack is limited to systems managed in Japan.The firm also owns big brands in Europe like Peroni and Fuller's Brewery in the UK. Asahi has said that the operations of those firms have not been impacted by the cyber-attack.The company said it spent nearly two months containing the attack and is now working to restore systems and reconfigure its network.Getty ImagesRetailers in Japan warned of beer and drink shortages as Asahi grappled with a major cyber-attack on its operationsThe outage resulted in drink shortages in shops across Japan. Asahi accounts for around 40% of the country's beer market.The shortage also affected Asahi's soft drinks, such as ginger beer and soda water.Shipments are also gradually resuming, said Atsushi Katsuki, the firm's president and chief executive, who apologised for the difficulties caused by the disruption. \"We are making every effort to achieve full system restoration as quickly as possible, while implementing measures to prevent recurrence and strengthening information security across the group.\"Other global brands have also recently experienced similar cyber-attacks.Jaguar Land Rover was forced to tap emergency funding after a major cyber-attack crippled operations at its British factories.",

    "body": "Venezuela has banned six major international airlines from landing in the country after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights there.The airlines had temporarily suspended their routes into the capital, Caracas, after the US warned of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.Angered by this, the Venezuelan government issued the carriers with an ultimatum that expired on Wednesday. While a number of smaller airlines continue to fly to Venezuela, thousands of passengers have been affected.The US has deployed a large force to waters off Venezuela, which it says is to combat drug trafficking but which Venezuela's leader has denounced as an attempt to overthrow him. Venezuela's civil aviation authority, which reports to the country's ministry of transport, announced on Wednesday that Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines would lose their landing and take-off rights with immediate effect.In a reference to the heightened US military activity off the coast of Venezuela, it also accused the airlines of \"joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government and unilaterally suspending air commercial operations\".The US has deployed 15,000 troops and the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, to within striking distance of Venezuela.Tracking build-up of US military planes and warships near VenezuelaThe US says the aim of the deployment, the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989, is to combat drug trafficking.US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they say were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, they have not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs and many analysts have pointed out that the US deployment is unusually large for a counter-narcotics operation. The Venezuelan government thinks the aim of the operation is to depose President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged. Amid the rising tensions, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued a warning on Friday to flight operators operating in Maiquetía, the international airport serving Caracas. It urged airlines \"to exercise caution... at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".It was in the wake of that warning that the now-banned airlines suspended their flights to Venezuela. An attempt by aviation industry body Iata to defuse the situation - by stressing that its member airlines were keen to restore operations - failed to appease the Venezuelan government.In recent days, both Maduro and his US counterpart Donald Trump have signalled a willingness to hold direct talks.Asked about it on Air Force One, Trump said that he \"might talk\" to Maduro, but also warned that \"we can do things the easy way, that's fine, and if we have to do it the hard way that's fine, too\".Maduro, meanwhile, uploaded a video of himself driving around Caracas pointing to Christmas decorations, in what appeared to be an attempt to show that life in the city was going on as normal.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAleem MaqboolReligion editor, travelling with Pope Leo XIVAnadolu via Getty ImagesPope Leo will mark the 1,700th anniversary of a landmark Church council during his visit to TurkeyPope Leo XIV has arrived in Turkey at the start of the first foreign trip of his papacy, where he will mark an historic Christian anniversary, before heading to Lebanon days after Israeli airstrikes on its capital, Beirut.As he travelled to Ankara, the Pope summed up the message of his trip by saying that \"all men, women can truly be brothers and sisters, in spite of differences, in spite of different religions, in spite of different beliefs\".Visits to both countries had originally been planned by the late Pope Francis, but the overarching theme – building bridges – is one Pope Leo has made his own from the moment he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.Since he became pontiff six months ago, he has conveyed a sense of being extremely measured, even cautious. But on this trip, his powers of diplomacy will be closely scrutinised.A key moment of the trip will take place in the Turkish town of Iznik, the site of the ancient city of Nicaea. Pope Leo and leaders of other Christian traditions will gather to mark the anniversary of an ancient council that took place there 1,700 years ago.  In 325 AD, among other key decisions, more than 200 bishops at the council affirmed the belief that Jesus was the son of God, eventually leading to what is known as the Nicene Creed.Eastern and Western branches of Christianity later dramatically split, but during this trip there will be messages of togetherness and healing divisions.In Turkey the Pope will also visit the Blue Mosque, as both his immediate predecessors Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI had done. He will have meetings with other religious leaders in a gesture of inter-religious dialogue before flying on to the second leg of the trip.EPAThe Pope plans to visit the Blue Mosque in IstanbulThe Vatican says plans for the Pope's visit to Lebanon have not changed following the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut earlier in the week.He will meet more faith leaders and hear from young people in Lebanon, his visit giving a boost in particular to the estimated third of the country that is Christian.On the final day of the trip, Pope Leo will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.Over recent months, though he has spoken out on some issues dear to him such as the dignity of migrants, he has certainly not been as overtly political as his predecessor could be.He has walked such a fine line that in some cases both progressives and traditionalists within the Catholic Church have made the case that he supports their school of thought.It was for similar reasons that cardinals of different persuasions were thought to have coalesced around him at conclave.Pope Francis was seen as a visionary but one who was not overly worried about creating consensus, leaving behind a somewhat divided Church. Pope Leo has so far operated very differently, gently holding on to some of the progressive ideals of his predecessor while paying heed to the views of traditionalists.He has repeatedly called for an end to war, but in a different way to Pope Francis, who memorably made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza to offer his support.ReutersThe Pope met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Presidential Palace in Ankara on ThursdayIn meetings on this trip - with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Lebanese civic leaders - Pope Leo may be drawn to comment on his views on conflict in the region.We may hear something of his impressions at the end of his trip, as it is customary for the Pope to hold a news conference with travelling press on the return flight to Rome.What we will hear more of this trip is a pope speaking in a Chicagoan accent. Although Pope Leo, who speaks several languages fluently, has mainly given public addresses in Italian up to this point, the Vatican has confirmed that he will speak English throughout the Turkish leg of his trip, with some French too during his time in Lebanon.",

    "body": "15 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterPeers have been given an extra 10 days to scrutinise the assisted dying bill, after a record number of amendments prompted concerns it would run out of time to be passed into law.The bill was backed by MPs in a historic vote in June and is now in its final stages in the House of Lords, where peers must agree the wording of the legislation for the bill to become law.There are fears opponents are trying to talk out the bill by lodging a record number of requests for changes, and making very slow progress in discussing them. With the legislation having been drafted as a private member's bill by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, there is a hard deadline on when agreement must be reached with peers.Approval for the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would need to be approved by both the Commons and the Lords before spring when the current session of Parliament ends.If passed, it would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales with fewer than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.Critics and opponents of the bill have insisted the legislation requires significant re-drafting to ensure any system properly protects vulnerable people.However, peers had managed to discuss fewer than 30 of the more than 1,000 amendments lodged after two of the four days reserved for committee stage, when the bill is scrutinised line-by-line.With only two more sessions scheduled before the end of the year, Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with cancer, last week warned peers not to \"sabotage democracy\".Leadbeater has also shared her concern that \"some of the processes and procedures that can be used are being used to frustrate the bill, and that is deeply disappointing and upsetting\".Now, the government's chief whip in the Lords has announced 10 extra Fridays will be given for debate in the Lords, spread over a number of weeks in the New Year between 9 January and 24 April.Lord Roy Kennedy said it is \"clear the House needs additional time to scrutinise the Bill\" given the high number of amendments.He said: \"I have always been clear that as this government is neutral on the Bill any additional time will not come from government time.\"I also believe given the importance of the subject and the number of colleagues wishing to participate, that this scrutiny could not take place in the Grand Committee, as some have suggested to me.\"I have therefore arranged for the House to sit on an additional eight additional Fridays in the New Year in addition to the three Fridays already announced.\"He added the government is not trying to \"prescribe\" how the Bill will progress, given its neutral stance.Welcoming the decision, backbencher Leadbeater said she was pleased extra days had been granted to deal with the large number of amendments.\"It is right that peers use their expertise and experience to properly scrutinise the Bill and propose improvements to strengthen it where necessary,\" she said.\"These extra days provide an unprecedented amount of debating time for a private members' bill.  \"There is little doubt that these days, used responsibly and constructively, will allow the Bill progress through the Lords and enable Parliament to give dying people choice and dignity in their final days and protect their loved ones from the threat of prosecution.\"Lord Charlie Falconer, who is steering the Bill through the Lords, said the extra dates mean that up to 24 April, there will have been 16 days for consideration of the legislation in the Lords.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

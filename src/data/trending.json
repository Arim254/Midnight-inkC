    "body": "Icon, trailblazer & Wales hero - Fishlock's seismic legacyImage source, FAWImage caption, Midfielder Jess Fishlock is the most capped Wales international of all timeByIan MitchelmoreBBC Sport WalesJess Fishlock's Wales chapter is poised to come to an end following a glorious international career that has boasted 165 caps and 48 goals.She will make her 166th and final appearance for her country when Rhian Wilkinson's side host Australia at Cardiff City Stadium on 25 October.The 38-year-old Fishlock was a monumental figure in the growth of a side that played in a major tournament for the first time in their history earlier in 2025.The record goalscorer then netted the first ever goal for the women's side on the grandest stage, although her remarkable impact went way beyond her on-pitch exploits.Destined for greatnessFrom the word go, there was always something special about Fishlock.She started her playing career with hometown club Cardiff City Ladies, now Gwalia United, and swiftly caught the eye - making her first-team debut at 15.Having captained Wales Under-19s, Fishlock earned her senior bow against Switzerland - a nation where almost two decades later the final touch of gloss would be dabbed on what was to be a glittering career - in 2006.Only two years later, Fishlock made the decision to join Dutch side AZ Alkmaar and became the first overseas player in the Eredivisie.Her boldness typified that of a woman who was as relentless as she was ambitious from the very beginning of her time as a footballer.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Midfielder Jess Fishlock scored her 48th Wales goal at Euro 2025Despite some struggles in the Netherlands, Fishlock was part of a side that claimed back-to-back Eredivisie titles, and it was a sign of things to come at club level. Upon returning to Bristol, she was named Women's Super League (WSL) Players' Player of the Season in her second campaign and enjoyed even more success in Australia soon after.Having joined Melbourne Victory, Fishlock starred as the Victoria-based side reached two Grand Finals - winning their first title in 2013.An eye-catching move to Seattle Reign in 2013 proved to be the catalyst in making Fishlock a star on the global stage.She has helped the club win three NWSL Shield titles, and even during her loan stints away from the American side, of which there have been six in total, success still followed.Indeed, the midfielder tasted further league glory with Glasgow, Melbourne City, Frankfurt and Lyon - winning the Champions League with each of the latter two sides.But the glut of honours were never replicated on the international stage.Fishlock wasted no time in becoming a key cog under Andy Beattie, Adrian Tucker, Jarmo Matikainen, Jayne Ludlow, Gemma Grainger and most recently Wilkinson.Though for all of her mesmerising showings, goals, assists and endeavour, tournament qualification proved one hurdle too many with Wales for the majority of her career. Although, thankfully, not for all of it.Media caption, 'She's the best player in the world'Finally achieving a dreamThe date 3 December 2024 will be forever etched into Wales history.Following a 1-1 draw between the sides in Cardiff four days earlier, goals from Hannah Cain and Carrie Jones earned Rhian Wilkinson's side a 2-1 victory over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin to ensure Wales would at long last break their tournament duck.It was the pinnacle for a team who had seen icons including Laura McAllister, Jayne Ludlow and Helen Ward - and Neville Southall, Ryan Giggs, Ian Rush and Mark Hughes to name a few on the men's side - all fail to achieve their tournament dream with Wales.On the eve of the 2025 Euros, Fishlock told BBC Sport Wales: \"A big narrative around my entire career internationally has been, 'Can I get to a major tournament?' and 'Can we get to a major tournament?' We've been so close so many times.\"When you want to achieve something and you get to do it with some of your very closest friends, there's really no comparison to that feeling.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jess Fishlock netted for Wales in a 4-1 loss to France at Euro 2025Even in the aftermath of their humbling 3-0 defeat by the Netherlands in their competition opener in Switzerland, Fishlock was intent on ensuring further progress was the target.\"This is the level now, right?\" she said. \"We've got to get used to this real fast.\"Not content with adding one more piece of history to her ever-increasing list of achievements, Fishlock again took centre stage as she netted a 13th-minute equaliser in Wales' second group stage match against France in St Gallen - the first  goal the women's side had scored in a major tournament.Aged 38 years and 176 days, the strike made Fishlock the oldest scorer in women's Euro finals history.It was as fitting as it was deserved, given the weight of expectation she had carried on her shoulders for the vast majority of her time in the red of Wales. It also demonstrated there was immense quality to go with her commendable longevity - with Fishlock playing in 67% of the 245 international matches ever played by the Welsh women's side.Recent Welsh success has brought with it increased expectation and stronger opposition - with Wales' nine-game winless run across their Euro and Nations League A fixtures in 2025 serving as proof that they are now on a whole new level when it comes to competing with the world's big guns.But Fishlock simply would not have it any other way.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, USA star Megan Rapinoe (L) and Wales great Jess Fishlock made a point to support LGBT rights after a friendly matchFishlock has never shied away from using her profile to speak out on her beliefs having come out as gay.In 2018, Fishlock - who married former team-mate Tziarra King in 2023 - was awarded an MBE for services to women's football and the LGBT community.Before the men's World Cup in Qatar, Fishlock opened up on the importance of visibility amid concerns over the 2022 tournament host nation's record on gay rights.It came after she had described her experience at school as \"hell on earth\" because of abuse she received over her sexuality.Nevertheless, Fishlock remained determined to use her platform to help educate others.Speaking in 2019, Fishlock said: \"I'm not the only one that gets abused. I am not the only one that gets comments thrown at them. \"It's come round to my family and my sisters and my mum and my dad, so when I made that decision, you know I have to think about other people as well otherwise it's very selfish of me.\"But there really is a big picture, and the bigger picture is generations of kids looking at a role model, looking at what they've achieved and understanding whatever they are going through.\"Following the friendly between Wales and the United States of America in July 2023, Fishlock embraced USA icon and Seattle Reign team-mate Megan Rapinoe - who is also openly gay.The pair wore each other's national team shirt and posed for photographs - making sure their support for LGBT rights was front and centre of the pictures' message.Such has been Fishlock's impact on the game itself, a mural covering the playing area of a five-a-side football pitch in Splott, Cardiff, was unveiled in June to celebrate her impact on football, equality and representation.The Red Wall will get the chance to celebrate Fishlock's efforts when Wales host Australia and Poland in friendlies later this month.One thing is for certain, the void left by Fishlock is unlikely ever to be filled, or her achievements surpassed.But Wales are unquestionably in a far better place thanks to the truly astonishing efforts of a player who gave her all, and more, to ensure she leaves behind a legacy like no other.",

It then headed back east, having dropped to an altitude of 10,000 feet, accoring to FlightRadar24.At this time, the plane started broadcasting a \"7700 squawk code\" on its transponder. These are relayed to signify a general emergency onboard, ranging from engine failure to depressurisation to a medical emergency.In February a government plane carrying Secretary of State Marco Rubio had to turn back due to a crack in the window of the cockpit, as well.Defence ministers had gathered in Belgium on Wednesday to discuss security in Ukraine.

Robert Bush, 47, admitted 35 offences of fraud by false representation and another of fraudulently running a business, Hull-based Legacy Independent Funeral Directors relating to the sale of funeral plans.He also denied 30 counts of preventing lawful and decent burials and one charge of stealing money from charity collection boxes, during a hearing at Hull Crown Court.Bush, formerly of Kirk Ella, East Yorkshire and now living in West Yorkshire, will face a trial at Sheffield Crown Court on 5 October 2026.Humberside Police began its inquiry into Legacy Independent Funeral Directors following a report of \"concern for care of the deceased\" in March 2024.The force said four of the fraud by false representation counts related to \"ashes provided to families following loss in pregnancy\".It took the court clerk 22 minutes to put all 67 charges to Bush, who wore a grey three-piece suit, a white shirt and purple tie.There were gasps from the packed public gallery each time a not guilty plea was entered.A woman heckled Bush from the gallery as he was ushered out of the courtroom at the end of the hearing. Bush was bailed until his next court appearance.Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devices",

    "body": "16 minutes agoDominic CascianiHome and legal Correspondent, at Westminster Magistrates' CourtReutersProtesters in London's Trafalgar Square on 4 October for a demonstration against the ban on Palestine ActionTwenty-eight people have pleaded not guilty after being charged under anti-terrorism laws with allegedly supporting the banned group Palestine Action. In the first of a series of complex hearings on Wednesday, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard about 2,000 people are likely to be charged with showing support in demonstrations for the group proscribed as a terrorist organisation in July.Judges face trying to find time and courtrooms to hold 400 trials of those accused of taking part in protests.While the judge began setting provisional trial dates for March, there is no certainty they can take place before the end of 2026 because of the ongoing legal battle over the group's proscription.The government proscribed Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation in July, after activists broke into an RAF base and damaged two military aircraft earlier in the year.Since that ban more than 2,100 people have been arrested at demonstrations in England and Wales. Each of them has been accused of holding up a placard reading: \"I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action\".So far, some 170 of them - many of them pensioners - have been charged with displaying an item supportive of a banned organisation. This is a low-level terrorism offence which can be dealt with in a magistrates' court and can lead to six months in jail.The first of two days of dedicated hearings to manage the cases dominated Westminster Magistrates' Court, as district judge Michael Snow set out how the courts would deal with all of them.Most of the 28 defendants appearing, who were among those arrested at the first protests in July, did not have a lawyer. That meant many were often unclear about what was going on or had not had an opportunity to read the basics of the accusations they face.Many complained to the court that their prosecution was unjust.Anthony Harvey, 59, travelled from his home in Oban, in the Scottish Highlands, to deny supporting a proscribed organisation.He told the judge: \"Protesting against genocide is not terrorism, I'm not guilty.\"The oldest defendant was 83-year-old the Reverend Susan Parfitt, from Bristol, who is partially deaf.She gently held onto a hand rail in the courtroom as judge Snow came down from the bench to sit next to her, so she could hear him.When he asked her for her plea, she replied: \"I was objecting against the proscription of Palestine Action and I therefore plead not guilty.\"David Kilroy, 66, from Plymouth, wearing a Just Stop Oil t-shirt, told the court: \"When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes a duty. Not guilty.\"During the day, prosecutor Peter Ratliff told the court that there were difficulties in fixing firm trial dates from early next year for what could end up being 2,000 defendants because of the ongoing legal challenge to the banning of Palestine Action.If that challenge overturns the ban, the prosecutions would almost certainly be scrapped. But if the ban remains there could still be complex questions over how the suspects can defend themselves.Three lead cases, which came to court in September, are being prioritised to try to decide those questions - but any of these legal standoffs could end up before the Supreme Court.If that happened, trials would have to be delayed, perhaps into 2027.Judge Snow acknowledged the risk of having to revise plans for 2,000 defendants if the Supreme Court ultimately gets involved in the case – but he said he had to nevertheless set timetables. Courtrooms at Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London are being set aside to manage the cases.That plan involves at least two trials a day of a total of 10 defendants, starting from 23 March. If the 2,000 defendant figure is correct, that would require at least 400 trials - or 200 full days of court time.But on Wednesday defendants and a lawyer told the judge there was a risk the trials would be too short to be fair.Katie McFadden, acting for some of the defendants, said that a half-day trial of five defendants at a time raised questions about whether that was enough time for them to individually give evidence, present their free speech arguments and be cross-examined.Another suspect, 72-year-old Deborah Wilde, told the court: \"I don't think I can get a fair trial on the [time] limit that you have allocated to me. I would like to seek leave to appeal.\"Judge Snow told her that was not legally possible.\"I'm satisfied that the time is sufficient,\" he said. \"I'm not allowing more time for the trial. Your only remedy is the High Court.\"Another 30 defendants are due in court on Thursday to continue allocating trial dates. On Friday, the Court of Appeal will rule on a government attempt to stop the challenge to Palestine Action's ban. Separately in November, the first trial is due to begin of alleged Palestine Action members who are accused of offences, including violence, relating to the targeting of an Israeli defence firm.",

    "body": "4 hours agoDavid GrittenBBCIt is difficult to identify bodies with just codes and numbers attached to the bags, Palestinian officials sayA health official in Gaza says a specialist committee is working to identify the bodies of 90 Palestinians handed over by Israel in exchange for dead hostages held by Hamas.If they were unsuccessful, photos would be posted online so families could search for relatives, said Dr Mohammed Zaqout, director general of hospitals for the Hamas-run health ministry.It is not clear whether the bodies - stored at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis - belong to Palestinians who died in Gaza or in Israeli custody. Footage filmed by a freelance journalist working for the BBC at Nasser's mortuary appeared to show the body of a blindfolded man. Another body seemed to have marks around the wrists and ankles.The BBC has asked the Israeli military and justice ministry for comment. They have previously rejected accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees.Under last week's ceasefire agreement with Hamas, Israel has agreed to hand over the bodies of 15 Palestinians in return for every deceased Israeli hostage.So far, the Israeli military has said the remains of six Israeli hostages have been returned.The body of another hostage - a Nepalese national - has also been returned from Gaza, along with the remains of another person who was not a hostage.Israel has called on Hamas to \"make all necessary efforts\" to recover the bodies of the remaining 21 deceased hostages as agreed.The last 20 living hostages were also handed over by Hamas on Monday in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Latest updatesHostage families confirm identities of three of four bodies handed over by HamasTrump demands Hamas disarm, as group moves against 'collaborators' in GazaBowen: Trump's role in Gaza ceasefire was decisive, but not a roadmap to peaceIsraeli authorities handed over 45 Palestinians' bodies to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Monday - with another 45 on Wednesday. The remains were transferred by the ICRC to Nasser hospital.Speaking outside the facility on Tuesday, Dr Zaqout said the first group of bodies had been kept by Israeli authorities in refrigerators, and that \"some are clearly recognisable, while others are difficult to identify\".\"Once confirmed, we will publish the names for the families so they can come forward to identify and bury their loved ones.\"However, Dr Zaqout said health officials had so far received no information to assist them, such as names or the circumstances of death.\"What we received are bodies with codes and numbers. However, we were promised that... we would be provided with the names. We are awaiting further clarification from our colleagues at the International Committee of the Red Cross.\"If we receive the names from [Israel], we will publish them. If not, we will be forced to create a link where photos of the identifiable martyrs will be posted.\"Gaza's health system has been devastated by the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, and lacks the specialist equipment needed for the identification of bodies, such as DNA testing.Rasmieh Qdeih said she was searching for her son, Fadi, who has been missing since the start of the warAlso outside Nasser hospital was Rasmieh Qdeih from Khuzaa, a town east of Khan Younis.She was searching for her son Fadi, 36, who has been missing since 7 October 2023, when the Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.At least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.\"I don't know whether he was imprisoned or martyred. I contacted everyone; no-one told me anything,\" Ms Qdeih said.\"Every time a prisoner is released, I ask them - have you seen Fadi?... Is he a prisoner, a martyr, or missing? They say 'no'. Everyone in Negev prison says they haven't heard that name. Each one tells me something different.\"She said the wait to learn her son's fate was the most difficult she had ever experienced.\"I'm not upset... I just want to know if my son is among them. If not, if they don't find my son among these martyrs, I will be shocked.\"\"If there's anything, I'll recognise him - my son's leg is amputated, and he has vitiligo... His hair is white. I'd know him,\" she added.It is not clear how many bodies of Palestinians from Gaza are being held by Israel.The National Campaign for the Recovery of Martyrs' Bodies, a non-governmental Palestinian campaign group, said last week the remains of at least 735 people, 99 of them from Gaza, were being held by Israel in its mortuaries or cemeteries.It also cited Israeli media reports from last year as saying Israel was holding the bodies of approximately 1,500 Hamas fighters at the Sde Teiman military base.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporter andFaisal IslamEconomics editorBritain is targeting Russia's largest oil companies and the country's \"shadow fleet\" of oil tankers in a bid to cut off Vladimir Putin's ability to fund the war in Ukraine.The UK government is also pursuing a major Indian oil refinery and four Chinese oil terminals in a package of 90 new sanctions.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the move was expected to have a significant impact on Russia's economy and its ability to sustain military operations in Ukraine.\"We are sending a clear signal: Russian oil is off the market,\" she said ahead of a meeting in Washington DC with global counterparts to discuss Russian sanctions.Reeves said the government was \"significantly stepping up the pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin's war effort.\"Russia's two largest oil companies - Lukoil and Rosneft - will be hit with sanctions, Reeves said on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) annual meeting. The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries. They work together to maintain global economic stability.\"At the same time, we are ramping up pressure on companies in third countries, including India and China, that continue to facilitate getting Russian oil onto global markets,\" Ms Reeves said.\"There is no place for Russian oil on global markets and we will take whatever actions are necessary to destroy the capability of the Russian government to continue this illegal war in Ukraine.\"The government was also sanctioning 44 tankers that operate in Russia's \"shadow fleet\" transporting oil around the world, Reeves said in a joint statement with the Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper.The two Russian oil firms export 3.1 million barrels of oil per day. Rosneft is responsible for nearly half of all Russian oil production, which makes up 6% of the global output, according to the government.Also on the sanction list is India's Nayara Energy Limited, which the government said imported 100 million barrels of Russian crude oil worth more than $5bn (£3.75bn) in 2024 alone.Cooper said: \"Today's action is another step towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, and towards a more secure United Kingdom.\"The announcement comes as the G7, a grouping of some of the world's most advanced economies, prepares to consider a plan to effectively seize hundreds of billions from the proceeds of Russian investments, frozen since the invasion of Ukraine.A vast bulk of Russia's assets are held as cash at the European Central Bank, after its underlying bond investments matured.The European Union (EU), where the bulk of funds are held, had been reluctant to pursue the wider plan, but appears to be developing a way round legal concerns. It will be considered at an EU summit next week.Ukraine has significant funding needs as the war continues, both in arms and reconstruction.Earlier this year, the UK joined the US in directly sanctioning energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas.At the time the then Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, had said it would \"drain Russia's war chest – and every ruble we take from Putin's hands helps save Ukrainian lives\".The US separately has discussed putting additional tariffs on goods from China, up to 500%, tied to Beijing's purchases of Russian oil.But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday that the US would not take that step unless Europe agreed to do something similar.\"We will respond if our European partners will join us,\" he said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHelen CattPolitical correspondent andChris MasonPolitical editorThe row over why the case of two men accused of spying for China collapsed continues to rumble on and on for the government (not least, of course, because the opposition senses it is worth stoking).The government does seem to have painted itself into a corner over the release of witness statements related to the case.Suggesting that the Crown Prosecution Service was stopping their release, only for the CPS to say they weren't, makes it very awkward to do anything other than publish them.At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer clarified that the government would do just that.The PM saw those documents for the first time this morning.It was an unusual start to the weekly question session - with the prime minister making that pledge in a statement, rather than in response to questions from the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch - something Badenoch was not expecting.There is an additional question, though, over whether the statements will really change anything.Unless they show something radically different to the situation that has so far been discussed, the central allegation here hasn't been that the government toned down evidence, but that it perhaps could have provided more and chose not to.The government maintains that's not the case and the publication of the statements may not shed any more light on that.Of course, these documents could put some more pressure on the CPS, as opposed to politicians. Let's see.Barring any surprises, it is unlikely to draw a line under this story - for the government or for those asking the questions.The Conservatives have been keen to keep up the pressure.There is danger though. The government's response throughout this has been to claim it was the Conservatives' position on China and the state of legislation which they did not change that is to blame.After PMQs, there are briefings with the prime minister's team and Badenoch's team.This week, they lasted around an hour and 20 minutes.That, for the avoidance of doubt, is a long time by the standards of these things.It looks as though the documents will be coming later.What else have we learnt?The final submission of evidence from the government's deputy national security adviser was submitted on 4 August this year.On 1 September, the National Security Adviser, Jonathan Powell, and the most senior civil servant at the Foreign Office, Sir Oliver Robbins, held a meeting in which what is described as the \"bilateral handling\" of the then forthcoming court case was discussed.In other words, how to deal with China when a big, high profile court case about alleged spying is under way.The government maintains that this meeting didn't get into the evidence relating to the case.The Conservatives say hang on, No 10 hasn't always been clear about this meeting — and it is a meeting that happened before the case collapsed on 15 September. They are now demanding the minutes of that meeting are published.The prime minister did find out the case was collapsing two days before it did, but those in government won't say how he found out.All of this just reinforces how complicated the detail of this story is and how much longer the questioning of it might go on.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterWatch: PM quotes Badenoch as previously saying China should not be called a \"foe\"The government will publish evidence submitted in the now-collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China, Sir Keir Starmer has said.Deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins provided three witness statements to prosecutors, which the prime minister said he intended to publish \"in full\".The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats had called for the documents to be released, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accusing the government of a \"cover-up\".The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry last month, prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. Both men deny the allegations.The director of public prosecutions said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.Mr Collins submitted three witness statements on whether China had been regarded as a threat at the time of the alleged offences - one in December 2023 and two further statements in February and August this year, after Labour took office.Speaking at the start of Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said he was \"deeply disappointed\" the prosecutions did not go ahead.He insisted that the case had to be based on the previous Conservative government's position on China. The PM pointed to the 2021 Integrated Review, which set out the government's security and foreign policy priorities, and an update of that document in 2023, which he said were \"very carefully worded to not describe China as an enemy\".\"The cabinet secretary assures me that the [deputy national security adviser] faithfully set out the policy of the then-Tory government,\" he said.\"Under this government, no minister or special adviser played any role in the provision of evidence.\"However, Badenoch said it was \"simply unbelievable that he is trying to say the last government did not classify China as a threat\".She highlighted a number of examples when Tory ministers and government documents had described China in this way.\"He's blaming his civil servants, he's blaming the media, he's blaming the last government, he cannot explain why he could not see this case through,\" she said.\"He should have seen this case through, and let me be clear, a serious case involving national security has collapsed because this government is too weak to stand up to China.\"The Conservatives have called for the publication of all communications between the government and the CPS, as well as the minutes of all government meetings discussing the case.The PM has confirmed that his national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, and the most senior civil servant at the Foreign Office, Sir Oliver Robbins, met to discuss the trial on 1 September, shortly before the case collapsed on 15 September.The government maintains this meeting did not discuss the evidence relating to the case.Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have demanded the government make public all legal advice it received on the case and launch an independent inquiry to \"get to the bottom of what actually happened\".Barring any surprises, it is unlikely the publication of the witness statements will draw a line under the issue.The central allegation has not been that the government toned down evidence, but that it perhaps could have provided more and chose not to.The government maintains that is not the case and the publication of the statements may not shed any more light on that.On Tuesday, senior government figures had suggested that the CPS had told them publishing the witness statements would be \"inappropriate\".But the CPS later made clear it would not stand in the way if ministers chose to put the government's evidence in the public domain. A spokesperson said: \"The statements were provided to us for the purpose of criminal proceedings which are now over.  \"The material contained in them is not ours, and it is a matter for the government, independently of the CPS, to consider whether or not to make that material public.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterA company linked to Baroness Michelle Mone has failed to meet a deadline to repay £122m for breaching a Covid-19 personal protective equipment (PPE) contract.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) won a legal case earlier this month against PPE Medpro, a consortium led by Lady Mone's husband Doug Barrowman, over claims the PPE did not comply with relevant healthcare standards.A High Court judge ruled some of the company's gowns they supplied were not \"sterile\".Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said the government would \"pursue PPE Medpro with everything we've got to get these funds back\" after the company failed to pay the damages cost by 16:00 BST on Wednesday.PPE Medpro entered administration on 30 September, the day before the court judgement.Streeting said: \"At a time of national crisis, PPE Medpro sold the previous government substandard kit and pocketed taxpayers' hard-earned cash.\"PPE Medpro has failed to meet the deadline to pay - they still owe us over £145 million, with interest now accruing daily.\"The firm was ordered to pay interest of £23.6m, which means the total sum owed is £145.6m.According to the DHSC, this sum will accrue interest at 8% per year from Thursday until it is fully paid.Forvis Mazars, one of the joint administrators appointed to take control of the business and recover money owed to creditors, declined to comment. The National Crime Agency (NCA) previously said it was investigating the PPE Medpro case.Mr Barrowman's spokesman had said £83m of the government deal was paid to other companies but it is unclear whether they are being looked at by the NCA.PPE Medpro was awarded a government contract in 2020 to supply PPE after being recommended by Baroness Mone.However, after ordering 25 million sterile gowns from PPE Medpro, the government later launched legal action in 2022 through the High Court, claiming the gowns did not comply with the agreed contract.PPE Medpro argued it had complied with the contract and that the gowns were sterile.According to the company's most recent accounts for the period ending 31 July, the business had £666,025 in net assets.The document filed to Companies House also mentioned how the firm had used about £4.2m in reserves to fight the legal dispute. Since the court judgement, Baroness Mone has faced cross-party calls for her to be stripped of her peerage. However, peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament.",

    "body": "An Israeli couple who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks have been reunited, two years after they were violently split up.Noa Argamani and Avinatan Or were seized at the Nova music festival. Video of Ms Argamani being dragged away in terror on the back of a motorbike became one of the most widely recognised images of the attacks.She was rescued by Israeli commandos on 8 June 2024. Mr Or, who was held separately in central Gaza, was released on Monday - one of 20 living hostages to be returned as part of the ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump.In a post on Instagram, Ms Argamani said the couple could now begin \"healing together\".After reuniting, Israeli media said the pair shared their \"first cigarette together after two years\".A day after her partner's release, Ms Argamani shared an emotional Instagram post alongside their first photos together since 2023.\"Two years since the last moment I saw Avinatan, my love. Two years since terrorists kidnapped us, put me on a motorcycle, and tore us apart in front of the whole world,\" she wrote.She said she had been held with other women and children inside houses during her captivity, \"while Avinatan was only in the tunnels\". \"Hamas released videos and signs of life from me, while there was no information at all about Avinatan,\" the post, in Hebrew, continued.She said the pair could now begin their recovery. \"We won our personal war and the whole world's fight with us to get to this moment, and now it's time for us to begin our shared journey together,\" the post said.Ms Argamani also thanked Trump for his part in bringing the hostages home and helping them \"overcome the darkness\".Mr Or's father told Israeli media about the conditions his son had been kept in - food supplies which were \"meagre\" and a lot of time alone, chained up in tunnels and small enclosures during his 738 days in captivity.He said his son - who is around 2m (6ft 5in) tall - was held at one point in a space just 1.8m high, and just slightly longer than the mattress he slept on.\"He's extremely thin,\" Yaron Or told reporters, adding that his son had had \"no books, no human contact - nothing\", but was given a Rubik's Cube at one point.He was given very little information about the outside world, including the whereabouts of his girlfriend or the full scope of the Hamas attacks and subsequent Israeli offensive.\"Around him were guards whose relatives had been killed in IDF [Israel Defense Forces] strikes, I think it's simply a miracle they didn't harm him, except for one time he tried to escape,\" the senior Mr Or said.Avinatan Or reportedly tried to escape whilst being moved through a tunnel but was captured and beaten for the attempt. \"He's sharing things gradually, we're not asking directly,\" his father said.\"Physically, he still needs to recover,\" he continued. \"But mentally, thank God, he's the same Avinatan - same humour, same strength.\"",

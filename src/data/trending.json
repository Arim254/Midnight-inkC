    "body": "14 minutes agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe CMA said competition between fuel retailers was poorDrivers could be paying more than they should for petrol and diesel after the UK's competition watchdog said fuel profit margins remain at \"persistently high levels\" despite prices at the pump having fallen.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also challenged retailers' claims that this was a result of higher operating costs. In its first annual road fuel monitoring report, the CMA said competition in the sector was \"weak\".The report was published as the government prepares to launch its \"fuel finder\" scheme, which will allow drivers to compare real-time fuel prices.Petrol was 136.8p per litre last week, according to government tracking, while diesel was 146.1p per litre.The CMA said if there was more competition, drivers would see better fuel prices at the pump.Retailers will have to sign up to the planned fuel finder scheme and report price changes within 30 minutes of them being implemented.The CMA said the finder would be accessible through apps and satnavs, and allow drivers to easily compare prices.\"In turn, this should incentivise retailers to compete harder for customers, placing downward pressure on prices.\"Dan Turnbull, senior director of markets at the CMA, said: \"Fuel margins remain at persistently high levels – and our new analysis shows operating costs do not explain this. \"We know fuel costs are a big issue for drivers, especially at this time of year with millions making journeys across the country.\"Drivers 'being taken for a ride'Both the RAC and the AA said drivers were being overcharged for fuel.The AA said that, since November, the wholesale cost of petrol has fallen more than 7p per litre but the average petrol pump price had fallen by just two-thirds of a penny.\"It comes as millions of drivers take to the road for Christmas and are being overcharged for their fuel,\" the motoring body said.\"Drivers are being taken for a ride at the pumps, as the CMA clearly illustrates.\"RAC head of policy Simon Williams said: \"Many drivers won't be surprised to hear that they're still paying too much for their fuel, especially judging by the complaints we receive about large price variations from area to area.\"He said retailers' arguments of higher operating costs had \"now been clearly rejected\" by the CMA.\"We sincerely hope the new fuel finder scheme, combined with ongoing scrutiny from the CMA, finally leads to increased competition and lower forecourt prices for drivers right across the country.\"",

    "body": "11 minutes agoAlex BoydandLaura GozziBBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg on scene of Moscow car bombingA Russian general has been killed in a car bombing in Moscow, officials have said.Russia's Investigative Committee said Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died on Monday morning after an explosive device planted under a car detonated.Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department, the committee added.It said one theory being investigated was that the bomb was planted with the involvement of Ukrainian intelligence services. Ukraine has not commented.Sarvarov died in hospital as a result of his injuries, the committee said, adding it had opened an investigation into murder and illegal trafficking of explosives.Investigators have been sent to the scene, in a car park near an apartment block in the south of Russia's capital.Images from the area show a badly damaged white car with the doors blown out, surrounded by other vehicles. According to Russian media, Sarvarov previously took part in combat operations during the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and the Chechen wars in the 1990s and early 2000s, and also led operations in Syria between 2015-2016. ReutersInvestigators could be seen working at the scene on Monday morningVladimir Putin was informed of Sarvarov's death immediately, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of military officials and high-profile individuals have been targeted in the Russian capital.Darya Dugina, the 29-year-old daughter of a prominent nationalist figure and Putin close ally, was killed in a suspected car bombing in 2022.Gen Yaroslav Moskalik was killed in a car bomb attack last April, while Gen Igor Kirillov died in December 2024 when a device hidden in a scooter was detonated remotely.A Ukrainian source later told the BBC that Kirillov was killed by Ukraine's security service, though this was never confirmed on the record. As a matter of policy, Ukraine never officially admits or claims responsibility for targeted attacks.",

    "body": "9 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe maker of the popular Jim Beam bourbon whiskey says it will halt production at its main site in Kentucky for all of next year.The distillery will stay closed while the firm takes \"the opportunity to invest in site enhancements,\" it told the BBC in a statement on Sunday.\"We are always assessing production levels to best meet consumer demand and recently met with our team to discuss our volumes for 2026.\"Distillers in Kentucky - famous for its bourbon - face uncertainty, in part, due to US President Donald Trump's trade policies.The brand is owned by Japanese drinks giant Suntory Global Spirits, which employs more than 1,000 people across its sites in Kentucky.The firm said its other operations in the state, including a separate distillery and its bottling and warehousing plants, would continue to run next year. The visitor centre in Kentucky also remains open. Jim Beam also said it was assessing how it would use its workforce during the production pause, and was holding talks with the workers' union.In October, the Kentucky Distillers' Association (KDA) trade body said the amount of bourbon in warehouses across the state was at a record high of more than 16 million barrels.According to the association, the barrels of bourbon, which are taxed by the state, have cost distillers \"a crushing\" $75m (£56m) this year.US distillers have faced retaliatory import taxes on their goods after Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" announcement in April saw the US imposing tariffs on most countries around the world.\"Much of the expansion over the last decade has been geared towards global growth,\" the KDA said in October as it called for a \"for a speedy return to reciprocal, tariff-free trade\".Trade tensions between the US and Canada have also affected sales of alcohol, with most Canadian provinces boycotting American spirits earlier in the year.",

    "body": "12 hours agoKate McGoughEducation reporterDan Nelson / BBCMany children find themselves singing at school in the run up to Christmas - at a nativity play or carol concert, often with parents watching proudly on.But new data suggests singing is a much less common occurrence throughout the rest of the school year, especially after pupils leave primary school.Now, an association of music teachers says every school should have a choir, to help pupils embrace music after a years-long decline in its popularity as a GCSE subject.The government says it is investing in high quality music teaching and that a \"renewed curriculum\" will encourage more people to study it.In a recent survey, Teacher Tapp asked just under 10,000 teachers in England how often their whole school sang together in assembly. Over half of state secondary school teachers (57%) said their pupils never sang together in assembly, while just 13% of private secondary school teachers and only 4% of primary teachers said the same. Teachers were separately asked whether their schools had a choir. Just over a third (36%) of teachers at state secondaries reported having no choir at their school, compared to just 8% of private school secondary teachers.Having access to multiple school choirs was much more common at private schools, with three quarters (77%) of private secondary teachers saying their school had more than one choir, compared to 27% of state secondary teachers.Jackie Bowen, head teacher at The East Manchester Academy, says secondary school pupils can feel \"embarrassed - or that maybe it's not cool to sing like it was in primary school\".But she says singing and music are priorities at the school.Dan Nelson / BBCJackie Bowen says music is part of the fabric of school life for her pupils\"We know the intrinsic value of music, but also what it does for students' development, mental health, its impact on academic achievements,\" she says. \"So we've run lots of initiatives to try and break down barriers to music.\" The school offers a music hub at the school once a week, offering pupils time with specialist teachers from the Royal Northern College of Music. At lesson changeover, students hear classical music instead of the traditional bell. The school has also established its first gospel choir. Year 11 student Mercy, who's part of the choir, says she always wanted to continue singing at secondary school.\"In primary they say you have to sing, but when you come to secondary it's a choice, so most people don't do it,\" she says. \"I feel like we should all release our voices to the world. Whether you're good or not, just sing.\"Kate McGough / BBCMercy is part of her school's gospel choir and says she enjoys singingThere has been a 25% drop in pupils studying GCSE music at schools in England over the last fifteen years, despite an uptick in the most recent stats. That is partly down to the introduction of a progress measure for schools called the English Baccalaureate in 2010, which assessed schools based on how many pupils took English, maths, sciences, geography or history and a language - and how well they performed.The government recently announced that it would be changing the school curriculum in England to make it easier for more schools to offer arts subjects like music.There has been some improvement in recruiting new music teachers this year, but the levels still fall 35% short of government's target for trainee music teachers in the most recent stats.James Manwaring, president of the Music Teachers Association - which represents music teachers across both state and private schools - says every school should have a choir.\"All you need is a room and you need someone to lead it and you need students,\" says James, who is also the director of music at Windsor Learning Partnership - a multi-academy trust of six state schools.\"It's a shame to think some state schools aren't capitalising on that.\"He says changes to the school curriculum in England are \"very exciting\" for boosting music in schools, but says more funding and resources will be needed -  \"as well as retaining the wonderful music teachers we have out there\".Dan Nelson / BBCMusic teacher Rob Hatton set up the gospel choir for students at The East Manchester AcademyA Department for Education spokesperson said the government was committed to ensuring art, music and drama \"are no longer the preserve of a privileged few\".Ministers are \"investing millions\" to help schools invest in musical instruments and equipment, and \"supporting high quality music teaching through our Music Hubs\", they said. \"Our renewed curriculum will also give every young person the skills, knowledge and experiences needed to achieve and thrive, including encouraging more people to study music and other creative subjects.\"",

The author has strongly denied the allegations.A spokesperson for Waterstones, the well-known British book chain, told the BBC: \"HarperCollins have confirmed that David Walliams will no longer be appearing at our festival in Dundee.\" The festival will also take in two other locations - Lincoln, where it held its inaugural event earlier this year, and Taunton. Walliams has now been removed from the listed speakers list on the festival website.Authors set to appear include How to Train Your Dragon writer Cressida Cowell and Tom Gates creator Liz Pichon.Walliams is one of the UK's most successful children's authors, having sold more than 60 million copies worldwide in 55 languages.HarperCollins published his first children's book, The Boy in the Dress, in 2008.Some of his books, including Gangsta Granny and Billionaire Boy, have also been adapted into television films.He has published more than 40 books in total, including a Christmas book titled Santa & Son, which was published by HarperCollins in October.Two of his books - Mr Stink and The Boy in the Dress - have been adapted into TV films, which were shown on CBBC on Sunday.Walliams is also scheduled to appear on comedy panel show Would I Lie to You? on Boxing Day on BBC One.A spokesperson for the BBC said on Friday: \"While we're not making any changes to the festive schedules, we have no future projects directly involving David Walliams.\"A spokesperson for Walliams said he had \"never been informed of any allegations raised against him\" by his publisher.\"He was not party to any investigation or given any opportunity to answer questions.

    "body": "12 minutes agoChloe Hughes,West MidlandsandEllen Knight,in WhitchurchBoats have been left stricken following a reported sinkhole at a canal in ShropshireA major incident has been declared over what police have called a sinkhole at a canal in Shropshire, leaving boats either stricken in a gaping cavity or teetering on the edge of a drop.Pictures appear to show that the structural integrity of a stretch of waterway in Whitchurch has completely given way, raising flooding fears. Two narrowboats at the scene were said to have sunk into the hole shortly after 04:00 GMT, with another two at the edge. Water there looks to have drained away completely.Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said it was responding to a landslip and confirmed a canal was affected. Scott Hurford, area manager at SFRS, which sent 50 firefighters, said crews received reports at about 04:20 GMT that a canal bank had collapsed and there were large volumes of water in surrounding fields.According to West Mercia Police, there are no reports of casualties at the scene, in an area of Whitchurch called Chemistry.The force asked people to avoid the area and seek alternate routes.The Canal and River Trust described the incident as a breach on the canal, and said its priority was the safety of boaters and those in the immediate area.\"We are carrying out initial investigations into the possible cause of the breach and will provide more details in due course,\" it said. \"We will also seek to return water levels either side of the breach as soon as possible and are providing support to the boaters affected and those in the immediate area either side of the breach.\"Shropshire Fire and Rescue ServiceThere were no reports of any casualties, West Mercia Police saidMr Hurford told BBC Shropshire: \"The information we've had back is that the canal bank failed and that's what put the emergency call in.\"The water from the canal has leaked out of the canal into the surrounding fields… There are up to 15 people who had to be moved out of the way to safety, and there's a number of canal boats that have been affected, some of those have gone into the field and some are at the bottom of the canal.\"He added: \"Our job is the response phase, so we're there to save life, protect property and the environment, but we will support in the recovery phase.\"Scott Hurford said about 15 people had been taken to safetyAndy Hall, a councillor in Whitchurch, said: \"We've got two boats at the bottom of the sink hole that have fallen down, and we've got two boats that are teetering on the edge that could go in at any time,\" he told the BBC.\"Obviously [the fire service is] going to make those safe.\"He added: \"[People] thought that there was an earthquake.\"To the right, we've got the field which has taken probably about a million gallons of water out of the canal.\"He said the fire service had put in a flood gate to stop the flow of more from the compromised waterway.\"The most important thing is that the canal itself has been secured by fire and rescue,\" he said. \"Their biggest worry was that the canal was going to burst even more and flood residents in the town.\"He said that no one was on board \"the two boats that went down\", adding that people on the boats \"teetering over the edge\" had been helped to safety by fire crews.He said that contrary to speculation on social media, there had been no bridge collapse.Lorraine Barlow said she felt \"something amiss\"Lorraine Barlow, who lives on a boat called The Singing Kettle and was moored near the site, said: \"About 04:20 this morning I could feel that there was something amiss, there seemed to be a current coming from underneath the boat, and bubbling, it sounded really unusual. \"Then I was tilting to the middle of the canal, I could feel the ropes were getting tight.\"She said she left the boat and could see the fire service as well as search and rescue teams.\"There was no water on the canal,\" she said. \"I was worried about the ropes and about my canal boat hanging there.\"It's an awful thing, I was worried about the other people.\"Andy HallPolice have asked people to avoid the areaRelated internet links",

    "body": "10 minutes agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterThe gold price has hit another record high, trading above $4,400 (£3,275) an ounce for the first time.The price of the precious metal has risen on expectations the US central bank will cut interest rates further next year, analysts said.Gold started the year worth $2,600 an ounce, but geopolitical tensions, the Trump tariffs and expectations of rate cuts have added to investor demand for safe haven assets, such as gold and other commodities.The prices of other precious metals, such as silver and platinum, have also risen.The spot price of gold hit a high of $4,420 on Monday before slipping back.The gold price has risen more than 68% this year, the highest increase since 1979, according to Adrian Ash, director of research at gold bullion marketplace BullionVault.2025 has seen \"slow-burning trends around interest rates, around war and trade tensions\", Mr Ash said, which have helped to push up the price of gold.\"The precious metals market says that President Trump has really triggered something – and gold has gone crazy this year.\"You've got the trade war, the attacks on the US Federal Reserve and you've got geopolitical tensions, all of those provocations come from Trump,\" he said.Lower interest rate expectations typically mean lower returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to commodities such as gold and silver to get a return, but also diversify their portfolios.The consensus among analysts currently is that the US will lower interest rates twice in 2026.Another factor adding to demand is that central banks globally are expanding their own physical holdings of gold as a way to counter economic turbulence, reduce reliance on the US dollar, and diversify their own portfolios, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs, which predicted the pattern would continue in 2026.The steady increase in the price of gold across the year could be because it is seen as a way for traders to help shield themselves from the threat of inflation and economic turmoil, Anita Wright, chartered financial planner at Ribble Wealth Management, said.\"When confidence in financial assets and policy stability starts to wobble, gold tends to respond first as the primary monetary metal,\" Ms Wright said.A weaker US dollar has also helped push gold prices higher by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers.Other precious metals have also had record years. The price of silver also hit a record of $69.44 an ounce on Monday.For 2025 so far, silver is up 138% year-to-date and platinum is at a 17-year high, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by strong and supply constraints, according to analysts. Unlike gold, the other precious metals are also used widely in industrial manufacturing which helps stoke demand.Separately, oil prices rose on Monday, after the US ordered a \"blockade\" last week of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country.The price of Brent crude rose 53 cents to $60.99 a barrel, while US oil was up 1.6% to $57.40. However, both measures look set to end 2025 at prices lower than where they started the year.",

    "body": "In rebel-held Myanmar, civilians face devastating air strikes and a sham election14 hours agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondent in MyanmarAamir Peerzada/BBCSome Burmese refugees who fled Chin state are now taking shelter across the border in IndiaLate one night last month Iang Za Kim heard explosions in a neighbouring village, then fighter jets flying overhead. She ran out of her home to see smoke rising from a distance.\"We were terrified. We thought the junta's planes would bomb us too. So we grabbed what we could – some food and clothes and ran into the jungles surrounding our village.\"Iang's face quivers as she recounts the story of what happened on 26 November in K-Haimual, her village in Myanmar's western Chin State, and then she breaks down.She's among thousands of civilians who've fled their homes in recent weeks after the Burmese military launched a fierce campaign of air strikes, and a ground offensive in rebel-held areas across the country, to recapture territory ahead of elections starting on 28 December.Four other women sitting around her on straw mats also start crying. The trauma of what they've gone through to make it to safety is clearly visible.While the air strikes were the immediate cause for Iang to flee, she also doesn't want to be forced to participate in the election.\"If we are caught and refuse to vote, they will put us in jail and torture us. We've run away so that we don't have to vote,\" she says.Aamir Peerzada/BBCIang Za Kim had to flee her home after the junta launched air strikes nearbySome from Chin state have described the junta's latest offensive as the fiercest it has launched in more than three years.Many of the displaced have sought refuge in other parts of the state. Iang is among a group that crossed the border into India's Mizoram state. Currently sheltered in a rundown badminton court in Vaphai village, the group's few belongings they were able to carry are packed in plastic sacks.Indian villagers have given them food and basic supplies.Ral Uk Thang has had to flee his home at the age of 80, living in makeshift shelters in jungles for days, before finally making it to safety.\"We're afraid of our own government. They are extremely cruel. Their military has come into our and other villages in the past, they've arrested people, tortured them, and burned down homes,\" he says.It isn't easy to speak to Burmese civilians freely. Myanmar's military government does not allow free access in the country for foreign journalists. It took over the country in a coup in February 2021, shortly after the last election, and has since been widely condemned for running a repressive regime that has indiscriminately targeted civilians as it looks to crush the armed uprising against it across Myanmar.During its latest offensive, the junta last week targeted a hospital in Rakhine State, just south of Chin State. Rebel groups in Rakhine say at least 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured.The Chin Human Rights Organisation says that since mid-September at least three schools and six churches in Chin State have been targeted by junta airstrikes, killing 12 people including six children.The BBC has independently verified the bombing of a school in Vanha village on 13 October. Two students –Johan Phun Lian Cung, who was seven, and Zing Cer Mawi, 12 - were killed as they were attending lessons. The bombs ripped through their classrooms injuring more than a dozen other students.Myanmar's military government did not respond to the BBC's questions about the allegations.This is the second time Bawi Nei Lian and his young family – a wife and two young children - have been displaced. Back in 2021, soon after the coup, their home in Falam town was burnt down in an air strike. They rebuilt their lives in K-Haimual village. Now they're homeless again.\"I can't find the words to explain how painful and hard it is and what a difficult decision it was to make to leave. But we had to do it to stay alive,\" he says.\"I want the world to know that what the military is claiming – that this election is free and fair – this is absolutely false. When the main political party is not being allowed to contest the election, how can there be genuine democracy?\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCBawi Nei Lian (left) says the scheduled elections are a shamThe National League for Democracy party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, will not be contesting as most of its senior leaders including  Suu Kyi are in jail.\"We don't want the election. Because the military does not know how to govern our country. They only work for the benefit of their high-ranking leaders. When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's party was in power, we experienced a bit of democracy. But now all we do is cry and shed tears,\" says Ral Uk Thang.Iang Za Kim believes the election will be rigged. \"If we voted for a party not allied with the military, I believe they will steal our votes and claim we voted for them.\"The election will take place in phases, with a result expected around the end of January. Rebel groups have called it a sham.At the base of the Chin National Front in Myanmar, the most prominent rebel group operating in the state, the group's Vice Chairman Sui Khar says: \"This election is only being held to prolong military dictatorship. It's not about the people's choice. And in Chin State, they hardly control much area, so how can they hold an election?\"He points out the areas where the most intense fighting is ongoing on a map and tells us nearly 50 rebel fighters have been injured in just the past month. There have been deaths too, but so far the groups have not released a number.\"There are columns of hundreds of soldiers trying to advance into the northern part of Chin state from four directions,\" Sui Khar says. \"The soldiers are being supported by air strikes, artillery fire and by drone units.\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCAbel lost his right leg and his hands were severely wounded fighting against the juntaAccess to the base is extremely rare. Set amid thickly forested mountains, it is the heart of the resistance against the junta in Chin state.Sui Khar takes us to the hospital at the base. We see a group of injured fighters who were brought in overnight and had to undergo hours of surgery. Some of them have had to undergo amputations.Many of them were just schoolboys when the coup occurred in 2021. Just about adults now, they've let go of their dreams to fight on the frontline against the junta.Abel, 18, is in too much pain to speak. He was with a group of fighters trying to take back territory the junta captured a week ago. They won the battle, but Abel lost his right leg and has serious injuries to his hands as well.In a bed next to him is Si Si Maung, 19, who's also had a leg amputated.\"As the enemy was retreating we ran forward and I stepped on a landmine. We were injured in the explosion. Then we were attacked from the air. The airstrikes make things very difficult for us,\" he says. \"I've lost a leg, but even if I've to give up my life I'm happy to make the sacrifice so that future generations have a better life.\"The impact of the ferocity of the latest offensive is visible in room after room at the hospital.Yet, it's the support and grit of tens of thousands of youngsters like Si Si Maung, who picked up arms to fight against the junta, that have helped the rebels make rapid advances against a much more powerful rival in the past four-and-a-half years.Some like 80-year-old Ral Uk Thang hope that after the election, the junta will retreat, and he will be able to go back home.\"But I don't think I will live to see democracy restored in Myanmar,\" he says. \"I hope my children and grandchildren can witness it some day.\"Additional reporting by Aamir Peerzada, Sanjay Ganguly and Aakriti Thapar",

    "body": "Watch: Images, cassettes and high-profile figures - What's in the latest Epstein files?A pair of US lawmakers have threatened legal action against US Attorney General Pam Bondi, after her deadline to release all government files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was met only in part. The release of the Department of Justice (DoJ) documents was highly anticipated but in the end, only a portion of the available material was made public.A leading campaigner on the issue, Republican congressman Thomas Massie, said he could try to bring contempt proceedings against the attorney general as a result.The DoJ insists it is complying with its legal obligations, and Bondi herself has said she is part of \"the most transparent administration in American history\".The phrase \"Epstein files\" refer to the trove of information that was amassed by the US justice department during its two criminal investigations into Epstein.A law that compelled the release of the full trove was signed by US President Donald Trump in November, after pressure from his supporters and members of his own Republican Party. Friday was the deadline for the release of the material. Although some material was released, there were many redactions and other information was withheld - which angered Massie and his allies, as well as survivors of Epstein's abuse. Trump himself is yet to comment.The DoJ has said that more material will follow in the coming weeks. But speaking to CBS programme Face the Nation on Sunday, Massie suggested that the justice department was \"flouting the spirit and the letter of the law\".He went on to say: \"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn't require going through the courts.\"Inherent contempt is a little-used legal recourse that can be used by either the Senate or House - the upper and lower chambers of Congress respectively - which has not been invoked for nearly a century, according to the American Bar Association.Massie added that \"Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now\", referring to a Democratic congressman who has also been prominent in the campaign for the release of the full Epstein files.Speaking to the same programme, Khanna gave further detail on how the contempt proceedings could work. \"We're building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents,\" he said.Unlike an impeachment effort - another option that would be theoretically available to critics of Bondi - the contempt move would only require support from the House of Representatives, Massie pointed out. Bondi's deputy Todd Blanche was defiant during an interview with another broadcaster on Sunday.Asked by the Meet the Press programme on NBC News whether he took threats from Congress members seriously, the deputy attorney general said: \"Not even a little bit. Bring it on. We are doing everything we're supposed to be doing to comply with the statute.\"Blanche pointed to the magnitude of the task. \"You're talking about a million or so pages of documents,\" he said. \"Virtually all of them contain victim information.\" He continued: \"And if by complying with the statute we don't produce everything on Friday, we produce things next week and the week after, that's still compliance with the statute.\"Speaking to the same programme, another member of Khanna's party, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, said contempt or impeachment efforts would be \"premature\".\"We have tools in appropriations bills and other tools to force compliance if somebody is dragging their feet and I'd rather focus on those tools,\" Kaine said.Blanche said elsewhere on Sunday that certain Epstein-related files that were originally released on Friday were later removed by the DoJ from its website because of concerns raised by victims.One of those files - an image featuring Trump - was later reinstated after review, said Blanche.",

    "body": "23 minutes agoMalcolm Prior,Rural affairs producer,Duncan Kennedy,CorrespondentandIan AikmanBloomberg via Getty ImagesA stock image of a hen from BelgiumHen cages will be banned as part of a raft of proposals to improve animal welfare standards in England, the government has promised.Pig farrowing cages, used to contain sows during birth and nursing to stop them rolling over onto their young, will also be outlawed.The National Farmers' Union said laws should also require imports to be produced to the same standards to prevent unfair competition for British farmers.The package of reforms, which also includes plans to ban trail hunting and puppy farming, have been described by Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds as \"the most ambitious animal welfare strategy in a generation\", but the Conservatives said it showed Labour did not care about rural Britain.The government aims to implement the new strategy by 2030.As well as ending \"confinement systems\" in farming, the government is looking at outlawing controversial so-called \"Frankenchickens\" - a term used by animal welfare campaigners to describe fast-growing breeds.Anthony Field, head of Compassion in World Farming UK, said the government was \"raising the bar for farmed animal welfare\".Conventional battery cages for individual hens are already banned in the UK, where the RSPCA says an estimated 80% of hens are free range.This new law will ban the use of larger so-called \"colony cages\", which contain multiple chickens.The RSPCA's head of public affairs David Bowles said removing the final 20% of hens from cages should not pose a \"massive commercial problem\".NFU President Tom Bradshaw urged the government to ensure imported food was not produced at a lower standard than would be legal in the UK.He warned that this would lead to British farmers facing unfair competition from cheaper goods around the world.\"If we don't implement the changes that we want to have in our production systems here within our import standards, then all we do is export our industry overseas,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.The Department for Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says it \"will not lower food standards and will uphold high animal welfare standards as part of our approach to trade\".It adds that it will \"always consider whether overseas produce has an unfair advantage and any impact that may have\".The National Pig Association said it would be \"following the next steps closely\" on farrowing crates and was itself looking towards more flexible systems.The British Poultry Council have been approached by the BBC for comment.Getty ImagesThe government has vowed to end puppy farming as part of its wide-ranging strategyMeanwhile, the RSPCA said a puppy farm ban could be a \"real game-changer\" and that it would work with the government on writing the legislation to \"make sure there are no loopholes\". Puppy farming is a term used to describe the practice of keeping dogs in poor conditions where they produce multiple litters a year to maximise profits.Animal rights campaigners say the practice can lead to long-term health issues in puppies. It is not currently illegal to breed a large number of dogs. Breeders selling three or more litters a year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland must undergo an inspection to get a licence.The government says it will launch a consultation on introducing a new registration scheme for all dog breeders, and on improving the health and welfare standards required for licences.Getty ImagesThe Countryside Alliance said a ban on trail hunting was \"completely unnecessary\"The government is also looking to ban the use of snare traps in the countryside and confirmed it would carry out a consultation on the proposed ban on trail hunting in 2026.Trail hunting involves using a rag with a natural scent on to lay a trail ahead of a hunt, which is then followed by the hounds - but live animal scents could be picked up by the pack instead.Reynolds told the BBC that while Labour had previously banned fox hunting in 2004 \"we have seen that people are trying to get around that ban by using trail hunting in some cases\". \"Obviously that's also a problem of enforcement, it's not just the legislation, but we are determined to go further, which is why banning trail hunting is in the animal welfare strategy,\" she said.\"We know sometimes it is used as a smokescreen for fox hunting.\"But Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said it was \"unbelievable\" that the government would be spending more parliamentary time on hunting.He said: \"Revisiting this pointless and divisive issue is completely unnecessary.\"People across the countryside will be shocked that after Labour's attack on family farms and its neglect of rural communities it thinks banning trail hunting and snares used for fox control are a political priority.\"Conservative chairman Kevin Hollinrake called the ban an \"attack on rural Britain and British culture\", accusing the government of \"punishing the law-abiding majority who support legal trail hunting\".",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesByChris Fawkes Lead Weather Presenter and Ben RichLead Weather PresenterUpdated 7 hours agoThe festivities are fast approaching – but if you're dreaming of a white Christmas you may end up disappointed.Temperatures will drop this week as easterly winds develop, bringing cold air from eastern Europe.However, high pressure will also be building which will mean a lack of widespread precipitation - and hence little chance of widespread snow.It is possible that a few wintry showers could drift into southern parts of the UK - or that thick cloud in north-eastern areas could produce the odd flake of snow - so in technical terms a white Christmas is still possible.Turning chillyDecember has so far mostly been dominated by low pressure, bringing outbreaks of heavy rain and mild westerly or southerly winds.This is now starting to change, thanks to high pressure, which is going to build strongly across Scandinavia before drifting across the northern half of the UK - just in time for Christmas.Combined with low pressure which will be centred over southern Europe or north Africa, this will mean a feed of chilly easterly winds.Image caption, Easterly winds will be strongest in southern parts of the UK on Christmas DayInitially there will be a lot of cloud, which could produce some spots of drizzle or even the odd flake of snow over high ground.However, by Christmas Day more sunshine is expected, albeit with windy conditions in southern areas.Overnight frost and fog are also possible.Will it be a White Christmas?Join BBC Weather’s Carol Kirkwood, Matt Taylor and Barra Best, along with famous faces Jeremy Vine and Lucy Porter, to explore where our fascination with a white Christmas comes from.Could it be a white Christmas?Forecasting snow in the UK is notoriously difficult.Partly it will depend upon exactly how cold the air moving across the UK is, but the other necessary ingredient is precipitation - something falling from the sky.At the moment it looks like most places will be dry on Christmas Day, which will be welcomed in areas which have recently seen heavy rain such as Cumbria and south Wales.However, a few computer weather models do hint at a little wet weather pushing across the Channel Islands and possibly fringing into the far south of England.If this was to happen it could mean a little sleet or snow mixing in, especially over high ground.It is also possible that thick cloud rolling into the east of Scotland could give a few flakes of light snow over the hills and mountains.So the chances of a white Christmas are low - but not zero - and you can keep up to date with any changes in the forecast on the BBC Weather website and app.What is a white Christmas?The definition of a white Christmas is just a single snowflake recorded falling at any point during the 24 hours of 25 December at any of the Met Office's network of around 300 weather observing stations.Snow already lying on the ground on Christmas Day does not count.An \"official white Christmas\" has happened more often than not since 1960, but new analysis of Met Office data by the BBC shows that snow falling on Christmas Day is rare for most of us - and getting rarer.The last time the UK saw a widespread white Christmas was back in 2010, when snow fell at 19% of weather stations and, very unusually, 83% of stations reported snow lying on the ground.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJulian PaszkiewiczYou & YoursSuppliedClare Lane says she had \"no idea\" she signed up to a subscription when she bought the sportswearA woman who found she had spent thousands of pounds on a monthly subscription with a sportswear firm after having bought two pairs of leggings seven years earlier says she had \"no idea\" she had signed up to such a commitment.Clare Lane said she had bought the leggings from Fabletics, an online sportswear retailer, in 2017 and \"as far as I was concerned, it was a one-off purchase and that was the end of it\".\"I wore the leggings, they were decent. I hadn't thought about it at all in that time,\" Ms Lane said.She told BBC Radio 4's You & Yours that she only realised she had also taken out a subscription when she and her husband were changing credit cards in October this year.Purchases on their existing card were being automatically paid off from their joint bank account, she explained.Ms Lane, from Leeds, said that when she went back to her credit card statements, she was horrified to find monthly payments of about £50 to Fabletics going back seven years - adding up to a total of almost £5,000.The company has since refunded most of Ms Lane's money, but its general manager for Europe told the BBC that customers must also take \"a little bit of responsibility\".Cindy Ord/WireImageFabletics founder Kate Hudson is currently starring in the film Song Sung BlueFabletics was set up in 2013 and co-founded by Hollywood actress and singer Kate Hudson.The company has also run high-profile collaborations with Lizzo and Khloe Kardashian.It claims to be an innovator in bringing subscriptions to fashion, and its latest UK accounts showed revenue of just under £20m in 2024.Fabletics runs a \"VIP\" subscription service which means that for a monthly fee of £59.99 its customers get store credit which can only be used to buy products from its website. The firm has told the BBC it tells customers four times during purchases that they are signing up for a subscription, adding that it is easy to cancel.However, several of its customers have told the BBC that was not made clear to them.Ms Lane also said the firm's emails had all filtered into her junk folder.She said that getting her money back from the firm after discovering she had been paying a monthly subscription had proved difficult.\"It's been a whole series of emails and phone calls, a lot of correspondence and formal recorded delivery letters,\" she said.\"We've tried to go through our credit card company to retrieve some of the money. We've gone to Trading Standards.\"'Waiting for resolution'Other Fabletics customers told the BBC they had faced similar problems.Lowri De Gennaro, from Llangollen in Wales, said she had bought a pair of its leggings on a new credit card in March 2023.She explained it was only 30 months later that she discovered Fabletics had billed her £54.99 a month for a VIP Membership. Ms De Gennaro said she had since got back £500 from the company, but she had been told the remaining £1,100 would not be refunded as her VIP credits had since expired.\"The customer service is dreadful. I email daily to no avail. I Facebook Message daily and I am still waiting for a resolution,\" Ms De Gennaro said.Meanwhile, a woman from Lanarkshire in Scotland, who only wanted to be known as Claire, told You & Yours that she had lost £2,000 in a similar manner.She said the experience had left her feeling \"physically sick\".'Pretty fair deal'Mark Ralea, Fabletics' general manager for Europe, told You & Yours the firm did attempt to contact by email any customers who were building large credit balances.Mr Ralea also defended the company's use of a subscription model.\"We want to be as sustainable as possible, so we know how many products we are producing based on our subscription base,\" he said.\"If you're not going to a gym for one month, the money is gone. In our case, you can still use that money for products, which is a pretty fair deal compared to any other membership.  \"We are trying to be as transparent as possible with every single customer.\"Mr Ralea said the firm had refunded most of Ms Lane's money out of goodwill, and he insisted VIP subscriptions were easy to cancel.However, when challenged on this, Mr Ralea responded by saying his customers had responsibilities too.\"I'm checking my credit card statements every month. We try to help as much as we can, but a little bit of responsibility is on people as well,\" he said.Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds promised to make subscriptions fairer, but  new laws have been delayedThe government has estimated that UK consumers lose £1.6bn a year in unwanted subscriptions.New laws on so-called \"subscription traps\", forcing companies to be clearer about subscriptions and make it easier for customers to cancel without penalty, were due to be introduced in the spring.However, the Department of Business and Trade has confirmed these have been delayed until next autumn at the earliest after retailers raised questions.Mr Ralea told You & Yours he believed Fabletics already complied with the new rules.Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.More on this story",

    "body": "1 hour agoBranwen JeffreysEducation EditorA leading academic who led a recent government review into sex and gender data collection has threatened legal action against the University of Bristol, claiming it failed to protect her freedom of speech.Prof Alice Sullivan has also written to the university regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), after a talk she gave at the university was disrupted by a trans rights protest. Universities have a legal duty to uphold the right to free speech, while balancing that with the right to protest by those who object. The University of Bristol rejected her claims and said the talk went ahead safely - despite \"unacceptable disruption\" - in line with its \"strong commitment to upholding free speech\".Universities have a longstanding legal duty to protect the rights of staff, students and visiting speakers to express views which others might find offensive. That has come into sharper focus with a new freedom of speech law in higher education, which came into force in August in England. The University of Bristol said every action it had taken was in support of free speech.Prof Sullivan's review for the government, published in March, recommended that data on biological sex and gender identity should be recorded as distinct categories. She said she was first invited to speak about her work by an academic at the University of Bristol in July 2024, and agreed to an event that autumn. In a new letter to the university, which warns she is willing to bring a legal challenge, Prof Sullivan's lawyers claimed that complaints about transphobia from the LGBTQ+ staff network were given priority and influenced the university.She alleged that her freedom of speech was restricted in a number of ways, including:The number of attendees being restricted to 60 staff, postgraduate students and members of the publicUndergraduate students being prohibited from attendingLimited advertising being provided for the eventA venue for the event being chosen which was vulnerable to protestsReasonable steps not being taken to prevent the talk being disrupted The OfS published guidance for universities on how the new law on upholding free speech might work when it came into effect in August.It says universities should not deny the use of its premises on the grounds of a speaker's opinions or ideas, and should have a clear process for making sure steps are taken to allow events to go ahead.It says universities should not \"interfere with free speech or academic freedom any more than is necessary to ensure that the event goes ahead safely and within the law\".The letter from Prof Sullivan's lawyers says the University of Bristol had first suggested the event was held online, rather than in person.When asked by the BBC why she had rejected that offer, Prof Sullivan said she did not realise what the scale of potential protests would be, but accepted that some people might have strongly opposing views on gender identity and had the right to express them. \"Everyone has a right to peaceful protest, but that must never amount to a heckler's veto, which means shutting down other people's right to speak,\" she said.\"This isn't just about my rights as a visiting speaker, this is about the rights of the university community to hold discussions and to have people come and listen.\"Following a delay, the event was scheduled for 22 October 2025.As Prof Sullivan arrived, some attendees filmed the protest on their phones at the front of the building. Videos - seen and verified by the BBC - show some of the protesters making rude gestures as others held signs.  Prof Sullivan told the BBC it was like a \"zombie apocalypse\" as some protesters pressed up against the window with placards and loudhailers. The fire alarm was set off more than once, disrupting the talk, until security staff advised they move to a higher floor. As she left after the event, Prof Sullivan said she heard \"howls of 'shame on you, shame on you'\". The police told the BBC they had attended the event and said no arrests had been made.The letter that has now been sent by Prof Sullivan's lawyers says the University of Bristol had 15 months to find a secure location on campus for the talk.It adds that documents disclosed by the university reveal there had been complaints made by its LGBTQ+ staff network against her speaking.Prof Sullivan says she has raised many of her concerns with the OfS, which as regulator of universities in England has the power to fine institutions if they fail to uphold freedom of speech. Earlier this year, the OfS handed out a record fine of £585,000 to the University of Sussex, warning that its transgender and non-binary inclusion policy had a \"chilling effect\" on freedom of speech.Kathleen Stock had previously left her job as professor of philosophy at Sussex following protests against her gender-critical views, which generally say that a person's sex cannot be changed and takes precedence over their gender identity. Following the Sussex fine, the University of Bristol withdrew a similar policy which said all staff were responsible for removing \"transphobic and anti-trans material\" from campus.   In August, a new freedom of speech law came into force, strengthening the legal obligations on universities to uphold freedom of speech. The government has not yet brought in the complaints process promised as part of the stronger powers. Prof Sullivan has told Arif Ahmed, the OfS's director of free speech, she is concerned that \"gender ideology\" led to Bristol's \"actions to obstruct and frustrate my talk\". She told the BBC that senior managers at the university \"could have apologised, and they could have said we intend to do better in future\". \"That is what I want from them,\" she said.A University of Bristol spokesperson said the talk went ahead safely and in line with its \"strong commitment to upholding free speech\".\"Although protesters caused unacceptable disruption, appropriate measures were in place to enable the event to continue and to protect the speaker and attendees,\" they said.The university added that the vice-chancellor had subsequently met Prof Sullivan. \"We refute claims that we failed to protect her freedom of speech; every action we took was in support of this and the restrictions she outlines were all necessary for public safety,\" the spokesperson said.\"Our stance is clear - free speech must be lawful. There is no protection within the law for abusive speech that incites violence, harassment or discrimination. \"Clearly the intimidating behaviour of protesters was not peaceful and we have condemned their unacceptable behaviour.\"We will take disciplinary action if anyone from the university community is identified as being involved.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoEve WebsterBristol, VirginiaBBCThe US town of Bristol, population around 44,000, is a divided community.Split between Virginia and Tennessee, the state line runs literally down main street. While both sides have much in common, there is one major difference - abortion is illegal in Tennessee. This has been the case since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling which gave individual states, rather than the federal government, the power to legislate abortion, triggering 12 states to pass near-total bans.So the city's only abortion clinic, Bristol Women's Health, moved less than a mile down the road to continue practising legally in Virginia.But just because abortion is legal in Virginia it doesn't mean the battle for abortion access is over.\"It's like whack-a-mole,\" said Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership. They assist people travelling into Virginia to get an abortion at Bristol Women's Health Clinic.\"As soon as one approach doesn't work, the anti-abortion crowd pops up in Bristol and tries another.\"Barbara Schwartz (on right) with other volunteers at the clinicOn 22 December, Bristol's Circuit Court will hear the clinic's case against an eviction notice served by their landlords, brothers Chase and Chadwick King in April 2024. Lawyers for the clinic argue it has the right to renew its lease for a total of six more years. But if the judge rules in favour of the building's owners, the clinic will be forced to find a new home.This is not the landlords' first attempt to remove the clinic from their property. The brothers claimed that the clinic fraudulently concealed that they perform abortions, to which they maintain to be \"adamantly opposed\". The case was dismissed in September last year, with Judge Sage Johnson ruling:\"If [the landlords] had conducted a simple internet search on their tenants, as any reasonably prudent landlord likely would, they would have discovered that the clinic did, in fact, provide abortion services as is plainly stated on their website.\"Clinic owner Diana Derzis, who declined to comment on the hearing, previously stated that she hopes to keep the clinic in the city, even if they are evicted. However, she noted there are few other suitable facilities in Bristol, Virginia.The clinic leaving Bristol would be a \"blow\" to abortion access, according to Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership.  Since Roe v Wade was overturned, states where abortions are legal have become destinations for out-of-state abortion seekers, with 155,000 people crossing state lines last year, according to the Guttmacher Institute (GI).The organisation also found that over 9,200 people travelled to Virginia alone to have the procedure done last year.\"Bristol's position means the clinic is the closest place by several hours to get a safe and legal abortion for millions of southerners.\"Victoria Cobb, the director of anti-abortion lobbyist the Family Foundation, also notes that Bristol's location places it at the \"epicentre of the debate\".Ms Cobb launched the first of several efforts to restrict abortion in Bristol by making use of local bylaws. The tactic is being used by anti-abortion campaigners in states which permit abortion. The logic is simple: If you can't win at Capitol Hill, why not fight at City Hall?\"Locals don't want to see their town turn into an abortion destination location,\" Ms Cobb states. \"We're happy to help them.\"Sammi Cooper is opposed to abortion and protests against the clinicThe Family Foundation has argued in the past that the existence of the clinic goes against zoning regulation, which prohibits buildings from being used in a way that could endanger life.\"Why would this not extend to unborn life?\" asked Ms Cobb.Their ordinance said no new clinics should be allowed to open in Bristol, and expansion of the existing clinic should be blocked.Similar rules have been used in other parts of the US to restrict abortion, including nearby Washington and Russell counties. But Prof Laura Hermer, an expert on abortion regulations in the US, says these efforts are largely \"virtue signalling\".\"I'd be surprised if many of these towns have any healthcare, let alone abortion, providers,\" she said.The debate became heated in Bristol, as the council agreed to look into the matter.\"It has been more stressful than dealing with a parking lot. It's not something that has really come to the local level before,\" Jay Detrick, the city's planning director told the BBC.Ultimately, the city's attorney found that imposing restrictions on a medical facility was not in their remit. Soon after the city decided not to intervene, another group decided to try and shut the clinic down - this one spearheaded by Texas pastor Mark Lee Dickson. The pastor has lobbied councils across the US to enforce the Comstock Act, a 152-year-old federal law that prohibits sending or receiving material via post which might induce an abortion.Ninety-three local authorities have passed ordinances to enforce the Comstock Act, even closing a Planned Parenthood clinic in Lubbock, Texas.Pastor Dickson is hopeful his ordinance filed in Bristol will have the same result. It has not yet been considered by the Council, but he remains optimistic.\"A local government's tabling or rejecting of such a measure doesn't by any means mean the initiative is dead,\" he told the BBC.Kimberly Smith, SLAAP's co-founder, anticipates further campaigns. She says anti-abortion activists target Bristol due to its unusual political make-up:\"They come here because we were a red part of a blue state. If they chip away here, then that weakens the entire framework of a state's rights.\"Indeed, even if the clinic wins its case this week and can remain in place, its opponents are undeterred, Pastor Dickson tells the BBC.\"As long as the cries of unborn babies are silenced in Bristol there will be an effort to push the City Council to fulfil their obligation to protect unborn Bristolians.\"",

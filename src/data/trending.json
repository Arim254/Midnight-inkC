    "body": "'England are the Super League of Europe' - how Premier League is dominating eliteImage source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal have won all four of their games in this season's Champions League without conceding a goalByGary RoseBBC Sport journalistEnglish clubs appear to be bossing things in Europe as, for the second time in this season's Champions League, five sides from the Premier League won in a single round of fixtures.Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham all won their games this week, with the first four of those sides now sitting inside the top eight - the positions they need to be in to qualify automatically for the knockouts.Only Chelsea failed to take all three points as they were held to a surprising 2-2 draw by Qarabag on Wednesday, but they are still handily placed at the halfway stage of the group stage as they sit 12th.Before this season the Champions League had never seen five teams from one country all win in a single round of matches. Now teams from England have managed it twice.\"In five years' time we will look at this period of the next five years as the domination of England, I don't see it any other way,\" Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague told BBC Sport.\"Bayern are doing really, really well and they can disrupt that. PSG will have their moments, I think Barcelona and Real Madrid are lagging behind, but there is nobody else.\"So following this dominant start, are English teams favourite to win the Champions League? And how likely is a fourth all-English final?Why are English teams doing so well?Arsenal are hoping to win the Champions League for the first time and, while it is still early days, they have made a hugely encouraging start.Themselves, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan are the only sides with a perfect record so far in the league phase, sitting joint top with 12 points from a possible 12.As well as keeping a clean sheet in each of their four games so far they have also scored 11 goals - a scoring record bettered only by Bayern Munich, Paris St-Germain (both 14), Borussia Dortmund (13) and Barcelona (12).Collectively, English teams are outperforming those from other countries, winning 17 of their 24 games, scoring a total of 56 goals - 14 more than any others - and conceding just 17, a record only bettered by teams from France, who have three clubs in the competition compared to six from England.So why are English teams doing so well? A significant factor is the financial muscle they are able to flex compared to teams from the rest of Europe, enabling them to spend more on transfer fees and wages to attract the best talent.TV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.This summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.To highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent this year was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.More money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big this summer to increase their strength in depth as they lead the way in the Premier League and sit joint-top of the league standings in the Champions League.\"Obviously in a knockout competition anything can happen but in terms of money, talent, coaching, facilities and even the talent in the offices, England are the super league of Europe,\" Balague added.\"I am not saying this perhaps with the jealousy of Spanish football in general, it is just a reflection of what is happening.\"Could a record number of English clubs progress?This is the first Champions League season to feature six clubs from one nation and history will be made if all six of England's representatives go through.Back in 2017, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed, making England the first country to have five teams in the knockouts of the competition.However just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.In the final, Liverpool were beaten by Real Madrid.According to Opta's predictions, Arsenal have a 99.8% chance of progressing to the knockouts, with Manchester City on 97.4% and Liverpool on 95.5%.However, the predictions model is a little less confident over the automatic progress of the other three sides with Newcastle on 82%, Chelsea on 80.8% and Tottenham on 72%.Former Liverpool midfielder Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport: \"I'd say at the moment it is [significant what English teams are doing], but it doesn't matter what goes on at the moment because we saw what happened last year, when Liverpool were dominating and finished top of the league stage - and then they were suddenly knocked out by PSG who had been rubbish up until then.\"So I just don't see at the moment, unless you get knocked out, what effect it is going to have and it does not mean the English teams are going to get through the knockout stages because it all depends on the draw, and how you are set up later in the competition.\"Which other teams are doing well?Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Bayern Munich's Harry Kane has five goals in four Champions League gamesBayern Munich, led by the in-form Harry Kane, boast a perfect record so far in the league phase.No team has scored more than their 14 goals so far - with Kane accounting for five of those - while they have conceded just three. It is currently mostly the usual suspects occupying the top eight slots - the positions sides need to finish to qualify automatically for the knockouts - with Inter Milan, Paris St-Germain and Real Madrid joining Bayern and the four English sides in those positions.Azerbaijani side Qarabag are showing that money isn't everything after they held Chelsea to a draw on Wednesday and currently have seven points from four games, putting them well on the way to sealing at least a play-off spot.What will likely be needed to reach knockouts?Taking last season - the first to utilise the league phase format - as a barometer for what is needed to finish in the top eight, then around 16 points from the eight games should be sufficient.It means teams are likely going to need to win five of their eight games, which this season's Premier League sides are on course to achieve.There is a lot more leeway to secure a play-off place, which goes to the sides who finish between ninth and 24th. Last season, Club Brugge secured the final qualifying spot for the play-offs, winning just three of their eight games on their way to a total of 11 points.Who has the best chance of going all the way?Media caption, Merino scores twice as Arsenal thrash Slavia PragueIt is still early days but Arsenal's superb start has them rated as the most likely to go all the way and win the competition.Opta predictions give them a 23.4% chance of winning the Champions League, while Manchester City are predicted to be the second most-likely English team to reach the final at 12.5%. Liverpool are third favourites from England with 11.3%.But former Everton midfielder Leon Osman believes the true test of the Premier League teams' capabilities will come in the knockouts.He said: \"It is great [what English teams are currently doing], but it is only when you then get to the knockout stages, where it is literally one team through and one going home, that is the true test and that is when the big-hitters turn up.\"But Osman added that while it is early days, there could be signs that Premier League teams are now getting the balance right between being able to be competitive at home and abroad.\"We have probably expected this [dominance] for years, but it hasn't quite materialised before,\" he said.\"Maybe that is down to the competitiveness of the Premier League, which makes it hard to combine the two, but maybe this year, they are starting to get the balance right.\"What chance is there of an all-English final?Of the 31 seasons of at least one English side in the Champions League, 16 of those campaigns have seen every Premier League representative progress beyond the group stage or first group stage.Of those 16 occasions there have been 11 appearances in the final from English sides, with 2007-08, 2018-19 and 2020-21 having all-English finals.But according to Opta predictions the most likely final at this stage would see an English side face a German side, with Arsenal (38.8%) and Bayern Munich (27.3%) the favourites to get there.",

President Donald Trump has responded to Mamdani’s victory by writing on social media that the government shutdown and his name not being on the ballot were the reasons why the Democrats won.\nBut with Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill also winning their governors races in Virginia and New Jersey, there is a renewed sense of hope within the party that this could mark a turning point after the 2024 presidential election.\nJustin, Sarah and Marianna assess whether the Democrats will be able to capitalise on their success, and how the Republican Party might respond.\nHOSTS:\n* Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n* Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter \n* Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n* Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n* Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n* Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n* Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Alix Pickles.

    "body": "4 hours agoAnbarasan EthirajanGlobal News ReporterItaly says seven of its citizens are missing in Nepal after trying to climb a Himalayan peak in the north-east of the country.Officials said the Italian team was at the base camp of Dolma Khang peak, which has an elevation of 6,332m (20,774ft), in Dolakha district.Three other Italian climbers have been confirmed dead this week, including in an avalanche that struck close to Dolma Khang on Monday. A senior Italian diplomat from neighbouring India has arrived in Kathmandu to coordinate with the Nepalese authorities and search teams.Nepal has been hit by avalanches and ferocious storms in the past week, killing and injuring a number of climbers and their local guides.\"At this stage, the local authorities have confirmed the deaths of three Italian climbers,\" Rome's foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. \"There remains no news of seven other Italian nationals, including Marco Di Marcello and Markus Kircheler.\"The foreign ministry said both Mr Marcello and Mr Kircheler were in the Yalung Ri area, where Monday's avalanche struck. Italian Paolo Cocco was among seven climbers who were already confirmed to have died near the Yalung Ri base camp. On Tuesday, Mr Marcello's family told Italy's Ansa news agency that his satellite radio signal was continuing to update and appeared to be moving. A Nepali tourism official, Ram Krishna Lamichhane, told the BBC they had been in contact with rescue teams searching the base camp at Dolma Khang peak, which was hit by an avalanche.\"According to the information we have, five people, including three foreign climbers and two Nepali guides, are missing in the Dolma Khang base camp area,\" Mr Lamichhane said.There have been conflicting reports about the number of dead and missing climbers in the area in recent days, as well as their nationalities. Mr Lamichhane added that they were also coordinating with the trekking agency that had organised their expedition to Dolma Khang to find out more details on the missing.As well as Paolo Cocco, the bodies of two other Italian climbers who went missing while attempting to scale the Panbari peak in western Nepal have also been recovered. Stefano Farronato and Alessandro Caputo were part of a three-man group that became stranded along with three local guides last week.The group had been granted permission to climb the 6,887m peak, but were reported missing when they lost contact with the base camp following heavy snowfall on 28 October.The third member of the group, another Italian man, was rescued along with one sherpa.Autumn is a popular season for trekkers and mountaineers in Nepal as weather conditions and visibility have tended to be better. However, the risk of severe weather and avalanches remains.Last week, Cyclone Montha triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, stranding people in the Himalayas.",

Bevan inflicted \"catastrophic\" brain injuries on the toddler in a \"brutal\" assault in her family home, his sentencing hearing in 2023 was told.Lola was attacked on the night between 16 and 17 July 2020 while she was in Bevan's care, and was left with 101 surface injuries on her body.Judge Mr Justice Martin Griffiths described Bevan's actions as \"an assertion of superiority over the only person he could feel superior to – a helpless child\".Family photoLola James was descibed in court as \"happy\" and \"beautiful\"Bevan, from Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, was ordered to serve at least 28 years in jail.Sinead James, Lola's mother, was sentenced to six years for causing or allowing her daughter's death at her home.The incident at the prison comes less than a month after the death of the paedophile singer Ian Watkins, who was fatally stabbed at the same facility on 11 October.A Prison Service spokesperson said: \"HMP Wakefield prisoner Kyle Bevan's death was confirmed on 5 November.\"We are unable to comment further while the police investigate.\"The incident comes less than a month after the death of paedophile singer Ian Watkins at the high-security jailIn September, an inspection report found levels of violence at HMP Wakefield had increased.Speaking at the time, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it had \"taken further action in high-security prisons such as Wakefield to reduce violence\".Andrea Coomber, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said HMP Wakefield was under similar pressures to other prisons but was \"insulated\" due to its status. \"Because it is of a higher security clearance, it actually has more guarantees of staffing and resource than lots of other jails have,\" she said.\"So in some ways, Wakefield should actually be doing better and be safer.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "5 minutes agoSeveral papers lead on the mistaken release of two prisoners from Wandsworth Prison in London. \"Not again\" is the Daily Mirror's assessment of the mishap, which occurred soon after sex offender Hadush Kebatu was wrongly freed from a prison in Essex. The blunders show that prisons are \"in chaos\", the paper writes.Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was \"grilled\" by MPs at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday over whether he knew of any more inmates that had been wrongly released, Metro leads. The paper reports that Lammy was told about at least one of the prisoners before PMQs, but instead \"castigated the state of the criminal justice system inherited from the Conservatives\" at the despatch box.The government was told to \"get a grip on the prison fiasco\" following the \"shocking\" release of the prisoners, the Daily Express writes. A \"major manhunt\" is under way to find 24-year-old Algerian national Brahim Kaddour-Cherif and 35-year-old William Smith. The hunt for the two men comes as police chiefs warn that Labour's \"soft-justice\" reforms will \"unleash a crimewave on the streets\", the Daily Mail reports. The \"unprecedented intervention\" was issued as the government \"was left reeling by another day of chaos in the creaking criminal justice system\", according to the paper. Lammy is \"absolutely outraged\" by the mistakes, which he says \"expose deeper flaws\" about the criminal justice system, the i Paper writes. The former security chief of Wandsworth Prison says: \"This is a prison in freefall\".Sex offender Kaddour-Cherif was free for six days before the error was spotted, according to the Times, which reports that Lammy has been \"snared\" by the latest prison blunder. The paper writes that the mistake happened because of a \"complete breakdown in communications\", and officials only realised the inmate was missing when he was due to appear in court and could not be found.During PMQs, Lammy \"refused multiple times to say whether any more prisoners had been released in error\", the Guardian reports. But Kaddour-Cherif's mistaken release was announced almost immediately after the \"bruising session\" of questioning ended. The paper's front page also features a photo of Zohran Mamdani, the winner of Tuesday's New York City mayoral election.\"Democratic cheer\" is the headline for the Financial Times, which writes that Mamdani's victory is a \"resounding snub to Trump\". Elsewhere, the paper features warnings from Nvidia boss Jensen Huang that China \"is going to win the AI race\" with the US.The Daily Telegraph leads on a new pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicle drivers set to be unveiled in the Budget. The paper also reports on whistleblower accusations that the BBC's coverage of transgender issues is subject to \"effective censorship\" by reporters who refuse to cover gender-critical stories. Asked by BBC News, a BBC spokesperson said: \"While we don't comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully. We have taken a number of actions relating to our reporting of sex and gender including updating the news style guide and sharing new guidance, making our Social Affairs Editor responsible for this coverage, and where there have been concerns about particular stories, we have addressed them. We continually review our coverage to reflect developments such as the recent Supreme Court Ruling.\"In a Hollywood exclusive, the Sun leads on the \"acting return\" of the Duchess of Sussex, who this week filmed scenes for the movie Close Personal Friends eight years after announcing her retirement from the screen. A source tells the paper that \"this is a massive moment for Meghan\".Finally, the Daily Star reports that British troops based overseas will get free mobile use thanks to a \"Remembrance Day tribute\" from Vodafone. \"Call of duty\" is their headline.

    "body": "King handed Nvidia boss a letter warning of AI dangers1 hour agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorBBCJensen Huang, the head of the world's most valuable company Nvidia, says King Charles III personally handed him a copy of a speech he delivered in 2023 that included a warning about the dangers of artificial intelligence.\"He said, there's something I want to talk to you about. And he handed me a letter,\" Huang told the BBC, speaking after receiving the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering in a ceremony at St James's Palace.The letter was a copy of the speech delivered by the King in 2023 at the world's first AI Summit, held at Bletchley Park. In it the monarch said that the risks of AI needed to be tackled with \"a sense of urgency, unity and collective strength\".\"It was his speech on AI safety. He obviously cares very deeply about AI safety,\" Mr Huang said.Mr Huang said the King wrote in his speech that he believed in the \"incredible capability\" of the technology to transform the UK and the world.\"But he also wants to remind us that the technology could be used for good and for evil, and so to make sure we do everything we can to advance AI safety.\"In the King's address he describes the development of advanced AI as \"no less important than the discovery of electricity\".On Wednesday, Jensen Huang received the the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering alongside six other foundational figures in AI, including Professors Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, who have warned that the technology poses an existential threat to humanity.But US president Donald Trump has urged the AI sector to make rapid rather than cautious advances in the technology, and the AI Safety Summit was rebranded the AI Action Summit earlier this year.Jensen Huang received the award along six other laureates - in the back row (L-R)  Yoshua Bengio; the King; Yan LeCunn; Geoffrey Hinton and front row, (L-R): Jensen Huang; Fei-Fei Li; Bill Dally; and John HopfieldSenator Howard Lutnick has discouraged the use of the word safety on the grounds that, \"It makes us sound like we're afraid\".Mr Huang's company, Nvidia, was valued at $5tn this week. It specialises in advanced computer chips including those which power AI.Mr Huang added that in his view the UK is in a good position to take advantage of what he described as \"an industrial revolution that's happening right now.\"\"It's your opportunity to grasp,\" he said.Large US tech firms including Nvidia are investing billions of dollars in building AI infrastructure in the UK, in the form of enormous data centres, which Jensen Huang has called \"AI factories\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoWill GrantCentral America and Cuba correspondentMexico President Claudia Sheinbaum has said she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance.Mobile phone footage of the incident on Tuesday shows Sheinbaum speaking to a group of supporters on a street near the National Palace in Mexico City. In the video, a man approaches her from behind and attempts to kiss her on the neck and place his hands on her body. Sheinbaum moved away quickly and a member of her team stepped in, but she was visibly shaken. The offender has been arrested.\"My view is, if I don't file a complaint, what will happen to other Mexican women? If they do this to the president, what will happen to all women in our country?\" Sheinbaum said at a news conference on Wednesday.\"I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,\" she said. \"I have experienced it before, when I wasn't president, when I was a student.\"She added that she had decided to press ahead with bringing charges against the suspect as he had allegedly harassed other women in the crowd.\"A line must be drawn,\" she said.Women's rights groups and feminist commentators have said the incident shows the extent of ingrained machismo in Mexican society, where a man believes he has the right to accost even the president if she is a woman. Femicide is also a huge problem in Mexico, with a staggering 98% of gender-based murders estimated to go unpunished.Sheinbaum promised to tackle the issue as a candidate, but so far in her administration there has been no discernible improvement in that area of violent crime.The incident also comes amid discussions about presidential security and the wider safety of politicians.As president, Sheinbaum has broadly followed the approach of her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in having close and regular contact with her supporters on the streets or in campaign events. On occasion, that has presented security concerns for her team. However, she confirmed in her new conference she had no intention of changing her policy of interacting with her supporters.The incident also happened just days after the murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, a municipality in the violent state of Michoacan, at the local Day of the Dead celebrations.Manzo had called on Sheinbaum for greater federal support in Uruapan in the fight against drug cartels. Around 35 candidates were killed in the lead up to the general election last year in what was considered the bloodiest campaign in modern Mexico.Since taking office, Sheinbaum has made in-roads in improving the country's dire security situation, particularly clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, President Trump.",

    "description": "4 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorLast week, after a migrant sex offender was mistakenly released from prison, Justice Secretary David Lammy said ",
    "body": "4 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorLast week, after a migrant sex offender was mistakenly released from prison, Justice Secretary David Lammy said he was implementing the \"strongest release checks that have ever been in place\".However, since then, details have emerged of two more prisoners being wrongly let out.It is always perilous for a government when it clearly lacks grip on an issue voters would reasonably expect it to be in control of.The stand out example of this in recent years has been the arrival of migrants on small boats.From Rishi Sunak's promise to \"stop the boats\" to Sir Keir Starmer's promise to \"smash the gangs\" both have been found wanting and the problem remains huge.Now the government confronts another example: a justice system that is palpably, transparently and repeatedly failing – and where measures designed to address the issue of letting prisoners out by accident aren't working.According to government figures published in July, 262 prisoners were released in error in the year to March of this year - a 128% increase on 115 in the previous 12 months.In other words, it has been a problem for some time, and it is getting worse.And, context is everything in politics: this row now comes after the mistaken release of perhaps the most high-profile prisoner jailed this year.Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, was jailed after sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman while living in an asylum hotel in Epping in Essex, only to be let out by accident. He has since been deported.It gave the issue of accidental releases from prison a salience and prominence it hadn't had until then.Once again, we are seeing ministers use the language we usually see from opposition politicians.The Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has described the number of people arriving on small boats as \"shameful\".Now, the Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy is saying he is \"absolutely outraged\" over the mistaken release a week ago of Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, a 24-year-old Algerian sex offender.Lammy added that his officials have been \"working through the night to take him back to prison.\"Which brings us to the messy genesis of this saga, at B-Team Prime Minister's Question Time on Wednesday lunchtime.With the prime minister at the COP climate summit in Brazil, it was his deputy who was answering questions.The Conservatives put up the shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge, who repeated a question, using a very particular form of words, over and over again.He wanted to know if an \"asylum-seeking offender had been accidentally released from prison\".It was obvious from the Press Gallery that Cartlidge was on to something – because of the apparent precision of his language and his constant repetition of the question.But Lammy chose to repeatedly duck the question, despite, we later learnt, knowing about the case Cartlidge was referring to.So why didn't he address it?It turns out Cartlidge had got his facts wrong - Kaddour-Cherif isn't an asylum seeker. He arrived here legally but then stayed after his visa expired.Lammy wasn't certain on entering the chamber whether he was an asylum seeker or not.So setting out what he knew might also have exposed what he didn't.His team insist \"it is incredibly important to know the facts\" and they argue it was for the police in the first instance to do that publicly.Really? It seems reasonable to ask both whether Lammy could or should have known more when he arrived in the chamber and whether he could or should have disclosed more when he was there.The Conservatives later called for him to return to the Commons to set out what he knew. The former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith suggested he may have misled the Commons. The Liberal Democrats and Reform have been very critical too.Some also suggest Lammy's manner – shouting \"get a grip, man!\" at Cartlidge, among other things – was a mistake.Could he instead have chosen to set out what he did and didn't know about the case at the beginning of the exchanges, before he took any questions?But it is the bigger picture here that really matters: the justice system is currently repeatedly failing in that most basic of its tasks – who should be in prison and who shouldn't.The reasons for that are complex – with difficult questions for the courts, individual prisons, the Prison Service, the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office.It is not a new problem, but it is a growing one, and one the government doesn't have a grip on. And that, if you are the justice secretary, is a problem.",

    "body": "Several contestants have walked out of a Miss Universe event after an official from host nation Thailand publicly berated Miss Mexico in a tense confrontation. At a pre-pageant ceremony, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil told off Fatima Bosch in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.Video of the incident, which was live streamed, has been shared online. The Miss Universe Organisation (MUO) has condemned Mr Nawat's \"malicious\" behaviour, for which he has since apologised.The Miss Universe contestants, who are the winners of national pageants in their home countries, attended Tuesday's event in their sashes and gowns.Some can be heard shouting back at Mr Nawat in the video, after he raises his voice to reprimand Ms Bosch and repeatedly tells her to stop talking. As many of them stand to show support, Mr Nawat says: \"If anyone wants to continue the contest, sit down. If you step out, the rest of the girls continue.\"Despite this, the majority of the women in the video appear standing, with several heading towards the door.After leaving the event on Tuesday, Ms Bosch told the press the 60-year-old executive was \"not respectful\" and said he had called her \"dumb\". Mr Nawat has disputed this, claiming his words had been misunderstood. He is widely reported to have called the 25-year-old a \"dumbhead\". But at a press conference he later claimed he was saying she had caused \"damage\".His conduct prompted a stern rebuke from the MUO, which has sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.In a video statement, MUO President Raul Rocha said Mr Nawat had \"forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\". He said the Thai official had \"humiliated, insulted and showed a lack of respect\" to Ms Bosch, and committed the \"serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenceless woman\".Mr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited \"as much as possible\" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking \"legal actions\" against him.\"I wish to reiterate that Miss Universe is an empowerment platform for women so that their voices can be heard in the world,\" Mr Rocha said.Among those to walk out on Tuesday was reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. \"This is about women's rights,\" she said as she left the event. \"This is not how things should be handled. To trash another girl is beyond disrespectful... That's why I'm taking my coat and I'm walking out.\"Ms Bosch later said in an interview: \"I just want to let my country know, I'm not afraid to make my voice heard. It's here stronger than ever. I have a purpose. I have things to say.\"We're in the 21st century. I'm not a doll to be made up, styled and have my clothes changed,\" she added. \"I came here to be a voice for all the women and all the girls who fight for causes and to tell my country that I'm completely committed to that.\"Video of Mr Nawat has outraged fans of the pageant, with many heavily criticising his actions and praising Ms Bosch's response.In a social media video statement, Mr Nawat said: \"If anyone feels bad, uncomfortable, or affected, I apologise to everyone. I especially apologised to the girls who were present, around 75 of them.\"The Miss Universe competition has pressed on despite this controversy, with contestants taking part in a welcome event in Bangkok on Wednesday.The winner will be crowned the new Miss Universe on 21 November.",

    "body": "9 hours agoDaniela Relph,Royal correspondent, Rio de Janeiro and Hafsa KhalilThe Prince of Wales has followed in his mother's footsteps with a visit to the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro.Prince William stood in the same spot that Diana, Princess of Wales, was photographed in 34 years ago.He is on the third day of his five-day visit to Brazil, where he will be presenting the Earthshot Prize, the annual award from the charity he set up.The star-studded event will be held in Rio's Museum of Tomorrow on Wednesday evening, where Kylie Minogue and Shawn Mendes will perform as five projects win £1m.The prince is also scheduled to give a speech at COP30, the UN's annual climate meeting.On a picture perfect day, the future king stood alone in a moment of reflection as he took in the views of Rio de Janeiro from the top of Mount Corcovado where Christ the Redeemer stands.The iconic and imposing statue is one of the largest Art Deco sculptures in the world, standing at 30 metres tall and reaching 28 metres wide with its outstretched arms.It has become a symbol of hope and resilience and is said to protect the people of Rio. Princess Diana posed in the same spot in April 1991 during her six-day tour of Brazil with the now King Charles III.During Prince William's walkabouts in Rio, dozens of people spoke to him about his late mother, who died in August 1997. \"The prince has loved meeting so many people from across Rio over the last few days,\" said a spokesperson for the prince. \"He's been incredibly struck by the number of people who fondly remember his mother's visit to this beautiful city.\"At Christ the Redeemer, Prince William also had some time away from the cameras in the chapel that sits beneath the statue.Security has been high throughout his trip.Public access to the statue was temporarily suspended to allow him to visit the site and meet the 15 Earthshot Prize finalists ahead of the evening's awards ceremony.The shortlist this year includes the city of Guangzhou in China and its electric public transport network, Lagos Fashion Week in Nigeria, nominated for its work reshaping the fashion industry, and Barbados for its environmental leadership.The prize annually awards a £1m grant in five different categories to projects that aim to repair the world's climate.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will join the prince for the ceremony before they both head to Belem in the Amazon rainforest for COP30, where world leaders will discuss how to limit and pepare for further climate change.Prince William's first day in Brazil involved football in the Maracana Stadium and barefoot beach volleyball on Copacabana.On Tuesday, focus shifted to the environment - his reason for visiting the country.The prince criticised criminals for their involvment in the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest during a speech at the United for Wildlife conference.He also travelled to the small island of Paqueta, where he met locals, learnt about mangrove conservation and planted tree saplings.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe British Medical Association has rejected a fresh offer from the government to end the long-running dispute with resident doctors in England.Health Secretary Wes Streeting had proposed covering the cost of exam fees and expanding training places more quickly than planned and wrote to the union on Wednesday giving it until the end of Thursday to accept the package.But the BMA said the offer did not go far enough - and the government needed to increase pay.It comes ahead of a five-day strike by resident doctors, the name now for junior doctors, which gets under way on 14 November. It will be the 13th walkout since March 2023.The fresh offer made by Streeting in the letter to the BMA on Wednesday afternoon followed a meeting with the union's leaders on Tuesday.There were a range of measures, including covering the cost of mandatory exams, which can run to thousands of pounds over the course of doctor training, and membership fees to royal colleges.The health secretary had also promised to expand the number of training places more quickly than initially planned.But the BMA told the BBC on Wednesday night that it had rejected the offer.The 10-year NHS plan published in early summer pledged an extra 1,000 training places by 2028, but this will now be increased to 2,000 with the 1,000 boost happening next year.These are speciality training places that doctors move into after the first two years of training.This year there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs at this stage, although some will have been doctors from abroad.In the letter to the BMA Streeting said: \"The choice is clear. You can continue to pursue unnecessary strike action, which will cause disruption to patients, harm the NHS's recovery and mean that at least some parts of this offer become unaffordable.\"Or you can put an end to this damaging period of industrial action and work in partnership with the government to both deliver real change and improvements.\"The letter said iafter Thursday the NHS would have to start cancelling treatments and bookings ahead of the next walkout.The offer has been made after months of dialogue between the union and government, which began in July after the last round of strikes.Streeting has maintained he would not negotiate on pay after resident doctors had received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years.But the BMA has argued that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.Responding to the offer, Dr Jack Fletcher, chairman of the BMA's resident doctors committee, said it \"does not go far enough\".He said even with the expansion of training places resident doctors would still be left without a job at a crucial point of their training.\"We have also been clear with the government that they can call off strikes for years if they're willing to offer a multi-year pay deal that restores pay over time. \"Sadly, even after promising a journey to fair pay, Mr Streeting is still unwilling to move.\"The strike next week is expected to cause significant disruption, particularly in hospitals.Resident doctors represent nearly half the medical workforce and range from doctors fresh out of university through to those with up to a decade of experience.They will walk out of both emergency and routine care with senior doctors brought in to provide cover.While the NHS attempted to keep as many routine services running as possible during the last strike, thousands of operations and appointments still had to be postponed.",

    "body": "15 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesL-R: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sarah Ferguson and Ehud BarakThe list of some of the world's most rich and powerful people with ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has lengthened, after the US government released millions of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier.There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing. Many people who have featured in previous releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Here is a list of some of the people mentioned in the latest release. Elon MuskThe documents include email correspondence between Epstein and tech billionaire Elon Musk over travel plans Epstein appeared to be arranging, although Musk has said he has never visited Epstein's private island. In November 2012, Musk wrote in one email: \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In another, from December the same year, he wrote:  \"I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose\", adding that a \"peaceful island experience\" is the opposite of what he's wanting.Response: Musk responded in an X post in January, acknowledging that the emails might be used to \"smear my name\", but said he was more concerned about the prosecution of \"those who committed serious crimes with Epstein\". Bill GatesTwo emails from 18 July 2013 are written as though drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they are genuine or were ever sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates \"to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls\".In an interview with NPR, his ex-wife Melinda said the release of the documents brought up memories of their marital struggles.\"I'm able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, my God, how did that happen to those girls?\" she said.\"At least for me, I've been able to move on in life, and I hope there's some justice for those now-women.\"Response: A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: \"These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.\"Donald TrumpThe US president is mentioned hundreds of times in the newly released files, including a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line. Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence.The list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures.Response: Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorPhotographs appearing to show Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground have also been included in the latest Epstein files release.In two of the images, the former prince is seen touching the person, who is unidentified and fully clothed, on her stomach. Another image shows him staring directly at the camera.No context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken.Response: BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.US Department of JusticeAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoingRichard BransonRichard Branson's name appears hundreds of times in the files. In one 2013 exchange, Epstein thanks Branson for his recent hospitality and public relations advice, to which Branson replies that it was \"really nice\" seeing him, adding: \"Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!\"Virgin Group has clarified that \"harem\" referred to three adult members of Epstein's team. Response: In a statement to the BBC, Virgin Group said Branson's contact with Epstein was \"only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event\".The statement added: \"When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations.\"As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again. Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever – Richard believes that Epstein's actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims.\"Sarah Ferguson Sarah Ferguson, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife, who is invariably known as Fergie, appears to also be mentioned in multiple emails, including when Epstein was still under house arrest.An email from an account believed to belong to Epstein says: \"I think Fergie can now say, I am not a pedo.\"In another email exchange from April 2009 there is a request to meet Epstein for a \"quick cup of tea\", that includes the lines: \"My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you.\" Response: The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response.Lord MandelsonEpstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released in the files suggest, including to his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva. The Metropolitan Police has launched a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.In 2009, one year after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor, da Silva sent an email requesting \"anything you can help me with\". Epstein replied: \"I will wire your loan amount immediately\".A separate email exchange appears to show Epstein arranging a place for Mandelson to stay at one of his New York apartments, with Epstein writing, \"thrilled to host and sad I'm not there\".Response: Lord Mandelson has said he will step down from the House of Lords. On Sunday, Mandelson reiterated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\" and for continuing his association following Epstein's conviction. He has told the BBC he \"was never culpable or complicit in (Epstein's) crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death\". He has not responded to the allegations of leaking documents, but BBC understands that he maintains he did not act criminally and did not act for personal gain. He argues that he sought Epstein's expertise in the national interest during the 2008 global financial crisis.Steve Bannon The files also contain thousands of messages that appear to be sent between the late convicted sex offender and one of Trump's former top advisers, Steve Bannon.Most messages were sent in 2018 and 2019 after Bannon left his role in the first Trump White House, as he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death.One text exchange shows Bannon apparently strategising with Epstein on how to change the narrative around his past crimes, suggesting \"first we need to push back on the lies\" and \"rebuild your image as philanthropist\". Response: Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.Miroslav LajčákAn October 2018 text exchange between Miroslav Lajčák - who was serving as Slovakia's foreign minister at the time - and Epstein appeared to show the two messaging about girls and diplomacy. After Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: \"Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl.\"\"Who wouldn't,\" Epstein texts back. \"You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters.\"Response: Following the latest release of Epstein-related documents, Lajčák resigned from his current post as Slovakia's national security advisor. He is not accused of any wrongdoing.Watch: 'Do you think you're the devil himself?' Epstein questioned in newly released interviewHoward LutnickBillionaire businessman and US Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick planned a visit to Jeffrey Epstein's island Little Saint James with his family, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files' release.In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant on what appeared to be the eve of the visit: \"We are looking forward to visiting you\", and, \"We would love to join you for lunch\". Response: The Commerce Department said in a statement to the BBC that \"Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing\".Larry SummersLarry Summers, US President Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary and former Harvard University president, is also in the new documents, including references to meetings and dinners between Summers and Epstein.In emails from 2017, Summers and Epstein joked about Trump and criticised him during his first term. \"Your world does not understand how dumb he really is,\" Epstein said of Trump in one email to Summers.Response: After Summers was mentioned amid a batch of Epstein files released in November, he said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\" and resigned from multiple posts, including his role on the advisory board of OpenAI. Steve TischSteve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, is shown in the release of Epstein-related documents inquiring about a woman he met at Epstein's house.In one email exchange, Tisch asked whether the woman was a professional or a \"civilian\".In other exchanges, Epstein tells Tisch he had a \"present\" for him and described a woman he would introduce Tisch to as \"tahitian speaks mostly french, exotic\".Response: In a statement to CNN, Tisch said he and Epstein \"had a brief association\", adding that he \"did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island\".Brett RatnerThe director of the new documentary on First Lady Melania Trump also appeared in a photo embracing a young woman in the files.Brett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured.Response: There is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner's representative for comment.US Department of JusticeBrett Ratner is seen on the right here alongside Jeffrey Epstein and two women Peter AttiaThe anti-aging influencer and CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, exchanged hundreds of emails with Epstein, including crass comments, the latest documents release shows. In the emails, he wrote that his friendship with Epstein was something he could share publicly and included a discussion of the 2018 Miami Herald story that identified some of Epstein's victims.He also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex, emails show.Response: On 2 February, Attia made a statement on X rejecting that he was \"involved in any criminal activity\", adding that \" I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties\".Casey WassermanThe chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games sent flirty emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of Epstein.Casey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, show him saying: \"I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein.Response: Wasserman said in a statement: \"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light.\" Sergey BrinSergey Brin, co-founder of Google and one of the world's richest men, visited Epstein's private island and made plans to dine at Epstein's home in New York City, according to the documents released on Friday.He also corresponded with Ghislaine Maxwell, who wrote to Brin in April 2003: \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed\", and, \"Look forward to seeing you\". Response: The BBC has reached out to Google for comment. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing in the emails.Ehud BarakFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is mentioned in the newly released Epstein-related documents, showing they corresponded on multiple occasions after Epstein was convicted for sex crimes in Florida in 2008.One exchange shows plans for Barak to stay at Epstein's New York City residence in 2017. Response: Barak has acknowledged his regular interactions with Epstein but said he never observed or participated in any inappropriate behaviour or parties. Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky, the famed linguist, appeared in both releases of the Epstein files, and the latest tranche of documents suggests Chomsky advised Epstein on media coverage of sex trafficking allegations against him. In emails from February 2019, the disgraced financier asked Chomsky if he should \"defend myself\" or \"try to ignore\".A response that appears to be from Chomsky laments \"the horrible way\" Epstein was treated and the \"hysteria that has developed about abuse of women\".\"It's painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,\" the email said.Response: The appearance of Chomsky's name in the files does not imply wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Chomsky's wife Valeria, who is his spokesperson, for comment.Brad KarpBrad Karp, the chairman of prestigious law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down from his role after the latest files showed dozens of apparent email exchanges between him and Epstein. One correspondence reportedly is said to show Karp discussing Epstein's pre-existing plea deal on sex trafficking charges.In an email sent in March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, a sender named Brad Karp said: \"The draft motion is in great shape.\" Bloomberg reported that this discussion related to Epstein's efforts to protect the 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors, in which he avoided federal charges, which could have seen him face life in prison. There is nothing in the emails to prove that they were in fact linked  to the plea deal.Response: Announcing his resignation in a company statement on Wednesday, Karp said: \"Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.\" The statement did not mention the Epstein files, and Karp has not commented since. The BBC has contacted Paul Weiss for further comment.Bill ClintonIn the justice department's first release of Epstein documents in December, several images showed former US President Bill Clinton, including a picture of him swimming in a pool, and another with him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was first arrested.Response:  A spokesman for Clinton, Angel Ureña, said on social media in December that photos released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) were decades old. \"They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be,\" he said.\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first,\" he said.In a post on social media, Clinton said that he had told Congress everything he knows. \"I have called for the full release of the Epstein files. I have provided a sworn statement of what I know,\" he said. \"And just this week, I've agreed to appear in person before the committee.\"Deepak ChopraThe files appear to reveal communication between Epstein and the self-help author Deepak Chopra years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from minors.In a February 2017 email, Chopra seemingly asks Epstein to come to Israel with him and an unnamed group.\"Come to Israel with us,\" Chopra says. \"Relax and have fun with interesting people. [if] you want use a fake name . Bring your girls. It will be fun to have you . Love\"In another apparent exchange a month later, the pair talk about God and cells of the human body before Chopra says: \"Cells are human constructs. No such thing ! Universe is human construct No such thing. Cute girls are aware when they make noise.\"Later in the discussion, Chopra adds: \"God is a construct. Cute girls are real.\"Epstein also asks the alternative medicine advocate: \"Did you find me a cute Israeli?\"Response: Since these emails emerged, Chopra has posted a statement online saying he was \"deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims in this case\" and denied his involvement in \"any criminal or exploitative conduct.\"\"Any contact I had was limited and unrelated to abusive activity. Some past email exchanges have surfaced that reflect poor judgment in tone. I regret that and understand how they read today, given what was publicly known at the time. My focus remains on supporting accountability, prevention, and efforts that protect and support survivors.\"The BBC has asked Chopra if in his dealings with Epstein, he was aware of any wrongdoing.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersA South Korean cryptocurrency exchange accidentally gave away more than $40bn (£32bn) worth of bitcoin to customers, briefly making them multi-millionaires.It had planned to give customers a small cash reward of 2,000 won - $1,37 - but instead gave them 2,000 bitcoins on Friday.The platform, Bithumb, apologised for the error, adding that it quickly had realised its mistake and recovered almost all the missing tokens. It said it had restricted trading and withdrawals for the 695 affected customers within 35 minutes of the glitch.The company said it had recovered 99.7% of the 620,000 bitcoins mistakenly sent. \"We want to make it clear that this matter has nothing to do with external hacking or security breaches, and there is no problem with system security or customer asset management,\" Bithumb said in a statement on Friday. In an emergency meeting on Saturday, South Korea's financial regulator said it would look into the incident. Any sign of illegal activity would prompt formal investigations, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).Bithumb vowed to co-operate with regulators. \"[We] will take this accident as a lesson and prioritise 'customer trust and peace of mind' rather than external growth,\" CEO Lee Jae-won said. The company plans to  pay 20,000 won ($13,66) in compensation to all customers who were using the platform at the time, and will waive trading fees, among other measures.Bithumb said it would improve verification systems and introduce AI to detect abnormal transactions.The incident is likely to spark discussion around tighter regulatory controls in finance. In April 2024 Citigroup, a US bank, mistakenly credited $81 trillion, instead of $280, to a customer's account. Two employees failed to spot the error before it was processed, but the bank reversed the transaction within hours after a third employee caught the mistake, the Financial Times reported.",

    "body": "10 hours agoHarriet Agerholm,BBC NewsandSimon LockUS Department of JusticeJeffrey Epstein and Peter Mandelson onboard a yacht in an unspecified locationLord Mandelson appears to have recommended a holiday home to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein with \"privacy\" to host his \"guests\", documents released by the US Department of Justice suggest.In an email to Epstein in 2010, he says he \"found you a great place to stay on the Amalfi coast\" offering \"privacy with accompanying rooms for your 'guests'\", according to documents in which Lord Mandelson's email address is redacted.Quote marks are used around the word \"guests\".A spokesperson for Lord Mandelson said he \"did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019\" and his lawyers said he had \"no recollection of this email, which was sent over 15 years ago\".BBC News and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism have identified Lord Mandelson as the sender of the email in part because his email address is partially visible despite the redaction.It is unclear which \"guests\" are being referred to and we have not determined if Epstein went on to stay in the accommodation.The email chain in the US government release is from 12 August 2010, the month after Epstein completed his 2008 sentence for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl in Florida.According to the document, Lord Mandelson tells Epstein he is due to arrive back in London from \"Myk\", later in August.\"Found you a great place to stay on the Amalfi coast near to Positano. Zeferelli [sic] home converted into beautiful suites and privacy with accompanying rooms for your 'guests',\" he writes in a message sent from his Blackberry, the document suggests.US Department of JusticeWhile the sender of the email is redacted in the published file, the black redaction box does not completely cover his email address in one reference on the chain.The correspondence is just one exchange between Lord Mandelson and Epstein revealed in the US Department of Justice releases that sheds new light on the friendship between the men.In other published emails from 2009, Lord Mandelson asks how they should celebrate Epstein's release from prison, to which the disgraced financier responds: \"With grace and modesty (those are the names of two strippers)\".A spokesperson for the peer said: \"Lord Mandelson regrets, and will regret until to his dying day, that he believed Epstein's lies about his criminality.\"Lord Mandelson did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019.\"He is profoundly sorry that powerless and vulnerable women and girls were not given the protection they deserved.\"Epstein died in a New York prison cell in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "UK to get brief respite from rain, forecasts showImage source, Richard Baker / GettyByBen RichLead Weather PresenterYou would be forgiven for thinking the rain this year has been relentless - because in some parts of the UK, it actually has been.Here at BBC Weather we have been watching computer models closely for signs of when that pattern will change.These computer-generated forecasts go out about two weeks into the future - and models have often been hinting at a change to colder and drier weather on that timescale. However, they have then reverted to the familiar wet pattern as we have got closer to the time. Now though, there are stronger signals of a change for some of us - albeit perhaps only a temporary one.Will the pattern shift?Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / JeannieImage caption, Sunshine and snow are both possible if colder air arrivesFor the weather to dry up, this pattern needs to change and a short-lived reprieve may be on the way.While spells of rain will continue throughout this weekend and into the start of the new week, it looks like higher pressure will start to build across the north of the UK later in the week.This may turn things a little drier here and possibly even brighter. It is also expected to turn a little colder.Wet weather is still likely to affect the south of the UK, perhaps turning to snow where it meets cold air, but even here there are signs of something a little drier and colder arriving - perhaps by the following weekend.However, it might be worth keeping the wet weather gear handy.Early indications are that milder westerly winds from the Atlantic will return during the third week of the month - delivering more wind and rain.Just how wet has it been?Rain gauges at locations including North Wyke in Devon and Astwood Bank in Worcestershire have recorded precipitation every single day so far in 2026.There have been a few exceptions - notably parts of western Scotland and north-west England which have been drier than normal.Statistics from the Met Office revealed that Northern Ireland had its wettest January in 149 years - while it was the wettest January on record for County Down and Cornwall.February has brought little improvement so far.Provisional Met Office data shows that some parts of the UK recorded more rainfall in the first five days than they would normally expect over the course of the whole month.Image source, Met Office / BBC Weather Watchers / JeanieImage caption, White and blue areas on this map show areas that have already had close to - or more than - their typical rainfall for the whole of FebruaryAberdeenshire has been one of the wettest places of all, with Aboyne receiving over 130% of its normal February rainfall in just five days.It should perhaps come as little surprise that the rain has also been accompanied by a seemingly unbreakable sheet of cloud.Aberdeen recorded no sunshine for 14 days from 22 January - provisionally the longest sunless spell on record for the city.Southern and south-western parts of England have also been badly affected by flooding and travel disruption.Conversely, some areas of north-west England and western Scotland have been drier than normal, with Aultbea in the north-west Highlands recording no rainfall for 19 consecutive days.A powerful jet stream has been sending areas of low pressure in from the Atlantic, arriving first across the south-west of England.But high pressure has been stubbornly sitting across Scandinavia, blocking the progress of those rain-bearing weather systems, causing them to stall close to the UK.Image caption, A blocked weather pattern with south-easterly winds has lingered for most of 2026 so farThis weather setup has driven persistent south-easterly winds driving moisture - and rainfall - into areas like southern England and eastern Scotland, leaving some spots further west sheltered from the worst of the wet weather.While dry places have remained dry, the wet areas have just kept getting wetter.You can get more detail on the long-range forecast in our monthly outlook.And the hour-by-hour forecast for your area is always available on the BBC Weather website and app.",

    "body": "4 hours agoGetty ImagesJeane Freeman was an MSP from 2016 to 2021Former Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman, who was a key figure in the response to the Covid pandemic, has died at the age of 72.Her partner said she died in hospital less than four weeks after being diagnosed with cancer.A former nurse, justice campaigner and civil servant, Freeman entered politics as a special advisor to Labour First Minister Jack McConnell before joining the SNP and standing for the Scottish Parliament.She became an MSP in 2016 and was appointed health secretary two years later, before standing down at the 2021 election.She was a regular presence at the daily media briefings held by the Scottish government during the Covid pandemic.Freeman was born and raised in Ayr and had a long career in the health and social justice sectors before working in politics. For 12 years she ran the social enterprise Apex Scotland, working with employers and former prisoners. She was awarded an OBE in 1996 for her work rehabilitating offenders.Freeman chaired the board of the Golden Jubilee Foundation and was a member of the Parole Board for Scotland and the Judicial Appointments Board.She was MSP for the Ayrshire seat of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley from 2016 to 2021 and served as health secretary between 2018 and 2021.During that time she ordered a public inquiry into the design, construction, commissioning and maintenance of Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and a new children's hospital in Edinburgh.After leaving Holyrood in 2021 she gave evidence at the UK Covid Inquiry and the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry.'Courage and care'Her partner, Susan Stewart, said: \"Jeane was given an unexpected diagnosis of incurable cancer on 13 January and we only had 25 days thereafter. Days which she faced with enormous courage, care for others and love for me.\"I wish to thank all the staff in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital whose professional skill, care and sensitivity were exceptional. We were both very grateful and also for the outpouring of love and concern from so many, across politics and beyond. Be kind to each other, that is what changes the world.\"Jeane and I were partners for over 25 years and I admired and supported her professional and public life. I am immensely proud of her, not least her latter  volunteering at the Beatson Centre taking round the tea trolley, a job she loved.\"But it is the private Jeane – my soul mate and companion – who I will be forever grateful to have had in my lifeSpeaking to the BBC, First Minister John Swinney said he was \"terribly saddened\" by Freeman's death, adding that she had \"given her all to the service of Scotland\".\"She was an outstanding cabinet colleague and a selfless servant of the people of Scotland,\" he said.  \"She designed Scotland's social security system based on the principles of dignity, fairness and respect and she made an incredible contribution to protecting others through the Covid pandemic.\" Swinney added that Freeman had been a \"great colleague and friend\" who was always the source of \"wise counsel\" and had brought \"deep values to all the work she undertook.\"'Heartbroken' - SturgeonFormer First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also paid tribute to Freeman, who she described as one of her \"best and closest\" friends. \"Words can't even begin to convey how heartbroken I feel that Jeane Freeman has gone,\" she said.\"As health secretary during Covid, she helped steer Scotland through the toughest of times. \"As well as bearing her own heavy responsibilities during that time, she helped me bear mine. I'm not sure I could have got through it without her by side.\"She added that she had last seen Freeman on Friday and during her visits to hospital had been\" overwhelmed to witness Jeane's courage\".'Formidable... ferociously clever' Former first minister and Labour peer Lord McConnell, who worked closely with Freeman during the early years of devolution, described her as one of his \"oldest friends\", adding that Scottish public life was \"poorer without her\". \"From her time as a student leader when we first met to becoming health secretary during a global pandemic she never flinched in the service of those she represented,\" he said. \"Jeane was one of the most formidable public figures of her generation. She was ferociously clever, fired by a strong sense of justice and an enduring commitment to public service.\"He added: \"Whatever role she was in, whether as head of Apex, a government adviser or in the cabinet, she gave everything, She was renowned for her strong opinions and work ethic, but she was never more happy than when she was with her soulmate Susan.\"Jeane Freeman made a political shift in the devolution years from Labour to the SNP via the campaign for independence.I was slightly taken aback to witness the moment she revealed her political journey.It was on a TV show I presented one Sunday. She appeared on set as a commentator - probably during the SNP's first term in office.Having been a key adviser to the previous Labour administration she might have been expected to take a pro-UK position.Instead, she signalled frustration with the powers of the Scottish Parliament and her potential support for independence.With hindsight, she was probably bringing to the surface a stronger undercurrent in the politics of that time.In government, she worked hard and with purpose. Her role in shaping the devolved benefits system is under appreciated.I always found her open and candid and I know that she showed care for others.When I last saw her, we reflected on the Covid lockdown. Freeman recalled a drive through the empty streets of Edinburgh in March 2020 and how she said to herself \"God, I hope we've got this right\".",

    "body": "19 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorVisionhaus/Getty ImagesThe crown princess said that the messages exchanged with Epstein did not represented who she wanted to be (file pic)Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit has given a \"profound apology\" to Norwegians for her friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after it emerged they had exchanged messages for three years.\"I also apologise for the situation in which I have placed the Royal House, especially the King and Queen,\" she said in a palace statement after days of mounting pressure to address the issue.Harald V and Queen Sonja, who are both 88, have not commented on the revelations. The King met Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre on Friday, alongside Crown Prince Haakon, who told reporters later that his wife wanted to speak: \"But right now she can't, and I also tell her she is not allowed to.\"Hundreds of emails from 2011-14 involving Epstein and the crown princess came to light in the cache of files published by the US justice department a week ago. Some of the exchanges apparently involve plans to meet in person, and reveal she spent four days at Epstein's Palm Beach house in Florida while he was not there.The warm nature of the correspondence has come as a shock to Norwegians, and she appears to have been aware he had already served a jail term in 2008: \"Googled u after last email,\" she wrote in October 2011. \"Agree didn't look too good.\"Although an initial statement was released last Saturday, in which the crown princess expressed regret and admitted \"poor judgement\", the palace had been pressed to provide further details of how well she knew Epstein.In a statement on Friday, the palace said the crown princess was deeply saddened that she had failed to realise early enough what kind of person he was. She wanted to provide a more detailed explanation but was in a \"very difficult situation\" and needed time to \"gather herself\".\"It is important for me to say I am sorry to all those I have disappointed. Some of the content in the messages between Epstein and me does not represent the person I want to be.\"Mette-Marit already had a four-year-old boy, Marius Borg Høiby, from an earlier brief relationship when she married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon in 2001.Her first child Marius Borg Høiby is now 29 and at the centre of a high-profile seven-week trial which began this week. He faces 38 charges, including four counts of rape which he denies.Although neither part of the royal family nor a public figure, he has grown up within his step-father Crown Prince Haakon's family, alongside half-sister Princess Ingrid Alexander and half-brother Prince Sverre Magnus.Rune Hellestad/Getty ImagesFile pic showing Crown Prince Haakon (R) and the crown princess with his step-son (L) and Princess Ingrid Alexandra (C-L) His mother has not commented on the trial but Crown Prince Haakon told reporters in Oslo there was a lot going on in his family and the most important thing in the past few days \"has been to take care of the flock\".\"We support Marius in the situation he is in. We look after the other children as well... They also need to be cared for, and I have to make sure to take care of the crown princess,\" he said.Mette-Marit is also extremely unwell with pulmonary fibrosis and her doctors are preparing to put her on a list for a lung transplant.Giving evidence in court on Wednesday, her son initially struggled to compose himself, holding back tears as he complained of being \"hassled\" by the press since he was three years old.If found guilty by the three judges at Oslo district court, he could face a jail term of at least 10 years. Two days before the trial began, he was arrested for a fourth time on Sunday, on suspicion of assault, wielding a knife and violating a restraining order. His half-sister Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 22, was also critical of the press in a post to almost 800 followers on a private Instagram account this week.In lengthy comments seen by public broadcaster NRK, Aftenposten and VG website, the princess, who is second in line to the Norwegian throne after her father, said it was important \"not to make claims you have no basis for\".While stressing she was not referring to anything in particular - \"not Marius, not mum or dad or Magnus. It's about personal attacks, it can apply to anyone, but I chose to post this here because I'm going crazy. Enough is enough\".When approached by the BBC, the palace said it did not wish to comment on the matter.",

    "body": "12 hours agoRianna CroxfordInvestigations correspondentUS Department of JusticeDavid Stern, Sarah Ferguson and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor pictured together An aide to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was asked by sex offender Jeffrey Epstein about arranging a dinner with a \"beautiful friend\" of his, nearly three years after the then-prince claimed to have cut ties, new emails show.\"I have a very beautiful friend comoing [sic] to london on tues. ANdrew might want to have her for a dinner,\" Epstein wrote in October 2013 to David Stern.Emails appear to show Stern, a trusted royal insider, acted as a go-between for the pair after the then-Duke's relationship with Epstein began to receive scrutiny following his 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing. The BBC has tried to contact Stern for comment.No further correspondence confirms whether Mountbatten-Windsor met Epstein's \"friend\".Other emails seen by the BBC suggest that Stern, an enigmatic figure with little online presence, also invited Epstein to a dinner at Windsor Castle in 2017 - nearly a decade after he was convicted of child sex offences.The latest email, released by the US Department of Justice, from Epstein suggesting that \"Andrew\" meet his \"beautiful friend\" is sent three years after he had separately suggested that \"The Duke\" might enjoy having dinner with a 26-year-old Russian woman in August 2010.Correspondence seen by the BBC, released by the DOJ, shows that Stern regularly communicated with Epstein about royal business and personal affairs from at least 2009 to 2017, by which point he was acting as a director of Mountbatten-Windsor's company Pitch@Palace - a Dragons' Den-style start-up competition where entrepreneurs could present their ideas to potential investors.Stern, an investor and German national, resigned as a director of Pitch@Palace in 2019. He was also a director of the St George's House Trust, based in Windsor Castle, from 2016 until 2022.In April 2017, Stern emails Epstein - nearly a decade after his conviction - to say that he was organising a \"super\" dinner at Windsor Castle in May that year, asking \"who else\" he should invite.In another email, dated the same day, Epstein appears to have the power to directly invite another business associate of his to the Windsor dinner, writing: \"I know you hate london do [sic] want a dinner invite at windsor castle with the top Chinese. biz people? may 26\".The recipient asks Epstein if he will be present at the dinner, to which he responds: \"no, I have a havard [sic] event\", potentially implying he was invited but unable to attend.The emails suggest that Epstein continued to have a much more influential and closer relationship with Mountbatten-Windsor and royal residences in the years after the former Duke had claimed to BBC Newsnight to have cut contact with him in December 2010.In 2014, Stern messages Epstein to say that \"PA [Prince Andrew] sends his birthday wishes and love\" alongside a picture of him with the then-Duke and Duchess of York.The message apparently from Stern also wishes Epstein \"Happy Birthday\" and shares a crude photo of champagne being poured down a naked woman, adding: \"Champagne for you (even though you don't drink it)\".He appears to keep in frequent contact with Epstein about his work and access to the Palace, emailing Epstein in 2010 that he was at Prince Andrew's \"birthday party\" and boasting about the famous celebrities he had encountered.Other emails seem to show that Stern had also acted around this time as a conduit between Epstein and Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of York.In 2011, emails include one from Stern's account which sent Epstein a message from \"Sarah\" mentioning \"The Duke\", in which she congratulates him on the apparent birth of a \"baby boy\".After the crash of a business venture in 2009, Ferguson also appears to write to Epstein: \"I urgently need 20,000 pounds ($27,521) for rent today\" following an exchange with Stern, which she is copied into.A spokesman for Sarah Ferguson previously told the BBC that she was told to congratulate Epstein on a baby but has no knowledge beyond that.Further emails, as part of the three million published last week, also shed new light on Epstein's apparent invitation to have dinner with \"The Duke\" at Buckingham Palace in 2010, and that the sex offender requested to bring three women along with him.On 27 September that year, Epstein emails \"The Duke\" to say that he is in London and asks what time Mountbatten-Windsor would like him and a woman, who the BBC is not naming.\"The Duke\" suggests they could have \"dinner\" at Buckingham Palace and \"lots of privacy\", to which Epstein agrees, responding that he is with three women.Epstein asks if he should \"bring them all, so as to add some life\", in the email exchanges. \"Yes. Plenty of space here for chat! Bring them,\" says \"The Duke\".In a previous email, sent months prior, Epstein had described one of the women as \"a great friend\" and \"very pretty\" after \"The Duke\" asked who she was.Another email, sent the evening before the dinner, appears to show that Epstein had also personally invited a fourth woman to the Buckingham Palace meet-up, asking if she wanted to join and that she agreed.The BBC has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising out of his association with Epstein.The BBC has spent days trying to contact Stern for comment.More on this story ",

    "body": "2 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongState Emergency Service of UkraineA fire broke out at a warehouse in the city of Yahotyn as a result of a Russian drone strikeUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, adding both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week.\"America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams – Ukraine and Russia – meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation,\" he said.There was no immediate comment from Washington or Moscow, but US President Donald Trump has been pushing for an end for the conflict since he took office again more than a year ago. Meanwhile, Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure - causing further widespread blackouts during freezing conditions.In comments released on Saturday, Zelensky told reporters what had taken place during the second round of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi, which ended on Friday with no reports of a breakthrough. Zelensky said \"difficult issues remained difficult\", including territorial concessions that Ukraine is under pressure to make.He said the parties discussed, for the first time, the possibility of a trilateral meeting between leaders, not simply representatives, but cautioned \"preparatory elements are needed for this\". Asked whether a time frame had been given for an agreement, the Ukrainian leader replied: \"The Americans say that they want to do everything by June.\" \"Why before this summer?\" he added. \"We understand that their domestic issues in the US will have an impact.\" These issues include the November midterm elections, which could affect the balance of power in the US government.As the diplomacy continues, so too are Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities. \"Russian criminals carried out another massive attack on Ukraine's energy facilities,\" Ukraine's energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote on Telegram. Substations, which control the flow of electricity, and overhead power lines that \"form the backbone of Ukraine's power grid\" were targeted, Shmyhal said. Power plants were also struck.Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said \"the power deficit in the power system of Ukraine significantly increased\" as a result of the latest attacks. Shmyhal said neighbouring Poland had been asked for emergency power supplies.Zelensky wrote on social media that Friday night's attack involved more than 400 drones and 40 missiles. Air-defence systems intercepted most, but not all, of them, the Ukrainian military said.\"The main targets were the energy grid, generation facilities, and distribution substations,\" he said, adding that damage had been reported in at least four regions.In the western region of Lviv, the Dobrotvir power plant came under attack, leaving thousands of people without electricity, according to the regional head, Maksym Kozytskyi. At least 6,000 people were without power as a result of hourly power outage schedules, he added.AFP via Getty ImagesKyiv residents have been sleeping in metro stations to avoid Russian air strikesThe Burshtyn power plant was also struck in the nearby Ivano-Frankivsk region.  DTEK, which runs both the Dobrotvir and Burshtyn plants said it was the tenth \"massive attack\" on its power plants since October 2025.\"In total, DTEK thermal power plants have been attacked by the enemy more than 220 times since the beginning of the full-scale invasion,\" the company added on Telegram. This was launched by Russia nearly four years ago. One person was reported dead in the Rivne region and several were injured in Zaporizhzhia. Rivne's head, Oleksandr Koval, said there was also damage to homes and \"critical infrastructure\".In Kyiv, residents once again took shelter in metro stations. Among them, Oksana Kykhtenko, told the Reuters news agency: \"They [Russians] make us live in inhumane conditions. Without heating, without electricity.\" A drone strike in the city of Yahotyn, about 10km (62 miles) away, caused a fire at a warehouse complex, the Ukrainian emergency services said. Ukraine has also attacked Russia, striking a factory that makes missile fuel components in the western Tver region, according to media reports quoting Ukrainian security officials. Further south, in the Saratov region, an oil depot was also hit, Ukraine said. Russia has not commented on any of the latest attacks.  Moscow renewed its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Monday after a pause US President Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe due to the fierce cold in Ukraine. Trump said the pause lasted for a week until last Sunday but Kyiv disputed the timeline.DTEK said the combined missile and drone strikes caused \"the most powerful blow\" to infrastructure so far this year. \"Moscow must be deprived of the ability to use the cold as leverage against Ukraine,\" Zelensky wrote on X on Saturday, responding to the latest strikes.It is not yet known who was behind the shooting.Some 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zelensky said earlier this week. The BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine.",

    "body": "8 hours agoTabby WilsonBBC NewsEPAUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order threatening to impose additional tariffs on countries that continue to trade with Iran. The order, issued on Friday, does not specify the rate that could be imposed, but uses 25% as an example. It says the tariff could apply to goods imported into the US from any nation that \"directly or indirectly purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires any goods or services from Iran\".Trump has not directly commented on the order but reiterated \"no nuclear weapons\" for Iran when speaking from Air Force One on Friday night.It came after talks between senior US and Iranian officials in Oman, following several weeks of threats from both sides. Trump threatened a 25% tariff of countries doing business with Iran earlier this year, in a post to Truth Social. On 12 January, he wrote: \"Effective immediately, any country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America.\"At the time, no further detail was provided on how the tariffs would work in practice.The White House said that this latest executive order reaffirmed the \"ongoing national emergency with respect to Iran\" and noted that the president may modify it of circumstances change. It read: \"The President is holding Iran accountable for its pursuit of nuclear capabilities, support for terrorism, ballistic missile development, and regional destabilisation that endanger American security, allies, and interests.\" Separately, the US state department announced on Friday that it was sanctioning 15 entities \"that have traded in Iranian-origin crude oil, petroleum products, or petrochemical products\". There was no immediate comment to either announcement from Iran, which is already subject to extensive sanctions imposed by the US and other Western powers over the country's nuclear programme.Tehran insists this is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Under a 2015 nuclear deal with world leaders, Iran was not permitted to enrich uranium above 3.67% purity - the level required for fuel for commercial nuclear power plants - and was not allowed to carry out any enrichment at its Fordo plant for 15 years.However, Trump abandoned the agreement during his first term in 2018, saying it did too little to stop a pathway to a bomb, and reinstated US sanctions, which crippled the Iranian economy. Those measures - affecting oil exports, shipping and banks - included \"secondary sanctions\" on countries trading with Iran.Tehran retaliated by increasingly breaching restrictions under the deal, particularly those related to the production of enriched uranium.EPA/ShutterstockIran's economy is in deep trouble, with food inflation alone exceeding 70%Despite sanctions on certain products and industries, there are still more than 100 countries that trade with Iran.Its biggest export partner is China. In the year to October 2025, Beijing bought more than $14bn (£10.4bn) of products from Iran, according to figures from Trade Data Monitor based on official Iranian data. China is followed by Iraq, which received $10.5bn worth of goods from its neighbour. Iran also counts the United Arab Emirates and Turkey among its largest customers. Exports from Iran to Turkey jumped substantially from $4.7bn in 2024 to $7.3bn last year.Starting in Oman on Friday, the ongoing talks are the first involving US and Iranian officials since last June, when the US bombed Iran's three main nuclear facilities.The Iranian delegation was led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, while the US was represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One, Trump said Friday's talks were \"very good\", and that Iran \"looks like it wants to make a deal very badly\". \"If they don't make a deal, the consequences are very steep,\" the president said, adding that there will be another meeting early next week. Oman's Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the discussions, said they had been \"useful to clarify both Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress\".The president has said he would be prepared to strike the Middle Eastern nation if it refused to reach a deal on its nuclear programme. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.The US has also built up a significant military presence in the region, including what Trump describes as a \"massive armada\" in response to Iran's violent repression of nationwide anti-government protests last month. Human rights groups have said that many thousands of people were killed in the crackdown, but the full scale of the bloodshed remains unclear due to internet restrictions imposed by the government since 8 January.",

    "body": "15 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says he 'didn't see' racist clip depicting Obamas as apesUS President Donald Trump has said he \"didn't see\" the part of a social media video which showed a racist clip depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was at the end of a 62-second video he shared containing claims about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The video was later removed.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said \"I didn't make a mistake\" when asked whether he was going to apologise.He added he had only seen the beginning of the video before it was posted by a staff member and didn't know it contained that depiction of the Obamas. Republican Senator Tim Scott - who is black - described it as \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The White House initially defended the clip as an \"internet meme video\" and told critics to \"stop the fake outrage\".But after fierce backlash, including from several Republican senators, the post was removed from Trump's Truth Social account and a White House official said that a staffer had \"erroneously\" made the post.The clip - which recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys - appears to be taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October. That video also depicts several other high-profile Democrats as animals, including New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump's predecessor in the White House, Joe Biden, is also depicted as an ape eating a banana. The Obamas have yet to comment on the video. The video was one of dozens posted to Trump's Truth Social account overnight.\"I look at a lot of thousands of things,\" the president said while aboard Air Force One on Friday, adding that after watching only part of the video he \"gave it to the people who generally, they look at the whole thing\".He says he liked the video's message on voter fraud, but that if his staff had looked at the whole thing, \"probably they would have had the sense to take it down\".\"We took it down as soon as we found out about it,\" he added. ReutersSome criticism came from within Trump's own party. Senator Scott, a South Carolina Republican and an ally of Trump, posted that he was \"praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".\"The President should remove it,\" he added. Another Republican, New York representative Mike Lawler, called the post \"wrong and incredibly offensive - whether intentional or a mistake\" and said it \"should be deleted immediately with an apology offered.\" The criticism continued even after the post was taken down. John Curtis, a Republican Senator from Utah, posted on social media that the video was \"blatantly racist and inexcusable\". \"It should never have been posted or left published for so long,\" he wrote. According to CBS, the BBC's US partner, Florida representative Byron Donalds - a longtime supporter of Trump's who is running for governor - called the White House after the video was posted and was told that it was the work of a staffer who \"let the president down\". The BBC has contacted the White House for clarification on how many people have access to the president's account and what the approval process is for posts. In a statement sent to the BBC earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the clip is from \"an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King\". \"Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,\" she added. Before it was removed, Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, called the video \"disgusting and utterly despicable\" and accused Trump of attempting to distract the public from the Epstein case and a \"rapidly failing economy.\" Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications in the Obama White House, said: \"Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our country.\" In a short post of his own, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said that \"Donald Trump is a racist\". \"Disgusting behaviour by the president,\" the office of California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X. \"Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries - who himself accused Trump of racism last year after he shared an AI-image depicting Jeffries with a moustache and sombrero - responded to the recent video by calling Trump a \"vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder\". \"Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry,\" he added. The clip of the Obamas was added to the end of a minute-long video which included claims about a voting conspiracy in Michigan in the 2020 presidential election. Those claims were debunked as part of Dominion Voting System's successful civil legal actions against some media companies.Trump also has a long history of criticising and attacking Obama.Before his first term as president, Trump regularly made false claims that the Hawaii-born Obama was actually born in Kenya and therefore was ineligible to be president.He later acknowledged that Obama was born in the US.",

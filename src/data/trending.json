What’s really going on with Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine?AmericastAvailable for over a yearDonald Trump has posted on social media that ‘something good just may be happening’ when it comes to negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, after overnight talks in Geneva.\nEuropean leaders criticised a 28-point US peace plan when it emerged last week, saying it was too favourable to Russia. A new plan has been promised, but President Zelensky has played down Trump’s hopes of progress.\nSarah, Anthony and Marianna join Matt Chorley on 5 Live to answer your questions. We look at who’s actually involved in putting the plan together? And what does Donald Trump stand to gain from the proposed deal?\nPlus, the MAGA icon and Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene says she will resign from Congress following her bitter feud with the president last week. Could we start to see power shifts within the MAGA movement following her departure? And why did Trump say the behaviour of some Democrats was “punishable by death”?\nPlus, what happened when the mayor-elect of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, met Donald Trump in the White House on Friday? Clips of the meeting quickly went viral, with users commenting on the warmth between the two leaders. Is this the start of a fruitful friendship between Trump and Mamdani - or is it all just for show?\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

The pair, who married in 1989, had three children and five grandchildren.In a post on Instagram, the Virgin Group founder said his wife was his \"best friend\" and \"guiding light\". \"She was the most wonderful mum and grandmum our kids and grandkids could have ever wished for,\" the 75-year-old wrote. The entrepreneur did not say what caused her death. In his post, Sir Richard wrote: \"Heartbroken to share that Joan, my wife and partner for 50 years, has passed away.\"He added: \"She was my best friend, my rock, my guiding light, my world. Love you forever, Joan x.\"The couple married on Necker island, owned by Sir Richard, in the Caribbean and had three children, Holly, Sam, and Clare Sarah, who died after four days. Paying tribute to his mother, Sam Branson described her as \"the kindest, most loving, warm and abundantly generous woman to walk this Earth.\"\"I am so deeply grateful to have had the privilege of being your son and being able to call you mum,\" he added.Getty ImagesSir Richard Branson and Lady Branson with daughter Holly Branson and the tycoon's mother Eve Branson in 2013In 2018, Holly wrote in a blog that her mother was raised in the centre of Glasgow and worked in a pawnbroker's shop, and, later, at a London bric-a-brac store in Portobello Road in west London. She said it was there that her father first fell in love with Lady Branson and \"turned up at the shop every day for months, buying stuff he didn't want or need.\"Holly described her mother as \"a stay-at-home mum who was (and still is) always there with a hug, inspiring words of wisdom, and a beautiful, welcoming smile.\"In a blog to celebrate their wedding anniversary five years ago, Sir Richard said he \"fell for Joan almost from the moment I saw her\".\"Joan has always been a steady source of wisdom and has played no small part in some of my better life decisions,\" he added.

    "body": "A parking inspector and his wife have been arrested on suspicion of embezzling more than €1m (£878,000) from a small German town's parking meters.The unnamed municipal employee is thought to have taken coins out of parking meters in Kempten \"on numerous occasions\" and placed them in bank accounts that his wife had access to, local police said in a statement.A money laundering report by a credit institution alerted investigators to the suspected theft. The inspector faces charges relating to 720 alleged incidents of theft, while his wife faces charges of aiding and abetting theft, also in 720 cases.Kempten Mayor Thomas Kiechle said he was \"stunned and dismayed\" by the allegations. In October, the Kempten public prosecutor's office was informed that cash was repeatedly being deposited into several bank accounts, according to the German news agency DPA.Police then searched office premises in the early hours of 24 November, the same day that the 40-year-old man and 38-year old woman were arrested.They are now being held in separate detention facilities.It is not clear how long it might have taken the couple to accrue the sum.In response to the allegations, Kiechle announced the appointment of a commission to \"review past work processes, uncover potential weaknesses, and reliably remedy them for the future.\"Kiechle noted that the names of the couple could not currently be released due to the ongoing investigation and privacy concerns.In a written statement, Kiechle said: \"I naturally support the public prosecutor's office and the police in their thorough investigation of the allegations.\"\"Until the proceedings are concluded, the presumption of innocence applies,\" he added.Kempten is one of the oldest settlements in Germany. Located in the country's south, it sits under the hills of the Allgäu and has around 70,000 residents.",

    "body": "Image source, Ben Whitley / PA WireByStav DanaosLead Weather PresenterUpdated 25 November 2025With a cold spell gripping the UK over the last week and bringing snow for many, you may be wondering whether winter has arrived.The answer is almost, but not quite. According to the meteorological calendar, the last week of November is the last week of autumn, notable this year for its vibrant autumn colours and changeable, whiplash-like weather patterns. The UK has recorded both the warmest November overnight minimums and the coldest November nights for 15 years.So when will we see the official start of winter and what kind of temperatures could that bring?Defining the start of winterImage source, Danny Lawson / PA WireImage caption, The recent cold snap created this snowy scene in the North York MoorsThere are two common ways to define the start of our seasons in the UK -  meteorological and astronomical.BBC Weather follows the meteorological calendar, where winter always begins on 1 December and ends on the last day of February. Meteorologists use fixed three month periods for each season, which makes year-on-year comparisons between them easier. Astronomical winter starts on the 21 December, known as the winter solstice and is the shortest day of the year. The season then runs until the vernal or spring equinox which in 2026 is Friday 20 March. What makes winter winter?We define winter as the three coldest months - December, January and February - and when we look at a list of record low temperatures from across the UK we can see why. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK is –27.2C (–17.0F), reached on three separate occasions in Scotland:Braemar, Aberdeenshire, on 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982Altnaharra, Sutherland, on 30 December 1995Other national record lows include:England: –26.1C (–15.0F) in Newport, Shropshire, on 10 January 1982Wales: –23.3C (–9.9F) in Rhayader, Powys, on 21 January 1940Northern Ireland: –18.7C (–1.7F) in Castlederg, County Tyrone, on 24 December 2010But the UK does not often experience prolonged very cold weather, and some winters are so mild that it feels as if we skipped the season all together.In February 2019 England and Wales saw an exceptional spell of warmth, with temperatures rising above 20C on more than one occasion. What impact is climate change having on winter?Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / NikonmanImage caption, Flooding in Martock, Somerset, December 2023UK winters are becoming warmer and wetter due to human-driven climate change. Long term data shows rising average temperatures and fewer cold weather extremes.With global temperatures continuing to rise UK winters are now about 1C warmer than a century ago. The decade 2015–2024 has been 1.24C warmer than the 1961–1990 average. Indeed, six of the ten warmest UK winters on record have occurred since 2000.Globally 2023 was the warmest year on record where most days in December broke temperature records.Air and ground frosts have fallen by around 25% since the 1980s, and snow days are becoming increasingly rare across the UK.A warming world means we are more likely to see winter precipitation fall as rain rather than snow, external.However, even in a warming climate the UK can still experience spells of extreme cold. In 2018 the infamous Beast from the East brought severe wintry conditions to many parts of Europe leading to significant disruption, and its impact lingered well into meteorological spring.",

    "body": "Australia's landmark social media ban for children is being challenged in the nation's highest court, with two teenagers alleging the law is unconstitutional as it robs them of their right to free communication.From 10 December, social media firms - including Meta, TikTok and YouTube - must ensure that Australians aged under 16 cannot hold accounts on their platforms.The law, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. However, 15-year-olds Noah Jones and Macy Neyland - backed by a rights group - will argue the ban completely disregards the rights of children.\"We shouldn't be silenced. It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,\" Macy Neyland said in a statement.After news of the case broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told parliament the government would not be swayed.\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she said.The Digital Freedom Project (DFP) announced the case had been filed in the High Court on Wednesday. Teenagers rely on social media for information and association, and a ban could hurt the nation's most vulnerable kids - young people with disability, First Nations youth, rural and remote kids and LGBTIQ+ teenagers - the most, the group said on their website.Led by a New South Wales parliamentarian, John Ruddick, DFP said their challenge would hinge on the ban's impact on political communication, and whether it was proportional to the law's aims.Other measures to improve online safety should be used instead, the group argued, pointing to digital literacy programmes, the forced introduction of age-appropriate features for platforms, and age assurance technologies which have greater privacy protections.Noah Jones argued the government's policy was \"lazy\". \"We are the true digital natives and we want to remain educated, robust, and savvy in our digital world... They should protect kids with safeguards, not silence.\"Australian media have previously reported that Google, which owns YouTube, has also been considering launching a constitutional challenge.Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has defended special envoy Steve Witkoff as doing the \"standard thing\" after a leaked recording appeared to show him advising a Russian official on how to appeal to the president.Trump told reporters on Wednesday he had not heard the audio, but that Witkoff was doing \"what a dealmaker does\" to \"sell\" the peace plan to both Russia and Ukraine.The leaked call from last month emerged days after a 28-point draft peace plan presented by the US largely reflected Russian positions on its full-scale war in Ukraine.Witkoff has visited Moscow several times this year and will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin again next week. He has not held talks in Kyiv.He has never gone to Kyiv in his role as special envoy, although other US officials have visited and US army secretary Dan Driscoll went to Kyiv this week and Trump says he will hold further talks with the Ukrainians.Diplomatic talks have continued after the initial draft plan was criticised by Ukrainian and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia. Among the proposals was a handover to Russia of Ukrainian-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine.The plan has since been revised to better reflect Ukraine's interests and the views of European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he is ready to meet Trump to discuss outstanding \"sensitive points\".In the leaked audio recording obtained and shared as a transcript by Bloomberg, Witkoff appeared to advise Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, on how to get on Trump's good side.BBC News has not independently verified the reported 14 October call, but Trump said it represented a \"very standard form of negotiations\". During the leaked conversation, the two men reportedly talked about ending the war, with Ushakov asking if it would be useful to get their bosses - Putin and Trump - to speak.Witkoff is quoted as saying he does and that \"my guy is ready to do it\", before suggesting how to go about the call.\"Just reiterate that you congratulate the president [Trump] on this achievement... that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen,\" Witkoff is quoted as saying. \"I think from that it's going to be a really good call.\"\"I told the president that you - that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That's my belief,\" Witkoff adds according to the transcript. \"The issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise.\"\"I'm even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza,\" Witkoff adds.The call ends with Witkoff telling Ushakov of an imminent Zelensky visit to the White House and that \"if possible\", Trump and Putin should talk before that meeting.What followed was a two-and-a-half hour phone call between the US and Russian presidents, news of which emerged as Zelensky was on his way to Washington last month.Before the Trump-Putin call, the US president had appeared to be running out of patience with his Russian counterpart and had suggested he might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.By the time Zelensky entered the White House, the atmosphere appeared to have changed. Trump said giving Kyiv Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and he believed Putin \"wants to end the war\".Asked about the leaked call, Yuri Ushakov told Russian state media that it was done to \"hinder, probably\" and that it was \"unlikely\" to be done to improve relations.He also confirmed that Witkoff would be visiting Moscow next week as per a \"preliminary agreement\".It was not clear who was behind the leak, but Bloomberg has also transcribed another reported call between Ushakov and Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who spent days with Witkoff in Miami in late October weeks before the 28-point draft plan emerged.According to the transcript, Dmitriev tells his Russian colleague: \"We'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal. And let them do like their own.\"Apparently angered by the report, Dmitriev complained of a \"well-funded, well-organised malicious media machine built to spread fake narratives, smear opponents and keep people confused\".",

    "body": "58 minutes agoOscar EdwardsBBC WalesPA MediaThe multi-million pound vehicles are made in Merthyr TydfilThe Army has paused the use of its Ajax armoured vehicles after soldiers became unwell from noise and vibration during a military exercise.About 30 soldiers became ill when training to use the armoured fighting vehicles over the weekend, and an investigation has been launched \"out of an abundance of caution\", the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.Some emerged vomiting from the vehicles, while others were shaking after the military exercise on Salisbury Plain, according to The Times newspaper.It comes just weeks after the UK government said it was \"confident\" Nato allies would be interested in buying the armoured vehicles that were made in south Wales.Defence minister Luke Pollard claimed the £6.3bn programme had \"left its troubles behind\", as Ajax declared initial operating capability (IOC), which means it can deploy a squadron on operations.The multi-million pound vehicles, made in Merthyr Tydfil by General Dynamics, were originally due to enter service in 2019.\"This weekend, a small number of soldiers reported symptoms of noise and vibration, having taken part in an exercise involving the Ajax armoured fighting vehicle,\" an MoD spokesperson said.Upon testing \"around 30 personnel presented noise and vibration symptoms\". A \"small number of personnel\" are still receiving expert medical care, it added, but the \"vast majority\" have been cleared for duty.\"Out of an abundance of caution, the minister for defence readiness and industry has asked the Army to pause all use of Ajax for training and exercising for two weeks, while a safety investigation is carried out into the events this weekend.\"A small amount of testing of the vehicle will continue, in order to ensure that any issues can to identified and resolved.\"The Ajax vehicles were originally due to enter service in 2019 but the programme has seen long delaysThe Ajax programme has suffered long delays because noise and vibration have injured soldiers who have tested the vehicles.A review of the £6.3bn programme in 2023 highlighted \"systemic, cultural and institutional problems\" at the MoD and a \"a number of errors of judgement\" in the Ajax project.More than 160 Ajax vehicles have been built, out of an intended 589.Before the two-week pause was declared, it had been estimated that full operating capacity for the programme may not be achieved for another four years.Speaking on 5 November, Pollard said the Ajax vehicles had proved to be the \"most advanced medium-weight armoured fighting vehicle on the planet\".\"We have more than a full squadron ready to go, ready to fight, ready to win, with more in the pipeline,\" he added.Ajax is a replacement for the aging fleet of CVR(T) vehicles which first entered service in 1971.AnalysisBy Jonathan Beale, Defence correspondentThe Ajax armoured vehicle has long been referred to as a \"troubled programme\" - plagued by delays and technical faults. The British Army ordered the vehicle in 2014. It was supposed to be fully in service by now. But it's not. Problems with excessive noise and vibration were said to have been resolved years ago. In 2023, then Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Ajax had finally \"turned the corner\". There are clearly still problems. The Ministry of Defence often rejects allegations of being involved in a long list of procurement errors. But that's getting harder to deny with Ajax. A failed attempt to hide some of the projects problems hasn't helped either.More top stories",

    "body": "6 hours agoJon DonnisonCorrespondent, JerusalemZaher IbrahimMohammed Ibrahim was 15 when he was arrested at his family's holiday home in the occupied West BankA Palestinian-American teenager is expected to appear in court in Israel later this week after nine months in detention without being charged.Mohammed Ibrahim, who is 16 and lives in Florida, was arrested in February while on holiday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank for allegedly throwing stones at Jewish settlers, something he denies.Last month, 27 Democratic US Senators and House members sent a letter to the US State Department, urging the Trump administration to do more to pressure Israel to release him.In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Mohammed had committed a \"a serious potentially deadly crime\" and that the court was proceeding under due process.The teenager's family disagrees.\"You can ask anybody you know, he's a real sweet boy, into his sports and his PlayStation and school,\" his father, Zahar Ibrahim, tells me before wiping a tear from his eye.Mohammed was arrested in a raid on his family's holiday home in the Palestinian village of al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya in the middle of the night by Israeli soldiers. He was 15 years old at the time.Mr Ibrahim has not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February.\"He's just a regular fun kid that loves and respects anybody,\" Mr Ibrahim tells me from the holiday home.Unable to speak to his son for nine months, Mr Ibrahim has only heard accounts of his detention through court documents and says his son was forced to confess.According to the court documents, he says, Mohammed woke up surrounded by Israeli soldiers. \"They tied him up and blindfolded him, and they threw him on the floor of the jeep and took him to wherever they took him.\"Mr Ibrahim, a father of four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, says his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.The Israeli prime minister's office has not responded to a request for comment on whether Mohammed is being held without charge or the allegation that he was beaten while in detention.The US embassy assigned a case worker who has visited Mohammed in prison. Mr Ibrahim says they told him he had lost a lot of weight and was not doing well.He has a message for President Donald Trump, another Florida resident.\"Do what you said from day one. You know America first. He's American, and he's a citizen and he's a child. So, you know, as a president, his [Trump's] duty is to protect Americans, and we're not seeing that for Mohammed.\"\"What's lucky about an American passport?\" Mr Ibrahim says. \"It's not helping. That's one thing that usually a foreign passport makes a difference, but the US state department is not really doing anything.\"A state department spokesperson told the BBC that it was \"tracking Mr Ibrahim's case closely and working with the government of Israel on this case\".US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and embassy staff in Jerusalem were also \"deeply involved\", they said, before adding that they could not comment further \"due to privacy and other considerations\".Zaher IbrahimMohammed is accused of throwing stones at Israeli settlers - something he deniesBecause Mohammed is an American citizen who was only on holiday in the West Bank when he was arrested, his case has attracted the attention of US lawmakers.\"This is a case where the US does have influence. It's just failing to exercise its influence, and that's a great dereliction of duty,\" says Democratic US Senator, Chris van Hollen, from his office in Washington DC.Along with 26 other US lawmakers he has written a letter to the state department and President Trump demanding more to be done to release Mohammed.\"If this were any other country, you would be seeing a much bigger effort. But for whatever reason, the Trump administration does not want to push the Netanyahu government to do what it needs to do,\" Van Hollen tells us.\"You have an American citizen who is being terribly mistreated, who has been beaten up, who has been deprived of adequate food and nutrition, and I haven't heard much from the US government. I haven't heard anything from the secretary of state. I mean, Donald Trump himself. I mean, who says that he is the 'America First' president?\"Mohammed is being held without charge at Ofer prison in the West Bank. It also houses adult detainees, including some who have been convicted of the most serious terrorist offences including murder.Mohammed's case has become relatively high profile because he is an American citizen.But there are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.Many have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.\"We should be demanding justice,\" says Van Hollen.As I leave Zahar Ibrahim's holiday home in al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya, he looks drained and alone. The house is sparse. Just a set of weights to fill his time.All he can do is wait.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMayeni Jones,Africa correspondent,Madina Maishanu,BBC Hausa, MinnaandJames ChaterAPThe abduction took place on 17 November in Kebbi State, with a more recent incident in neighbouring Niger StateA group of 24 Nigerian girls who were abducted from their boarding school over a week ago have been released, the country's president said.Armed assailants stormed the school in Nigeria's Kebbi State on 17 November, killing two members of staff and abducting 25 students. One was able to escape soon after.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu praised security forces for their \"swift response\" to the incident - although the circumstances of the girls' release remained unclear. Africa's most populous nation has suffered a spate of abductions in recent years - with more than 250 children abducted from a Catholic school last Friday still missing.In a statement, a special adviser to the president confirmed that all the girls taken from the school in Kebbi State had been accounted for, saying that the raid had triggered copycat kidnappings in two neighbouring Nigerian states.Tinubu said that more personnel would be deployed to \"vulnerable areas to avert further incidents of kidnapping\". In a separate post on X, Tinubu wrote: \"The Air Force is to maintain continuous surveillance over the most remote areas, synchronising operations with ground units to effectively identify, isolate, disrupt, and neutralise all hostile elements.\"More than 1,500 children have been abducted from Nigerian schools since 2014, when 276 girls were abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction.On Friday, at least 300 children and staff were abducted from St Mary's, a Catholic boarding school in Niger state, according to the Christian Association of Nigeria, which says that at least 250 remain unaccounted for.However, some Nigerian officials have suggested that the number of those kidnapped may be lower.The main Catholic cleric in the region has told the BBC that Nigeria's government is making \"no meaningful effort\" to rescue those still missing.The abduction at the school was the third to hit Nigeria in a week, forcing President Bola Tinubu to cancel his trip to the G20 summit, held in South Africa at the weekend, to deal with the crisis.UN education envoy Gordon Brown called on the international community to \"do our utmost\" to support efforts to return the abducted children.Brown, a former UK prime minister, said: \"It's also incumbent on us to ensure that Nigerian schools are safe spaces for learning, not spaces where children can be plucked from their classroom for criminal profit.\"The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.In the north-east of the country, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump threatened military action, accusing the Nigerian authorities of failing to protect Christians from attacks from Islamist militants.The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".The BBC was told that the schoolgirls abducted from the Government Girls Comprehensive Senior Secondary School (GGCSS) in Kebbi are Muslim. An official has said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of the jihadist groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority-Muslim north of the country.

    "body": "4 hours agoSimon DedmanEssex political reporter in EppingPA MediaEpping Forest District Council leader Chris Whitbread (centre) said \"a strong majority\" of councillors backed continuing court proceedingsEpping Forest District Council is going to continue its legal action and appeal against a High Court decision that rejected its case to close Epping's Bell Hotel to asylum seekers.Its Conservative leader, Chris Whitbread, told the BBC after a meeting on Tuesday night that \"we have agreed we are going to continue the process of appeal\", adding \"a strong majority\" of councillors backed continuing court proceedings.Earlier this month, Mr Justice Mould dismissed the council's claim, ruling an injunction was \"not an appropriate means of enforcing planning control\".The Home Office said the judgment allowed it to work to close every asylum hotel in an \"orderly, planned and sustained programme\".Epping Forest councillors moved into private session to discuss potential further legal actionThe extraordinary council meeting was held in private session, so councillors could receive legal advice.Mr Whitbread told the BBC afterwards that the cost of the legal action would be made public \"very soon\".He said \"council tax will be going up in the coming year, but not because of The Bell\", adding the cost would hopefully be found \"from our reserves\".Jon Whitehouse, Liberal Democrat group leader, said: \"The legal action initiated by the Conservative cabinet, which has cost far more than most councillors expected, has so far achieved precisely nothing except to drain the council's reserves.\"PA MediaThe Bell Hotel was the focal point of intense protests and counter-protests over the summerEpping became the epicentre for anti-asylum hotel protests this summer.They started after an asylum seeker was accused of sexual assault against a woman and teenage girl in the town centre.Hadush Kebatu, 41, was found guilty and sent to jail, before accidentally being released from Chelmsford Prison. He has since been deported to Ethiopia.The events sparked weekly protests and counter protests. It has split the community with those against the use of the hotel and others displeased with regular protests and marches and an increased police presence.Earlier this month, Epping Forest District Council lost a High Court case to seek an injunction against hotel owner Somani and the Home Office using the site on the edge of Epping to house asylum seekers.The local authority won an emergency interim injunction to close the hotel to migrants in the summer, only to have the ruling overturned by the Court of Appeal.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "13 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media EditorBBCA former BBC board member who quit last week has shared his resignation letter with BBC News, shedding new light on the events that led up to the departures of the corporation's director general and CEO of news.Shumeet Banerji resigned on Friday, citing \"governance issues\" but the full reasons were not known until now.In his damning letter, he said news boss Deborah Turness was told that \"she did not have the confidence of a majority of the board\".But, Banerji wrote, he was \"not invited to any meeting where a matter of such importance was to be discussed\".The details of the letter come a day after the corporation's chair, Samir Shah, told a select committee of MPs that he believed he had consulted Banerji, and the pair had had a \"26 minute call\".Banerji told BBC News on Tuesday he had followed the discussion at the committee with interest.He added: \"My resignation letter might clarify my reasons for resigning. It might also serve to inform misconceptions which may have arisen for committee members and viewers.\"​​Davie and Turness resigned as a result of the fallout over a Panorama episode that edited together parts of a 2021 speech by US President Donald Trump.​​It was sparked by a leaked memo to the board sent by a former external adviser, Michael Prescott.​​Since then, concerns have been raised in some quarters about how the BBC board operates. The board is responsible for oversight and strategy of the corporation.​​In his letter, Banerji wrote: \"I will not be seen as a participant in a board decision on which I was not consulted, nor one which in my view has had adequate discussion.\"​​On Monday, Shah was asked directly by MPs about Banerji's resignation and rejected his claims that he hadn't been consulted about the events leading to the departures of Turness and Davie.​​\"I am both disappointed and surprised by what he has to say\", Shah replied, telling the committee: \"I would say he was consulted\".​​Banerji's resignation letter gives a different version of events. He said two board meetings had been held to discuss the crisis at the corporation after the Prescott memo leaked.​​He had been unable to join the first meeting, but on the second had been surprised to learn that Turness had already been told that \"she did not have the confidence of a majority of the board\".​​\"I was not invited to any meeting where a matter of such importance was to be discussed,\" he wrote.​​\"Nor has your office asked for an urgent need to discuss where we are. I requested a phone call with you yesterday.​​\"You may well have spoken to each director and asked for ayes and nays but the reason there are boards is to have reasoned discussions about important matters. This has not happened.\"​​He also said he was not surprised Davie had also resigned as he would have seen the board's lack of confidence in his head of news as \"a direct assault on himself as the editor-in-chief and CEO\".​​He suggested the board had acted \"in the white heat of press excoriation\" and concluded: \"The lesson for detractors of the BBC is leak and launch. Will the departures of two of our most senior, respected and loved executives make the BBC stronger? Somehow, I doubt it very much.\"​​The release of the full letter adds to the pressure on Shah, after the culture committee chair Caroline Dinenage on Monday questioned whether the BBC was in \"safe hands\" under him.House of CommonsBBC chairman Samir Shah gave evidence to MPs yesterday Banerji's letter is also an insight into what was happening behind the scenes as the crisis unfolded. In the committee hearing, board members were at pains to present a position of unity, although this letter paints a different picture.It also helps explain what one board member Caroline Thomson described as a \"continuing and sharp difference of opinion\".BBC News had already reported that the board blocked Turness and the news division from apologising for the Donald Trump edit, after the Telegraph began reporting on the leaked memo.In his appearance before the committee on Monday, Shah told MPs the apology \"took its time\" because \"I needed to make sure that what I was apologising for was fully sourced and fully right\".Banerji is suggesting the board made Turness' position untenable. One insider to the process has told me she had already decided to resign because she didn't have confidence in the board and viewed them as a \"circular firing squad\".

    "body": "49 minutes agoPete AllisonCulture reporterNetflixStranger Things' fifth and final season will be released in three parts before the end of 2025It's been over three years since Stranger Things fans' last visit to Hawkins, Indiana.The fictional US town is home to one of Netflix's biggest hits, and the long wait for its blockbuster final series is nearly over.But, you'd be forgiven for having forgotten what Eleven and her bike-peddling pals were up to when we were last in their troubled neighbourhood.Here are key questions you might be asking if the show's hiatus has your memory feeling a little Upside Down.When are new episodes out?The first four episodes of Stranger Things' fifth season drop on Netflix in the UK early on Thursday 27 November at 01:00 GMT.That's a late night for any UK fans intent on avoiding spoilers, but it's because the series is being released at the same time globally. For example, it will be 17:00 on Wednesday for viewers in Los Angeles, and 20:00 Wednesday for fans in New York.But, bingers beware, you'll have to wait until Christmas Day for episodes five, six and seven.The final series will then conclude with its eighth episode, The Rightside Up, on New Year's Eve.Stranger Things' entire story will be told before 2025 is over, but how many of its beloved characters will still be with us by New Year's Day?How did the last season end?Getty ImagesL-R: Sadie Sink, Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Noah Schnapp and Millie Bobby BrownSeason four's finale involved the gang splitting up to bring down Vecna.We learned Eleven essentially created the villain herself, having used her powers to send Henry Creel tumbling through dimensions.Henry had targeted Eleven inside a research facility where experiments were carried out on her and her supernatural abilities.Burning up en route to the Upside Down, he transformed into Vecna and later set his sights on finding his way back through Eleven's friend Max, who he (briefly) kills.While their friends seemingly destroy Vecna, Eleven's intervention to resurrect Max gives the villain a lifeline.The divide between the Upside Down and Hawkins is flung open as fields of flowers wilt, clouds turn black and bright red flashes of lightning fill the sky.Who is Henry Creel?Or should we be calling him One? Or Vecna?Henry Creel gained powers when he slipped into an alternative dimension for 12 hours.Outcast Henry's life fails to improve when his family relocates to Hawkins, where he spends his free time hanging out with spiders in an attic.During a spectacularly disastrous family meal, Henry uses his powers to kill his parents and finds himself on the radar of staff at Hawkins National Lab.Once there, Dr Brenner labels Henry \"001\" or \"One\", his first research subject.Dr Brenner suppresses Henry's powers by placing a chip in his neck and moves his attention onto other children, including Eleven.Henry bides his time, watching other subjects closely before befriending Eleven.She helps him recover his powers, which ends badly and their battle sends him crashing and burning towards his transformation into Vecna.Why is Stranger Things a big deal?Getty ImagesThe show helped revitalise the career of two-time Academy Award nominee Winona RyderStranger Things is one of the biggest gems in Netflix's crown, and became one of the streaming giant's earliest original hit series in the mid-2010s.Netflix's own stats say the show's fourth season alone was viewed more than 140 million times, or around 1.8bn viewing hours. As the show's fandom grew, so did the profile of its predominantly young cast.Millie Bobby Brown, 12 when she first appeared as Eleven in 2016, has gone on to become one of Hollywood's brightest stars.The British actress has appeared in two Godzilla films and a Sherlock Holmes spin-off, based on the detective's teenager sister, Enola.Meanwhile, Stranger Things spawned the West End production The First Shadow and revitalised the career of two-time Academy Award nominee Winona Ryder.David Harbour's performance as Jim Hopper has proved to be his gateway into blockbuster hits including Marvel films Black Widow and Thunderbolts.",

And this sprung floor is just fabulous.\"Mr Hill said he was \"gobsmacked\" to be back dancing with his wife in the ballroom\"This is our place,\" said Mr Hill, who was born in Blackpool but currently lives in Wantage, Oxfordshire, with his wife.He said he felt \"gobsmacked\" to be back.\"My wife was a bit nervous to dance, but I pushed her around a bit,\" he joked.Mr Hill has a piano at home but does not really play it now because of his dementia, but after being given the chance to play the famous Wurlitzer organ after their dance he could not resist.\"That really was something,\" he said after playing. \"I'm really honoured to sit at it, let alone play it.\"Olivia WattsGranddaughter Oliva Watts (right) reached out on TikTok to give the couple one last dance at the ballroomIt was also an \"emotional\" moment for Ms Shane, who said: \"It was special, really special.\"They are a beautiful couple with a beautiful family.\"Ms Shane said Mr Hill \"could obviously dance, he plays piano, but he'd forgotten\". \"As soon as the organ started to play, he started to dance.\"He took Marilyn to the floor and then he went and played [the organ].\"It was still there, and that moment in here it came back,\" she said.\"We should think about that for our friends and relatives, we just need to be making moments and celebrating people while we still have them.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on BBC Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.

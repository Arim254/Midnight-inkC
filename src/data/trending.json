It's to do specifically with the national stadium.</p><p>Which is not to say that Wembley is never vibrant for England - think back to the Euros in 2021, and what it sounded like when Germany were beaten, or the explosion of noise when Luke Shaw opened the scoring in the final.

width=\".75rem\" height=\".75rem\"></svg></a></div></div></div><div><div><p>Available for over a year</p><p>There was an extraordinary moment at the White House on Wednesday when, in front of reporters, secretary of state Marco Rubio handed Donald Trump a note that read the words “very close”, followed by a whisper where he told the president that Israel and Hamas were on the brink of reaching a Gaza ceasefire agreement. \nAlthough there are many details of the plan still being worked on, this could potentially be a pivotal moment. Posting on Truth Social, the president said that all Israeli hostages held in Gaza would be released soon in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israel. \nIn today’s podcast, Sarah and Anthony discuss Donald Trump’s role in the process, how much credit he can personally take, and what it tells us about US foreign policy. \nHOSTS:\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Alix Pickles.

It will be optional for students, pensioners or others not seeking work.</p></div><div><p>The UK Parliament petition opposes the creation of any national ID system and demands the government ditch its plans, which petitioners claim \"would be a step towards mass surveillance and digital control\".</p><p>The number of signatures means the issue will be debated by MPs in the coming weeks and has also received an official government response, confirming plans to introduce digital ID \"to help tackle illegal migration, make accessing government services easier, and enable wider efficiencies\".</p><p>The statement says: \"This is not a card but a new digital identity that will be available for free to all UK citizens and legal residents aged 16 and over (although we will consider through consultation if this should be age 13 and over). </p><p>\"Over time, people will be able to use it to seamlessly access a range of public and private sector services, with the aim of making our everyday lives easier and more secure. </p><p>\"It will not be compulsory to obtain a digital ID but it will be mandatory for some applications.\"</p><p>Defending the plans to consider the inclusion of 13 to 16-year-olds in the scheme, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told LBC: \"Everybody has forms of digital ID... We all have different ways of having to prove who we are.</p><p>\"Lots of 13-year-olds already do [have a form of digital ID], and what the department is going to be consulting on is exactly how that should be taken forward.</p><p>\"I do think that this is the right way forward, to have this standardised process now, and it's something that we had been already setting out for people who come to work from abroad.\"</p></div><div><p>However, civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch branded the scheme \"Orwellian\" and urged MPs to reject plans.</p><p>Director Silkie Carlo said: \"The prospects of enrolling even children into this sprawling biometric ID system is sinister, unjustified and prompts the chilling question of just what Starmer's government think the digital ID will be used for in the future.</p><p>\"At a time when parents are taking a critical view of whether children should have smartphones, it is shocking that the government is considering enroling children into this digital ID app.</p><p>\"We now know that digital IDs could be used for everything from tax and benefits to banking and education -- it has all the hallmarks of a sprawling national database that Britain has long rejected.\"</p><p>The Liberal Democrats said the consultation on offering digital ID to 13-year-olds showed they had been right to warn about \"mission creep\".</p><p>\"It's frankly sinister, unnecessary, and a clear step towards state overreach,\" said the party's science and technology spokesperson Victoria Collins.</p><p>During <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdj66llg9go\">a trip to India this week</a>, Sir Keir praised the country's Aadhaar digital ID system, which is far more extensive than the plans initially announced for the UK and involves the storing of biometric data, as a \"massive success\".</p><p>He signalled Britain could use the technology for services like banking, pointing to New Delhi's scheme as an example, and said ministers must \"make the case\" for the \"huge benefits\" the scheme could offer.</p><p>No 10 said Britain's system would not necessarily copy India's biometric data usage and signalled the UK scheme would be run by the public sector.</p><p>Other countries that already have digital ID systems include Estonia, Demark and Spain, as well as Canada and Japan.</p><p>The European Union is introducing the Digital Identity (eID) Wallet, which all member states will be required to roll out to citizens by the end of 2026.</p><p>Digital ID schemes are also being piloted in non-EU countries Norway, Iceland, and Ukraine.</p></div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/z7hc239\">Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter</a> to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

A White House official responded by saying the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\" .</p><p>Announcing the recipient of the prize at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo on Friday, the committee warned that \"democracy is in retreat\" across the world.</p><p>Machado - who has been forced to live in hiding for much of the past year - was recognised for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy\", Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes said.</p><p>She has been a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided... in a brutal authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis\", he added.</p><p>\"Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.\"</p></div><div><p>Machado - who has long been one of the most respected voices in Venezuela's opposition - was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which Maduro won a third six-year term in office. </p><p>The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.</p><p>Even after she was barred from the polls, she managed to unite the notoriously divided opposition faction and succeeded in getting millions of Venezuelans behind the little-known candidate which replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González.</p><p>When the government-controlled National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner - even though tallies from polling stations showed that González had won by a landslide - Machado continued to campaign from hiding as the Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest.</p><p>Machado expressed shock in response to the award, saying it was the \"achievement of a whole society\".</p><p>\"I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve this,\" she said in a video message.</p><p>González, meanwhile, wrote on social media that the prize was \"well-deserved recognition for the long struggle of a woman and of an entire people for our freedom and democracy\".</p><p>Frydnes was critical of Venezuela's leadership during a news conference after the prize was announced, saying the committee saw the same trends emerging around the world.</p><p>\"[The] rule of law abused by those in control, free media silenced, critics imprisoned and societies pushed towards authoritarian rule and militarisation,\" he said.</p><p>He added that he hoped Machado would be able to attend the award ceremony in Oslo in December but acknowledged the serious security situation.</p></div><div><p>There were 338 candidates nominated for this year's peace prize, according to the Nobel Committee - though the names of the nominees will not be revealed for 50 years, as per tradition.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly said that he deserves the award, on one occasion declaring that \"everyone says I should get it\".</p><p>A number of world leaders backed his bid, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cnvm2ngnpe1o\">Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, who publicly revealed a nomination letter while visiting the White House</a>, as well as the governments of Pakistan and Azerbaijan - despite nominations closing in January, just as Trump's second term began.</p><p>Asked whether pressure from the US president and some in the international community to award Trump the prize had impacted the committee's deliberations, Frydnes said there had been many campaigns and \"media tension\" in the \"long history\" of the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>\"We base our decision only on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel,\" he said.</p><p>Reacting to Friday's announcement, the White House's communications director Steven Cheung wrote in a post on X that the \"Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace\".</p><p>\"President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives.</p><p>\"He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will,\" Cheung added.</p><p>The Nobel Prize, which is split into six categories, celebrates the work of people or organisations that have contributed \"the greatest benefit to humankind\".</p><p>Frydnes said that Machado met \"all the criteria\" laid out by Nobel for the prize, and \"embodies hope for the future\".</p></div><div><p><span>More on this story</span></p></div></article>",

    "body": "Brisbane is not a city to give England some much-needed Ashes optimism.After defeat by Australia in the first Test, the tourists must stir themselves for a trip to the Gabba, a ground where England have not won since 1986.Men wearing three lions have habitually been lambs to the slaughter at the Gabbatoir.Among a recent history of broken English hopes, dreams and bodies is a source of inspiration delivered by a shining knight.It is exactly 15 years since Sir Alastair Cook conquered the Gabba with a career-defining 235 not out, saving the first Test of 2010-11 and setting England on course to their only Ashes series win in Australia in the past 38 years.It was the beginning of Cook's triumphant circumnavigation of Australia; three hundreds and 766 runs. Wally Hammond is the only Englishman to score more runs in a series in this country.England won 3-1, with all victories by an innings. They have not won a Test here since.\"You forget the tough times, the nervousness and anxiety that went into that,\" Cook tells the Test Match Special podcast.\"I look back with pride. I played a significant part in a series when England won 3-1 in Australia and all three games were won by an innings. That just doesn't happen. One day, I need to sit down and watch some of it.\"Cook's road to his Australian epic began 18 months earlier, at the end of the 2009 Ashes in the UK. England won, but the opener averaged less than 25 with just one score above 50.He wanted more.\"Cricket is a team game, but the individuality does make you feel like you want to pull your weight,\" he says. \"The stats are very clear. I wanted to be part of an Ashes series I did well in, then it would have meant more.\"I wanted to judge myself against the best and my game wasn't stacking up against the best bowlers in the world.\"Two days after the celebrations I was back hitting hundreds and hundreds of balls in the nets with Graham Gooch, trying to groove something very unnatural, thinking in the long run it would be better for my technique.\"The initial results were encouraging. Cook made three hundreds on the 2009-10 winter tours to South Africa and Bangladesh.When Cook returned to England for the 2010 summer, the left-hander had a \"stinker\". In eight innings against Bangladesh and Pakistan, his highest score was 29.On nought not out at the end of the second day of the third Test against Pakistan at The Oval, Cook was convinced he was playing his last Test innings before being dropped.\"I was sitting in the bar, trying to find the answer in the bottom of a beer bottle,\" he says.\"I made the promise to myself: 'Don't get out defending tomorrow'. That was where I was at.\"It was a clearing of the mind. I decided to go back to my old technique. I attacked and had 76 by lunch on the third day.\"Cook's 110 guaranteed his seat on the plane to Australia, albeit via an infamous team-bonding trip to Bavaria dreamt up by England coach Andy Flower and captain Andrew Strauss.Players carried bricks uphill and did hundreds of press-ups. James Anderson suffered a cracked rib in a boxing session. Luckily for Cook, he missed almost all of it.\"I was at my brother's wedding,\" he says. \"I turned up for the last day. The most broken men were Strauss and Flower. I thought it served them right because they organised the thing.\"I'm genuinely disappointed I did miss it. For the next little while there were always references back to that camp. At the time it was horrendous, but the fact we were still talking about it years later shows it had its worth. I think people really opened up around the camp fire every night.\"Well-drilled on and off the pitch, England continued their preparations by winning two and drawing one of their warm-up games in Australia - Cook scored a century against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval.Come the first Test at the Gabba, they were hit by Peter Siddle's hat-trick, then hundreds from Mike Hussey and Brad Haddin.An hour before the end of the third day, Cook and Strauss opened England's second innings with a deficit of 221 runs. They reached 19-0 at stumps and followed up with a performance etched in Ashes folklore.\"I don't remember the messages, anything of what we spoke about,\" says Cook. \"We had an experienced team and the pitch had no demons. We just had to show some fight.\"The left-handers added 188 for the first wicket. Strauss made 110. When the captain fell, Jonathan Trott eased into Cook's slipstream for an unbeaten 135.Cook's 235 not out was the highest score by an Englishman in Australia for 82 years, beaten by his own 244 not out in Melbourne seven years later. England racked up 517-1 to save the Test and put Australia on the back foot.\"It was my 14th Test hundred, but the first time when it felt like I had really contributed and made a difference,\" says Cook.\"It gave us a lot of belief the Australian team were there for the taking. We got out of jail, but in a way that gave us a lot of confidence.\"England capitalised on an astonishing first morning of the second Test in Adelaide. Simon Katich was run out by Trott's direct hit from the fourth ball of the match and Australia captain Ricky Ponting was out first ball to Anderson.When Anderson also nicked off Michael Clarke, Australia were 2-3 and never recovered. The home side spiralled to 245 all out, leaving England one over to bat at the end of the first day.\"We got into the changing room and Flower asked if we were having a nightwatchman,\" says Cook.\"If Jimmy Anderson opened the batting, got out, then I went out to bat, imagine the stick I'd have got from the Australians when they were pumped up.\"Straussy usually took the first ball, but I said to him 'I'm going out there now and will face the first ball. You do what you want'.\"He said 'OK. I'll do it as well'.\"Cook followed up his Brisbane heroics with 148 in a Test remembered for Kevin Pietersen dismantling the Australian attack in his 227. Off-spinner Graeme Swann took five wickets in the second innings to bowl England to victory just before the heavens opened on the fifth day.\"After struggling the whole last summer, I was hungry for runs, and there's no better place to be hungry than a flat Adelaide pitch in 40-degree heat,\" says Cook.\"The KP double hundred was a real marker of dominance, of taking Australia down. He led it, the team got ahead of the game. He hammered Australia into the ground.\"England could have retained the Ashes in Perth, only for Mitchell Johnson to foreshadow the havoc he would cause four years later.England bowled out Australia for 268 and reached 78-0 in reply before Johnson got going. The left-armer took nine wickets in the match and England lost by 267 runs.\"We had a team meeting straight after and I wasn't sure it was the right thing to do,\" says Cook.\"It turned out to be the right move. Flower wanted us to look at how we lost the game.\"Did we take our eyes off what we were doing and started to think about the end result? Did we think we had done all the hard work and were going to win? Maybe we were thinking about retaining the Ashes there in Perth. I don't know.\"There were questions we maybe didn't have the answer to, but it was important to get them out. We went to Melbourne and the Perth game was buried. It was 1-1 and it became a two-match series.\"Australia were flying, there were pictures of Ricky Ponting all over the newspapers, people were saying we were done.\"What followed was perhaps England's single greatest day of Ashes cricket in Australia.At the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the 100,000-seater cathedral of Australian sport, and on Boxing Day, the highlight of the calendar in this country, the home side were blown away for 98. England - Cook and Strauss - were 157-0 at the close.\"If Carlsberg did Boxing Days, it was that. There was disbelief at the end of the day,\" says Cook. \"Me and Strauss cleared the MCG with our batting - most people wanted to go home when we were batting together.\"The Aussies are very proud of how many people they can get to the MCG on Boxing Day. By the end there were only 20,000 English people watching me and Strauss grind it around Melbourne.\"If I could go back through my career and play any one day over again, that would be right up there because of what we did as a group.\"Trott made 168 and England won by an innings and 157 runs. They celebrated retaining the Ashes with a sprinkler dance on the MCG outfield.\"I felt a little bit uneasy doing it, because we hadn't gone there to retain the Ashes - we'd gone there to win,\" says Cook.\"I enjoyed the dressing room in Melbourne and a few of the lads went out and enjoyed a night with the Barmy Army, but we hadn't finished yet.\"A result of 2-2 would have felt a bit of an injustice. However good Melbourne was, we still had Sydney.\"Fuelled by the focus to win the urn, Cook was at it again at the Sydney Cricket Ground. His 189 lifted England to 644, their highest total in a Test in Australia.The question was not if England would win the match and the Ashes, but when.\"The fourth evening, Chris Tremlett bounced out Brad Haddin and brought Mitchell Johnson to the wicket,\" says Cook.\"The song the Barmy Army sang, I've never heard anything like it. I spoke to Tremmers and he said 'I'm just going to bowl this as fast as I can'. He bowled an absolute jaffa to Johnson, and it bowled him. I've never heard noise like it.\"England took the extra half an hour on that fourth evening, but could not get over the line.The fifth morning was a victory procession. The Barmy Army and the rest of the travelling supporters were joined in the SCG by every ex-pat and backpacker in Sydney for an English Ashes party.\"The atmosphere was incredible,\" says Cook. \"It felt like an age, I was desperate to take the final wicket.\"When Tremlett got Michael Beer out to win the match, it was a moment of pure elation, just incredible.\"It was so early in the day, we had so much time to soak it in. I don't know when we left the ground, but we stayed for absolutely ages, on the outfield and in the changing rooms. It was very, very special.\"Cook was player of the series. The remaining seven years of his Test career were illuminated by other milestones: a starring performance in the 2012 series win in India, winning the Ashes as captain in 2015 and breaking the England records for most Test runs and hundreds.There were low moments, too, most notably the humiliating 5-0 defeat in Australia when he was captain in 2013-14.Following his international retirement in 2018, Cook was knighted for services to cricket. That service was best delivered on the 2010-11 tour of Australia.\"I couldn't have played any better,\" he says. \"I was very lucky to have been part of that team, achieving something rare for England in Australia.\"When you win games of cricket, it is unbelievably special. It was hard work, but international sport is hard work.\"It was such a good team to be part of. Flower and Strauss were tough, and that regime was very regimented, but we had the time of our lives there.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal correspondentIrish author Sally Rooney has told the High Court it was \"almost certain\" she cannot publish new novels in the UK and may have to withdraw her current books because of the banning of Palestine Action under terrorism laws.Rooney says UK legislation may mean she cannot be paid royalties by her British publisher or the BBC because it could leave both at risk of being accused of funding terrorism.In August, she said she intended to use royalties \"to go on supporting Palestine Action\".The group was banned in July after the home secretary accused it of causing serious damage to property. Its co-founder is challenging that ban in the High Court, arguing it interferes with the right to protest.The author of Normal People, which was adapted into one of the most watched BBC dramas of recent years, has supported the campaign to reverse the ban.In two witness statements provided to the High Court, Rooney said she believed that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza - and Palestine Action's activity in the UK was from a \"long and proud tradition of civil disobedience - the deliberate breaking of laws as an act of protest\".She went on: \"I myself have publicly advocated the use of direct action, including property sabotage, in the cause of climate justice. It stands to reason that I should support the same range of tactics in the effort to prevent genocide.\"Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence.Rooney said the ban on Palestine Action under terrorism laws also had far reaching consequences for her as an author and her right to free expression.She explained she periodically receives royalties from the BBC's adaptions.In August she declared in an Irish Times article that she intended to use those royalties \"to go on supporting Palestine Action\".Following that statement, she said she had been advised that any such payment to her for those televised dramatisations could be a breach of terrorism laws.That warning had come from the independent producer of the two BBC dramatisations of her novels. It told her agent that it had received \"unambiguous legal advice\" that if it knew or suspected that Rooney was using royalties from the TV dramas to fund Palestine Action, sending her the money would be a terrorism offence.\"It is therefore unclear whether any UK company can continue to make payments to me, even when it had agreed to do so,\" said Rooney.Rooney told the court that this legal uncertainty affected her rights as an artist - and her publisher's too.\"If... Faber & Faber Limited are legally prohibited from paying me the royalties I am owed, my existing works may have to be withdrawn from sale,\" she said.\"My novels have been influential and popular in Britain, where I am among the best-selling literary authors of the last decade.\"The disappearance of my work from bookshops would mark a truly extreme incursion by the state into the realm of artistic expression.\"It is also almost certain that I can no longer publish or produce any new work within the UK while this proscription remains in effect.\"Rooney publicly revealed in September that she did not believe she could travel to the UK anymore because of her stance.\"I am and will continue to be a committed supporter of Palestine Action. If that support is criminalised, I will effectively be prevented from speaking at any future public events in the UK.\"Is it likely that I could ever again collaborate with British public institutions like the BBC as I have done in the past?\"The hearing continues through Thursday with a final day of submissions next week.",

    "body": "14 hours agoEd Thomas,UK editor,Patrick ClahaneandRebecca WearnWatch: BBC joins officers on criminal network raidsThree men have been arrested in dawn raids following a BBC News investigation into organised crime gangs operating on the High Street.Two Iranian men aged 32 and 28 were arrested after immigration officers targeted multiple addresses in Birmingham and the West Midlands. The Home Office said the third man was a naturalised British citizen aged 43.They are being held on suspicion of facilitating illegal entry to the UK and facilitating illegal working.Earlier this month, the BBC found more than 100 mini-marts, car washes and barber shops operating from Dundee to south Devon were linked to a crime network.Andy Radcliffe, an assistant director at Immigration Enforcement, is leading an investigation into the BBC's allegations involving HMRC, the National Crime Agency, Companies House, police forces and Trading Standards.An investigation was \"immediately launched\" after the BBC's report, he said, with teams building \"an intelligence picture in the matter of a few weeks\".Mr Radcliffe added that this was just the start of the investigation \"to try and tackle the widespread abuse\".\"We're taking this very seriously... people could go to prison for this, we could take assets off them, so we're taking it very seriously,\" he said.Earlier this month, the BBC revealed evidence of criminal networks organising and profiting from undocumented working in barber shops, mini-marts and carwashes across the UK.The Home Office launched an \"urgent investigation\" involving police forces across the country after the BBC uncovered more than 100 businesses linked to a suspected Kurdish crime network enabling migrants to work illegally and sell counterfeit cigarettes in High Street mini-marts.The investigation found an asylum seeker, who says his claim was rejected, trying to sell a mini-mart for £18,000 in cash.Undercover reporters also exposed a man at the centre of an immigration crime group who said he had \"customers in every city\" and could wipe illegal working fines worth up to £60,000.Loose regulation of Britain's labour market is acting as a pull factor for those entering the UK illegally, the government has acknowledged.The Home Office launched an \"urgent investigation\" involving police forces across the country after the BBC reportHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood said these kinds of criminal networks \"create an incentive for people to come here illegally\".Questioned by the BBC last week on whether the government had lost control of High Streets to Kurdish organised crime gangs, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"What your reporters were able to scrutinise and show is absolutely evidence of why our system is broken.\"It's why this government has been cracking down on illegal working.\"In the Budget, the chancellor announced funding for 45 new Trading Standards officers.Rachel Reeves said the government would be undertaking \"additional enforcement activity on High Streets, focusing on illicit tobacco and vaping products\", which would involve deploying 350 newly-recruited criminal investigators part of the fraud investigation team.Minister for migration and citizenship Mike Tapp praised the BBC investigation and its reporting saying \"really it shows the value of the BBC\".On a government level, he said: \"We said we take it seriously and we have and we are.\"I hate what these, you know, hairdressers, nail bars and dodgy vape shops are doing to, so many of our high streets, not just for the look and feel of them, but also for those genuine businesses that are being undercut. So it's really important that we continue to work hard to combat this.\"Additional reporting by Phill Edwards",

Yermak has played a crucial role in Ukraine's response to Russia's full-scale war, and he is Kyiv's lead negotiator in peace talks with the US. However, his position has become increasingly under threat from critics calling for him to go.Yermak confirmed on social media that both the anti-corruption bureau and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sapo) were \"conducting procedural actions at my home\" and had full access to his apartment, with his lawyers on site.He added that he was co-operating fully.",

    "body": "21 minutes agoShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentandKoh EweA Japanese court has ruled the country's ban on same-sex marriage as  constitutional - bucking a trend set by courts around the country that had raised hopes for marriage equality in Japan.The ruling was met with disappointment from plaintiffs and their legal team who had gathered outside the Tokyo courthouse.Japan is the only G7 country that does not fully recognise same-sex couples or offer them clear legal protection. But it's not an outlier in Asia, where only Taiwan, Thailand and Nepal offer same-sex marriages.Ayumi Higashi, the judge who delivered the verdict, said laws on same-sex marriage should first be deliberated in parliament, the Mainichi reported.Outside the Tokyo courthouse on Friday, the plaintiffs of the lawsuit and their legal team held up signs that read \"unjust verdict\", local media reported.Shino Kawachi, one of the plaintiffs, told local media that the ruling was \"difficult to comprehend\". \"What is justice? Was the court even watching us? Were they considering the next generation?\" she told local media.Her partner, Hiromi Hatogai, said she was \"extremely outraged\" and wondered if the judiciary was \"on our side\". But, she added, they would \"keep fighting\". Amnesty International described the ruling as a \"damaging step backwards on same-sex marriage\".\"The Japanese government needs to be proactive in moving towards the legalisation of same-sex marriage so that couples can fully enjoy the same marriage rights as their heterosexual counterparts,\" the rights group's East Asia researcher Boram Jang said in a statement.The verdict on Friday is the last among six high court rulings on same-sex marriage lawsuits filed between 2019 and 2021, in courts across the country from Sapporo to Osaka to Fukuoka.Among them, five found the ban unconstitutional - though they rejected the plaintiffs' compensation claims.Friday's ruling by the Tokyo high court marks an exception to this series of verdicts, which had been adding weight to the push for same-sex marriage to be legalised in Japan.The cases will next be taken to the Supreme Court.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNadine YousifWatch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah BeckstromOne of the two members of the National Guard who were shot in Washington DC on Wednesday has died, US President Donald Trump said.Sarah Beckstrom, 20, succumbed to her injuries, while the second National Guard member, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, \"is fighting for his life\", Trump said on Thursday evening.Both were shot at close range near Farragut Square in downtown DC just after 14:00 EST (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Police have arrested one suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old from Afghanistan.The soldiers had been deployed to the capital as part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on what it sees as rampant crime in several US cities.Trump confirmed Ms Beckstrom's death while on a Thanksgiving call with US service members. \"Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we're talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person... She's just passed away. She's no longer with us,\" he said. Trump later spoke to her parents, a White House official told BBC's US partner CBS News.Ms Beckstrom had enlisted on 26 June 2023 and was assigned to the 863rd Military Police Company, 111th Engineer Brigade of the West Virginia Army National Guard. She had volunteered to work in Washington over the US holiday Thanksgiving, Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News following the shooting.Jim Justice, a Republican senator from West Virginia, said he was \"absolutely devastated\" to learn of Ms Beckstrom's passing. \"Our prayers are with her family, friends, and fellow guardsmen during an incredibly difficult Thanksgiving Day,\" he said in a statement.\"We are also lifting up Andrew Wolfe in prayer as he continues his journey to recovery.\"Both soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets, an area where many office workers mill around at lunchtime.More than 2,000 troops have been guarding the nation's capital since August, when the president began deploying troops to cities to tackle what he called \"out of control\" crime.Ms Beckstrom and Mr Wolfe were among those who were deployed in August, the West Virginia National Guard confirmed to BBC News.National Guard troops are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.The location of the shooting, just blocks from the White House, meant a number of law enforcement officials arrived quickly at the scene to treat the two victims and apprehend the gunman.The suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS News.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanSuspect once worked alongside CIA in AfghanistanOfficials said Mr Lakanwal came to the US from Afghanistan in 2021.He will be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed, as well as possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro  told a news conference on Thursday morning, before news of Ms Beckstrom's death.\"We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree,\" Pirro had said. \"But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge: murder in the first degree.\"Bondi told Fox News on Thursday that her office will seek the death penalty against the suspect, calling him a \"monster who should not have been in our country\".Mr Lakanwal reportedly came to the US under a programme named Operation Allies Welcome, which offered special immigration protections to Afghans in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.He had helped guard US forces at Kabul airport in 2021 as thousands scrambled to escape Afghanistan as the Taliban swept back to power, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC's Afghan Service.The suspect had been recruited to Unit 03 of the Kandahar Strike Force. His unit was known locally as Scorpion Forces, operating initially under the CIA but eventually for the Afghan intelligence department known as the National Directorate of Security.Mr Lakanwal was a GPS tracker specialist, the former commander told the BBC, describing him as a \"sporty and jolly character\".His whole unit was moved from Kandahar to Kabul five days before the Taliban entered the capital. They continued to protect the airport for another six days, before they too were airlifted out to the US.At a press conference on Thursday morning, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed Mr Lakanwal's connection to US forces, saying the suspect \"had a relationship in Afghanistan with partner forces\", before moving to the US.Mr Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024, and his application had been granted earlier this year, an official told CBS.On Thursday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services chief Joseph Edlow said the president had directed him to conduct \"a full scale, rigorous re-examination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern\".When asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the agency pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.Additional reporting by Hafizullah Maroof and Sayed Abdullah Nizami of the BBC Afghan Service",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said he will \"permanently pause migration\" to the US from all \"third world countries\".The US president said in a Truth Social post that the decision would \"allow the US system to fully recover\" from immigration policies that had eroded the \"gains and living conditions\" of many Americans. He did not provide details of his plan or name which countries might be affected.The president also blamed refugees for causing the \"social dysfunction in America\" and vowed to remove \"anyone who is not a net asset\" to the US.His comments come a day after an Afghan national was accused of shooting two members of the National Guard in Washington DC, one of whom died.Trump previously said the shooting underlined a major national security threat and promised to take steps to remove any foreigner \"from any country who does not belong here\".On Wednesday, the US suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, saying the decision was made pending a review of \"security and vetting protocols\".Then on Thursday, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would re-examine green cards issued to individuals who immigrated to the US from 19 countries.When asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the agency pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.There were no further details about what the re-examination would look like.Trump's latest post on Thursday night went further, pledging to \"end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens\". The flurry of announcements follow reports that the suspect in Washington DC shooting came to the US in 2021 under a programme that offered special immigration protections to Afghans in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Officials said Rahmanullah Lakanwa once worked alongside the CIA in Afghanistan and helped guard US forces at Kabul airport during evacuations, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC's Afghan Service.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJon Donnison,JerusalemandDoug FaulknerWatch: BBC correspondent examines footage showing moments leading up to shooting in the occupied West BankVideo has emerged showing Israeli security forces shooting dead two Palestinians who appeared to have surrendered in the occupied West Bank.The incident happened during an ongoing Israeli military operation in the city of Jenin. The Palestinian Authority (PA) accused Israeli forces of committing a \"war crime\" and described the killings as \"brutal\" field executions.The Israeli military and police say the men were wanted men \"affiliated with a terror network\" and the incident is under review. Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has given his full backing to the officers involved, adding that \"terrorists must die\".The video shows two Palestinian men come out of a building with their hands up. They are surrounded by a number of Israeli border guards. They then kneel on the ground. One of them lifts his t-shirt, apparently to show that he is not armed.After a short period, they move back into the building. Border police then open fire, killing them.A joint statement from the IDF and police said forces had been trying to apprehend wanted individuals who had carried out \"terror activities\", including throwing explosives and firing at security forces.\"The forces entered the area, enclosed the structure in which the suspects were located, and initiated a surrender procedure that lasted several hours,\" the statement said.\"Following the use of engineering tools on the structure, the two suspects exited. Following their exit, fire was directed toward the suspects.\"Writing on X, Ben-Gvir said \"the fighters acted exactly as expected of them\".The raid in Jenin is the latest in a months-long Israeli campaign in cities in the northern West Bank, which Israel says is necessary to tackle Palestinian armed groups it says were responsible for attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers. On Wednesday the Israeli military launched an operation in the nearby city of Tubas.Violence in the West Bank has spiked since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023, which led to a devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza.Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, including members of armed groups and civilians, in the West Bank since then, the UN says. At least 44 Israelis, including soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during Israeli military operations, Israel says. ",

    "body": "6 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe Louvre museum received nearly 9 million visitors in 2024Ticket prices for the Louvre museum in Paris will rise by 45% for most non-European Union visitors, the museum's board decided on Thursday.From early next year, tourists from countries like the US, UK and China will have to pay €32 ($37; £28) to enter the museum, a price hike which is expected to raise millions of euros annually to fund an overhaul of the famous gallery.The museum's security and management have faced criticism since a brazen heist in October, when a four-person gang stole jewellery worth $102m (£76m) and fled within minutes.An official audit of the museum published shortly after the heist highlighted the institution's inadequate security systems and ageing infrastructure.From 14 January, visitors from countries outside the European Economic Area - a group which includes EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - will pay an extra €10 to enter the world's most visited museum.The Louvre received nearly 9 million visitors last year, with the majority coming from abroad. More than a tenth of its visitors are from the US and around 6% from China, according to the museum.There have been longstanding calls to address the museum's capacity to accommodate crowds, with visitors often complaining of congested galleries and long queues.In January, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Louvre announced improvements to the museum, and suggested higher fees for non-EU residents in 2026.Getty ImagesThe Louvre, home to the Mona Lisa, is the most visited museum in the worldMacron also said the Mona Lisa would be moved to a new space to deal with overcrowding.Most of the Louvre's 30,000 daily visitors flock to see Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. Crowds squeeze through the Salle des États - the gallery where the Mona Lisa is displayed - leaving each visitor only moments to view the painting and snap a photo.The Louvre will also renovate other areas of the museum and add new amenities like toilets and restaurants - upgrades which are projected to cost several hundred million euros.Earlier this month, the Louvre announced the closure of a gallery showcasing Greek ceramics due to structural concerns.The investigation after October's heist found the museum had spent significantly more on buying new artworks, but far less on maintenance and restoration.",

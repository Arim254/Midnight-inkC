    "body": "Aston Villa have won nine games in a row in all competitions, but can they reach double figures by beating Manchester United on Sunday?\"Villa have gone behind in three of those games and haven't kept a clean sheet in their past four matches,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. \"But they have been so attacking and Morgan Rogers is absolutely flying. They just never seem to lie down.\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.For week 17, he takes on Zambian musician and rapper Sampa the Great.Sampa the Great's new single, Can't Hold Us, is out now and is included in the EAFC 26 video game.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, Abu DumbuyaImage caption, Another Sampa the Great track, Let Me Be Great, was featured on the Fifa 23 soundtrack. She met up with the Zambia squad at a training camp before Afcon 2025 and has a created a special football shirt to celebrate the national team and ZamrockThe Africa Cup of Nations begins on Sunday and Sampa is looking forward to seeing how Zambia, the 2012 winners, get on in Morocco.\"I have my fingers crossed because I am still holding on to that win that we had,\" she told BBC Sport. \"It was just so memorable.\"I have no idea how we are going to do this time, but I am very excited, and very hopeful about our chances. We've just had a restructure and appointed a new coach too [Moses Sichone] so I am also hoping that can push us more.\"It is not just Zambia who I will be looking out for, though. I don't think people know how much of an Afcon fan I am, and how much rivalry I have with my friends - especially when their teams get knocked out!\"Afcon is huge for us when it comes around and everything else kind of shuts down while everyone just focuses on the tournament. \"It is such an exciting time when the whole of Africa kind of bands together as a continent to celebrate.\"Chris Sutton and Sampa the Great were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

His side are very principled in the way they play and they will cause Newcastle problems.I am still going to go with the Magpies to win it, though. I usually back them at home anyway, but this is prediction is mainly based on Chelsea's recent record at St James' Park, which is poor - they have not got anything there since 2021.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Sampa the Great's prediction: Both teams are quite inconsistent - this is going to be close. 2-2AI's prediction: 1-2Vitality Stadium, 15:00Both of these sides are without a win in seven league games but Burnley's problems are deeper because they have lost every time during that run.So, their boss Scott Parker really needs a positive result against his former club.We have had callers on 6-0-6 suggesting his time is up at Turf Moor, but I think that is harsh because they have still been competitive despite all those defeats.I always thought they would struggle this season after getting promoted and I am sure their fans did too but, as I have said many times already, because Sunderland are doing so well, it means Clarets fans are asking: 'Why can't that be us?'Bournemouth were second on 26 October, but are now 13th after taking only three points in total from those seven games.The Cherries' 4-4 draw at Old Trafford on Monday was an extraordinary game and proved again what I already thought - that they have goals in them.I can see Burnley giving them a good game too, but this is where Andoni Iraola's side get back to winning ways.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Sampa the Great's prediction: Bournemouth drew 4-4 last time? That is a lot of goals! I am going for them to get more here too... Burnley have had a lot of losses! They will be motivated and I always think the underdog can surprise people, but not this time - Burnley are going to lose again! 4-2AI's prediction: 2-1Amex Stadium, 15:00Sunderland are an amazing team, and winning last week's Wear-Tyne derby is just the latest high for them in what has been an a brilliant season.The Black Cats are on 26 points after 16 games, and have already beaten Leicester's total from 38 games last season - they were relegated with 25 points in 18th place.That's an extraordinary achievement. I know they are losing a few players to Afcon, but that would only be a big problem if they were languishing near the bottom of the table.Instead this just feels like an opportunity for the players coming in to try to maintain their momentum. Regis le Bris and his team will be full of confidence too, although this is a tricky trip for them to the south coast.Brighton are a real Jekyll and Hyde side at the moment, but I always feel they will do well at home - they have only lost once there this season.I watched the Seagulls at Anfield last week. They should have scored at 0-0, but didn't... and lost.This time? My instinct still tells me to go with Brighton at Amex Stadium, but Sunderland are going to push them very close.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Sampa the Great's prediction: I can't pick a winner here. 3-3AI's prediction: 2-0Etihad Stadium, 15:00This just feels like it will be a routine win for Manchester City, who have won their past six games in all competitions and are building real momentum.West Ham, in contrast, are in the bottom three and facing one heck of a scrap to stay in the Premier League.It hardly helps the Hammers that all the teams immediately above them picked up at least a point last weekend while they were losing at home to Aston Villa.I do think their performances have improved under Nuno Espirito Santo, but they really need some points to go with that, and this is not a game where I think that is particularly likely.I just can't look past City for the win, because I don't see West Ham keeping them out.What a goal Rayan Cherki scored against Brentford in the EFL Cup on Wednesday - I got a bit of flak on the Monday Night Club, and on social media too, for agreeing with Pep Guardiola that he needs to cut out the rabonas and use his left foot instead, but he is a huge talent and he has has kicked City on.City have kept three clean sheets in a row in the Premier League too, which surprises me a bit - and makes me think they will concede here, but this will still be a comfortable afternoon for them.Sutton's prediction: 3-1Sampa the Great's prediction: I think there will be tears for West Ham. City are going to take this one. 4-3AI's prediction: 3-0Molineux, 15:00What a miserable Christmas party the Wolves players must have had. They are not staying up, not a chance.They pushed Arsenal close with their rearguard action at Emirates Stadium last weekend, but still lost in the end.Rob Edwards needs something, anything, to go his way after five defeats from five games and maybe - just maybe! - he will get a crumb of comfort on Saturday.The reason I say that is because Brentford's away record is woeful, with seven defeats and just one win in the Premier League so far.I still think the Bees might nick it, but instead I am going for Wolves to get a point and bring a tiny bit of Christmas cheer to Molineux, although I am not sure how long it will last.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Sampa the Great's prediction: Wolves have waited a long time for a win but I feel like they can take this one. 2-1AI's prediction: 1-2Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 17:30It is normally a good game when these two sides meet but, going into it this time, I suppose both sets of supporters are unsure how their team will perform.At Tottenham, poor Thomas Frank is having a tough time of it.He was so furious after their defeat at Nottingham Forest that he said it feels like there is a hurricane inside him. I can understand why he is so angry, because Spurs were so limp and offered so little in that game.If you look at where they are in the table, 11th, then they are doing all right but it is their performances that are lacking something. They have never really found any fluency under Frank.They did win their past two home games and Frank can cling on to that but, the way Spurs fans are, they are probably thinking: 'It was only against Brentford and Slavia Prague.'Winning this game would be far more of a statement. Even though Mohamed Salah has left for Afcon, there are still questions over Liverpool too.Brighton had their moments last week and it was not entirely comfortable for Arne Slot's side, although I thought Hugo Ekitike was excellent.Liverpool could have another problem at right-back because Joe Gomez came off injured in that game. Dominik Szoboszlai has been their best player, in midfield, so if he has to slot back in there, it would be a bit of a blow.I certainly don't trust Spurs to turn up, but I don't think you can fully trust Liverpool again either, especially away from home in the Premier League. Because of all of that, I can't back either of them to win it.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Sampa the Great's prediction: Both teams are under a bit of pressure for a win. 1-3AI's prediction: 1-2Hill Dickinson Stadium, 20:00Arsenal got very lucky with the way they beat Wolves last time out, but is that the mark of champions, that they can find a way to get over the line?The Gunners have been ugly at times this season but they still get the job done and it might be a similar story here.I can't see them losing this game but they will need to find a way to win it, against an Everton side who have won four of their past six matches.What might help Mikel Arteta out is that most of the Merseysiders' best players might be missing for this one.Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish are both injury doubts, while Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye are at Afcon with Senegal.That's a stinker for Toffees boss David Moyes, because Ndiaye in particular is so influential - and he is in my fantasy football team too.To be without all four of them would be a massive blow. I am not a medical expert but, if Dewsbury-Hall or Grealish have hurt their hamstrings in any way, which is what has been reported, then there is no way they will be fit for Saturday. Because of that, I am going for a narrow Gunners win to make it a 'Feliz Navidad' ['Merry Christmas' in Spanish] for Arteta, with his team top of the league.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Sampa the Great's prediction: Everton are going to surprise people. Arsenal only just beat Wolves, and this will be close too. 3-4AI's prediction: 1-2Elland Road, 20:00If Leeds striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin had hit this run of form a little bit earlier, he would have been my vote for Sports Personality of the Year.Calvert-Lewin has scored four goals in four games and his leap to score against Brentford last week was incredible.Fair play to Leeds boss Daniel Farke too. I've said it before, but I am delighted for him. He was written off a few weeks ago as not being able to manage in the Premier League and it felt as if some people were waiting for him to be sacked. He has proved them all wrong. Farke's side are always a handful at home and will relish the challenge of getting another good result on Saturday, but I can see this being a very close contest.Palace are the counter-attack kings and they are especially effective away from home - they have won their past three matches on the road and have the best away record in the Premier League this season with five wins, a draw and only two defeats from eight games so far.So, do I go with the energy of Leeds or back streetwise Palace? I am tempted to go with Oliver Glasner's side to nick it but they have got a Europa Conference League game to contend with on Thursday, which has stretched them in the past. They are going to miss Ismaila Sarr, too, who has gone to Afcon with Senegal, so on that basis I am going for another draw instead.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Sampa the Great's prediction: Leeds to edge this - just about! 3-2AI's prediction: 1-1Sunday, 21 DecemberVilla Park, 16:30Manchester United are still a bit of an oddity but they are entertaining, you'd give them that. They have scored eight goals in their past two games.United have some sort of hoodoo over Villa, who have only beaten them in one of their past 26 Premier League meetings - Unai Emery's first game in charge, in November 2022.I usually think that sort of history in a fixture holds a lot of weight when it comes to making my predictions.But Villa have already beaten Arsenal this month, so why can't they beat United? I think they can. Also, for Villa to have won nine games in a row is just unbelievable.I am a dreamer in life, as you will all know, and I want Emery to make it 10 wins in a row. Nothing against United, but I am going for another Villa victory.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Sampa the Great's prediction: Villa are favourites here, everything is working for them at the moment and they will have lots of confidence. 3-2AI's prediction: 2-2Monday, 22 DecemberCraven Cottage, 20:00Fulham are another team who I usually fancy to win at home, but they have been depleted by Afcon call-ups.Samuel Chukwueze has been a really good impact player recently but Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey have been the heartbeat of Marco Silva's side this season, and all three will be missed.As for Nottingham Forest, they are on fire with six wins in eight games in all competitions. Maybe 'Dyche-ball' is going under the radar a bit, because they are doing very well.Bassey got the winner in this fixture last season but, as I mentioned, he is not here and this is a very different Forest side too.I can see this being a very tight affair. I was looking for a reason to say my boyhood team Forest will win, but Harry Wilson will score for Fulham and they can't keep a clean sheet, so it has 1-1 written all over it.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Sampa the Great's prediction: This is a high stakes game - a win would be big for both teams. I hope there are more goals here, too! 3-2AI's prediction: 2-1How did Sutton do last week?Chris got four correct results with no exact scores from the 10 matches in week 16, giving him 40 points.The BBC readers fared better, with five correct results and no exact scores for a total of 50 points, while Chris's guest, England gaming star Daniel 'Stingray' Ray, also got five correct results but with one exact score, for a tally of 80 points.But, for the second successive week, the weekly win went to AI. It got seven correct results, with two exact scores, finishing with 130 points.",

The White House Chief of Staff, referred to by the president as the “most powerful woman in the world”, is the gatekeeper to the Oval Office and a crucial figure in delivering Trump’s national agenda. \nShe also rarely speaks to the media, making her an elusive figure in the president’s top team despite her significant influence. But in a series of interviews for Vanity Fair, she refers to Donald Trump as having an “alcoholic’s personality”, describes JD Vance as a “conspiracy theorist” and Elon Musk as an “odd, odd duck”. The White House has described the articles as a “framed hit piece” and accused Vanity Fair of taking statements out of context.\nIn today’s podcast, Justin and Anthony go through some of the most revealing lines from the interviews, and speak to the journalist who sat down with Susie Wiles - Chris Whipple - to find out why he thinks Wiles wanted to speak with him, and how he responds to White House criticism of the interviews.\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\nChris Whipple, Journalist and author of several White House books, including Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History \nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

    "body": "UK government borrowing was higher than expected last month, according to the latest official figures.Borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - was £11.7bn in November, whereas analysts had been expecting about £10bn.However, the figure was £1.9bn lower than in the same month last year and was the lowest November borrowing for four years. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the fall was mainly due to higher receipts from taxes and National Insurance contributions.Separately, the ONS reported retail sales had fallen unexpectedly in November as Black Friday failed to boost spending.Government borrowing for the financial year to November has now reached £132.3bn, which is £10bn ahead of where it was at the same point last year.Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray said last month's Budget would \"deliver on our pledge to cut debt and borrowing.\" \"£1 in every £10 we spend goes on debt interest - money that could otherwise be invested in public services,\" he said.The retail figures showed supermarket sales fell for the fourth month in a row, while discounts at retailers across November did not lift Black Friday spending as much as in recent years.Analysts had expected total sales volumes to rise by 0.4% in November. Instead, they fell 0.1%.The ONS said that over the three months to the end of November, sales rose by 0.6%, boosted by sales of computers, clothing and furniture.However, some analysts said the weeks of pre-Budget uncertainty had dented shoppers' confidence to spend.\"The chaotic run-up to the Budget hit consumer spending, driving retail sales into two consecutive monthly falls after a run of four rises from June to September,\" Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoTom Bennett,LondonandBernd Debusmann Jr,White HouseReutersThe UK has named career diplomat Christian Turner as its new ambassador to the US, Downing Street has confirmed.The previous ambassador, Lord Peter Mandelson, was sacked by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer after evidence, including emails and photos, emerged showing his continued association with the paedophile Jeffery Epstein.Turner has spent nearly 30 years working across Whitehall and the Foreign Office.As the new ambassador in Washington, he will have to navigate relations with the Trump administration, which have been partly strained by disagreements over how to handle the war in Ukraine, as well as President Donald Trump's criticism of Europe.The White House said it looked \"forward to working with Ambassador Turner to further enhance the strong relationship between the United States ‍and United ‌Kingdom\", according to a statement sent to Reuters news agency.The Foreign Office said in a statement that King Charles had formally appointed Turner, and the UK would now seek official approval - or agrément - for his appointment from the US.Turner said he was \"honoured\" to be nominated for the position. \"At a pivotal time for the transatlantic relationship, I look forward to working with President Trump's administration, and leaders in Congress, business and society to strengthen that bond in the years ahead,\" he said. Turner will face a heavy load of diplomatic tasks when he takes up the role.Chiefly among them is working with the US on Trump's push to end the war in Ukraine, which European nations fear will undercut the long-term interests of the continent in favour of a quick resolution.Earlier this month, a US national security strategy document - signed by Trump - argued that Europe was facing \"civilisational erasure\" and questioned whether certain European countries could remain reliable allies.Turner will also have to work to secure a long-anticipated but delayed tech deal with the US, amid concerns from some White House and congressional officials who have been critical of the UK's online safety laws. Some have characterised those regulations as \"censorship\" and legal overreach that impacts US firms.AFP via Getty ImagesPeter Mandelson (right) announced US-UK trade agreement alongside Donald Trump in May Sir Keir's government has pushed for close ties with Trump, hosting him on a second state visit in September, during which Trump praised the \"unbreakable bond\" between the US and UK.But just days before Trump arrived, Sir Keir sacked Lord Mandelson after revelations over his friendship to Epstein. Lord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.The Foreign Office reportedly pushed hard for a diplomatically experienced figure to be appointed as the new ambassador. Turner's previous roles include political director at the Foreign Office, British High Commissioner to Pakistan, and Foreign Office Director for the Middle East and North Africa. He also previously worked in 10 Downing Street as private secretary to the prime minister.Before entering government, he worked in television documentaries.In a statement released by the Foreign Office, Sir Keir said: \"The United Kingdom and United States have a very special relationship, and Christian's extensive experience as an outstanding diplomat will support this uniquely close bond and ensure it continues to flourish.\"Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said Turner would bring \"exceptional diplomatic experience and deep understanding\" to the role. Ambassador to the US is seen as one of the UK's top diplomatic postings. More on this story",

    "body": "The Australian government has announced a gun buyback scheme in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack - its deadliest mass shooting in decades.The scheme is the largest since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, which left 35 people dead and prompted Australia to introduce world-leading gun control measures.Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured on Sunday when two gunmen, believed to have been motivated by \"Islamic State ideology\", opened fire on a Jewish festival at the country's most iconic beach.On Friday, police also said there was no ongoing reason to detain a group of men who were arrested in Sydney over their \"extremist Islamic ideology\".Police allege Sunday's attack, which they have declared a terrorist incident, was committed by a father-son duo. Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.The day after the shooting, national cabinet - which includes representatives from the federal government and leaders from all states and territories - agreed to tighten gun controls.Speaking to media on Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there are now more than 4 million firearms in Australia - more than at the time of the Port Arthur massacre.\"We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney's suburbs... There's no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns. \"If you're going to reduce the number of guns, then a buyback scheme has to be a piece of that puzzle,\" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett added.The new scheme will purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms, and will be funded on a 50-50 basis with the states and territories. Hundreds of thousands of firearms will be collected and destroyed, the government estimates.National cabinet has also agreed to impose limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual, restrict open-ended firearms licensing and the types of guns that are legal and make Australian citizenship a condition of holding a firearm licence. Work on a national firearms register will be accelerated and firearm regulators will have better access to criminal intelligence.On Friday, New South Wales Police said they were preparing to release seven men with extremist ideology, but that they would continue to be monitored.Tactical officers swarmed on the group, who had travelled from Victoria and were known to police there, in dramatic scenes in the suburb of Liverpool on Thursday. Officers found a knife, but no guns or other weapons.NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference there is \"no confirmed link\" between the alleged terrorists and the detained group, but that Bondi Beach was one of several locations the latter was intending to visit.\"Whilst this specific threat posed by the males is unknown, I can say that the potential [for] a violent offence being committed was such that we were not prepared to tolerate the risk,\" Commissioner Lanyon said.",

The sampling of whale \"blow\" is a \"game-changer\" for the health and well-being of whales, said Prof Terry Dawson of King's College London.\"It allows us to monitor pathogens in live whales without stress or harm, providing critical insights into diseases in rapidly changing Arctic ecosystems,\" he said.The researchers used drones carrying sterile petri dishes to capture droplets from the exhaled breath of humpback, fin and sperm whales, combined with skin biopsies taken from boats.They confirmed for the first time that a potentially deadly whale virus, known as cetacean morbillivirus, is circulating above the Arctic Circle.The disease is highly contagious and spreads easily among dolphins, whales, and porpoises causing severe disease and mass deaths.It can jump between species and travel across oceans, posing a significant threat to marine mammals.The researchers hope this breakthrough will help spot deadly threats to ocean life early, before they start to spread.Nord UniversityThe researchers sampled humpback, sperm, and fin whales across the North-East Atlantic\"Going forward, the priority is to continue using these methods for long-term surveillance, so we can understand how multiple emerging stressors will shape whale health in the coming years,\" said Helena Costa of Nord University, Norway. The study, involving King's College London and The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in the UK, and Nord University in Norway is published in BMC Veterinary Research.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNadine Yousif,Max MatzaandTabby WilsonProvidence Police/Handout via ReutersPolice released a grab from CCTV footage showing the suspect at the Alamo rent-a-car where they matched his nameThe suspect ‍in ​last week's ‌mass shooting at Brown University has been found dead in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, following a six-day multi-state manhunt, police say. They identified the suspect as Claudio Neves Valente, 48, a Portuguese national who studied at the university in Providence, Rhode Island, about 25 years ago. Providence police chief Oscar Perez said video evidence and tips from the public led investigators to a car-rental location where they found the suspect's name and matched him to their person of interest.Officials said they also believe Valente killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor two days after the 13 December shooting at Brown.Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said Valente was found dead with a satchel and two firearms.  Evidence in a car nearby matched to the scene of the shooting at Brown University in Providence.Initial findings suggest Valente died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and police were unable to comment on how long he might have been inside the storage unit.\"Even though the suspect was found dead tonight our work is not done. There are many questions that need to be answered,\"  FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Ted Docks said, adding that the agency had deployed approximately 500 agents to assist local authorities in the investigation.ReutersImages of Claudio Neves Valente were displayed during the Thursday press conferenceBrown University President Christina Paxson said that Valente was enrolled at the Ivy League school from the autumn of 2000 to spring 2001, and was studying for a PhD in physics. He had \"no current active affiliation\" to Brown, she said. Officials said they believe Valente shot and killed MIT professor Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47,  on Monday at his home in Brookline, which is about 50 miles (80km) from Providence.Both the victim and the suspect had studied at the same university in Portugal in the late 1990s, police said.Officials said the cases were linked when the suspect's vehicle was identified via CCTV footage and a witness at Brown University.The same car was spotted nearby to the scene of the professor's shooting in Brookline, Massachusetts.\"He was using a phone that obfuscated the ability to track it,\" said Leah B Foley, the US state attorney representing Massachusetts.\"\"He was sophisticated in hiding his tracks.\"Authorities have not provided any suspected motive for either attack.For days, members of the public had expressed frustration at the investigation into the shooting at Brown University last Saturday, after it appeared to yield little progress almost a week after the attack. A gunman burst into Brown University's Barus & Holley engineering building and opened fire during final exams. Two students were killed and a further nine injured. Six remain in hospital. Authorities identified the two dead victims as Ella Cook, 19, a sophomore from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, 18, an Uzbek-American freshman student. Police had asked for patience from Rhode Islanders and on Wednesday released new footage of a person of interest, where a man was seen walking around the university campus with a black mask over his mouth. The FBI also offered a $50,000 (£37,350) reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the attack.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThe Minister for Women and Equalities, Bridget Phillipson, is blocking the publication of trans guidance that would require businesses and public bodies to protect women-only spaces, describing them as \"trans-exclusive\", according to the Daily Telegraph. The paper also focuses on Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's criticism of the government's plan to tackle misogyny in schools, saying it must look at immigration from cultures that \"don't respect women\". And the Prince and Princess of Wales' outdoor family Christmas photo with their three children takes the top picture spot under the caption \"Fresh heir\". A photo of actress Olivia Coleman at the launch of Labour's strategy to stop violence against women and girls is splashed across the Metro's front page. The government has revealed a raft of new measures aimed at cracking down on the \"national emergency\" and change men's behaviours towards women.The Independent follows with their lead on the government's vow to make women and girls \"safe at last\". The paper also focuses on a call from Under-Secretary of State for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls Jess Phillips for \"all of society to step up and end the epidemic of abuse and violence that shames or country\". Elsewhere, a smiling Rory McIlroy lifts the trophy for BBC Sports Personality of the Year.The i Paper is predicts a \"mortgage price war in spring\" after the Bank of England cut interest rates to 3.75%, the lowest since 2023. Mortgage brokers are hoping for a \"golden era of house buying\" early in the new year as the central bank expects inflation to fall quicker than expected, the paper says.The signs of cooling inflation also makes the Financial Times' lead story. Elsewhere, there are fears of financial reprisals by Russia among some EU states if a move to agree to a multi-billion euro loan in frozen Russian money to fund Ukraine's military and economic needs goes ahead. According to the paper, last year Western businesses held at least $127bn of assets in Russia.Staying with Russia, the Daily Express features comments by Badenoch, who says the Tories are the only party to have the \"competence\" to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats. The Conservative leader added that the UK could not afford complacency and must \"face down\" Russia, the paper reports.In news closer to home, nearly 10 million voters face having their local elections delayed until 2027 as part of Labour's plans to reorganise local government, the Times reports. The paper says the government has asked more than 60 districts and county councils if they want to suspend elections due to take place in May next year.\"Labour's running scared of voters\" is the Daily Mail's take. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has likened the move to the actions of a \"dictator\" the paper says.The Guardian turns its attention to the new photos from late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate released by US House Democrats. Among the new batch of images are what appear to be lines from the novel Lolita written on different parts of a woman's body, the paper says. As Christmas nears, around 1.8 million people will spend the day alone, says the Daily Mirror. The results from a poll have prompted pleas from ministers for people to \"pop in on a pal\" and look out for their lonely neighbours.The Sun reports that former Strictly Come Dancing contestant Thomas Skinner is suing the BBC over claims the broadcaster rigged voting to kick him off the show. A BBC spokesperson said: \"Strictly Come Dancing's public vote is robust and independently overseen and verified to ensure complete accuracy.\"Finally, the Daily Star pays tribute to darts ace Ally Pally's \"lucky wasp\", which was sadly swatted and killed after it landed on PDC World Championship winner David Munyua's face. \"Rest sting peace\" is the headline.On its front page, the Sun pins the blame for what it calls an \"unprecedented Foreign Office breach\" on a hacking group which has been accused of targeting critics of the Chinese state. The paper says Storm 1849 is believed to have tried to harvest sensitive political information from politicians and parliamentary staff in the UK. According to the report, this latest incident has \"sparked major fears\" that any stolen information could be used for fraud and bribery.\"Labour's running scared of voters\" is the headline in the Daily Mail, which leads on the government's consultation on postponing next year's local elections in some areas. The move is described as \"extraordinary\", with the paper saying it would \"rob more than 10 million people of a vote in May\" and could boost the prime minister's \"chances of survival\".According to the Times, the decision has \"enraged\" Reform UK, which has accused Labour and the Conservatives of \"colluding\" to stop the party getting into power.The women and equalities minister, Bridget Phillipson, is accused in the Daily Telegraph of blocking the publication of new guidance which would ban transgender women from female toilets. Sources tell the paper she has insisted on additional bureaucratic processes that have held up approval. The government insists Phillipson wants to make sure the advice is legally watertight.The Guardian reports that the former Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, is writing a memoir, which it says \"will be seen as an attempt to set the narrative before any leadership contest\". She is, the paper says,\" often considered a potential successor\" to Sir Keir Starmer, with speculation about her ambitions continuing even after she stepped down over a row about her failure to pay stamp duty on a flat.And a YouGov poll is highlighted in the Daily Mirror which suggests around 1.8 million people will spend Christmas Day alone this year. In its leader column, the paper urges its readers to \"check in on someone\". \"Knock on a neighbour's door, phone an old friend,\" it says, \"spare five minutes for the person you have been meaning to visit.\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "12 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinHouse Oversight CommitteeThe House Oversight Committee has released a batch of around 70 photos from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It's the third such release from a tranche of over 95,000 photos the committee has acquired from Epstein's estate. It includes images of quotes from the book Lolita written across a woman's body, and redacted images of women's foreign passports. It comes hours before the 19 December deadline for the Department of Justice to release all files related to its investigation into Epstein. \"These new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession,\" said ranking member of the committee, Robert Garcia.What's in the images releasedSome of the photos released on Thursday show Epstein speaking with professor and activist Noam Chomsky aboard a private plane; Bill Gates standing beside a woman whose face is redacted; Steve Bannon sitting at a desk across from Epstein, and former Alphabet president Sergey Brin at a dinner event. The BBC has attempted to contact each for comment.These are the latest wealthy, powerful men to be seen in Epstein estate photos released by the House Oversight Committee - previously released photos also show US President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, as well as film director Woody Allen, former US treasury secretary Larry Summers, attorney Alan Dershowitz, former prince Andrew Mountbatton-Windsor, and others. Appearing in the photos is not evidence of any wrongdoing, and many of the pictured men have said they were never involved in Epstein's illegal activity. House Oversight CommitteeIn a statement accompanying the photo release, Democrats on the US House Oversight Committee said the Epstein estate did not provide context or timings for the pictures. \"Photos were selected to provide the public with transparency into a representative sample of the photos received from the estate, and to provide insights into Epstein's network and his extremely disturbing activities,\" the statement says.The release also includes several photos of quotes from the Vladimir Nabokov novel Lolita written in black ink across different parts of a woman's body, like her chest, foot, hipbone, and back. Lolita tells the story of a young girl who was groomed by a middle-aged literature professor.One quote from the book written across a woman's chest reads, \"Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth\". House Oversight CommitteeThere are also a number of photos of female passports and identification documents from countries around the world, including Lithuania, Russia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine.  Most of the information on the documents, like names and birth dates, is redacted but the House Oversight Committee said in a press release that the passports belong to \"women whom Jeffrey Epstein and his conspirators were engaging\".Another photo shows Epstein sitting at a desk closely surrounded by three female figures whose faces have been redacted - one has her hand on Epstein's chest under his shirt, and another is crouching to look at a nearby laptop. Epstein appears to be helping the third put on a bracelet. House Oversight CommitteeAnother image released is a screenshot of text messages from an unknown person who says they have been sent \"some girls\" and are asking for \"$1000 per girl\". House Oversight CommitteePhoto release comes ahead of DOJ deadlineThe committee has thousands of images in its possession from the Epstein estate, which are \"both graphic and mundane\", its statement on Thursday explained. The House Oversight Committee first subpoenaed the estate of Epstein, who died in a New York prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on allegations of sex trafficking, in August. The photos and files the Epstein estate gave to the committee are separate from what is largely referred to as \"the Epstein files\". Those are documents within the justice department's possession related to its own investigation into Epstein. Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law last month, the DOJ has until 19 December to release its files. The extent of what's contained in the DOJ's files is unknown, and it's likely that much of the content will be heavily redacted, similar to House Oversight Committee materials. ",

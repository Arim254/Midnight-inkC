    "body": "Allen up against it & more drama in Chicago - NFL play-off predictionsMedia caption, Enter The Top SeedsByPaul HighamBBC Sport JournalistWe are moving a step closer to Super Bowl 60 with four Divisional Round games coming up - and if this bill delivers anything like the drama from Wildcard Weekend, it will be quite the treat.The battle for the Lombardi Trophy is as wide open as it has been in years, and nobody would be surprised by any of the remaining eight sides going on to taste glory in Santa Clara next month.But who will emerge victorious this weekend as the number one seeds enter the fray?We have our panel of experts to try to pick the winners, including Radio 5 Live's Rob Staton, BBC Sport journalist Paul Higham and our special guest, former NFL coach Phil McGeoghan.You can also pick your winners below.Divisional Round ScheduleAll times GMT and AFC/NFC seedings in bracketsSaturday, 17 JanuaryBuffalo Bills (6) @ Denver Broncos (1) - 21:30San Francisco 49ers (6) @ Seattle Seahawks (1) - 01:00 (Sunday)Sunday, 18 JanuaryHouston Texans (5) @ New England Patriots (2) - 20:00Los Angeles Rams (5) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 23:30Buffalo Bills @ Denver BroncosMedia caption, Former NFL coach Phil McGeoghan shows his game-worn Broncos helmet.Rob Staton: BillsI've just got a sense that Josh Allen might will his team to victory again. This is his big opportunity this season so can he take advantage?Phil McGeoghan: BroncosMy wife's from Buffalo and we met when I was coaching for the Buffalo Bills, but I've spent most of my career in Bronco land. So I'm not going to say it out loud. She gets a little fired up, but that's who we're going for in this house (Broncos), but that's only in the basement. So I'm subterranean Phil. I can't wait to see what happens, but I'm going to be doing it well below ground, cheering as quietly as possible for the Denver Broncos.Mike White: BroncosThe way this season has unfolded it seems like the door has been left wide open on the AFC side for Josh Allen and the Bills to finally end their wait not only for a return to the big game but also for their first Lombardi success.However, I'm finding it hard to look past the Broncos, who had the advantage of the bye week, have a dominant defence, know about winning games in comeback mode and aren't banged up the way Buffalo are - especially at the wide receiver position. I'll take Denver to progress but in a close one by three points or less.Paul Higham: BroncosDenver won the last Super Bowl at Levi's Stadium (the venue for Super Bowl 60 next month) a decade ago, which was also their last play-off win - while it's the only stadium in the league Josh Allen has yet to play in, so there's a hint of destiny about both sides.Allen got his first road play-off win last week, Buffalo's first since 1993, but he got beat up in Jacksonville, has a depleted bunch of receivers, and if James Cook again struggles against Denver's rush defence even Superman himself may just have too much to overcome by himself.And ironically it could be the legs of Bo Nix that do more damage, as Buffalo gave up the most yards per carry to opposing quarterbacks this season. It'll be close but Denver went 11-2 in one-score games this season.San Francisco 49ers @ Seattle SeahawksImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sam Darnold and Brock Purdy will renew their rivalry in SeattleRob Staton: SeahawksYou've got to give Kyle Shanahan and his team a tonne of credit for what they've achieved amid an injury crisis, but realistically this might be a game too far.Mike White: SeahawksThis feels like a game too far for the Niners against a highly talented Seattle, who boast a stingy defence whilst San Fran are battered, bruised and without big-name, big-game players such as George Kittle, Nick Bosa and Fred Warner.Sam Darnold has an injury designation going into this but is expected to play. Once upon a time, that would've been a boost for any of Seattle's opponents, but the post-New York Jets Darnold is a different proposition and the one-time former 49ers back-up will lead them to the NFC title game. Seahawks by 10.Phil McGeoghan: NinersVery interesting game. The 49ers are decimated by injuries, but the best predictor of future events is past events. They've found a way to overcome injuries for quite some time so that means culture has now taken over and it's a winning culture. You don't forget how to win.Paul Higham: SeahawksSam Darnold led the league in turnovers and has an injury, so Seattle will hope to win this with their improving ground game, which averaged 140 yards a game over the last eight weeks, against San Francisco's ailing rush defence heading in the opposite direction.The pass rush is another decider - the Niners ranked last in sacks and second-last in quarterback pressures as their pass rush unit is basically all out injured. Seattle, meanwhile, get consistent pressure and dominated two weeks ago having upped their blitz rate.Throw in the famous Seahawks 12s and a flight back across the country for the 49ers from Philadelphia on a short week and there's just too much in the home side's favour.Houston Texans @ New England PatriotsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Can the Houston Texans defence be good enough to win the Super Bowl?Rob Staton: PatriotsThe Texans' defence is legit and can win them any game, but Drake Maye's mobility and playmaking is the perfect counter. Pats get it done.Phil McGeoghan: PatriotsThe Texans have changed games, ruined games, so you must have a protection plan for the Houston Texans. They will ruin your weekend. In my mind, though, just looking at the way Drake Maye is playing at this particular point and the way that they're just kind of moving, I think it's the Patriots, right?I am from Boston. So I think if I go home and I don't say the Patriots, I might be in the 'harbour' or something. So I will say I think it's going to be the Patriots.Mike White: PatriotsThis is likely to be a tight affair with very few points in the game. The Patriots offence matching up against that forceful Texans defence feels like the match-up to keep an eye on. And with CJ Stroud set to be without his best receiving option in Nico Collins (concussion), Houston's chances just reduced considerably.Mike Vrabel's already a strong coach of the season candidate, and returning the Patriots back to their once-familiar surroundings of the AFC Championship game will only enhance those credentials. Pats take it by six.Paul Higham: TexansHouston's first road play-off win last week was a statement win for this terrifying defence, but the Pats have won a league-leading eight straight Divisional games.Drake Maye's mobility can slow Houston down but I just can't see him doing enough to keep them off his case enough throughout the game. As long as CJ Stroud cleans things up and doesn't have another five fumbles, I'm backing the Texans to make their first AFC Championship game.Los Angeles Rams @ Chicago BearsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Matthew Stafford is the only quarterback still in the play-offs to have been to the Super BowlRob Staton: BearsThere's just a bit of magic about the Bears at the moment and the Rams have not played their best football in weeks. Soldier Field will be rocking and I think Chicago make it to the NFC Championship.Mike White: RamsThe Chicago Bears' renaissance has been nothing short of remarkable and Ben Johnson deserves a tonne of credit for it. As does Caleb Williams who's defied a lot of the (justified) rookie season critics in his second year.That said, this is a Rams team that many have been crowning as the champions-elect for weeks and not without good reason. Whether it's offensive guru Sean McVay, the experience and MVP qualities of Matthew Stafford or the magic hands of Puka Nacua, they have all the ingredients for another Super Bowl run. The predicted Arctic conditions might be somewhat of a leveller but still taking the Rams by four.Phil McGeoghan: Rams I am such a fan of Sean McVay. His mind, the way it works, his gameplans, also his humour. His willingness to be open. All these things matter in football.Because of his personality and how he is with the players, he admires his guys. He doesn't pretend Davante Adams isn't one of the best to ever do it. He doesn't pretend he's not in awe of Matthew Stafford when he makes one of his no-look throws. That stuff really builds culture.That's why they've won Super Bowls, that's why people don't leave there unless they get promoted and get better jobs, because McVay is such a good man and he's a brilliant, brilliant offensive mind so I'm picking Sean McVay and the Rams for those reasons.Paul Higham: BearsOnly four quarterbacks have thrown for 140-plus yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter of a play-off win in the past 20 years - and two of them collide at Soldier Field.So this genuinely could be decided by whether Matthew Stafford or Caleb Williams, who have combined for 29 fourth-quarter touchdowns this season, has the ball last after both earned thrilling late wins last week.Williams has been doing it all season though, and watching last week even when they were well behind it seemed inevitable the Bears would come roaring back to win. It just gives you a funny feeling that they've got something special rolling in the Windy City.Select your winners from the four Divisional Round games below...",

Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "4 hours agoTinshui YeungAnadolu via Getty ImagesMayor Yamanaka has been accused by officials of workplace harassmentThe mayor of Yokohama has apologised for insulting colleagues after an official publicly accused him of making offensive remarks.At a news conference, the Japanese city's human resource chief, Jun Kubota, alleged that Mayor Takeharu Yamanaka had used terms such as \"idiot\" and \"human scum\" to disparage staff.It is highly unusual in Japan for a serving city official to openly accuse a sitting mayor and demand an apology.Yamanaka initially denied the allegations, but later admitted to some of them. \"I want to frankly apologise for placing a psychological burden on the personnel director,\" he said.At a news conference on Thursday, Kubota accused Mayor Yamanaka of repeatedly making remarks towards officials - including himself - that could amount to workplace harassment.The mayor was accused of calling officials \"useless\", \"silly\" and \"low-spec\", as well as making comments about colleagues' appearance and likening them to animals.He is also accused of threatening Kubota, saying he would have to \"commit seppuku\" - a Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment - if he failed to secure an international conference bid.Kubota demanded an apology from Yamanaka and called for an investigation.Yamanaka initially published a statement on his personal website, denying the allegations.But on Friday, he publicly acknowledged some remarks - such as using words like \"idiot\" and \"human scum\" - and apologised.\"I am reflecting on this. I will be more careful with my words and behaviour,\" Yamanaka said.He said those comments were made during discussions over personnel evaluations.However, the mayor denied other accusations, including insulting colleagues' appearance.Yamanaka said an investigation was being considered under the supervision of the deputy mayor, adding that he would co-operate \"sincerely\" if an investigation takes place.In response, Kubota insisted Yamanaka had made the comments he has not admitted to, saying: \"The mayor doesn't understand anything. I cannot accept that as an apology. I want him to change.\"More from the BBC",

    "body": "Fourteen people have been arrested and four people taken to hospital after a protest outside the Iranian embassy in London.One protester climbed across balconies to reach a terrace at the embassy and remove a flag before being detained on Friday night, police said.A further 13 were arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault of an emergency worker, criminal damage and trespass on diplomatic premises.Demonstrations have been taking place outside the embassy after widespread anti-government protests in Iran, where more than 2,600 protesters have been killed, according to a US-based human rights group.The Metropolitan Police said missiles had been thrown at police during the protest. It added that four officers had sustained minor injuries but none are believed to have been taken to hospital. The man who removed the flag was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, trespass on diplomatic property and assaulting police, the Met said. He remains in custody. The force added that a group of protesters had attempted to prevent his lawful arrest and dispersal tactics were used by officers \"to ensure the safety of those concerned and prevent further disorder\".A section 35 dispersal order had been imposed outside the embassy \"as a result of ongoing disorder\", the force added.A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said it was called at 20:45 GMT \"to reports of an incident at the junction of Exhibition Road and Kensington Road\".Four people were taken to hospital while two others were treated at the scene, it added.Earlier this week, the Iranian ambassador in London was summoned to the Foreign Office after the killings of protesters in Iran. Last Saturday, two people were arrested at a protest outside the embassy where a protester also climbed onto the building's balcony and appeared to tear down the Iranian flag. ",

    "body": "12 hours agoPhilippa Roxby and Jim ReedHealth reportersGetty ImagesTaking paracetamol while pregnant is safe and there's no evidence it raises the risk of autism, ADHD and developmental issues in children, say experts behind a major new review.Pregnant women \"should feel reassured\" by the findings, they say, which contradict controversial claims from US President Donald Trump last year that paracetamol \"is no good\" and pregnant women should \"fight like hell\" not to take it.His views were criticised at the time by medical organisations worldwide. Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety.But US health officials maintain that \"many experts\" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy.The US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol - known as acetaminophen in the US - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy.Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research.Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Women's Health, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't.The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review \"gold-standard\".The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link.\"When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism,\" lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC.\"The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,\" she added.This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller.Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says.\"This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever,\" said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London.Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant. This can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth or developmental problems in babies.Medical experts not involved in the research have welcomed the study's findings, saying it will help reduce worry among women.Prof Grainne McAlonnan, from King's College London, said expectant mothers \"do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far reaching effects on their child's health\".\"I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close,\" she said.Prof Ian Douglas, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the review was \"well-conducted\" because it excluded studies of lower quality, where no account was taken of important differences between mothers who use or don't use paracetamol during pregnancy, such as underlying illnesses.According to Prof Jan Haavik, molecular neuroscientist and clinical psychiatrist at the University of Bergen, the study provides \"strong evidence\" that use of paracetamol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability and \"should effectively put this question to rest\".It is widely believed by scientists working in this field that autism is the result of a complex mix of factors, including genetic and environmental ones.Getty ImagesIn a speech in September 2025, President Trump said his administration was linking paracetamol (or acetaminophen) to autism and urging pregnant women to largely avoid the pain relieverA spokesman from the US Department of Health and Human Services said \"many experts\" had expressed concern over the use of acetaminophen - the US name for paracetamol - during pregnancy.For example, a review in August 2025 led by Dr Andrew Baccarelli, dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found that using acetaminophen during pregnancy may increase children's autism and ADHD risk, and urged caution over \"especially heavy or prolonged use\".Months earlier, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr had pledged to find out the cause of a steep rise in reported autism cases.In a controversial speech in the Oval Office in September, the US president said doctors would be advised not to prescribe the pain reliever to pregnant women. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a letter to clinicians urging them to be cautious about the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, while also saying it was still the only drug approved for treating fevers during pregnancy.On its website, the FDA says \"a causal relationship\" between the drug and neurological conditions \"has not been established\". Health officials in the UK have stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women.",

    "body": "4 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorReutersShoppers on Oxford Street during the Boxing Day salesA new year, a new beginning.The latest monthly figures on the economy hardly confirm a change of gear, but nor do they back up the worst doom-mongers claiming decline and recession. It is neither doom nor boom, but a new year makes an opportunity to wipe the slate clean on policy, on a sense of certainty, and perhaps above all, the vibes in the economy.There is one chart that might explain quite a lot about both the state of and the prospects for the UK economy. And it might say a fair bit about the political direction of the UK too.It is consumer confidence. These are the long-running surveys that essentially put the nation on the economic psychiatric couch.  How do you feel about the economy's prospects? Are you likely to buy a major piece of equipment? How are your personal finances?There is a solid data source of consistently asked questions going back five decades - it is the measure now called the GfK Consumer Confidence Barometer.I've been reporting on this metric for half of its existence. It's an imperfect science but the basic idea to reach the net confidence number is the optimism score minus the pessimism score.The patterns then were interesting and consistent. And it was important as a predictor for those in power to stay in power. \"It's the Economy Stupid\", remember.But has something significant changed in the water? This chart is quite extraordinary and a version of it has been circulated at the top of government.A quick narration is in order.This chart breaks down the headline net confidence number by age cohort.Broadly speaking they used to move together, they were \"correlated\". Younger people have a generally sunnier starting point but that dims as they age - not a great surprise - and all age groups react to events similarly. Over the past decade you can see correlated declines in consumer confidence across all age groups in reaction to the post-Brexit vote era and the impact of the pandemic. An interesting takeaway is how devastating the Liz Truss mini-budget in 2022 was for all age groups. A loss of confidence in the 45-day government and in economic prospects.And up until 2024 all those lines move in tandem.But what happens in late 2024? Divergence. Big time.The under-50s' consumer confidence goes higher, and soars for the under-30s to highs not seen since Brexit. But take a look at the bottom two red lines. Over-50s' and over-60s' consumer confidence collapses toward Truss-era levels.How can it be that the over 50s, and pensioners in particular, are living through another collapse in economic confidence, and yet the young adult population is much more positive?Well the dotted line is the 2024 General Election. And while correlation does not mean causation, that is when this age-related break occurs.Votes affecting vibesA possible explanation from political economy is this - the flow of causality from economic sentiment to political sentiment has reversed.Where how you felt about your finances influenced how you voted, now how you voted influences how you feel about your finances and the economic outlook for the country.Young people broadly on the liberal left are now happier after enduring a rolling series of crises so far this decade, and with a government they largely voted for in 2024.The older, who voted Conservative and Reform predominantly, are unhappy and unconvinced. They think the country has gone to the dogs even more than usual.One possible factor is the tone set by social media and the emotive doom-scrolling and rage magnets embodied in their algorithms. Is this demographic seeing the Mad Max-style dystopia presented on their social media feeds and responding with this negative outlook?There is also some evidence in the US of respondents to one consumer sentiment survey exhibiting a political tint on their sense of economic confidence. In the transition between the Donald Trump and Joe Biden administrations at the end of 2020, Democrats respondents' economic confidence surged from 67 to 96, while Republicans' crashed from 100 to 59. The Biden administration then bemoaned what staffers called the \"Vibecession\" - the subsequent sense of economic malaise not really reflected in good economic numbers.Rates a double-edged swordThere are other economic factors at play. This rebound in confidence for the young coincides with when the Bank of England started cutting interest rates. Rate cuts are good for young home seekers and jobseekers, but bad for older savers.There are significant economic consequences if this picture is correct too. It might help explain the curiously high and nearly double-digit UK savings rate. That looks like a pandemic-style aberration. Older Britain is sat on its savings, despondent about the country and the economy, refusing to spend its money and weighing down GDP, even as pay rises for workers remain higher on average than the rate of inflation.The takeaways from this chart are also well-reflected in the early financial results we are getting from businesses.Many retail results have defied the gloom. Some bosses that complain the most about National Insurance rises seem to be reporting healthy sales and profits having basically paid for the tax. Pub chain Mitchells & Butlers \"traded very strongly across the festive season with like-for-like growth of 7.7%\". Fullers had an \"outstanding five-week Christmas and New Year season across all parts of the estate\", 8% up on an already strong festive period last year.Obviously challenges remain in the level of price rises. But inflation is on its way down to the 2% target, with a conscious attempt from government to limit regulated price rises for rail and water.More rate cuts will come slowly, and the impact of previous cuts will also filter into the household sector.A mortgage price war may be on its way to help a housing market rebound after months of Budget uncertainty. The government will hope to draw a line under a tumultuous 2025, with what they hope is an investment boom typified by recent announcements on Heathrow and on a new northern train line.So there's a platform to defy the doom. But could people's now politically charged perceptions of economic confidence be a brake on all that?",

    "body": "13 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesThe Trump administration has named US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former UK prime minister Sir Tony Blair as two of the founding members of its \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner will also sit on the \"founding executive board\", the White House said in a statement on Friday.Trump will act as chairman of the board, which forms part of his 20-point plan to end the war between Israel and Hamas.It is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza and manage its reconstruction.Also on the founding executive board are Marc Rowan, the head of a private equity firm, World Bank chief Ajay Banga and a US national security adviser, Robert Gabriel.Each member would have a portfolio \"critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success\", the White House statement said.Trump had said on Thursday that the board had been formed, calling it the \"Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place\".Further members of the board would be named in the coming weeks, the White House said.Sir Tony was UK prime minister from 1997 to 2007 and took the UK into the Iraq War in 2003. After leaving office, he served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers (the US, EU, Russia and the UN). In this role, he focused on bringing economic development to Palestine and creating the conditions to move towards a two state-solution.Sir Tony had already been a part of high-level talks about Gaza's future with the US and other parties. In August, he joined a White House meeting with Trump to discuss plans for the territory, which Witkoff described as \"very comprehensive\".In September, Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC that involving Sir Tony in such talks, given his record on the Iraq War, would \"raise some eyebrows\".But Streeting also noted the former prime minister's role in brokering the 1998 Good Friday Agreement to end Northern Ireland's Troubles.\"If he can bring those considerable skills there, in both diplomacy and state craft,\" Streeting told the BBC, \"that can only be a good thing\".BBC/Monika GhoshFormer UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair is a founding member of Trump's \"Board of Peace\"It comes after the announcement of a separate 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), charged with managing the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza.Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control, will head that new committee.The statement also said that Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, would be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza working with the NCAG.Trump's plan says an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will also be deployed to Gaza to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces and the White House statement said that US Major General Jasper Jeffers would head this force to \"establish security, preserve peace, and establish a durable terror-free environment\".The White House said that a separate \"Gaza executive board\" was being formed that would help support governance and includes some of the same names as the founding executive board as well as further appointees.The US peace plan came into force in October and has since entered its second phase, but there remains a lack of clarity about the future of Gaza and the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there.Getty ImagesBulgarian politician Nickolay Mladenov will represent the board \"on-the-ground\" in Gaza, the White House saysUnder phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Earlier this week Witkoff said phase two would see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.\"The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations,\" he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"However the ceasefire is fragile, with both sides accusing each other of repeated violations.Almost 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, while the Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian groups during the same period.Humanitarian conditions in the territory remain dire, according to the UN, which has stressed the need for the unrestricted flow of critical supplies.The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNick Eardley,Political correspondentandOttilie MitchellConservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has insisted Britain is not broken after her former minister Robert Jenrick criticised the party for failing to campaign on that line.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, she said: \"Ours is still one of the most successful, resilient and influential countries on Earth,\" adding that telling voters their \"country is finished\" only \"drags them down\".She also insisted that the Conservatives were stronger after Jenrick was sacked, ahead of his defection to Reform.In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Friday, Jenrick said a shadow cabinet meeting where colleagues failed to agree that the country was broken had been the final straw for him.In her editorial, Badenoch said there were problems in the UK, some of which were getting worse, but that the country's best days lay ahead.She insisted the Conservatives were best placed to offer solutions to the country's problems, saying that Reform were destined to fail as they welcomed \"toxic people\" who \"destroy organisations\".\"A movement built on grievance and serial disloyalty is doomed to fail, and they will be at each other's throats soon enough,\" the opposition leader wrote.In a separate editorial in the Daily Express, Badenoch said \"some things in Britain are broken, but they are not broken beyond repair\".She also criticised politicians who \"talk Britain down instead of showing they have a plan to build it back up\". Speaking to BBC Newsnight on Friday, Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice praised Jenrick as \"the only cabinet minister who resigned on a matter of principle from the Conservative government\". This was in reference to Jenrick's decision to resign from Rishi Sunak's government, saying it was not going far enough to find a solution to fast-rising immigration levels.Tice continued: \"That makes him uniquely qualified to actually to explain where things went so badly wrong on both legal and illegal immigration, which is to the fury of tens of millions of British people.\"Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Saturday, Tice added: \"Robert has tremendous experience and we've been criticised for not having the experience to be able to govern and manage things - and now we bring in someone with that experience and we're still being criticised.\"Badenoch said that Jenrick's defection \"was never about principle, it was about ambition\" and \"every criticism he now makes occurred when he was in government\".The Conservative party are now a \"stronger and more united team\", she wrote.

    "body": "6 hours agoClaire KeenanReuters / Getty Images / EPAAjay Banga, Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff are among those on the committeeThe White House has released the names of the members who will form the Trump administration's new \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza. With the US president as chair, the founding Executive Board will oversee the work of a committee of technocrats tasked with the temporary governance of Gaza - and its reconstruction.Each member of the executive board is expected to be in charge of a portfolio that will be \"critical to Gaza's stabilisation\", the White House added. But it is not yet clear who will be responsible for which priorities. No women and no Palestinians have been announced at this top level, but the White House said additional members will be announced over the coming weeks.So, who is on the founding Executive Board?Sir Tony Blair BBC/Monika GhoshFormer UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair had long been talked about as a potential member of Trump's \"Board of Peace\", with the US president confirming back in September that he had expressed an interest in joining the body.The former Labour Party leader was the UK prime minister from 1997 to 2007 and took the country into the Iraq War in 2003, a decision which means some may view his presence on the board as controversial. After leaving office, he served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers - the United Nations, European Union, US and Russia - from 2007 to 2015. Sir Tony is the only founding member of the executive board who is not a US citizen.He previously described Trump's plans for Gaza as the \"best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering\". Marco RubioGetty ImagesAs US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio is central to the Trump administration's approach to foreign policy. Before Trump's return to office, Rubio had spoken out against a ceasefire in Gaza, saying that he wanted Israel \"to destroy every element of Hamas they can get their hands on\". But he has since praised the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal signed in October as the \"best\" and \"only\" plan. Also in October, Rubio criticised a move by the Israeli parliament towards annexation of the occupied West Bank.Steve WitkoffReutersUS Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, a real estate magnate and golf partner to Trump, will also be on the board.Earlier this month, Witkoff announced the start of phase two of Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, adding that it would see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza - including the disarmament of Hamas.He added that he expects Hamas to \"comply fully with its obligations\" under the deal, or face \"serious consequences\". Witkoff has been a central figure in US-led efforts to negotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, including holding a five-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in December.Jared KushnerEPAJared Kushner, the US president's son-in-law, has also played a key role in the Trump administration's foreign policy negotiations. Alongside Witkoff, Kushner has often worked as a US mediator for the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza wars.In November, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss key sticking points in the peace deal.At a talk at Harvard University in 2024, Kushner said \"Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable... if people would focus on building up livelihoods.\"Marc RowanGetty ImagesBillionaire Marc Rowan is the CEO of Apollo Global Management, a large private equity firm headquartered in New York. Rowan was seen as a contender to become US treasury secretary for Trump's second term.Ajay BangaGetty ImagesAjay Banga, president of the World Bank, has advised a number of senior US politicians, including President Barack Obama, during his lengthy career. Born in India in 1959, Banga became a US citizen in 2007, and later served as the CEO of Mastercard for more than a decade.Former US President Joe Biden nominated him to lead the World Bank in 2023. Robert GabrielRobert Gabriel, a US national security adviser, will be the final member of the \"founding executive board\".  Gabriel has worked with Trump since his 2016 presidential campaign, shortly after which, according to PBS, he became a special assistant to Stephen Miller, another of Trump's key current advisers.Nickolay MladenovGetty ImagesThe White House statement also said that Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, would be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza. He will oversee a separate 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), charged with managing the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza.The NCAG will be led by Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control.",

    "body": "Is fibre the new protein? The surprising health benefits of the latest wellness trend12 hours agoRuth Clegg,Health and wellbeing reporter andGrace DeanNatalia Gdovskaia/Getty ImagesFibre has been trending on social media, with creators sharing recipes with ingredients like chickpeas, avocado and nutsLast year, many of us went protein-mad in the hopes of boosting our strength and fitness. But over the past few months, fibre has become the hot topic on social media - with only 4% of us getting the recommended daily amount.Videos of people sprinkling chia seeds on top of porridge and nutritionists lauding the benefits of red kidney beans and chickpeas are filling up people's TikTok feeds.The NHS recommends adults eat 30g of fibre a day but most people in the UK aren't eating even close to that, with the average daily consumption at around 16.4g a day, and women eating less than men.Many nutritionists say the buzz over fibre isn't a bad thing. According to dietitian Kate Hilton, fibre has long been viewed as an \"unsexy nutrient\" due to its associations with digestion and flatulence, in contrast with protein's longstanding link to fitness and exercise.\"When I first saw all the posts on fibre, I was pretty thrilled,\" says nutritionist Kristen Stavridis. \"It feels like the messages around gut health are finally getting through to people.\"As well as benefitting your gut, eating more fibrous food - like brown rice and jacket potatoes - has other benefits too.\"People who have a higher fibre intake will live longer, have less cardiovascular disease, fewer cancers and are at a lower risk of conditions like diabetes,\" says Kevin Whelan, professor of Dietetics at King's College London. He adds that some studies suggest it can help our mental health, too.Yeshe Sander, 24, from Birmingham, says upping the fibre in her diet to 30g a day has helped her feel \"so much better\" physically and mentally.She grew up with parents who tried to get her to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and have a fibre-rich diet but, as she entered her mid-teens, she decided to rebel.\"I wanted nothing to do with healthy food,\" Yeshe says. \"As a teenager, I would eat huge amounts of chocolate, doughnuts, cookies.\"At college, her favourite quick meals included instant noodles with white toast or frozen pizza.\"It was only when I got a bit older, in my early 20s, that I thought maybe they were onto something,\" Yeshe says of her parents.After feeling sluggish, low and lacking motivation, she re-examined her diet and started to eat more healthily again. After increasing her fibre intake, Yeshe noticed the difference.Yeshe SanderYeshe and her porridge, topped with chia seeds, ground flaxseed, plant milk, apple, kiwi, pumpkin seeds, cinnamon, walnuts, peanut butter and some honey\"Now I can see it so clearly: when I'm eating more fibre, my mental health gets better,\" Yeshe says, \"and my anxiety and low mood is reduced.\"Breakfast is her favourite meal and she recommends eating porridge with a variety of toppings as a way to get some fibre in the morning.What is fibre and why is it so important for our diet?Dietary fibre is a chain of sugar molecules produced by plants that cannot be digested by humans. It is found in fruits, vegetables, grains, beans and nuts.The effects of fibre were first discovered in the 1970s, when it was believed that fibre was just \"hard roughage stuff\" that helped our bodies get rid of waste, explains Whelan. \"Now we know it's so much more than that - it has health benefits way beyond the bowel.\"Fermentable fibres in foods like oats and legumes help the good bacteria in our large intestine grow, enriching our gut microbiome.Insoluble fibres, found in wholegrain bread, bran and the skins of fruit and vegetables, help our poo travel through the gut.Viscous fibres, found in oats, seeds and some fruits and vegetables, slow down the speed sugar is absorbed and reduce sugar spikes in the bloodstream.All these different types of fibre, among others, help keep us healthy, Whelan says.Getty ImagesFibre is found in fruits, vegetables, grains, beans and nutsWhen speaking about the health benefits of fibre consumption, Whelan points to numerous large-scale epidemiological studies, which record a large group of people's eating habits alongside which diseases they go on to develop.While these studies don't always take into account other factors – like demographics, environment, awareness of diet – he says there are also clinical trials that suggest fibre has health benefits for many parts of the body.Some studies also suggest a high-fibre diet can help improve mental health, says Whelan. A healthy microbiome, fed with prebiotic fibre that boosts health bacteria in the gut, can potentially reduce anxiety and depression risk.\"There is a two-way communication between our brain and our gut, the gut-brain axis,\" he says. Clinical trials suggest certain fibres – prebiotic fibres that feed the microbiome – can help improve mood.One surprising finding from Whelan's research was that fibre helped improve cognition in people over 60.'My skin's better, I've got more energy'Vicky Owens says boosting her fibre intake after a health scare last year has had huge benefits.As a business owner with little time to devote to cooking, her diet mainly consisted of takeaways and ready meals.Vicky EvansVicky says her new diet has helped her skin and energy levelsThen the 25-year-old started experiencing unexplained symptoms including panic attacks, gastric issues and swollen, itchy eyes, which, she says, baffled her doctor.She began to re-evaluate her lifestyle and after an acupuncturist suggested she shake up her diet, it dawned on Vicky she was eating next to no fibre.She began to cut out ultra-processed foods, instead opting for fresh fruit and vegetables, whole wheat pastas and oats.Eventually, she started to see huge benefits.\"My skin's better, I've got more energy,\" Vicky says, \"and I think as a whole everything's so much more balanced now.\"How to add more fibre to your dietSmall switches are a great way to add more fibre to your meals, says dietitian Hilton. Here are some ideas how to do that:Replace white bread with seeded wholegrain breadSwap snacks like crisps and chocolate for almonds, kiwis and popcornAdd seeds, nuts, fruit or almond butter to your porridge or yogurtChange white rice for brown or wholegrain rice, or go half and halfAdd avocado, hummus or salad to your sandwichIf you like to start your day with cereal, go for something like wheat biscuits, bran flakes or bran sticksSome typical fibre-rich foods Here's a sample meal plan from Stavridis on how you can hit 30g fibre in a day (note that fibre quantities vary by brand and portion size):Breakfast: Two slices of thick seeded wholemeal toast (7g fibre), with a sliced banana (1.5g fibre) and honeyLunch: Baked potato (5g fibre), 100g of baked beans (4g fibre), cheese, tuna, side salad of mixed leaves, followed by one kiwi (2g fibre)Snack: One serving (20g) of popcorn (2g fibre)Dinner: Beef mince bolognese with kidney beans (5g) and whole wheat spaghetti (6.5g)People in the UK eat a lot of convenience and ultra-processed foods, which don't typically contain much fibre, says Hilton.\"The carbohydrates that we consume tend to not be things like whole grains and we have a lot more of a reliance on things like meats to get our proteins, rather than beans or vegetarian sources,\" she adds.Stavridis points out that the recent fixation on protein may have affected some people's fibre intake too, as some people prioritised it at the cost of other nutrients.Though protein is important for our health, she says people should stop \"obsessing over protein and start tracking fibre\" and ensure they're getting a healthy diet overall.While eating more fibre is a good thing for most people, for some with conditions like Crohn's disease and diverticulitis, it is often not recommended and medical advice should be sought before any dietary changes.Too much too fast can also cause problems, explains Cara Wheatley-McGrain from the Mindful Gut, a wellbeing company which supports people to change their diets.\"Increase slowly - if we suddenly make a dramatic change, our gut goes 'hang on a minute', and we can end up with bloating and constipation.\"And make sure to drink plenty of water, she recommends.While Wheatley-McGrain is \"really happy\" fibre is finally being taken seriously on socials, she does not want to add additional pressure on young people who are constantly met with a barrage of different diets and eating regimes.\"We need to navigate that to make the best choices for ourselves,\" she says. \"Add some fibre to your diet slowly, notice how it feels and take it from there.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "Justice Secretary David Lammy has blocked the transfer to an open prison of a killer accused of releasing rap music about murdering 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen.Jake Fahri was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 14 years in 2009 for killing the teenager by throwing an oven dish at him in south London. The dish shattered, severing blood vessels in his neck.Fahri was released on licence in 2023 but recalled by the Ministry of Justice last January after the Sun published a story alleging he was making drill music -including about the murder - as balaclava-clad artist Ten.The Parole Board said earlier this month he should be moved to an open prison, but that has now been opposed by Lammy.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said Deputy Prime Minister Lammy's intervention was for \"public protection\".The Parole Board said In its decision summary earlier this month Fahri had given evidence disputing his music was \"about his own life\" but noted that since his recall he had accepted he was the artist Ten.It said his failure to disclose the music to his probation officer had been a breach of his licence, but Fahri, 36, claimed to have been unaware of the restrictions - something the panel found to be untrue.The board had rejected the possibility of re-releasing Fahri, instead recommending his move to an open prison. It added that Farhi \"needed to reflect\" on \"why he failed to be open and honest with the professionals managing his case\" but this \"could be achieved\" in an open prison.Lammy's blocking of this move has been welcomed by Mizen's mother Margaret, who told the Sun she had been \"shocked\" by the Parole Board's initial recommendation.\"I would much prefer this decision didn't have to be made because he would have turned his life around. I'm really sad that he hasn't,\" she said.But the reversal shows Farhi had \"not changed his attitude\", she added.\"He got into the witness box at his trial and lied through his teeth,\" she told the newspaper. \"Clearly, he hasn't changed, and I'm glad the justice secretary has seen through it.\"When he was sentenced for the May 2008 murder, Farhi had been given a minimum 14-year prison term - the point at which release can be considered, usually with conditions attached.Two songs by Ten were played on BBC 1Xtra, The BBC said it had been unaware of his background at the time of broadcast.

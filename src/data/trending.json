Donald Trump says the lack of evidence in this batch absolves him of any guilt, while survivors and Democrats say there are still unanswered questions and unseen documents. \nJustin, Sarah, Marianna and Anthony discuss where this leaves the president and his MAGA base.  Also, what does it mean for Epstein's victims, particularly as many victims’ names have been published by the US DoJ for the first time without permission.  \nWe also answer your questions on celebrities calling out the actions of ICE agents in Minneapolis at the Grammys as Trump threatens to sue its host Trevor Noah. Plus, why quilters on social media might have more to do with those ongoing protests than meets the eye.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray and Grace Reeve.

Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was long seen as the most influential and feared figure in the country after his father, who ruled Libya from 1969 until being ousted and killed during an uprising in 2011.Born in 1972, he played a key role in Libya's rapprochement with the West from 2000 until the collapse of the Gaddafi regime.After his father's removal, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi - who was accused of playing a key role in the brutal repression of anti-government protests - was jailed by a rival militia in the city of Zintan for almost six years.The International Criminal Court wanted to put him on trial for crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the suppression of opposition protests in 2011.This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

    "body": "9 hours agoPAAnya Taylor-Joy and her husband were staying in a London mansion at the time of the break inAn armed robber who tried to prise open the bedroom door of Hollywood actress Anya Taylor-Joy while she was staying at a London mansion has been jailed.Kirk Holdrick, 43, was one of two masked men who smashed their way into the luxury property, in what may have been a targeted raid, Wood Green Crown Court heard.In November, Holdrick was jailed for 12 years for a robbery in Dorset where a mother and daughter were tied up and threatened with violence. He was handed a further three-year custodial sentence after admitting burglary of the London home.Holdrick, from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, was described in court as a career criminal with convictions dating back to his teenage years.Taylor-Joy and her husband, Malcolm McRae, were staying at the London property on 12 February 2023 when they heard the glass of a side window being smashed.McRae confronted the intruders before barricading himself and his wife inside a bedroom, which they then tried to prise into. Armed only with a lamp, he managed to scare off the men by bluffing that he had a gun, causing them to flee the scene empty-handed.Prosecutors suggested that because the burglars did not simply steal expensive items and implied they had intended to target the celebrities personally.The couple told police they had been traumatised by the ordeal and feared being targeted again.The Golden Globe winner known for The Queen's Gambit, the Dune films and Peaky Blinders, appeared on the Baftas red carpet just a week after the ordeal.Holdrick was arrested on 18 April 2023 after stepping off a ferry from Belfast to Liverpool. He claimed he had been to the property previously as a guest at a party and suggested that was how his DNA had been left behind. He later abandoned this defence and pleaded guilty to burglary in mid-December last year.PA MediaHoldrick, from Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, was described at Wood Green Crown Court as a career criminalNine days after the break-in at the London mansion, Holdrick took part in a robbery in which a mother and daughter were held at gunpoint, tied up and threatened with violence.Holdrick and his accomplice, Ashley Fulton, disguised themselves as police officers during the break-in at a property in Sandbanks, overlooking Poole Harbour, Dorset where they targeted the home of wealthy businessman Mark Aitchison.Aitchison's wife, Kerry, was told she would be killed if she did not open the family safe. When their daughter Emily arrived home unexpectedly, she was also restrained and threatened.The intruders told her they would shoot her in front of her mother and demanded to know where the iron was, saying: \"We want to burn you.\"The pair escaped with £200,000 worth of luxury watches, designer handbags, jewellery and cash, but left a trail of DNA behind. Police traced the getaway car and recovered vapes from the vehicle.Holdrick, who previously briefly dated one of the cast members from The Only Way Is Essex, was jailed for life in 2005 for armed robberies on a security van.He was recalled to prison to continue serving his life sentence after his latest offences.In November, he was jailed for 12 years for the Sandbanks robbery and a further four years on licence if he is released, after pleading guilty at Bournemouth Crown Court to two counts of robbery, possession of an imitation firearm and fraud.Related to this storyRelated internet links",

The images appear to show Andrew kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground, while other files repeatedly reference him and his former wife, Sarah Ferguson. Being mentioned in the documents is not an indication of any wrongdoing.Prince Edward made the comments at the World Governments Summit in Dubai after being asked by a CNN journalist how he was \"coping\" with the fallout from the files.The duke replied: \"Well, with the best will in the world, I'm not sure this is the audience that is the least bit interested in that.\"They all came here to listen to education, solving the future, but no, I think it's all really important, always, to remember the victims and who are the victims in all this.\"US Department of JusticeAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor in an image from the documents relating to EpsteinAndrew, formerly known as Prince Andrew and the Duke of York, was stripped of his royal titles in October after increasing scrutiny over his links to Epstein.He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.Emails released on Friday showed a number of exchanges between Epstein and Andrew in the years after the US billionaire pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor.The files also show there have been multiple unsuccessful approaches from US authorities for Andrew to help with Epstein inquiries.Calls are now growing for Andrew to give evidence of what he knows about Epstein in the US.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been amongst those calling for him to testify, and told reporters over the weekend that \"anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information\".\"You can't be victim-centred if you're not prepared to do that,\" he said. \"Epstein's victims have to be the first priority.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoBrian Wheeler,political reporterandAlex Partridge,political reporter Getty ImagesPeter Mandelson surprised everyone in 2008 when he arrived in Downing StreetPeter Mandelson's skills as a political operator were so highly prized by successive Labour prime ministers that they were apparently prepared to overlook past scandals to hand him a series of senior roles.Yet the release of emails by the US Department of Justice appear to show Mandelson himself was receiving advice on political strategy from US financier and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Crucially, Lord Mandelson appears to have kept Epstein informed of developments in the immediate aftermath of the 2010 general election, as Gordon Brown made a doomed attempt to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats.On 9 May, Lord Mandelson appears to tell Epstein: \"GB now having 'secret' talks with [Lib Dem leader Nick] Clegg in Foreign Office\".And then, at 09.07am on Monday 10 May, he appears to tell Epstein: \"Finally got him to go today\".Brown's resignation as Labour leader, it was later claimed, was the price demanded by Clegg to begin coalition talks with Labour.In the end, these talks went nowhere and Clegg formed a coalition government with David Cameron's Conservatives.Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment about these email exchanges, which appear to give an almost minute-by-minute account of the five days of coalition wrangling, which gripped the nation after there was no clear general election winner.On 8 May, two days after the election, while talks were taking place between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, an email appears to show Lord Mandelson telling Epstein he'd spent \"all day first with [Gordon Brown] then with Libs. They are all pretty bonkers…\"Epstein suggests \"stressing\" in negotiations that the Liberal Democrat plus Labour vote is \"15m v 10 million votes\".Later the same day, the financier suggests \"why not let tories govern with minority, no coalition\" suggesting they won't be able to get \"anything done\". It seems that Lord Mandelson, whose name and email address are redacted for most but not all of the messages, replies \"cos GB thinks British economy will collapse without [him] at helm\".Epstein also passed on advice from someone referred to as \"jess\" that \"supporting gb will be seen as bad form commercially, he has lost the confidence of the public\".He added that \"jpm\" [investment bank JP Morgan] is \"very concerned that the pound could be the next currency to falter. and big time. uncertainty is not in your favor\".At the time Greece was seeking a bailout from the EU amid its debt crisis.Lord Mandelson appears to reply \"agree but method and timing is all\" saying he's \"getting messages both from people saying to take GB out and keep him there to do deal with Libs. Ideally [should] do both. But cannot see how\".On 11 May, with negotiations still ongoing, Epstein tells Lord Mandelson \"a mere opposition party, is not in your interest\" to which Lord Mandelson seems to reply \"Not sure in my interest to father a mutual suicide pact\".Epstein then suggests making \"a real offer you can live with…if clegg won't agree, it would be on his shoulders\" and if he does \"youve bought time\".Hours later Epstein receives an email saying \"It's over. I am out of govt at the end of the day…\"Later the same day, as Lord Mandelson appears to say he is attending a \"farewell\" event for Gordon Brown, Epstein offers a \"big hug\".The email exchanges are peppered with gossipy and sometimes indiscreet comments.On 6 May 2010, as UK voters went to the polls, Epstein asks his friend how it was going, to which Mandelson apparently replies \"we are praying for a hung parliament. Alternatively, a well hung young man\".'Third time lucky'Brown's decision to bring Lord Mandelson back into government, in October 2008, stunned Westminster.The pair had once been inseparable as they worked with Tony Blair to create New Labour.But Brown had never forgiven Lord Mandelson for what he saw as his betrayal in backing Blair for the party leadership in 1994.Explaining his decision to bring his bitter rival back into the fold as business secretary and a member of the House of Lords, Brown said: \"Serious people are needed for serious times.\"The appointment was seen as a daring gamble by Brown, whose government was floundering in the face of the biggest economic crisis in a generation.Lord Mandelson was a divisive figure who had twice been forced to resign from Tony Blair's government.Brown hoped that his old foe's political nous and experience as an EU trade commissioner would add much-needed heft to his government's handling of the global economic crisis.\"We are bringing together the best team possible to deal with the difficulties [that we face],\" Brown told reporters. Lord Mandelson acknowledged that the pair had had their \"ups and downs\" but said they were now \"joined at the hip\".As he bowled up Downing Street to start his new job, he joked to astonished reporters that it was \"third time lucky\".PA MediaGordon Brown turned to his old rival in his hour of needIn June 2009, Lord Mandelson's status was enhanced further when Brown gave him the honorary title first secretary of state, making him the de-facto deputy prime minister.In that same month, the DoJ emails suggest Lord Mandelson forwarded an internal memo on selling off government-held assets in order to raise public funds to Epstein.The Cabinet Office has referred material to the police after an initial review \"found that they contain likely market sensitive information surrounding the 2008 financial crash and official activities thereafter to stabilise the economy\".Part of Lord Mandelson's mystique - and one of the reasons he is despised by some in the Labour movement - is his love of political intrigue, gossip and plots.And this appears to be on full display in his alleged exchanges with Epstein.In early 2010, he appears to be discussing removing Brown as Labour leader or running for leader himself.On 6 February, he tells Epstein: \"If I continue as now people will say I am one of the few (only) big figures. And I have to deliver a reasonable campaign that only he [expletive]'s up. And that I perform well in the campaign itself. That I was bigger than the lot of them.\"Epstein allegedly replies: \"lets not dwell on him, i am only interested in how this plays out for you.\"Lord Mandelson allegedly says: \"Perhaps but either way - direct or not - he cannot take the truth. He needs 5 years of therapy...\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoBranwen JeffreysEducation EditorBranwen Jeffreys / BBCUniversity of Sussex vice-chancellor Prof Sasha Roseneil (left) appeared outside the High Court with university colleagues The University of Sussex has started its High Court legal challenge against a record £585,000 fine for failing to uphold freedom of speech. It claims the higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), acted beyond its legal powers to impose the fine, and put too much weight on a trans and non-binary equality policy in place at the time. The university had been caught up in controversy after Dr Kathleen Stock, a former academic at the university, resigned from her post as a professor following protests against her views on sex and gender issues. The Office for Students will defend its \"careful and detailed\" investigation of the university in front of a judge this week.When it handed down the fine, the OfS said its investigation had found the university's policy had a \"chilling effect\" on free speech, which may have led staff and students to censor themselves on campus.As the regulator for all higher education providers in England, the outcome of the challenge against the OfS will have far-reaching implications for its ability to enforce freedom of speech and academic freedom at universities.Opening the case for the university, Chris Buttler KC said Sussex had a proud tradition of fostering free speech. He said the fine had \"severe\" consequences for the university's reputation as a \"bastion of free speech\".When Stock resigned in October 2021, after students protested against her view that biological sex is more important than gender identity, it appeared to mark the end of a high-profile row. Now, decisions made by the regulator in a subsequent investigation, which lasted three-and-a-half years and led up to the fine, will be under scrutiny in the High Court.Much of the legal argument centres around the university's former trans and non-binary equality policy.The university has argued this two-page policy was not a \"governing document\", so the regulator had no right to rule on it. Court submissions by the lawyers for Sussex also claim there was potential bias in the investigation into the university, because of a pre-existing friendship between Dr Arif Ahmed, director for freedom of speech at the OfS, and Stock. The university claims that before he took up the post, Ahmed had written publicly in support of Stock's views, and sent emails of warm encouragement privately. Stock was the only witness interviewed during the investigation, the university claimed. Getty ImagesThe OfS fined the University of Sussex for failing to uphold free speech on campusSussex said its requests for meetings were turned down, and that testimony was not gathered from students or the students' union. The OfS is scheduled to begin its defence on Tuesday, and is expected to say its role in safeguarding the \"fundamental values\" of freedom of speech and academic freedom is at the heart of the case.While the trans and non-binary policy went through several versions, the regulator is expected to argue the university failed to follow its own procedures for how it adopted what it describes as \"governing documents\".The OfS has said in its submissions to court that it offered Sussex a chance to meet to discuss a settlement as early as October 2022, provided the university accepted it had breached regulations.It also refutes any suggestion of bias, saying Ahmed had a \"limited professional acquaintance\" with Stock.The OfS rejects claims that it has singled out the University of Sussex for punishment.The hearings are due to last three days before Mrs Justice Lieven, with a judgment likely to be delivered at a later date.",

    "body": "2 hours agoIan AikmanUS Navy via ReutersThe drone was \"aggressively\" approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln, a spokesman said (file photo) An Iranian drone was shot down as it \"aggressively approached\" an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday, a US military spokesman has said.An F-35C stealth fighter jet which took off from the USS Abraham Lincoln warship shot down the drone \"in self-defence\" to protect the aircraft carrier and its personnel, US Central Command spokesman Capt Tim Hawkins said.The ship was approximately 500 miles from the Iranian coast when the drone approached it with \"unclear intent\".No US equipment was damaged and no service members were harmed.It comes as the US continues to build up a military presence in the region, with tensions high between Washington and Tehran.US President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action against Iran if it does not negotiate an agreement to restrict its nuclear programme. Speaking after the downing of the Iranian drone, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that negotiations between the US and Iran are still scheduled for later this week.She said Trump \"remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first\", but added he \"has always a range of options on the table, and that includes the use of military force\".Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously warned that any attack on the country would spark a \"regional war\".Tehran has not commented on Tuesday's drone incident. In a separate incident on Tuesday, the US military said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) forces had \"harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel\" in the Strait of Hormuz - the world's busiest oil shipping channel.Military support \"de-escalated\" the situation and the tanker proceeded safely, Capt Hawkins said.Also on Tuesday, Leavitt said US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, will attend the talks on behalf of the White House.US media had previously reported he would meet Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Istanbul on Friday, with the foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also invited.But US news website Axios has since cited two sources as saying Tehran wanted the venue moved to Oman, with only Iranian and US officials present.Ahead of the planned talks, Washington has repeatedly reminded Tehran of the US strikes on Iran last year, which Trump said had \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear enrichment facilities.He said a fresh attack would be \"far worse\" than those air strikes, which were launched last June during Israel's 12-day war with Iran.The Israeli military also targeted Iran's nuclear facilities and scientists during a short direct conflict, as well as its military commanders and missile arsenal.Tehran responded to the strikes by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. It also carried out a missile attack on a major US air base in Qatar.Iran has insisted its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Last week, Trump told reporters at the White House that Iranian officials \"do want to make a deal\", and that they must commit to \"no nuclear\" and to \"stop killing protesters\". The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,424 protesters, 152 children, 214 people associated with the government, and 58 bystanders. It is also investigating reports of another 11,280 deaths.Norway-based Iran Human Rights has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities have acknowledged that at least 3,117 people were killed, but said the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by \"rioters\".The unrest was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living, but it quickly developed into demands for political change.Khamenei described the unrest as \"sedition\" orchestrated by the US and Israel.",

    "body": "5 hours agoSean Coughlan,Royal correspondentandLauren Turner,Culture reporterGetty ImagesSarah Ferguson's image was once about her good-humoured ability to bounce back from misfortunes and embarrassment, but the latest Epstein emails appear to cast her in a different light.She comes across as a needy figure, chasing money and support, more desperate than duchess - apparently describing herself to Epstein as \"very traumatised and alone\", and seeming to suggest she could be employed to \"organise your houses\".But there are also glimpses of a life of privilege, as the same email mentions she's in the south of France with the \"perfect butler\".The BBC has contacted Ferguson for comment on the latest release. Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.The messages between Ferguson and Epstein almost seem like he's talking about someone on his payroll, such as asking her to show business contacts round Buckingham Palace - and her daughters get included too.In a message to \"Ferg\" in March 2010, Epstein writes: \"Thank you Sarah, could you are (sic) one of your daughters show (redacted) buckingham thanks.\"An apparent reply from \"Sarah\" reads: \"Of course.\"That July, referring to a separate occasion, she apparently writes to Epstein apologising that \"the girls were not around this weekend\". \"Shows I don't crack the whip when I am not in the country!,\" the message continues. \"Actually eugie was in france and beatrice was out with dave.\"Epstein also messages to say a friend will be in London, adding: \"Any chance of your daughters saying hello.\"As more emails emerge, there's a growing impression of how much Ferguson seemed to depend on Epstein, telling him he was her \"pillar\" and confiding \"I have been so so sad\".Some of the emails date from when Epstein was still serving a sentence for soliciting sex from a minor, according to the documents. He was released from prison on 22 July 2009 after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence. There are emails in the files from that June and earlier in the July from \"Sarah\". An email from August the following year reads: \"I am feeling very traumatised and alone. I am wanting to work for you at organising your houses.\" The next month she appears to ask \"when are you going to employ me\", and the same day \"phew.. you still love me\".In another exchange in 2009, she jokes with Epstein about another woman: \"You can marry her too. She is single and a great body.\"Referring to her former husband, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Ferguson writes later in 2010: \"So you have not forgotten about me. I do know that my handsome Prince is a saint.. And you worship him, I do too. \"But then I did marry him. And still love him.\"Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently and strenuously always denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment on the release of the files.There are also messages behind her back between Epstein and his associates: \"Getting financials for fergie is painful. Incredible mess. I'm on it but for sure completeness will always remain questionable.\"She appears to tell Epstein that \"the British press is ready to exterminate me\" and that the Palace is \"not equipped to deal with all of this huge wave of negativity\". \"I am now 1000 percent being hung out to dry, just as I predicted you will see, the Press will have me exiled,\" the email continues. \"I am totally on my own now. This is beyond scandalous and nobody can do anything. I cannot believe what this is all coming to.\"She adds that \"no woman has ever left the Royal Family with her head, and (they) cannot behead me, therefore they will discredit me. Totally to obliteration\". This latest round of Epstein emails, released by the US Department of Justice, could remove her even more from public life.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDan HuntEast MidlandsSuppliedTwo-year-old Xielo Maruziva died after falling into the River Soar in Leicester in February 2024Police have apologised to the mother of a two-year-old boy who died after falling into a river in Leicester.Xielo Maruziva fell into the River Soar from Packhorse bridge on 18 February 2024. His body was found nearly four months later at the Aylestone Meadows nature reserve.Leicester Coroner's Court heard it took an hour to tell Xielo's mum Kayela Smith that her son had fallen into water.Det Insp Kevin Hames, from Leicestershire Police, apologised for the delay and said it \"absolutely\" should have happened sooner.Senior coroner, Prof Catherine Mason - who is overseeing proceedings - said Xielo's father Bradley Maruziva could not explain why Kayela was not told - adding he had been searching \"desperately\" for his son.Hames told the court on Monday that Xielo entered the water at 17:00 GMT and at 17:01, police were called, with the first responding officers at the scene at 17:09.On Tuesday, Hames, the senior investigating officer, told jurors he was not on duty when the police response to Xielo entering the water began, which he said would have been \"chaotic\". The inquest was told the force \"hoped\" to find Xielo on Sunday evening, and agreed with Prof Mason that it should have been a \"priority\" to inform Xielo's mother.'We did our best'The inquest heard more than 26km (16.1 miles) of waterways were scoured, and more than 60,000 hours of searches were completed. Hames told jurors it was the \"largest search that has ever been undertaken by Leicestershire Police\", and \"one of the largest water searches ever undertaken in the United Kingdom\".\"None of us thought it would take 109 days to find Xielo, but we did our best to find him,\" he said. Jurors were told the search for Xielo was \"not constrained\" by budgets, and the force sought help \"far and wide\" to help find him.PA MediaThe inquest heard more than 26km (16.1) miles of waterways were searchedThe inquest was told Hames was informed by another officer, at about 10:00 on 6 June 2024, that council workers may have found a child's body in some debris that had been cleared from Aylestone Meadows. The jury was told council workers had been removing flood debris from the area, which was then placed on to a truck and taken to a site in East Leicester.Hames told the court when the debris was taken to East Leicester, a council worker said he believed he had seen a child's body, and police were called to the scene.Tributes were paid to Xielo at his inquest on MondayOn Monday, the inquest heard Xielo was a \"few baby steps\" ahead of his aunt and great-aunt - Nicole Maruviza and Memory Maruviza - on Packhorse bridge, when they went for a walk in Aylestone Meadows. Jurors were told on Tuesday by Hames that he was not able to confirm a distance between the aunts and Xielo at the moment he fell into the water due to the \"limitations\" of the CCTV from where the camera is situated.He added from CCTV, he was able to say \"with some certainty\" the time between Xielo entering the water and Nicole reaching the same point was between \"five to six seconds\". When asked by Prof Mason whether he would describe the distance between Nicole and Xielo as being a \"significant\" distance, he said: \"On the balance of probabilities, yes ma'am.\"The inquest has heard that the area is a designated flood plain, but did not have signage warning walkers that the water level might be high at the time Xielo entered the water.After Xielo fell into the water, Leicester City Council - which does not own the bridge but does manage the wider Aylestone Meadows site - put up signage warning of the risk of flooding, and erected fencing at Packhorse bridge, jurors were told.The inquest continues.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "7 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterGetty ImagesChappell Roan described her look - shown before she removed her cape - as \"so awesome and weird\"Chappell Roan has laughed off the reaction to the revealing outfit she wore on the Grammy Awards red carpet on Sunday.The US pop star removed her red chiffon cape on the red carpet to reveal a matching draped dress hung from nipple rings, leaving virtually all of her top half exposed.The Mugler ensemble was one of the most talked-about outfits at this year's ceremony.\"Giggling because I don't even think this is THAT outrageous of an outfit,\" the star posted on Instagram. \"The look's actually so awesome and weird. I recommend just exercising your free will it's really fun and silly :D.\"ReutersShe added: \"Thank you for having me @grammys and those who voted for me!!\" Some fans praised Roan's style, describing her as \"a goddess\" and \"an icon\" in response to her own Insta post.Referencing Justin Bieber's performance on Sunday wearing just boxer shorts, one wrote: \"If Justin can perform in his underwear without anyone batting an eyelid, you can rock pierced pasties diva. Misogyny.\"Nipple pasties are prosthetic nipple covers, which provide both protection and coverage.Others found her outfit was not to their taste, however.Responding to Billboard's video of Roan on the red carpet, one post read: \"I love her but this is too much. Is she gonna get banned?\", while another responded: \"I don't know what people have against wearing clothes.\"Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, fashion writer and stylist Alex Fullerton said: \"What this label (Mugler) has done consistently since the 80s has worked a lot with transparency, bare breasts, so she's honouring the legacy of the designer.\"But at the end of the day... she's got them out!\"Watch: The best looks of the 2026 Grammy AwardsMore on the Grammys 2026Roan was nominated for two Grammys on Sunday - record of the year and best pop solo performance, both for The Subway, but she came away empty-handed.Known for her individual style and hits including Pink Pony Club, Hot to Go and Good Luck, Babe!,  Chappell is actually the alter-ego of the more reticent Kayleigh Amstutz.\"I couldn't be Chappell all the time,\" she admitted. \"I'd be absolutely exhausted.\"Getty ImagesCharli XCX wore a sheer black dress at the Brits last yearHer latest outfit continues the trend of celebrities wearing sheer and revealing looks on red carpets and at award ceremonies.Charli XCX wore a see-through black dress at last year's Brit Awards, and addressed the controversy over her outfit during one of her speeches on the night. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples. I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\" she said.Kanye West's wife, Bianca Censori, arrived at last year's Grammys wearing a sheer body stocking that left little to the imagination.",

Minchella</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><strong>Super League Grand Final: Hull KR v Wigan</strong></p><p>Saturday, 11 October</p><p>Listen to the Super League Grand Final on BBC Radio 5 Live on Saturday, 11 October with build up throughout from 12:00 BST, and watch highlights on BBC Two on Sunday, 12 October at 13:00 BST</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Hull-KR-have-to-get-job-done\"><span>Hull KR 'have to get job done'</span></h2><p></p><div><p>It is a story that has been told time and again over the past couple of years, if for no other reason than to highlight just how much of an achievement it is for Hull KR to be tussling at the top.</p><p>Just nine years ago, they lost their Super League spot in agonising fashion having initially led Salford Red Devils in the 2016 Million Pound Game before losing on golden point and dropping into the Championship as a result.</p><p>Less than a decade later, they look set to complete one of the most impressive comebacks in sport, let alone rugby league, has ever seen and talismanic half-back Mikey Lewis summed it up best in his pre-match media commitments.</p><p>\"We've built something at the club so we've got to believe each other and get this job done,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.</p><p>\"That's something that will fuel us on Saturday.\"</p><p>Their record this season makes for remarkable reading having won the Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield - not bad for a club which finished bottom of the pile in Super League just five years ago.</p><p>What makes this all the more impressive is the fact that Hull KR have been so undeterred by Wigan's quadruple last season that they've now threatened to win a treble themselves.</p><p>\"When I first came to the club we were in a relegation battle and there wasn't much in it, either,\" forward Dean Hadley, who joined in 2019, added.</p><p>\"To say five or six years on you've played in back-to-back Grand Finals, you've won a Challenge Cup and League Leaders, it's a totally different place.</p><p>\"It's been a process, it's taken time. It's year on year making improvements. Not just on the field but off the field as well. You can feel it when you're at the club. It's a really good club and environment to be at. Players like myself and others have thrived in that.\"</p></div><div><p>Hull KR set up their place in Saturday's final off the back of beating St Helens in the semi-final and Saturday will see some departures for the east Hull club.</p><p>With the youthful but formidable Lewis, accompanied by the wisdom and stewardship of senior figures like Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and Micky McIlorum, Hull KR have assembled one of the most forbidding sides of the modern era.</p><p>Yet the club, and sport, will wave goodbye to the veteran pair after Saturday's game as they retire.</p><p>For Lewis, Saturday's Grand Final is not just an opportunity to win silverware, write themselves into the record books and tick another box - it is a chance to pay respect to two of the sport's greats in style.</p><p>\"To put them into retirement having won all three trophies in the first year of being at the club would be a massive achievement for them,\" he added.</p><p>\"It's something we'd be really proud of. The leadership and the accountability and the honesty they've brought to this team this year has been massive.</p><p>\"To get the job done for each other, for the east side of Hull, the board, the chairman, Neil, for our families, we all sacrifice so much and to lift that trophy would be huge for everybody.\"</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Highlights: Wigan complete clean sweep with Grand Final victory</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Wigans-chance-to-win-three-in-a-row\"><span>Wigan's chance to win three in a row</span></h2><p></p><div><p>For Wigan Warriors, they can regain some glory having missed out on silverware so far in 2025, not least because of how impressive Saturday's opponents have been.</p><p>The Cherry and Whites have their own record to chase. Having reached a 14th Grand Final, they are 80 minutes away from winning three in a row for the first time in their history.</p><p>In Luke Thompson, they have the perfect man to guide them to glory at Old Trafford, with the front rower never losing in a Grand Final in four appearances - twice with St Helens and twice with Wigan.</p><p>\"I see a lot of similarities. I see a lot of commitment and professionalism. The hunger,\" Thompson told BBC Radio Manchester about the current Wigan set up compared to his time with Saints.</p><p>\"They're slightly different teams. I think we play a bit differently but I think the quality that underpins both teams, you can definitely see some similarities.\"</p><p>One man who could be in the mix for the Cherry and Whites is Brad O'Neill, who has his own motivation to take to the field on Saturday.</p><p>The Wigan hooker missed out last year with a serious knee injury and had conflicting emotions having been unable to play his part in their quadruple glory.</p><p>\"It was definitely a proud moment for myself watching on and seeing the team do something special that year,\" he said.</p><p>\"It was a bittersweet feeling. It would have meant so much last year to play in it but the fact that we've got here now, I'm so grateful, and I definitely won't be taking it for granted come Saturday night.\"</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>'We get to make a lot of people proud, and that's what drives us' - Peet</p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Wigan captain Liam Farrell is no stranger to a Super League Grand Final and knows what it takes to win on the big occasion.</p><p>Whereas some players would be unnerved by the big occasion Farrell, in contrast, thrives off his nerves.</p><p>\"If I played one game for Wigan, never mind the Grand Final, I'd have been very happy. But to be in the position I'm in now, leading my team out for a third year in a row, it's a very special feeling,\" Farrell told BBC Radio Manchester.</p><p>\"I can't really put into words how special it is, but it's one I'm excited about and to create some more memories with the special group we've got.</p><p>\"It calms me down, the fact that I do still get nervous. It makes me realise that I still care about what I do. I want us to win, I don't want to lose.</p><p>\"The club wants success and the town wants success. I think that's where the nerves come from and I like the fact that I do get them.\"</p><p>Farrell, a Wigan veteran, might well be in the twilight of his career at 35 but he still believes he has the fight in him to continue and will not hang up his boots regardless of the result on Saturday.</p><p>\"If you're able to win one and go out like that, it'd be a nice way to go out, but I still think I've got a little bit more to give and the club wanted me to still stay on so I'm very happy about that,\" he added.</p><p>\"I'd say psychologically I'm still enjoying it as well, that's probably the main thing for me, which is a big aspect and I think as long as I'm doing that and happy about what I'm doing then I'll still go around.\"</p></div></article></div>",

    "body": "<p></p><figcaption>Aerial footage shows devastation after blast at explosives manufacturer in Tennessee</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Nineteen people are missing after a blast at a military explosives manufacturing facility in Tennessee on Friday.</p><p>Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said four or five people were taken to a nearby hospital after the enormous explosion that levelled a factory, and that several are deceased.</p><p>\"There's nothing to describe, it's gone,\" he said.</p><p>The plant in Bucksnort, Tennessee - roughly 56 miles (90km) south west of Nashville -  specialises in the development, manufacture, handling and storage of explosives. The cause of the blast remains unclear.</p></div><div><p>Aerial video from the scene showed charred debris, smouldering vehicles and little remaining of the facility, which is owned by Accurate Energetic Systems.</p><p>Sheriff Davis, who was visibly emotional during his first media briefing of the day, declined to say exactly how many people died. </p><p>But he noted that the plant had been up and running when the explosion happened and that secondary blasts forced first responders to keep their distance from the site.</p><p>Workers who had just started their day \"now may be missing or deceased\".</p><p>\"A lot of times, when I have these types of situations, I refer to them more than just a person...we're missing 19 souls,\" Davis said.</p><p>During a second briefing hours later, Davis confirmed that 19 people were still unaccounted for and that the explosion happened in a large building. It flung debris across a half square mile, he added.</p><p>\"This was a massive enough explosion that I can tell you that folks in Waverly felt and heard this explosion,\" he said, referring to a town about 15.5 miles (25km) north west of the facility.</p><p>Davis declined to answer whether he believed the explosion was accidental or intentional, saying that \"we have to make the worst assumption in order to find the truth\".</p><p>Tennessee Governor Bill Lee in a social media post said his office was monitoring the ongoing situation, and referred to it as a \"tragic incident\".  State and local authorities were working with federal agencies to respond to the explosion.</p></div><div><p>Casey Stapp, director of media relations at TriStar Health in nearby Dickson, said two walk-in patients were treated for \"minor injuries\" from the explosion and have been released.</p><p>A third walk-in patient, Stapp said, is still being treated for minor injuries.</p><p>Local news media said patients were also being treated at other hospitals in the area and that residents who lived more than 20 miles away from the site could feel the explosion.</p><p>The factory, which sat on about 1300 acres of land, produced C-4, TNT and other high-grade military and commercial explosives and stored them there. </p><p>Accurate Energetics Systems has now ceased operations, the sheriff said. It is believed that the company employed about 75 people.</p><p>\"They are focusing on their families, their employees,\" Davis said.</p><p>The explosion took place on the border of Hickman and Humphreys Counties and prompted a massive response from local and federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><p>The FBI and ATF secured the scene and declared it stable, Davis said. </p><p>Officers are expected to remain on the scene for several days, with a number of teams trying to figure out what happened, Davis said, promising a \"slow and methodical\" investigation. </p><p>Another blast took place at the same location in 2014. at a unit which was being operated by a company called Rio Ammunition.</p><p>Reports from the time said one man was killed and three were injured in that blast.</p><p>Mixing explosives and filling munitions is a \"high-hazard, low-probability industry\" when properly regulated, Ken Cross, former President of the Institute of Explosives Engineers, told the BBC. </p><p>\"Competent staff are essential, and the majority of organisations provide relevant training and supervision for their explosives worker,\" he added.</p><p>He also noted that, globally, there are reports of explosions in factories most weeks, but those are often in places that make fireworks or \"that might be considered to have less than ideal explosives safety legislation and official oversight in place\".</p></div>",

With only 18 months before the end of Macron's presidency, he also warned that anyone joining his government would have to put on hold their presidential ambitions. </p><p>What makes it even harder for Lecornu is that he will face a vote of confidence in a National Assembly where Macron has no majority to support him. The president's popularity hit a record low this week, according to an Elabe poll that put his approval rating on 14%.</p><p>Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally, which was not invited to Macron's talks with party leaders on Friday, said that Lecornu's reappointment was a \"bad joke\", from a president \"more than ever isolated and disconnected at the Élysée\".</p><p>Bardella said his party would immediately bring a vote of no confidence against a doomed coalition, whose only reason for being was fear of an election. National Rally is currently leading in the polls.</p></div><div><p>Lecornu at least knows the pitfalls ahead as he tries to form a government, because he has already spent two days this week talking to parties that might take part.</p><p>He was first appointed prime minister on 9 September and took the next three weeks to put together a government, only for it to fall apart overnight when the the leader of the conservative Republicans, Bruno Retailleau, criticised one of the ministerial appointments.</p><p>By themselves the centrist parties cannot form a government, and there are splits within the conservative Republicans who have helped prop up Macron's governments since he lost his majority in elections last year. </p><p>Retailleau, who is known to have presidential ambitions, has made clear he will not be part of Lecornu II, and has declared the <i>socle commun</i> (common platform) of centrists and conservatives as dead. Not all his party colleagues agree.</p><p>But it means the centrist prime minister is also looking to left-wing parties for potential support.</p><p>In an attempt to court the left, Macron's team indicated the president was considering a delay to part of his highly contentious pension reforms passed in 2023 which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9ab/live/1f9dcea0-a622-11f0-844a-3d3421526d3c.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images National secretary of French left-wing Greens party Marine Tondelier (L) and President of Ecologiste et Social parliamentary group Cyrielle Chatelain speak to the press after a meeting with the French President at the Elysee Palace,\" /><span>AFP via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Marine Tondelier (L) of the Greens said she saw no reason not to bring a vote of no confidence in a Lecornu government </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>That risks angering key centrist allies, who fought hard to get pension reforms through.

    "body": "5 minutes agoImogen Foulkes,Geneva correspondentandOlivia IrelandReutersPeople in the area have been leaving tributes to the victims of the deadly New Year's Day fireThe Swiss bar that was the scene of a fire that killed 40 people and injured 116 hadn't undergone safety checks for five years, authorities have said.The mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, told a Tuesday press conference that he could not explain why Le Constellation bar hadn't been checked in so long, but that the council was \"profoundly sorry\".  \"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers - which are believed to have caused the fire when they were raised too close to the ceiling - will be banned in local venues. Local authorities will now bring in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. At the news conference, Feraud conceded there was a team of five people inspecting more than 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana and could not explain why the bar had not been inspected since 2019.Taking repeated questions on why the bar had not been checked in so long, Feraud said: \"I have no answer for you today.\"\"We're profoundly sorry about that and I know how hard that will be for the families.\" \"I'm not resigning, no, and I don't want to,\" he later added. Feraud said it would be \"down to the judges\" to decide whether members of the local authority would be included in a criminal investigation that has been opened by Swiss prosecutors.AFP via Getty ImagesCrans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud announced that all kinds of sparklers would be banned from being used in local venuesWhen the fire occurred on New Year's Day, the bar seemed to have many more people in it than legally permitted, which Feraud said was the responsibility of the managers of Le Constellation to regulate.Swiss prosecutors have placed the two bar managers under criminal investigation, which local media have named as French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said.Feraud said the use of sound-proofing material on the ceiling of the bar and allowing sparklers in the venue was extremely negligent. But he also suggested the local authorities hadn't viewed the materials used as risky.Questioned on why authorities had not acted on pictures of sparklers close to the bar's ceiling that were widely available on social media and used as promotion for Le Constellation before the fire, Feraud said it was likely no-one in the council saw the images. Safety regulations are determined by cantons in Switzerland's devolved political system. But they must then must be implemented by the local authorities.Many local councillors are elected to work on a part-time basis. The Swiss are generally proud of this system as they believe it makes the authorities much more accountable to voters.But the new year's fire raises questions about the system, with warnings signs  appearing not to have been followed up.

    "body": "9 minutes agoPaulin Kola'We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,' Trump saysOne of Donald Trump's most influential aides has said Greenland should become part of the US in order to protect Nato and the Arctic.Asked in an interview with CNN to confirm the US would rule out the use of force to annex the semi-autonomous region of fellow Nato member Denmark, Stephen Miller said, \"nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland.\"On Sunday Trump repeated his insistence that the US \"needs\" Greenland - to the consternation of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen who said an attack by the US would spell the end of Nato.Six European allies rallied to Denmark's support with a joint statement on Tuesday.\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" read the statement by the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Denmark.In his interview with CNN, Miller said it was \"the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US\".He went on: \"By what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland? What is their basis of claiming Greenland as a colony of Denmark?\"The top Trump aide also said the US \"is the power of Nato. For the US to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend Nato and Nato interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the US.\"Nato is a trans-Atlantic military group where allies are expected to go to each other's aid in case of external attacks.The issue of Greenland's future resurfaced in the wake of the US military intervention in Venezuela, during which elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York.Following the raid, Trump said the US would \"run\" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time.He also said the US was returning to an 1823 policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere - and he warned a number of countries the US could turn its attention to. In the wake of the Venezuela intervention, Miller's wife Katie posted on social media a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag, alongside the word \"SOON\".It has reignited fears that the US may consider using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic - something the US president has previously refused to rule out. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve American security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark.Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.More on this storyFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "2 hours agoKaty Austin,Transport correspondentandEmer Moreau,Business reporterDrivers over the age of 70 will have to have their vision checked every three years, under plans to reform driving laws in Britain.The changes are part of the government's new road safety strategy, which will be published on Wednesday.Other proposed measures, which were first reported in August, include lowering the drink-driving limit in England to match the limit in Scotland, and giving penalty points for not wearing seatbelts.Nearly one in four car drivers killed in 2024 were aged 70 or older, according to government figures.Edmund King, president of the AA motoring organisation, said: \"Eye tests are free for people over the age of 60 anyway and healthcare professionals advise them every two years given they can help with diagnosis of other underlying conditions.\"In fact, the AA advises everyone to have an eye test every two years.\"Drivers in the UK must be able to read a number plate from 20 metres away, according to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). But currently, drivers of any age are not required to prove their skills or health once they obtain their licence.Drivers must tell the DVLA if they become unfit to drive, but this is a self-reporting system.Lilian Greenwood, local transport minister, said: \"We know driving can be very important for older people's wellbeing and help them to live independently, but we must also make sure everyone is safe on our roads.\"As the country's older population grows, our plans in the first road safety strategy in more than a decade will preserve personal freedoms where possible with action to save lives.\"Last year, an inquest into the deaths of four people killed by drivers with failing vision said enforcement of eyesight standards on the roads was \"ineffective and unsafe\".HM Senior Coroner for Lancashire Dr James Adeley pointed out that the UK was one of only three countries to rely on self-reporting of visual conditions affecting the ability to drive.In the report, which was handed to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, he said: \"Self-reporting of visual conditions permits drivers to lie about their current driving status to those performing an ophthalmic assessment and avoid warnings not to drive.\"Drivers may also admit they drive but then ignore instructions not to drive and fail to notify the DVLA.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondentNvidia has unveiled a new tech platform for self-driving cars as the world's leading chip-maker seeks more physical products to embed AI into.Speaking at the annual CES technology conference in Las Vegas, boss Jensen Huan said the system - called Alpamayo - would bring \"reasoning\" to autonomous vehicles.That would allow cars to \"think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,\" Huang claimed.He said Nvidia was working with Mercedes to produce a driverless car powered by the tech, which would be released in the US in the coming months before being rolled out in Europe and Asia.Nvidia's chips have helped power the AI revolution, though so far attention has mostly been focussed on the software it powers, such as ChatGPT.However, leading tech firms are now increasingly looking for hardware - meaning physical products such as cars - that AI could be used in.Wearing his trademark black leather jacket, Huang told an audience of hundreds that the project has taught Nvidia \"an enormous amount\" about how to help partners build robotic systems. \"The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is almost here,\" Huang said.\"NVIDIA's pivot toward AI at scale and AI systems as differentiators will help keep it way ahead of rivals,\" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, from Las Vegas.\"Alpamayo represents a profound shift for NVIDIA, moving from being primarily a compute to a platform provider for physical AI ecosystems.\"Shares of the AI chip designer rose slightly in after-hours trading following Huang's presentation.It featured a video demonstration of the AI-powered Mercedes-Benz driving through San Francisco while a passenger, sat behind the steering wheel, kept their hands in their lap.\"It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,\" Huang said, \"but in every single scenario... it tells you what it's going to do, and it reasons about what it's about to do.\"Alpamayo is an open-source AI model, with the underlying code now available on machine learning platform Hugging Face, where autonomous vehicle researchers can access it for free and retrain the model, Huang said. \"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" he told the audience.The project could pose a threat to companies like Elon Musk's Tesla, which offers driver assistance software called Autopilot.\"Well that's just exactly what Tesla is doing,\" Musk posted on social media following the Alpamayo announcement. \"What they will find is that it's easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.\"Like Tesla, Nvidia also has plans to launch a robotaxi service by next year in collaboration with a partner, but has declined to name the partner or say where it will be.Nvidia is the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of more than $4.5tn (£3.3tn). It became the first company to reach $5tn in October, but has lost value over concerns about whether demand AI is overhyped.The company also revealed that its Rubin AI chips are currently being manufactured and are due for release later this year.The highly-anticipated hardware can compute using less energy than Nvidia's current line of AI chips, and could drive down the cost of developing the technology.",

A \"full madness pass\" covering all three days of the festival will cost 12,500 baht ($400; £300) while a single-day pass is going at 5,100 baht.More details on the festival's theme and line-up will follow soon, organisers said. Although the Tomorrowland group has held events in some Asian cities, this is the first time it will be holding an entire festival in the continent, and one that is similar to the scale of what it does in Belgium.  Thailand finalised an agreement with Tomorrowland to host the event for five years and expects it to generate 21bn baht ($673m; £497m) over the period, Thai media reported.\"Expanding Tomorrowland to a new continent is a milestone we approach with great respect and excitement... This is the beginning of a long-term story,\" said Tomorrowland's chief executive officer Bruno Vanwelsenaers.In recent years, Thailand has become a strong contender in the live music scene. Last year, it played host to international music festivals like Electric Daisy Carnival and Creamfields. Bangkok was also a stop on K-pop band Blackpink's world tour last October. And the country's homegrown music and arts festival Wonderfruit is emerging as a hot destination on the festival circuit, drawing tens of thousands of people each year.",

    "body": "6 hours agoPhil Mackie,Midlands correspondent,Shehnaz Khan,West MidlandsandRachael Lewis,in BirminghamEPAPiles of rubbish were seen in the city not long after the strike began last yearIt's exactly a year since bin workers in Birmingham staged their first walkout and according to unions there is no end in sight.Union members started a series of one-day strikes on 6 January 2025, with an all-out strike launched on 11 March. It led to piles of uncollected waste in the streets and Health Secretary Wes Streeting saying he was concerned for public health.Birmingham City Council said it would be going ahead with a new waste collection regime in the summer, even if industrial action continued.Unite said there would be no end to the strikes until there was a fair deal for Birmingham's bin workers.Connie Marshall and other residents in Castle Vale sympathise with the bin workers but want the strike to endThe council has ensured household waste collections are still made. But there have been no recycling collections since February. People have had to either hoard it, dispose of it with their household rubbish or make trips to the tip. In Castle Vale, one of the biggest housing estates in Birmingham, there is little if any uncollected rubbish, with the authority managing to empty out the wheelie bins over the holiday period.The Pioneer Group, landlord to more than half of Castle Vale's residents, also has its team ensuring everything is kept clean and tidy.Residents Connie Marshall and Marie Notarantonio were union members who went on strike in the 1970s, so sympathise with bin workers, but still want the strike to end.\"I just don't understand it, you know for so long and... [it] hasn't come to an agreement,\" Marshall said.\"I think council and union reps need their heads banging together,\" Notarantonio added.Can Birmingham's bin strikes be resolved?Giant rats and a stenchWhy are Birmingham's bin workers on strike? The intermittent walk-out began over plans to downgrade some job roles, which Unite said would result in up to 170 workers facing an £8,000-a-year pay cut.But the dispute escalated and an indefinite all-out strike began on 11 March, with picketers delaying crews from leaving waste depots to collect rubbish, before a High Court injunction was granted.Certain areas of the city have seen pavements fly-tipped with black bin bags - this picture was taken on 30 December in SaltleyIn Small Heath, an inner-city area blighted by piles of uncollected waste on street corners throughout the strike, residents said sometimes bins could go uncollected for six or seven weeks.Shafaq Hussain is frustrated that there's still no end in sight.\"They're not mediating, walking away, not being transparent to the community and nobody actually knows what's the deadlock,\" he said.With many businesses along Coventry Road, even after rubbish is collected, waste soon starts piling up again.\"We're paying the council tax, everything, but they never pick [up] the bins,\" said Riaz Hussian, from Riaz Sweets.Hockley resident Stephen Message said the fly-tipping, pictured on park land near New Spring Street North on 30 Dec, was horrible. The rubbish is still thereAmid the ongoing bin strike, parts of the city have also seen \"environmental criminals\" littering pavements and parks with unwanted items.Hockley resident Stephen Message was in parkland near New Spring Street North where a pile of discarded household rubbish, including Christmas wrapping paper and other items such as pushchairs, have been dumped near a waste bin. The mess has been there for more than a week. The park is close to the Soho Loop section of Birmingham's Mainline Canal and some dumped other items in the park, including a mattress, have been there for weeks, despite residents reporting them to the council.\"People are taking advantage of the fact that there's a waste bin and they're just dumping rubbish whenever they want,\" he said.\"Who in their right mind is going to want to sit on this bench and have a view of the canal with this here?\"I just think it's horrible, it just shows they [fly-tippers] have no consideration for the community.\"The city council said 1,753 tonnes of waste was collected at kerbside on 29 December and that it was \"identifying the root cause of the fly-tipping problem to tackle the issue\".There were now 275 union members taking industrial action as opposed to 370 at the beginning of 2025, which it said was \"mainly due to VR.\"Waste collections had improved in recent months, although recycling has been suspended since industrial action began.\"During this industrial action and despite the initial disruption, we've continued to deliver a collection of residual [waste] for all households across the city and productivity has actually increased by nearly a quarter,\" said councillor Majid Mahmood. \"The reports of missed collections have decreased by more than 50%.\"Mahmood told the BBC the council would also be recruiting staff for a new food waste collection service set to be rolled out from June, alongside the previous recycling service.\"June of this year, whether or not industrial action continues, we will be rolling out a recycling service back again across the city and introducing a food recycling service,\" he said.\"If industrial action continues then we will be recruiting new staff to operate the new service which is the food recycling,\" he added.Councillor Majid Mahmood said the authority will start recruiting for new food waste collection teamsMahmood, cabinet member for environment and transport, called for Unite to come back with a \"constructive suggestion\" that the council could work to to bring staff back into work.\"We've been negotiating with Unite now for twelve months and we've made multiple offers, fair and reasonable offers to Unite, all of which have been rejected,\" he said.Mahmood added that workers involved in the original dispute had accepted alternative employment with the same pay and same grade or had taken the offer of voluntary redundancy.Birmingham City Council says it is identifying the root cause of fly-tipping in places like HockleyTalks to end the dispute broke down in July, with Unite stating there would be \"no end\" to strike action until there was a \"fair deal\" for bin workers.In a statement, Unite said: \"Our members resolve remains rock solid in the face of the council's attempt to scapegoat and punish them for the mess politicians have made in Birmingham.\"There will be no end to the strikes, until there's a fair deal for Birmingham's bin workers.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Parents say babies failed by delayed diagnosis like Jesy Nelson's twins6 hours agoLeigh BoobyerBBC WalesCharlie BrownDani-Rae Brown could not move her legs at five months old, when her first symptoms of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) started to showParents of babies born with a life-limiting, rare condition say their diagnoses came months too late, and after they had initially raised the alarm about their symptoms.Dani-Rae Brown was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) seven months after her first symptom and now has to use a wheelchair, while Lucian Neale was diagnosed at six weeks old despite showing symptoms in his mother's womb.SMA is a progressive muscle-wasting disease that can cause death within two years if untreated.Their parents' comments come days after former Little Mix star Jesy Nelson revealed the twins she gave birth to prematurely last May have SMA, and will \"probably never walk\".The Welsh government said it follows advice from the UK National Screening Committee, which does not currently recommend routine newborn screening to detect SMA.\"We are working to improve diagnosis of rare conditions and will consider any future recommendations from the committee\", it said.'I was completely ignored' over baby's rare spinal conditionCurrently, the NHS offers a blood spot test when a baby is five days old for nine rare but serious conditions.SMA UK, a charity which supports people affected by the condition, is calling on the NHS to include SMA on the list - as screening is only carried out on those who have a sibling with the condition.Charlie BrownCharlie Brown said he believes Dani might be walking if she had been screened at birth and treatedDani's father Charlie Brown, from Blackwood in Caerphilly, said she started displaying symptoms at five months old, but was diagnosed at 12 months.\"People weren't paying attention enough,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\"She was failed by the NHS because of how long it took to diagnose her.\"It went from Dani's legs not moving, to pretty much from the neck down she couldn't move anything,\" he said, adding that she was treated quite late.\"Had she been screened at birth and treated, potentially she could have been walking, running, playing and being your typical child.\"Mr Brown said Dani now relied on a wheelchair, was \"completely weak\" and at-risk of illnesses constantly as muscle wasting got worse.He added: \"No-one would ever choose this life. I don't think anyone would want to put this life onto anyone. You wouldn't put it onto your worst enemy.\"What is Spinal Muscular Atrophy?According to the NHS, SMA is a rare genetic condition that can cause muscle weakness.There are four types of SMA based on the age that symptoms begin and how they affect sitting, standing and walking.Most types of SMA are caused by an altered gene being passed on to a child by their parents.A blood test can be used to confirm an SMA diagnosis, and there is currently no cure for the condition. Former Little Mix star Jesy Nelson said her twins have been diagnosed with SMAOn Sunday, Nelson said in an Instagram video her twin girls - Ocean Jade and Story Monroe Nelson-Foster - have the condition.She described it as the \"most severe muscular disease\".\"It does affect every muscle in the body, down to legs, arms, breathing, swallowing,\" she said.In the video, Nelson said her daughters had not been showing as much movement in their legs as they should be, and were struggling to feed properly.Samantha WilliamsSamantha Williams said she was told she was an \"over-protective mum\" when raising concernsSamantha Williams, from Crumlin near Pontypool, said Lucian was diagnosed with SMA when he was six weeks old after showing symptoms in her womb.\"I was completely ignored. I started going to the GP from four weeks old. By five [weeks old] he had stopped moving everything,\" she said.\"I was told I was an over-protective mum which is really frustrating.\"Lucian is now two years old, and Williams said he was \"doing really well\" but \"would be even better if they'd listened to me\".Samantha WilliamsWilliams said Lucian's symptoms were first appearing in her wombIn 2018, the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) reviewed screening for SMA and decided against adding it the list because, at the time, treatments and robust evidence on cost-effectiveness were limited.In February 2025 the UK NSC approved an \"in-service evaluation\" - a pilot screening programme - to gather UK-specific data. But a rollout has been delayed, despite positive progress, because the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) cannot find researchers until a range of health partners formally agree to deliver a pilot. This is a prerequisite for initiating the trial programme.Among the agencies is NHS England which said it currently supported further evaluation, adding it was \"determined to make one-shot treatments as quick as possible for all children and their families\".\"The NHS Generation Study is also evaluating whether genomic sequencing could be adopted more widely as part of standard newborn screening in the NHS, including testing for SMA,\" a spokesperson added.'Timing is everything'Giles Lomax, chief executive of charity SMA UK, said: \"Without early diagnosis and treatment, babies with the most severe forms of SMA can experience rapid and irreversible muscle weakness, leading to serious disability and, in some cases, life-threatening complications.\"Today, we have effective treatments for SMA. But timing is everything. The evidence is clear: babies who are diagnosed and treated before symptoms appear have significantly better health outcomes.\"Many can meet developmental milestones that would not have been possible without early intervention. Once symptoms begin, damage to motor neurons cannot be undone.\"A Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We follow advice from the UK National Screening Committee, which does not currently recommend routine newborn screening to detect SMA.\"The in-service evaluation in Scotland will help inform a recommendation from the UK NSC as to whether screening for SMA should be included as part of the newborn blood spot screening programmes across the UK.\"According to SMA UK, an estimated 47 babies were born with the condition in the UK in 2024, although about one in 40 people carry the altered gene that can cause the disease.More top storiesRelated Internet Links",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaulin KolaEPARussia has intensified attacks - particularly against Ukraine's energy sectorFrench President Emmanuel Macron is hosting Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky and other key allies of the country as efforts intensify to agree security guarantees for Kyiv in the event of a ceasefire with Russia.Heads of state and top officials from more than 30 countries - part of the so-called Coalition of the Willing - are taking part, including US mediators in peace talks Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law. Zelensky met Trump recently and said his plan to end the war with Russia was 90% agreed.However, the proposals have yet to be presented to Russia, whose response so far has been far from encouraging.The outstanding 10% of the agreement that's yet to be decided concerns territorial concessions Kyiv is being asked to agree to.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress on the ground recently and, therefore, is unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas.Russia has also consistently opposed any idea of a temporary ceasefire and has intensified its attacks in Ukraine, particularly aimed at paralysing its power supplies in the middle of a harsh winter.Ukraine has also hit back with drones - the latest target being an oil depot in the Lipetsk region of western Russia. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte are among the participants at the Paris meeting. Leaders are expected to seek agreement on details that include a multi-national force to reassure Ukraine after a peace deal, what security guarantees to offer Ukraine in the event of a renewed Russian attack - as well as helping Ukraine's armed forces and its economy.For months, the so-called \"backstop\" has been on the agenda - the desire among Ukraine's European allies to secure a pledge from the US that it will be involved in responding to Russia should it violate the terms of a peace deal.Following talks between Zelensky and Trump in Florida last month, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered security guarantees for 15 years - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.The talks in Paris are being overshadowed by the aftermath of the US's military action in Venezuela, where elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York.Following the raid, Trump said the US would \"run\" Venezuela for an unspecified period of time.He also said the US was returning to last century's policy of US supremacy in its sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere. Looming larger over the Paris talks is Trump's subsequent insistence that the US wants to annex Greenland - the semi-autonomous territory that is part of Denmark, a Nato ally.The repeated threat prompted Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to say any such move from the US would be the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance. European leaders have been reluctant to criticise Trump's intervention in Venezuela and its perceived implications for the world order.But many, including Starmer and Macron, have sided with Denmark over Greenland.As host of the talks, Macron will be keen not to have the issue derail the focus on Ukraine.",

    "body": "Is AI taking the fun out of fantasy football?2 hours agoJack GrayandYasmin Malik,BBC NewsbeatPA WireAI tools offer \"expert management\" that could help you top your mini-leagueFor years, fantasy football has given every armchair manager the space to back up claims they \"could do a better job\" than the real thing.Whether you're competing against workmates, family members or strangers, the ability to pull together your own dream team is irresistible to millions of football fans.The competitive pastime has spawned a whole industry of content creators offering weekly tips for anyone looking to gain an edge as they sift through stats and manage transfers.Recently, more players have been turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for advice - but not everyone agrees they have a place in the virtual dugout.Ryan JordanContent creator Ryan Jordan posts fantasy football tips and advice to TikTokFantasy Premier League (FPL) is the UK's most popular fantasy league, and claims to have more than 11 million players taking part.Users select squads of 15 footballers, who each earn points based on their weekly on-pitch performance. The catch? A £100m budget, constant price changes, and a strict limit on how many players you're allowed from each side. Content creator Ryan Jordan, who posts fantasy football tips and advice to his 15,000 followers on TikTok, says FPL makes the real-life game \"more engaging to watch\".The Bristol City fan says it encourages him to pay attention to teams he might not usually follow, and makes \"every match really matter\".  \"So even a team lower in the table that you might not want to watch on TV each week, you'll watch it because you've a player from their team in your FPL team,\" he says.\"It brings the community together to watch a lot more.\"Fantasy Football HubFantasy Football Hub gives players advice, including possible transfersRyan tells BBC Newsbeat he uses Fantasy Football Hub, an app which offers AI tools, including one that rates a manager's squad. He says it gives advice on transfers, predicts how many points a certain player will achieve each week, and when it's best to play or bench them.Fantasy Football Hub's founder Will Thomas told Newsbeat the app has attracted about 793,000 members since it launched in 2019, with about 59,000 of those paying a subscription to access AI features.Of those paid members, he said, about 28,000 signed up in 2025, with about 381,000 joining as free members.Fantasy Football Fix, another popular app, told Newsbeat it had also seen user numbers climb.It now has 690,000 members overall, up from about half a million in 2022.The company believes one of its key features, an AI-powered chatbot the company says is trained on \"FPL-specific\" data, has contributed to the increase.Newsbeat understands the Premier League is set to add features to its official Companion app, which uses Microsoft's Copilot, to help users pick fantasy teams and strategies later in the season. But do AI tools actually do what they claim?Ryan says he mostly finds Fantasy Football Hub reliable. \"A lot of the time, some of the players they put in there are spot-on,\" he says.\"I'm not going to lie, there are some times I see a player and I think: 'What's he doing in there?'\"In groups dedicated to fantasy football on Reddit and other platforms, some users argue that the subscription apps don't provide insights or data which players can't get elsewhere. And one of the biggest complaints is that they remove the elements of gut instinct and luck that keep people hooked on fantasy leagues.Ryan says he understands why some people are against AI use, but he sees it as similar to getting advice from YouTube or podcasts.\"At the end of the day, I think people should play FPL in whatever way they enjoy most,\" he says.\"AI tools don't replace skill, they just support decision-making.\"Villa fan Jake reckons AI should stay on the benchTwo-thirds of FPL players who replied to a survey from Virgin Media O2 published in August said they were planning to use AI this season.However, many respondents told the company it \"takes the fun out of the game\" and others felt it was \"outright cheating\".It's a view that Newsbeat encountered among fans travelling for the Aston Villa v Manchester United match in Birmingham last month.Supporters told us they felt puzzled by others using AI to help them pick their squads.When we spoke to Jake Thomas O'Donnell, a long-time FPL player, in Birmingham city centre, he was also unimpressed.\"I think AI ruins the banter a little bit,\" the Aston Villa fan said.\"People that use AI have no clue what they're doing and automatically become these great people.\"It should be done by the person.\"Other players we spoke to say they weren't too fussed about it - and some didn't even know AI was used by others. 'I don't really see it spoiling the game'Dani GonçalvesDani Gonçalves co-created Aerial Fantasy which follows the Women's Super LeagueDani Gonçalves is a co-creator of Aerial Fantasy, one of several unofficial fantasy games developed for the Women's Super League after England's Lionesses won the 2022 Euros.It opened the 2025-26 season with more than 30,000 users.Dani argues there is little difference between following advice from an AI chatbot and a fantasy football \"expert\", such as a podcaster.\"People have always been trying to game the system and figure out a way to get the edge,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"I don't really see it spoiling the game.\"Dani admits there is a risk that widespread AI use could lead to lots of similar-looking teams as \"everyone's using the same data\".But she says those running fantasy leagues can use incentives to encourage players away from obvious or popular picks.Aerial Fantasy, for example, offers \"visionary points\", or bonuses, boosting rewards for those who choose lesser-picked squad members.Dani says there can also be a benefit for players who do enjoy the old-fashioned method of trawling stats and spreadsheets to optimise their teams.\"Some players really enjoy digging through all the data and finding that gem, and obviously using AI does make that faster,\" she says.\"They're almost more engaged than the person who is rolling the dice and just picking a random person.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this ",

    "body": "11 hours agoJack Fenwick,Political correspondentandChris Mason,Political editorThe leaders of West Midlands Police and Birmingham City Council will be grilled by MPs later over a decision not to allow Israeli football fans to attend a match in the city last year.The decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a match against Aston Villa in November was criticised by the prime minister and other politicians, some of whom suggested it amounted to antisemitism.BBC News has obtained a letter from the Dutch police inspectorate in December, which appears to contradict claims made by West Midlands Police about Maccabi fans' previous behaviour, which were used to justify the ban.West Midlands Police maintains it banned fans because of concerns over the safety of local people.The decision to allow the match to go ahead without Maccabi fans was announced in October, three weeks before the fixture.Aston Villa said the decision had been made by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group, who deemed the match a \"high risk\" because of unrest during previous Maccabi matches.Despite criticism from government and opposition politicians, the match went ahead without any away fans present.Craig Guildford, the chief constable at West Midlands Police, and John Cotton, the leader of Birmingham City Council, will both be questioned by Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee on Tuesday.Guildford has been called back by the committee, after previously giving evidence last month.The row over why away fans were banned has been ongoing since October, when the Safety Advisory Group, which includes the council, the club and police, made the decision because of what they said were safety concerns.West Midlands Police have repeatedly mentioned the unrest surrounding a Maccabi match in Amsterdam in November 2024, as part of the justification for the ban.During meetings of the safety group in October, they claimed that 500-600 Maccabi fans had targeted Muslim communities the night before the Amsterdam fixture, saying there had been \"serious assaults including throwing random members of the public\" into a river.They also claimed that 5,000 officers were needed to deal with the unrest in Amsterdam, after previously saying that the figure was 1,200.In November, a representative for the police force in Amsterdam said they did not recognise the claims.Last month, West Midlands Police hit back when a senior officer suggested that Dutch police had only questioned the claims because of political pressure.But a body that oversees the Dutch police has now backed up the Amsterdam officers' account of what happened.In a letter seen by BBC News, the Dutch Inspector General, Liesbeth Huijzer, said \"we do not see any new facts or circumstances that would warrant revising these findings\".Conservative MP Nick Timothy, who asked the Dutch Inspector General to intervene, said they had \"confirmed what we have long suspected\".He added: \"The facts on the ground in Amsterdam do not remotely resemble what West Midlands Police has claimed.\"Leaked minutes from the safety group, first reported by the Sunday Times and seen by BBC News, also reveal that the police said it would favour a ban despite an \"absence of intelligence\".A summary of a closed doors meeting on 7 October said that the police's preference had been determined based on what one officer described as \"conversations with piers [sic] and my professional judgment\".Those present, including representatives from the council, police, fire service and Aston Villa, were reminded that it was a \"confidential discussion\" and \"must not be shared\".The Sunday Times reported that two days later, an official at Birmingham City Council asked the police to provide more evidence for how the ban would help ensure the safety of fans because of concerns that it \"may be wrongly considered as anti-Jewish sentiment\".At a further meeting of the safety group on 16 October, West Midlands Police claimed there was now \"significant intelligence indicating potential for disorder involving Maccabi Tel Aviv fans based on recent fixtures\".West Midlands Police has been approached for comment.",

    "body": "1 hour agoNick EdserBusiness reporterReutersFashion retail chain Next has raised its profit forecast after reporting stronger-than-expected sales over the key Christmas period.However, the retailer warned that UK sales were unlikely to grow as quickly this year, partly due to rising unemployment which is set to weigh on consumer spending.Next said full price sales in the nine weeks to 27 December were up 10.6% compared with a year earlier, which was a bigger rise than it had predicted.The bumper festive sales means the retailer now expects to report annual profits of £1.15bn, slightly ahead of its previous estimate. It is the fifth time Next has increased its profit forecast in the past year.Next said full-price sales - which excludes items sold in sale or clearance offers -  in the UK rose by 5.9% over the Christmas period, while international revenues jumped by 38.3%.But for the coming year, the retailer expects sales growth will slow due to a number of factors, including continuing \"pressures on UK employment\" which it said were likely to \"filter through into the consumer economy as the year progresses\".While it expects UK sales - covering both stores and online - to have risen by 6.6% in the current financial year, it is only forecasting growth of 1.6% for 2026-27.Charles Allen, retail analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told the BBC's Today programme: \"Next has been consistently warning about the slight edge up in unemployment, particularly among younger people, and they remain concerned about that as something that could slow sales down.\"Next also said it would be tough to match 2025's performance as it had been helped by \"very favourable summer weather\" and a boost it received when rival chain Marks & Spencer was hit by a cyber attack.Allen said that overall, Next's results showed that \"when it came to the peak season, people did go out and spend in the UK\".But he said spending was bunched in the last few weeks before Christmas, which was probably due to people waiting to see what was announced in the Budget. \"I think people wanted to see what their finances would look like,\" he said.Emily Salter, lead retail analyst at GlobalData, said Next had set a high bar for the UK retail sector with its strong performance over Christmas.She said the company was likely to be one of the top performers among non-food retailers over the festive period, helped by its range of products.\"The retailer is well-known for more resilient categories such as childrenswear, and the fact that it allows shoppers to easily trade up to more premium brands, as better-off consumers focus on buying fewer, higher quality items in clothing and home,\" she said.Catherine Shuttleworth, owner of marketing agency Savvy, said Next had enjoyed good sales \"in a time where consumer confidence has been pretty suppressed\".She told the BBC she expects another \"sure-footed\" performance from the chain this year, adding: \"Next is one of those organisations in retail that knows its customers pretty well.\"Looking at the wider picture for retail over Christmas, Shuttleworth said she thought results would be \"steady\" rather than \"stellar\".While she expects food retailers to have done well, the clothing sector will be more varied and talk \"about some retailers leaving the High Street for good\" will be heard over the next few weeks.On Monday, the company behind retail chains Claire's and The Original Factory Shop said it would be placing them into administration, putting 2,500 jobs at risk.",

    "body": "53 minutes agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaThe US military action in Venezuela was the right thing to do \"morally\", Kemi Badenoch has said.The Conservative leader told the BBC that while she did not understand the legal basis for Donald Trump's operation to remove President Nicolás Maduro from the country, he was overseeing a \"brutal regime\" and she was \"glad he's gone\".However, she added that the move did \"raise serious questions about the rules-based order\".The UK government has so far avoided criticising the US move or saying whether it breached international law, instead arguing that Maduro was an \"illegitimate president\".However, some Labour MPs and opposition parties including the Liberal Democrats, Green Party and SNP have called on the government to condemn Trump's actions and brand them illegal.Badenoch told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the US action was \"extraordinary\" but she understood why it was taken.\"Where the legal certainty is not yet clear, morally, I do think it was the right thing to do,\" she said.The Tory leader, who spent her childhood in Nigeria before moving back to the UK at the age of 16, added: \"I grew up under a military dictatorship, so I know what it's like to have someone like Maduro in charge.\"However, she said it was right to tell Trump not to intervene in Greenland because \"there is a big difference between democratic states\" and the \"gangster state in Venezuela\".\"What happens in Greenland is up to Denmark and the people of Greenland,\" she added.In recent days Trump has repeated his threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory which has a strategic location and is rich in minerals - arguing it is vital for US national security.The UK has issued a joint statement with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark insisting it is for Denmark and Greenland alone to decide on matters concerning the territory's future.Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Breakfast the UK's approach to Greenland was different to Venezuela as Denmark was a member of the Nato military alliance and it was not in the UK's national security interests to question the territory's future.Streeting also defended the prime minister's response to the developments in Venezuela, arguing he was acting in the UK's national interest, as well as the \"best interests of the people of Venezuela\".\"I appreciate there are others who have been more strident and have been more critical of the United States,\" he said.\"The prime minister has a different responsibility, and he is choosing his words carefully and wisely to try and influence how events unfold from here on.\"Critics of the government's approach, including Labour MP Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, have argued the US action risks emboldening Russia and China and that the UK should be clear the operation breached international law.In a statement in the House of Commons on Monday evening, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she had reminded her US counterpart Marco Rubio of his obligations under international law.However, she reiterated the prime minister's position that it is for the US to set out the legal basis for its actions.Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife were seized from Caracas on Saturday in an operation by US forces which also saw strikes on military bases in the country.The pair have been taken to New York where they have been charged with weapon and drug offences, accused of enriching themselves from a violent crime ring smuggling cocaine to the US.Maduro has long rejected the allegations as a pretext to force him from power and both have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.Trump has vowed to \"run the country\" until there is a \"proper\" transition of power, with Venezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as interim president.",

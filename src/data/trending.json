This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "3 hours agoChristian Fuller,South East and Charlie Rose,in GuildfordSurrey PoliceThomas Waller was branded \"a very dangerous individual\"Warning: This story contains distressing detailsA teenage nursery worker who raped and sexually abused children as young as three has been sentenced to 10 years in a young offender institution.Thomas Waller, now 18, was found guilty of multiple offences, including rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, earlier this year.Waller, who committed the offences in Surrey in 2024, was arrested after a mother was told by her son that he had been abused in a toilet while at nursery.At Guildford Crown Court, he was also sentenced to an additional five years on licence. Within days of being able to look after children, Waller took advantage of his position to gain the trust of two boys in his care before exploiting them, the court heard.The teenager was working at a nursery for the summer months, where his responsibilities included taking children to the toilet and helping them get changed, the court was told.In a victim impact statement, one of the boys' fathers said his son had \"gathered a collection of memories that I would never wish on a human being\".\"Three things have kept us going; justice for our little boy; to protect other children from this dangerous, calculating predator; and to ensure that lessons are learnt for nurseries in Surrey and beyond that mean it is harder for paedophiles to abuse children,\" it added. Speaking about his son's new school, he added: \"We should be telling them that he doesn't like carrots, not that he has been raped.\"Sentencing him, Judge Claire Harden-Frost said it was \"heartbreaking\" to see the boys' parents feeling responsible for what happened.Teenage nursery worker convicted of child rapeThe nursery, which cannot be named for legal reasons, said: \"We were, and remain, deeply shocked, saddened and sorry to learn of the actions of a former member of our staff.\"As soon as concerns were raised, we took immediate action, contacting the police without delay, suspending the individual concerned, and fully cooperating with the investigation.\"It said a full review had been carried out and its safeguarding policies and staff training had been strengthened.Jonathan Hulley, Surrey County Council cabinet member for children, family and lifelong learning, said he was \"appalled\" by the crimes committed by Waller.\"The wellbeing and safeguarding of children and young people is our absolute priority,\" he added. Waller was found guilty of rape, two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity and taking indecent photos after a trial at Staines Youth Court earlier this year.The offending happened at a nursery in Surrey between July and August 2024.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Call of Duty is back, and it's got a battle on its hands4 hours agoTom Richardson,BBC Newsbeat and Mel Ramsay,BBC NewsActivisionActress Kiernan Shipka takes a central role in Black Ops 7's campaignThere are some things you can always rely on, and a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of them.As one of the best-known names in video games, it's a series that needs little introduction.According to publisher Activision, it's sold an estimated 500 million copies, a movie adaptation is on the way, and despite having launched in 2003 it still reliably appears at - or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts.But this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands.Battlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor.And long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its roots.The clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses to fan concerns about the series losing its way.It has long offered players the chance to purchase \"operator skins\" that change their character's appearance. They're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj.But when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash.Fans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which have included pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025.Activision said the feedback from fans \"hit home\" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously.It's also being released after parent company Microsoft increased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20%, angering many players.ActivisionBlack Ops games thrust players into a world of espionage and conspiracyWhen BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign.The equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes.Black Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies.Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company.Natalie says that the \"Black Ops identity\" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't.\"There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,\" she says.\"And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?\" ActivisionMilo Ventimiglia takes over the role of hero David MasonBeing one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects.For Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia.Kiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans.She says being involved was \"honestly more exciting than anything.\" \"I love a fandom,\" she says.\"And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool.\"The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be.\"If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing.\" As someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have.\"I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,\" he says. Asked whether he thinks players are getting \"fatigued\" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint.\"I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,\" he says. But Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year.The game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed.When they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 \"the best game it can be\".As for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has \"variety and volume\" of experiences to offer.\"But more broadly, she says, \"I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun. \"They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life.\"I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and  relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "A man has been found guilty of stalking former Conservative leadership candidate Dame Penny Mordaunt.However, Edward Brandt, 61, of Lymington, Hampshire, was cleared of the more serious charge of stalking involving serious alarm or distress.The jury at Southampton Crown Court heard he sent multiple emails and phone messages to Dame Penny and also turned up at her Portsmouth office out-of-hours in a bid to meet her.Dame Penny, who was an MP from 2010 to 2024, said in a statement to police that she \"feared sexual violence\" because of the defendant's \"creepy\" behaviour, the court heard.The alleged offending occurred between 11 September 2023 and 12 May 2024.Brandt, a former councillor, was arrested in March last year and given a conditional caution the following month, requiring him not to contact Dame Penny, but he then left two voicemail messages for her.In one of the messages, he said: \"I am going to go on gently knocking at your door in order to shake your hand, I am not giving up.\"The jury returned the guilty verdict by a majority of 10 to two.Brandt wept and held his hands over his face after the verdicts were returned.Explaining why he wanted to meet Dame Penny, the former elected member of East Hampshire District Council said he wanted to commiserate with her over her leadership bid.He added: \"I wanted to congratulate her because she was a reforming leader of the Commons, I wanted to congratulate her on the coronation, chat to her about her time in office, have her sign a copy of her book.\"It was entirely political and entirely harmless.\"Clearly emotional at times, Dame Penny told the court: \"The difference between this case and even threats to shoot me and my family [is that] they are easier to deal with because that threat is not constantly present.\"It's not something you are having to think about every single day when you are leaving your house.\"I believe this man was a real threat to me and still is.\"Brandt was released on conditional bail ahead of sentencing on 16 January.",

    "body": "4 hours agoFaisal Islam,Economics editor, Chris Mason,Political editor and Kate Whannel,Political reporterGetty ImagesRachel Reeves has decided against raising income tax rates at the Budget after receiving better-than-expected economic forecasts, government sources have said. In recent weeks, the chancellor had given strong indications she would increase the tax - a move that would have broken Labour's  election promise not to raise \"the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax\".However, as first reported in the Financial Times, the chancellor has decided not to proceed following estimates suggesting a gap in the public finances is £10bn smaller than previously thought.Instead of raising rates, Reeves could opt to freeze or lower income tax thresholds, the salary levels at which the rates kick in.Other taxes could also be raised and government sources maintain they are still having to make what they call \"tough choices\".They also stress that the move was not related to the turbulence in recent days relating to the prime minister's future.Ahead of every Budget, the chancellor submits their plans to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which then make forecasts on whether the government will spend more money than it raises and whether the economy will grow or shrink.A proposal to increase income tax rates by 2p, while cutting National Insurance by the same amount, was sent to the OBR as an option earlier this month to be costed, to help fill what was then a £30bn gap in the public finances, mainly caused by a downgrade to productivity.Newer assessments from the OBR appear to have increased the projected strength of wages and tax receipts in the coming years and offset several billion pounds of that gap, taking it closer to £20bn.In addition to the more positive forecasts, it is also the case that many Labour MPs were nervous about breaking an election promise, something that would have influenced the chancellor's decision.Government borrowing costs initially rose in reaction to the reports but fell back after further reports that the financial hole would not be as big as first thought.Chancellors never comment publicly on what will be in their Budgets but do prepare the ground - also known as \"pitch rolling\" - for any big changes that might be coming.And in the months running up to this year's financial statement, Labour ministers have repeatedly given strong indications that income tax rates would go up. In October, the prime minister declined to repeat his previous promises not to increase key taxes, despite being asked to do so by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at Prime Minister's Questions. Earlier this month, Reeves took the unusual step of making a pre-Budget speech to warn about the need for \"necessary choices\" and said everyone would have to \"contribute\". And on Monday, she told BBC Radio 5 live: \"It would, of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.\"If the chancellor has decided not to increase income tax rates, she will have to explore other ways to raise money, in order to meet her self-imposed rules on debt and borrowing while filling a hole in the public finances of around £20bn. She could still opt to extend a freeze on income tax and National Insurance (NI) thresholds. The freeze was introduced in April 2023 and was due to expire in 2028.  An extension of the freeze would not break the strict letter of the manifesto promise but would mean income tax bills go up for some, as more people would be pulled above the income threshold at which point they either start paying tax and NI or qualify for higher tax rates. It would also mean Reeves reversing her stance from last year's Budget, when she told MPs: \"I have come to the conclusion that extending the threshold freeze would hurt working people. It would take more money out of their payslips.\"From 2028-29, personal tax thresholds will be uprated in line with inflation once again.\"The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates extending the freeze by two years could raise £8.3bn a year and would mean someone on the minimum wage would be liable to pay income tax if they worked just 18 hours a week. Another option would be to lower the thresholds which would raise more money than simply extending the freeze. There have been reports the Treasury is also considering other measures including a new tax on electric vehicles and higher taxes on gambling companies. Insiders say that the chancellor's Budget strategy \"remains the same\" - to increase the buffer or \"headroom\" on meeting her borrowing rules from the current £10bn a year,  to tackle cost of living pressures, and to make \"fair choices\" on tax.In its 2024 general election manifesto, Labour promised that it would \"not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, or VAT\".Breaking the manifesto promise would mean difficult questions for Labour ministers and MPs ahead of elections in Scotland, Wales and England. At the start of the month, the party's newly-elected deputy leader Lucy Powell, said: \"It is really important we stand by the promises that we were elected on and that we do what we said we would do.\"Health Secretary Wes Streeting said it was \"really important that we keep our promises and that we stand by our manifesto\".He added that talk about tax rises demonstrated how \"challenging\" the situation in public finances was, but that it was \"wise to stop speculating\"  and \"wait for the Budget\".Kemi Badenoch said: \"It's good if they aren't going to increase income taxes, but the truth is they shouldn't be increasing any taxes at all.\"I've never seen a government do this in the run up to a budget. I have never seen this level of chaos, this level of irresponsibility.\"\"Reeves must guarantee no new taxes on work, businesses, homes or pensions - and she should go further by abolishing stamp duty.\"Liberal Democrat Business spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: \"The chancellor gave a press conference to trail her income tax hikes. \"She must come before the British public today, unroll that particular pitch and come clean on what on earth is going on at the Treasury.\"The SNP social justice secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said the UK government was in \"complete disarray\".A Downing Street spokesman did not comment on whether income tax would rise but said: \"The chancellor was very clear about addressing the challenges this country faces and her priorities in addressing those challenges – all of that stands.\"One of the objectives of the budget is to build more resilient public finances with the headroom to withstand global turbulence and to give businesses the confidence to invest.\"",

    "body": "What does Trump want with boat strike campaign?38 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseReutersAt least 80 people were killed in over a month of US strikes on suspected drug vessels. US airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have continued unabated since early September - a deadly campaign now dubbed Operation Southern Spear. Tens of thousands of troops and substantial air and naval assets have been deployed to the region, collectively forming the largest US military presence in and around Latin America in decades. The Trump administration argues that the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs to the US. They have, however, been controversial and sparked fears of a wider conflict in the region. Here is what we know. Why is the US conducting strikes?President Trump and members of his administration have justified the strikes as a necessary counter-drug measure to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America to US streets. In a statement, defence secretary Pete Hegseth said that the campaign - which on 13 November was officially named Operation Southern Spear - is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".But little information about the targets or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belonged to has been officially released by the Pentagon. In at least a few cases, Hegseth and several other officials have claimed that the targets were tied to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration at the start of the year. It is unclear how much of an impact US officials believe that the strikes are having on the wider flow of drugs, a significant portion of which cross the land border between Mexico and the US. How many strikes have there been?Between 2 September and 13 November, US forces hit at least 21 vessels in 20 separate strikes in international waters, both in the Caribbean and in the eastern Pacific. The majority of these strikes have taken place off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. Collectively, at least 80 people have been killed. While US forces have not publicly identified them, they have all been alleged to be \"narco-terrorists\". One investigation, from the Associated Press, reported that several Venezuelan nationals killed in the strikes were low-level traffickers driven by poverty to a life of crime, as well as at least one local crime boss. Are these boat strikes legal? The Trump administration has insisted that the strikes are legal, justifying them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives.In a confidential note to Congress, the administration argued that the US is engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels who are \"unlawful combatants\" and whose actions - drug trafficking - \"constitute an armed attack against the United States\".But some legal experts have said strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), told the BBC that he believes that the strikes could be treated as crimes against humanity.Critics have also questioned whether the White House complied with US law in initially authorising the strikes.According to the US constitution, only Congress is able to declare war.In October, President Trump said the US is \"allowed\" to strike vessels near Venezuela, but that his administration \"may go back to Congress\" if the campaign was expanded to include targets on land.\"We don't have to do that,\" he said. \"But I think...I'd like to do that.\"Is the US preparing to attack Venezuela?As part of the operation, the US has deployed substantial strike power in the Caribbean and western Atlantic within striking distance of Venezuela. This force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, as well as a range of guided missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships capable of landing thousands of troops. Additionally, US combat aircraft have been deployed to bases in Puerto Rico, and US long-range bombers have flown within striking distance of Venezuela's coastline. Trump has also acknowledged that he authorised the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela, although the scope of what that could mean remains highly classified. This build-up has prompted concerns that the US is preparing to directly target Venezuela, or potentially try to topple the left-wing socialist government of Nicolas Maduro. On 3 November, Trump downplayed the possibility of a war with Venezuela, but suggested that he believed Maduro's days as the country's president were numbered. Asked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it.\" \"I don't think so,\" he added. \"But they've been treating us very badly.\" How has Maduro responded? The Maduro government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government. In response, the Venezuelan military have announced readiness exercises and in November declared a \"massive mobilisation\" of troops, which saw 200,000 personnel sent across the country. Maduro has cautioned against the US becoming involved in Venezuela, and called for peace. \"No more forever wars. No more unjust wars. No more Libya. No more Afghanistan,\" Maduro said on CNN on 13 November. \"Long live peace.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoImogen FoulkesIn BernAPTrump was pictured on Monday apparently with the Swiss gifts on his desk in the Oval OfficePaul KirbyEurope digital editorSwitzerland and the US have agreed to cut President Donald Trump's steep 39% tariffs on Swiss exports to 15%, as part of a deal that involves a Swiss promise to invest $200bn (£150bn) in the US.\"It's a great relief for our economy,\" said Swiss Economics Minister Guy Parmelin, who said significant damage had been done since the additional tariffs had kicked in last August.Parmelin said a move by Swiss business leaders to meet Trump in the White House last week had proved \"decisive\" in reaching a deal. Industry chiefs visited the Oval Office, bearing gifts including a Rolex gold watch and a specially engraved gold bar from Swiss-based gold refining company MKS.Initial attempts by Swiss President Karin Keller Sutter to change Trump's mind had fallen on deaf ears. Trump said she \"was a nice woman, but she did not want to listen\".But after the 4 November encounter with Swiss business leaders, Trump revealed this week a deal was being worked on.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer confirmed an agreement had been reached, saying \"President Trump's unmatched dealmaking continues to deliver for the American people\".The deal had involved very hard work, said chief trade negotiator Helene Budliger Artieda. Guy Parmelin said it would bring Switzerland into line with the 15% tariff rate negotiated with the US by its European Union neighbours.The economics minister said it involved the Swiss economy investing $200bn directly in the US by 2028. A third of that Swiss money will be invested in the US in 2026 under the deal.Switzerland has also agreed to axe tariffs on a quota of US meat exports including beef, bison and poultry.Greer said the deal \"tears down longstanding trade barriers\" and Swiss investment would bring thousands of new jobs.For Swiss industry, the deal could not come soon enough. Tech exports to the US are down 14.2% on the third quarter of last year, according to latest statistics - a dramatic fall since the tariff hike was imposed in August.The role of Swiss industrialists appears to have been key, and some particularly those trading in luxury goods, gold, or commodities, already had contacts in Trump's circle.In September, Trump appeared at the US Open tennis final in the Rolex VIP box hosted by the Swiss watch company's chief executive Jean Frédéric Dufour. MANDEL NGAN/AFPJean Frédéric Dufour and Trump stood together in the Rolex VIP box in New York in SeptemberThe president even asked if the Rolex CEO would have been there if Trump had not slapped such steep tariffs on Switzerland.Last week Dufour met Trump again, this time in the Oval Office, along with fellow business leaders including Johann Rupert from luxury goods maker Richemont and Marwan Shakarchi from MKS.Days after the meeting, Trump was pictured in the Oval Office with what looked very much like a Rolex \"Datejust\" desk clock, produced by the company as a collector's item, and worth tens of thousands of dollars.A White House official has confirmed to the BBC the two items were given to Trump.It is quite normal nowadays for visitors to the Oval Office to come bearing a gift.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer brought an invitation from King Charles for a lavish state visit. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz offered a framed copy of the birth certificate of Trump's German grandfather.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFPThe Rolex desk clock was pictured on Trump's desk on MondayThe US president receives thousands of gifts every year and they then become US property, deposited with the National Archives and filed annually by the state department. They are eventually transferred to a presidential library. Some gifts can be kept but presidents have to pay federal taxes if they do not come from a close relative.Swiss industry has been waiting for a deal with bated breath and a number of Swiss companies had warned they would have to furlough staff if nothing changed.Yves Bugmann, who heads the Swiss Watch Industry Federation, welcomed the deal after months of uncertainty. Asked what kind of investment the Swiss government might make in the US that would add up to $200bn, Helene Budliger Artieda said there was a detailed list that included pharmaceuticals, but she singled out plans for plane manufacturer Pilatus to build a big US plant and train-maker Stadler to expand its US operations in Utah.Gold refining is also part of the plan. \"Currently, Switzerland is the primary location for gold storage, and New York is the primary location for trading,\" said trade negotiator.The chief trade negotiator said it would take a few days or even weeks for the changes to come into effect.The agreement will only become binding when it receives approval from the Swiss parliament, and then it will be put to a referendum.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKhanyisile Ngcobo,Johannesburg and Wycliffe Muia,NairobiGift of the GiversAbout 23 of them have since left for other destinations, authorities saySouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be an investigation into the \"mysterious\" arrival of a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza into the country.The group arrived at OR Tambo International Airport but were initially refused entry and were stuck in the plane for more than 10 hours as they \"did not have the customary departure stamps in their passports\", local authorities said.Most were eventually allowed in after intervention from a local charity and because of the government's \"empathy [and] compassion\", Ramaphosa said.The circumstances of their departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa remain unclear.South Africa has maintained strong support for the Palestinian cause throughout the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.Ramaphosa said the group \"somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi\" and flew to South Africa, reports the News24 site.Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: \"The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them.\" It did not specify the country.According to the Palestinian embassy in South Africa, the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, \"without any prior note or coordination\".A statement from the embassy said \"an unregistered and misleading organization [had] exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner\". The BBC has asked the Kenyan government for comment.Of the 153, 23 managed to fly on to other destinations, leaving 130 who were admitted into the country, South African authorities say.Ramaphosa, speaking during an event in Johannesburg, said he was informed of the unfolding crisis by the home affairs minister.In response, the president said \"we cannot turn them back\", according to News24.\"Even though they do not have the necessary documents and papers, these are people from a strife-torn, a war-torn country.\"The president also told reporters the South African government would carry out a \"proper evaluation\" of the matter and update the public on \"what is happening and how this matter came to be where it is\", according to public broadcaster SABC.Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said that while Palestinian passport-holders qualified for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, the lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses in some of the travellers' documentation resulted in the initial refusal to let them into the country.Once it was established that the absence of this information \"did not indicate that the travellers wished to apply for asylum\" and their accommodation was confirmed, they were granted entry.\"All of the travellers are in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of them have applied for asylum,\" he said.South African charity Gift of the Givers has said it will provide the group with accommodation in the country.Civil societies in South Africa have called for investigations into the conditions the Palestinians had fled in Gaza and the exact route of the aircraft.One of the Palestinians who spoke to local eNCA TV expressed his relief to be in South Africa, describing it as a country of \"peace, laws and justice\".  \"We came from Gaza where we've faced death on daily basis. We have survived a war of two years and we are lucky to be here,\" said one man who had fled with his wife and two children. Gift of the Givers has since called for Ramaphosa to investigate the home affairs ministry and border authority for the \"humiliation they've caused\" the Palestinians.The organisation's founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said this treatment included being forced to wait for hours on the tarmac at the airport, being denied food provided by the group and \"using every excuse in the book to prevent these passengers from disembarking\".South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.The country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause.Large pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began.Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa.In 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it \"baseless\".You may also be interested in: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "3 hours agoIone WellsSouth America CorrespondentAFP via Getty ImagesTens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud were unleashed through communities surrounding the damMining company BHP has been found liable for a 2015 dam collapse in Brazil, known as the country's worst-ever environmental disaster, by London's High Court.The dam collapse killed 19 people, polluted the river and destroyed hundreds of homes.The civil lawsuit, representing more than 600,000 people including civilians, local governments and businesses, had been valued at up to £36bn ($48bn).BHP said it would appeal against the ruling and continue to fight the lawsuit and has said many claimants in the London lawsuit had already been paid compensation in Brazil.The dam in Mariana, southeastern Brazil, was owned by Samarco, a joint venture between the mining giants Vale and BHP.The claimants' lawyers argued successfully that the trial should be held in London because BHP headquarters \"were in the UK at the time of the dam collapse\".A separate claim against Samarco's second parent company, Brazilian mining company Vale, was filed in the Netherlands, with more than 70,000 plaintiffs.The dam was used to store waste from iron ore mining. When it burst, it unleashed tens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud. The sludge swept through communities, destroying hundreds of people's homes and poisoning the river.Judge Finola O'Farrell said in her High Court ruling that continuing to raise the height of the dam when it was not safe to do so was the \"direct and immediate cause\" of the dam's collapse, meaning BHP was liable under Brazilian law.BHP is expected to appeal the ruling. President of BHP's Minerals Americas, Brandon Craig, said in a statement that 240,000 claimants in the London lawsuit \"have already been paid compensation in Brazil\".\"We believe this will significantly reduce the size and value of claims in the UK group action,\" he added.The lawsuit has been littered with different clashes between the UK firm representing the claimants, Pogust Goodhead, and BHP. BHP always denied liability and said the London lawsuit duplicated legal proceedings and reparation and repair programmes in Brazil.BHP and Vale have set up an organisation called the Renova Foundation tasked with compensating victims. It has offered them either cash compensation, or a house in a new city that the foundation has built to replace the town of Novo Bento and has disbursed billions of dollars in repair and compensation actions to hundreds of thousands of people.In June, a presentation by BHP and Vale's Samarco venture said around 130,000 people in Brazil had reached settlements with them. In response, Pogust Goodhead alleged the companies had pressured claimants to \"settle their claims at far below their true value\" and that it would seek £1.3bn in unpaid fees lost as a result.It alleged that a $30.3bn compensation agreement which Brazil signed with BHP, Vale and Samarco in October 2024 prevented claimants from discussing the deal with the firm or paying its legal fees.The firm said it had incurred $1bn in borrowing costs to finance the English case.BHP said it rejected Pogust Goodhead's allegations in their entirety and dispute \"their factual and legal basis.\"It said the claims were \"without merit\" and BHP would \"vigorously contest them.\" A spokesperson also said that the firm continued to believe Brazil was the most appropriate, effective, and efficient place for compensation for the dam collapse.AFP via Getty ImagesSome of those affected by the disaster travelled to the High Court last yearBut there were also parallel claims that Pogust Goodhead – which promotes itself as a firm representing human rights and environmental law – had tried to profit off \"vulnerable\" Brazilians.During proceedings the firm was accused of \"misleading\" vulnerable Brazilians for its own gain by a Brazilian judge in the state of Minas Gerais.Pogust Goodhead rejected the accusation at the time as \"without merit\". In a claim brought by the Public Prosecutors and Public Defenders in Brazil against Pogust Goodhead, the judge criticised several \"allegedly abusive clauses\" in Pogust Goodhead's contracts with Brazilians who suffered damage.Among these, it alleges the law firm engaged in \"misleading advertising\" considering the \"hypervulnerability of those affected\".It also alleges \"undue charging of fees on compensation amounts obtained extrajudicially in Brazil\" which it said represents \"illicit enrichment that diverts essential resources from those affected\" and \"excessive\" penalties for claimants who terminated their contracts which it said \"discouraged\" them from joining national compensation programmes.The former Brazilian ambassador in London and Washington, Rubens Barbosa, told the BBC earlier this year that he believed this amounted to spreading misleading information in Brazil.Mr Barbosa said bringing the case to London \"hinders efforts to resolve the matter locally\" and the \"extremely vulnerable Brazilians were misled\" by contracts.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesSarah Ferguson's new children's book, which had already been delayed, has now been withdrawn from sale, according to analytics firm Nielsen.Flora And Fern: Kindness Along The Way was initially due to be published on 9 October, according to a press release in Bookseller.As of last week, it was showing as being available from 20 November on Amazon, but it is now no longer listed on the website.NielsenIQ Book Data confirmed to the BBC that the title had been marked as \"withdrawn from sale\" at the request of the publisher. Ms Ferguson's representatives declined to comment.Her publisher, New Frontier Publishing, has not responded to multiple requests for comment.Ms Ferguson, 66, lost her duchess title when her ex-husband, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, relinquished use of his Duke of York title over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Since then, Andrew has also lost his prince title.Last month, Waterstones bookstores told BBC News that the publication date for Flora And Fern: Kindness Along The Way had \"moved\" and that they did not have a new publication date.A spokesperson for Waterstones said they had had no further communication from the publisher since then.No reason has been given for why the book has now been withdrawn from sale.But one industry source told BBC News that the decision \"makes total sense commercially\".\"You have to imagine it's to do with the current controversies,\" said Neill Denny, from the book trade news website Book Brunch.\"It's not the right time to release a book by Sarah Ferguson.\"Mr Denny said the publisher may decide to \"sit on it\" for six months or a year, hoping for a better time to put it out.\"It's not the sort of book that's going to age, and you're not risking a lot of money by holding it back,\" he said.Getty ImagesMs Ferguson's other publishers have remained tight-lipped when asked whether they plan to sever links with her.Harper Collins, which has published two of her titles, the most recent being A Most Intriguing Lady which came out in 2023, previously declined to comment but pointed to the fact that both her books remain in print and available.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, and Ms Ferguson, are due to move out of his Windsor estate, Royal Lodge.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor will move to the King's Sandringham estate in Norfolk. It is not yet clear where Ms Ferguson will go.On Friday, the Daily Mail reported that she is preparing to move in with her daughter Princess Eugenie in her Portugal home, although there has been no official confirmation of this. Ms Ferguson's representatives declined to comment on these reports.Ms Ferguson has also faced a separate scandal about her own links with Epstein.In September, several charities dropped her as patron or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.Away from her philanthropic work, Ms Ferguson has various business ventures, and has written several children's books, non-fiction about Queen Victoria, and her own memoirs.",

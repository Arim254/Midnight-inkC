    "body": "Three shark attacks have been reported in Sydney in a little over 24 hours, leaving at least two people seriously injured, according to local authorities.A man was taken to hospital in critical condition after being injured at Manly beach on Monday evening, New South Wales Police said in a statement.Hours earlier, an 11-year-old surfer had to be assisted off Sydney's Dee Why Beach after a suspected shark bit his surfboard, with the local council urging swimmers and surfers to be cautious.The first incident saw a 12-year-old boy taken to hospital with critical injuries after he was attacked by a large shark while swimming in Sydney Harbour on Sunday afternoon, police said.The boy and his group of friends were jumping off a six-metre rock ledge at Shark Beach, in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse, when the attack happened on Sunday.Despite its name, shark attacks are rare at Shark Beach, a popular swimming spot.The boy was pulled out of the water by his friends before rescuers arrived. Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.\"The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery,\" said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command.\"Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship.\"Marine police arrived to a \"horrendous scene\", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs. They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf.Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world.McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore. The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice.According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT). He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital.Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least five fatal shark attacks in the country last year.",

    "body": "27 minutes agoBrooklyn Peltz Beckham's statement addressing his strained relationship with his parents features prominently on Tuesday's front pages. \"Brooklyn goes nuclear\" says the Daily Mail as it quotes the eldest son of Sir David Beckham and Lady Victoria Beckham, accusing his parents of being \"controlling\" and putting their family brand first. The Sun carries the same headline as the Mail, providing more details from the six-page Instagram statement from Peltz Beckham saying he has no wish to reconcile with his family.\"Brooklyn blasts Posh and Becks\" is the Daily Star's take. Elsewhere, the paper pays tribute to legendary Italian fashion designer Valentino who has died aged 93.The i Paper reports that Nato insiders are warning that Donald Trump's ambition to annex Greenland is \"destroying trust\" and \"tearing apart longstanding agreements\". The headline suggests that UK and US relations is at its \"lowest ebb\" since the 1956 Suez crisis.Staying with Donald Trump, the Guardian reports the US president has linked his threats to seize control of Greenland to his failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize. In a text message sent to Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre on Sunday, Trump said he no longer felt the need to think \"purely of peace\" after being snubbed for the award, the paper says. In the top picture spot is Prince Harry arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice in London for the trial against the Daily Mail for alleged unlawful information gathering.The Metro focuses on the response from Norway's prime minister, saying he has repeatedly tried to explain to Donald Trump that he was not purposely snubbed for the award. \"A prize idiot\" is the headline. The Times follows with reports that Trump has refused to rule out military action to seize Greenland despite intense opposition from European allies. The US leader is due to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday where the paper says he is likely to face some \"tense encounters\" with Nato allies.\"Trump maintains Greenland seizure threat\" echoes the Financial Times. It features responses from Nato allies, with Denmark bolstering its military troops and Germany saying \"we will not be blackmailed\".In news closer to home, the Daily Telegraph's lead story reports the government confirmation that it is consulting on plans for an Australian-style social media ban for teenagers under 16 in the UK. The paper says the final decision is expected to be made in the summer. The story also gets a mention on a number of other front pages.Finally, the Daily Express fills its front page with a photo of four nurses, who have  spoken to the paper after they complained about a transgender woman using their changing room at a hospital - leading to an employment tribunal ruling in their favour.

    "body": "Forecasters are predicting a colder spell of weather to take hold in the UK for the end of January and into the start of February.A battle between cold air from the east and milder conditions from the west will be taking place this week, with a growing likelihood of colder air winning into next week.Some places will see an increased chance of sleet and snow although details remain uncertain at time stage.However, before the colder conditions kick in we're expecting another round of wet and windy weather to dominate for the next few days. Low pressure moving in from the south-west on Tuesday will bring a spell of heavy rain and strong winds initially to the western half of the British Isles. By midweek those wet and windy conditions will spread across the UK. The Met Office has issued various weather warnings over the next few days, including a yellow warning for wind in south-west England on Tuesday and a heavy rain warning in eastern Scotland from Wednesday into Friday.Slightly colder weather is expected across northern areas on Thursday and into Friday, with some snow likely over high ground in Scotland, especially across the Grampians and Highlands.For most areas temperatures are set to stay around the January average for the rest of the week, then will fall below average over the weekend and throughout the final week of January.Whilst several longer-range weather forecasting models are starting to agree that temperatures are going to drop more widely towards the end of the month, the change will not be clear-cut. With high pressure expected to the east and lower pressure to the west, the UK will lie just on boundary between cold and mild air.Forecasting snow in the UK is rarely straightforward because we are an island nation on the edge on a large continent. Most commonly our weather our arrives from the west - moving in from a relatively mild Atlantic. However, when we do see winds from the Arctic or from Siberia during winter, we can see spells of cold, snowy weather. The difference between precipitation falling as rain, sleet or snow can be dictated by a change in just a degree or two, meaning forecasters often won't firm up on any snow detail until a few days in advanced. Keep an eye on the latest thoughts from the BBC Weather team on our website and via the BBC Weather App. ",

    "body": "6 hours agoNaomi de SouzaBBC Newsbeat PA MediaThe Hull hair stylist was a popular faithful on the BBC reality showSpoiler warning: This article contains details of the ongoing series of The Traitors.BBC Traitors star Jessie Stride says helping to raise awareness for those with a stammer \"means more than any prize money\".The Hull hair stylist was a popular faithful on the BBC reality show, but became the sixth player to be murdered by the traitors last week – leaving fellow contestants and viewers gutted. But representing people with speech conditions was always her bigger goal, and has seen her break down more barriers than she could have imagined. The 28-year-old tells BBC Newsbeat she is \"on a high\" after being the first contestant to have a stammer.\"I've had lots of people with stammers reach out, which is just really nice,\" says Jessie.\"I'm just on a really big high. I love it. I'm so happy.\"Ahead of entering the game, Jessie said having a stammer has helped her be \"an authentic person\" because she cannot hide it.Stammering, also known as a stutter, is a difference in the way some people speak which can cause them to repeat sounds or words, according to the charity Stamma. \"I would just love to be able to push (awareness) out a bit more and to get people speaking about stammers and just to help educate those who don't understand it,\" Jessie explains.PA MediaJessie was the first Traitors contestant to have a stammerJessie won many viewers' hearts and contestants in the castle with her loyalty, good humour and bright red hair - but also her ability to observe the behaviour of others. \"I feel like having a stammer makes you a good listener and it kind of helps me to be able to just watch a little bit more,\" she says. \"And I would just watch how Stephen was and how he'd act and I just had an instinct that it could be him.\"By the second week of the series, Jessie successfully identified that fellow contestant Stephen was a traitor after analysing numerous scenarios. The hairdresser doesn't feel her game was impacted by her stammer as the other contestants would be patient and allow her to speak her mind. \"It helped that the whole cast would just wait and were all just really kind about it,\" she says. \"Yes, it would take me longer speech-wise because I would need more time to speak, but the whole cast let me have that, which did help a lot.\"PA MediaShe hopes to continue to break down barriers by working more with children or in TV Jessie says she has received messages from others with a stammer who have said the representation has helped them feel seen.\"I'm hoping that if people who have a stammer watch me that it does give them hope that, you know, we are able to do what we want and that it doesn't have to hold us back,\" she says. When the next Traitors episode lands on Wednesday, many viewers will likely miss Jessie's yellow and orange energy, but she has plans to continue to knock down any challenges coming her way.\"I would love to do more BSL, I would love to work with kids, I'd love to work in TV,\" she says.\"I have an open mind, but I do hope this isn't it and that I could do more here.\"And although she has not won the prize pot, Jessie says she will take away the \"great\" friendships and bonds she made in the Traitors castle.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "4 hours agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsWatch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decadeSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has promised to get to the bottom of why two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain killing at least 40 people, as rescuers continue to search the wreckage.After visiting the site of the crash, Sanchez also announced three days of national mourning for victims.More than 120 more people were injured as carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening.The crash is the worst the country has seen in more than a decade.Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, according to Transport Minister Óscar Puente. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva.Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.Sanchez visited the site of the crash with senior officials on Monday afternoon.\"This is a day of sorrow for all of Spain, for our entire country,\" he told reporters.\"We are going to get to the truth, we are going to find the answer, and when that answer about the origin and cause of this tragedy is known, as it could not be otherwise, with absolute transparency and absolute clarity, we will make it public.\"Puente said an investigation could take at least a month, describing the incident as \"extremely strange\".ReutersRescuers are still searching the wreckage at the crash siteEPAPedro Sánchez travelled to Spain to pay tribute to the people killedBut Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed source briefed on initial investigations as saying experts had found a faulty joint on the rails, which was causing a gap between rail sections to widen as trains travelled over it. They added that the joint was key to identifying the cause of the accident.Spain's El País newspaper said it was not clear whether the fault was a cause or a result of the crash.Four hundred passengers and staff were on board the two trains, the rail authorities said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 41, including children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 are in intensive care.Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\". Officials are working to identify the dead.The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters.Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\".\"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: \"There were people and screaming, calling for doctors.\"All high-speed services between Madrid and the southern cities of Malaga, Cordoba, Sevilla and Huelva have been suspended until Friday.Watch: Footage inside Spanish train as passengers evacuate from crashKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster \"with great concern\" and offered their \"most heartfelt condolences\". The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive.The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.Spain's high-speed rail network is the second largest in the world, behind China, connecting more than 50 cities across the country. Adif data shows the Spanish rail is more than 4,000km long (2,485 miles).",

    "body": "2 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesSir David and Lady Victoria Beckham have not publicly acknowledged the much-rumoured rift with their eldest son and his wife Nicola\"I do not want to reconcile with my family,\" Brooklyn Peltz Beckham has said in a statement in which he accuses his parents of \"attacking\" him and his wife in the press.The eldest child of Sir David Beckham and Lady Beckham accused them of \"trying endlessly to ruin\" his relationship with Nicola Peltz Beckham and placing \"lies\" in the media \"to preserve their own facade\".After months of speculation about a feud in the high-profile family, he said he had tried to keep the situation private but was left with \"no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth\".The BBC has reached out to Sir David's and Lady Beckham's representatives for comment. The pair have never acknowledged the rift.\"I have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private,\" the 26-year-old wrote in a series of posts to his 16 million followers.\"Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.\"I do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.\"He added: \"Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.\"Much of the statement focused on his relationship with his wife - an American actress and the daughter of billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz - whom he said had been \"consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one\".He accused his parents of trying to derail their wedding, claiming his fashion designer mother had \"cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress\".Reports emerged at the time that Nicola, now 31, had refused to wear one of Lady Beckham's designs. She later told the Times that her mother-in-law had realised her atelier could not finish it in time, denying speculation that there was a feud.He also accused Lady Beckham of \"hijacking\" their first dance - claiming that when he was called to the stage, \"my mum was waiting to dance with me\" instead of his wife and \"danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone\".He said they renewed their vows in 2025 to create new memories \"that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment\".Peltz Beckham also alleged that his parents had \"repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name\" weeks before the ceremony. It is not clear to which rights he is referring.He said he had refrained from agreeing to do so - which \"affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since\".Getty ImagesThe pair joined the rest of the family at the premier of their Netflix documentary, Beckham, in October 2023He also addressed another incident which had fuelled speculation about the rift: the couple's absence from Sir David's 50th birthday party in May.Peltz Beckham said he and his wife had travelled to London for Sir David's birthday but were \"rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him\".\"He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner,\" the influencer wrote.He said his father \"finally agreed\" to meet him but on the condition that his wife was not present, which he called a \"slap in the face\", adding that his family then refused to see him on a subsequent trip to Los Angeles.At the time, a source told the BBC that the 26-year-old had chosen not to go to the party as his younger brother Romeo was attending with a woman to whom he had previously been linked.The influencer's post alleged that his mother had \"repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable\".The eldest son criticised his family for valuing \"public promotion and endorsements above all else\".\"Brand Beckham comes first,\" he wrote, adding that \"family 'love' is decided by how much you post on social media\".He said: \"I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared\".Peltz Beckham said he had been subject to \"endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders\".He added that his younger brothers had also been \"sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last summer\".Cruz Beckham, 20, said in December that their parents would \"never unfollow their son,\" in response to a Daily Mail story claiming they had done so.\"Not true. My mum and dad would never unfollow their son. Let's get the facts right,\" he wrote on Instagram.\"They woke up blocked as I did.\" Ex-England football captain Sir David and former Spice Girl Lady Beckham have two other sons and a daughter - Romeo, 23, Cruz, and Harper Seven, 14.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterConservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has warned her MPs against more plotting and \"psychodrama\" after two defections from the party in four days.Former shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick became the most senior Tory to move to Reform UK, after Badenoch discovered he was planning to defect last week, and sacked him.Andrew Rosindell, who was the shadow minister for foreign affairs for the Conservatives, made the leap to Nigel Farage's party this weekend.Now Badenoch has called some of her MPs on the right of the party to a meeting on Monday night, to underline the message.Farage will be attending a rally with Jenrick in the former Tory's Newark constituency. The Reform leader has  warned those thinking of defecting to his party that they should do so before the May elections or risk being rejected.In a letter obtained by BBC, Badenoch insisted the defections were \"a minor setback, not a defining moment\" for her party, and called for unity.\"A party that is ruthlessly focused on being effective, holding the government to account and creating a plan for the country cannot also spend its time on psychodrama and intrigue,\" she wrote.The Conservative leader also suggested MPs \"satisfy themselves\" about their own staff's behaviour, because \"a small number of individuals were actively briefing against the party while presenting themselves as Conservative sources\". She warned: \"Those who want to undermine or destroy the party will be dealt with firmly and fairly.\"Former Conservatives, including David Gauke, who was justice secretary under Theresa May, have suggested the party should move towards the centre ground and leave the \"populist right\" to Reform, but Badenoch dismissed this as  a \"serious misreading of the situation\".Instead, she attacked the more than 20 former Tories who have moved to Farage's party as being part of a wider cultural problem, insisting the defections \"are not about policy differences or ideology\" but \"character\" and \"those who put individual ambition\" above public service.Badenoch said she believed Britain is not \"broken\", as Jenrick claimed in his defection speech, but pointed the finger at a broken political culture \"because too many who come into it are motivated by self-interest and not national interest\".Sir Keir Starmer also \"cannot get legislation through because of the self-interest of his own MPs\", despite having a huge majority, she said.But she also told MPs the Conservatives are \"stronger and more united now\", adding: \"We are a team that wants to talk to voters, not just to ourselves or online echo chambers.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "3 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe government will consult on whether social media should be banned for under-16s in the UK.It said \"immediate action\" would give Ofsted the power to check policies on phone use when it inspects schools, and it expected schools to be \"phone-free by default\" as a result of the announcement.A similar ban took effect in Australia in December 2025, the first of its kind in the world. Other countries are said to be considering such a law.It comes after more than 60 Labour MPs wrote to the prime minister about the issue, with the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey also calling on the government to act.\"Some argue that vulnerable children need access to social media to find their community,\" Brianna's mother Esther Ghey wrote in a letter seen by the BBC. \"As the parent of an extremely vulnerable and trans child, I strongly disagree. \"In Brianna's case, social media limited her ability to engage in real-world social interactions. She had real friends, but she chose to live online instead.\"According to The Department of Science, Innovation and Technology, the consultation will \"seek views from parents, young people and civil society\" to determine the effectiveness of a ban.It would also look at whether more robust age checks could be implemented by social media firms, which could be forced to remove or limit features \"which drive compulsive use of social media\".And Ofsted will give tougher guidance to schools to reduce phone use - including telling staff not to use their devices for personal reasons in front of pupils.The government will respond to the consultation in the summer.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the laws in the Online Safety Act were \"never meant to be the end point\" and said she understood \"parents still have serious concerns\".\"We are determined to ensure technology enriches children's lives, not harms them - and to give every child the childhood they deserve,\" she said.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has already said her party would introduce a social media ban for under-16s if it was in power.She said the consultation was \"more dither and delay\" from Labour.\"The prime minister is trying to copy an announcement that the Conservatives made a week ago, and still not getting it right,\" she said. Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Munira Wilson said there was \"no time to waste in protecting our children from social media giants\" and \"this consultation risks kicking the can down the road yet again\".National Education Union (NEU) general secretary Daniel Kebede called the move a \"welcome shift\". \"Every day, parents and teachers see how social media shapes children's identities and attention long before they sit their GCSEs, pulling them into isolating, endless loops of content,\" he said.AFP via Getty ImagesThe Association of School and College Leaders also welcomed the consultation on social media, but said the government had been \"sluggish\" in responding to the online risks posed to children.The union's general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio said there was \"clearly a much wider problem of children and young people spending far too much time on screens and being exposed to inappropriate content\".And Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, also welcomed the plans to consult on a potential social media ban.But he said the suggestion that Ofsted should \"police\" phones in schools was \"deeply unhelpful and misguided\".\"School leaders need support from government, not the threat of heavy-handed inspection,\" he added.'Not strong evidence'It comes as the government faces additional pressure from the House of Lords, which is expected to vote on a proposed ban on Wednesday.The amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill has backing from several prominent figures such as former children's TV presenter Baroness Benjamin and former education minister Lord Nash.There is also a separate amendment calling for the introduction of film-style age ratings which could limit the social media apps children can access.Professor Amy Orben, who leads the Digital Mental Health programme at the University of Cambridge's MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, told the BBC there was \"broad agreement\" more needed to be done to keep children safe online.However, she said there was still \"not strong evidence\" that age-based social media bans were effective.Dr Holly Bear from Oxford University, whose work focuses on developing, evaluating, and implementing mental health interventions for young people, agreed the evidence for the effects of a social media ban was \"still unfolding\".\"A balanced approach might be trying to reduce algorithm-driven exposure to harmful content, improving safeguards, supporting digital literacy and carefully evaluating any major policy interventions,\" she said.The NSPCC, Childnet, and suicide prevention charity the Molly Rose Foundation were among 42 individuals and bodies to argue a ban would be the \"wrong solution\" on Saturday.\"It would create a false sense of safety that would see children - but also the threats to them - migrate to other areas online,\" the organisations wrote.\"Though well-intentioned, blanket bans on social media would fail to deliver the improvement in children's safety and wellbeing that they so urgently need.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoNick EdserBusiness reporterGold and silver prices hit record highs but share prices fell on Monday as investors reacted to the threat by US President Donald Trump to impose fresh tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland.The price of gold touched $4,689.39 (£3,499) an ounce on Monday, while silver rose to a peak of $94.08 an ounce.Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year.But stock markets in Europe fell as investors worried over the latest increase in geopolitical tensions. On Saturday, Trump announced a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland would come into force on 1 February, but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal on Greenland was reached.Reports have suggested the EU is considering responding with a €93bn (£80bn) package of tariffs on US imports.Worries over the Greenland spat triggered another rise in gold and silver prices as investors headed for \"safe haven\" assets.Last year, the price of gold soared by more than 60%, partly due to concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.However, there are other factors behind the rise, including expectations of more interest rate cuts, central banks adding hundreds of tonnes of gold to their reserves and - in regard to silver - China announcing restrictions on exports of the metal.\"Gold has hit fresh record highs on its glittering run upwards,\" said Susannah Streeter, chief investment strategist at Wealth Club.\"The precious metal is holding even more allure as a safe haven as worries spread about the repercussions of the US aggressive trade and geopolitical policies.\"But while gold and silver were continuing their recent strong runs, shares were on the back foot.London's FTSE 100 index closed down almost 0.4%, while the FTSE 250 - which has a greater number of domestically focused companies - closed 0.9% lower. A mixture of financial firms and industrial stocks were lower, but shares in gold miners Fresnillo and Endeavour rose following the latest increase in precious metal prices.Across Europe shares in carmakers, tech and luxury goods firms saw sharp falls.In Germany, the Dax index fell 1.3% with car companies BMW, Mercedes-Benz and VW all down by about 2-3%.In France, the Cac 40 index was down 1.8%, with luxury brands LVMH and Hermes among those that lost out.However, European defence stocks rose, with Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales both trading higher.Markets in the US are closed on Monday for a public holiday.\"Fears that a hard-fought trade deal between Europe and the US might now be off the cards contributed to significant falls across European indices,\" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.However, the US Supreme Court is set to rule on whether President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing some tariffs using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a decision which could come as soon as Tuesday.That \"could bring another huge upset\" if the court were to strike down Trump's tariffs, Hewson said.Trade tensions are one of the main risks to global economic growth, according to the latest forecast from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).In its latest world economic outlook - prepared before the latest tariff threat emerged - it described the global economy as \"steady\", but said risks to growth included an end to the AI boom and a \"flare up\" in trade tensions.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporter ReutersPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said a trade war is in \"no-one's interest\" after Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10% tax on imports from the UK and other countries who oppose his plans to take control of Greenland.Making a speech from Downing Street, Sir Keir said the \"right approach\" was \"through calm discussion\" and that the use of tariffs against allies was \"not the right way to resolve differences\".He reiterated his belief that decisions about the island should rest with the people of Greenland and Denmark. Principle \"cannot be set aside\", he said, but he vowed to take a \"pragmatic\" approach, emphasising both the economic and military importance of the UK-US relationship.He said he did not believe Trump was genuinely considering military action against Greenland.While seeking to diffuse tensions, the prime minister stressed that the situation was \"very serious\" and said it was a \"moment for the whole country to pull together\".He welcomed the support offered by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch in regards to Greenland and potential tariffs.Trump's threat had, he said. been \"very badly received\" in the UK but warned against \"performative\" or \"grandstanding\" actions.\"It may make politicians feel good, but it does nothing for working people whose jobs, livelihoods and security rely on the relationships we build across the world.\"Sir Keir defended his decision to pursue a close relationship with Trump, arguing that it had help deliver \"hundreds of billions of pounds\" of investment in the UK. During his speech and the subsequent question session, he also made repeated references to US-UK co-operation on defence, nuclear capability and intelligence.Asked if he would consider imposing retaliatory tariffs on the US, the prime minister replied: \"We have not got to that stage, my focus is making sure we don't get to that stage.\"On Monday night, Sir Keir spoke to the prime ministers of Canada and Italy, Mark Carney and Giorgia Meloni, and explained the UK and its allies need to reassure Trump they are ready to defend the Arctic from Russia and China.A Downing Street spokesperson said: \"He said that it was in everybody's interests to go further to deliver on Arctic security, and that the UK stands ready to contribute fully alongside our allies through Nato.\"European leaders are expected to raise the future of Greenland with Trump this week when he travels to Davos for the World Economic Forum gathering. French President Emmanuel Macron has hinted he wants to impose counter-tariffs saying the EU should deploy its \"trade bazooka\", but Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni has expressed concerns about the mutual cost of a trade war. The prime minister is not currently due to attend Davos but it remains an option as the week progresses. Over the weekend, a small French military contingent travelled to Greenland as part of a so-called reconnaissance mission. The deployment also involved Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK.Asked if Trump had incorrectly interpreted the visit as a hostile act towards the US, Sir Keir said: \"This is one of the things I discussed with President Trump yesterday.\"Those forces were clearly there to assess and work on the risk from the Russians - there is real clarity, I hope, about that.\"He added that Europe needed \"to step up and do more on its own defence and security\".The US president has partly justified his interest in controlling Greenland by arguing that Denmark had not done enough to protect the area from Russian threats. Located between North America and the Arctic, Greenland is a useful base for early warning systems for missile attacks as well as monitoring vessels in the region.It is also a potential source of rare earth minerals as well as oil and gas, all of which could become more accessible as global warming leads to the melting of the ice sheet that covers the island. Trump has said \"complete and total purchase\" of the Danish territory is essential for US and global security. \"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland,\" he has warned.On Saturday, he said he would place a 10% levy on goods exported to the US from the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.The tax would come into force from 1 February, rising to 25% on 1 June. If Trump does follow through on his threat to impose tariffs it could be damaging to the UK economy, whose biggest overseas customer, in terms of individual countries, is the US. Economists have estimated the new tariffs could take 0.5% off the UK's GDP.The threat of tensions hit stock markets in Europe on Monday morning, with carmakers and luxury good firms seeing some of the biggest falls. Over the weekend, Badenoch said she agreed with the prime minister on the sovereignty of Greenland adding that tariff threats are \"a terrible idea\". Scotland's First Minister John Swinney has also condemned the threat of tariffs saying they should \"not be a bargaining chip in place of reasonable dialogue between partners\". The leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey said he was \"a bit disappointed\", saying that the prime minister had taken \"retaliatory tariffs off the table\".He said \"no-one wants a trade war\" but \"as our European neighbours and others are doing, they're keeping this threat on the table to show that we're not going to be bullied by Donald Trump - the way to beat a bully is to show that you're serious and will stand up.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"This is not how you treat your best friends\", adding that he would be \"having some words\" with members of Trump's team when he travels to Davos this week. He said he that Brexit meant the UK were \"free to negotiate directly\" with the US. Lord Mandelson, former British ambassador to the US, told Matt Chorley on BBC Radio 5 Live that the US president \"expects direct language\" adding: \"He will not be surprised if people talk directly back, but respectfully, not through a megaphone, not by shouting at him from the other side of the street.\" \"That's not what Starmer does, and he's absolutely right not to do so. I think that there are other European leaders, frankly, who could do worse than take their cue from our own prime minister.\"Breaking down Starmer's speech on Greenland row",

    "body": "7 hours agoMaia DaviesandTom Symonds & Imogen James,Royal Courts of JusticeWatch: Prince Harry arrives at the High Court in London on Monday morningThe Duke of Sussex was made to feel \"paranoid beyond belief\" by alleged unlawful information gathering by the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, a court has heard.Prince Harry is among seven high-profile claimants including Sir Elton John and Liz Hurley alleging the papers' publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), committed \"grave breaches of privacy\" over a 20-year period.The prince felt his \"every move, thought or feeling was being tracked and monitored just for the Mail to make money out of it\", according to a written submission by his lawyer.ANL said the duke's social circle was \"known to be a good source of leaks\" to the press and has repeatedly denied the claimants' allegations.Antony White KC, representing the publisher, said it was \"a striking feature of the case that none of the articles were the subject of complaint by the claimants at the time of publication\".\"The pattern of misconduct the claimants seek to establish is simply not made out.\"Joining the duke in bringing the lawsuit against ANL are:Actors Liz Hurley and Sadie FrostSir Elton John and his husband David FurnishSir Simon Hughes, the former Liberal Democrat MPBaroness Doreen Lawrence, a campaigner whose son Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racist attack in south London in 1993NEIL HALL/EPA/ShutterstockSadie Frost attended the first day of the trial at the High Court on MondayPrince Harry was present in the courtroom on Monday for the first day of the trial, which is expected to last nine weeks.David Sherborne, representing the claimants, quoted the prince in his written submission as saying the papers' alleged activity created \"distrust and suspicion\".He said the \"intrusion\" was \"terrifying\" for his loved ones while \"isolating me\".Sherborne said the alleged unlawful information gathering in the duke's case was related to 14 articles between 2001 and 2013.The Daily Mail's current royal editor Rebecca English was accused of \"obtaining the exact plane seats, flight times and travel plans\" of Prince Harry's then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy in December 2007.Sherborne alleged the information was obtained through private investigator Mike Behr, who was accused of suggesting he could \"plant someone next to her\" on the flight to South Africa.For the publisher, White said English \"strongly denies that she ever used Mr Behr for unlawful information-gathering\", and the allegation was \"unsupported by the evidence before the court\".He said the prince's social circle \"at all material times… was and was known to be a good source of leaks or disclosure of information to the media about what he got up to in his private life.\"He said all the articles \"were sourced entirely legitimately from information variously provided by contacts of the journalists responsible\", including press officers and publicists, freelance journalists, photographers and prior reports.White also said the duke discussed his private life in the media and that information about his life was provided by Palace spokespeople.Sherborne said there had been \"systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" at the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday and that there was \"no way\" that details reported in some articles could have been lawfully obtained.In their joint opening statement, the claimants accused a string of senior Mail and Mail on Sunday journalists of commissioning and using unlawfully gathered information from private investigators.They said they were \"engaged in or complicit in the culture of unlawful information gathering that wrecked the lives of so many\".Sir Elton and Furnish accused ANL of \"stealing\" their son Zachary's birth certificate before they \"had a chance to see it ourselves,\" accusing the publisher of \"invasion of medical details\".White said in written submissions that their claims were \"unsupported by any evidence before the court and utterly baseless\".Mail on Sunday journalist Katie Nicholl was accused of having obtained intimate information about Frost's private life - including the termination of her pregnancy, about which the actor had not even told her mother.Notebooks showed \"Susie\" of ELI, a private investigation firm, provided information on the point, Sherborne said, adding that days later there were payments recorded as \"KATIE NICHOLLS URGENT ENQ\" and \"K NICHOLLS SEARCHES\".Baroness Lawrence said she felt she had been targeted as she sought the truth about her son's murder.She said she felt she \"could not even grieve the injustice of what was happening privately, even for a day\" and that she had been made \"a victim all over again\".Her allegations concern five articles published between 1997 and 2007, written by veteran Daily Mail crime correspondent Stephen Wright.The claims include that he made payments of thousands in cash for \"special contacts re Stephen Lawrence\" and \"special inquiries\", and that he got \"well-known blagger\" Christine Hart to call Baroness Lawrence pretending to be a journalist from the Guardian, as it was believed she would be more likely to speak to her.Baroness Lawrence said she was \"angry that the Mail seem more interested in interrogating me about how I found out what they did to me... then threatening to question me at trial about all this, rather than saying sorry, investigating what it did, and getting at the truth of what happened\".White said the allegations against the reporter were \"denied in their entirety\" and were \"unsupported by the available evidence\".REUTERS/Toby MelvilleThe prince listened to the first day of proceedingsSherborne meanwhile said ANL had kept up a \"hear-no-evil, see-no-evil, speak-no-evil defence\", claiming that during the 2012 Leveson public inquiry - into the culture, practice and ethics of the press - the publisher argued there had been no unlawful activity at all.He said ANL \"knew they had skeletons in their closet\" because the company investigated the use of phone hacking between 2003-05, finding evidence in stories that the technique had been used.ANL has repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them \"lurid\" and \"preposterous\".White said: \"In relation to almost every article alleged to be the product of phone hacking or phone tapping Associated is able to call a witness or witnesses to explain how the article was in fact sourced.\"The lawyer added that \"the pattern of misconduct the claimants seek to establish is simply not made out.\"This is a civil trial, so there is no jury. The judge Mr Justice Nicklin will decide the case on his own.It is Prince Harry's third major court battle accusing newspaper groups of unlawful behaviour.In December 2023, he won 15 claims in his case accusing Mirror Group Newspapers of unlawfully gathering information for stories published about him.In January 2025, the publisher of the Sun newspaper agreed to pay \"substantial damages\" and issued an apology to the prince, over claims of unlawful intrusion into his life.",

    "body": "1 hour agoFergus WalshMedical editorA blood test for more than 50 types of cancer could help speed up diagnosis, according to a new study.Results of a trial in North America show that the test was able to identify a wide range of cancers, of which three-quarters don't have any form of screening programme.More than half the cancers were detected at an early stage, where they are easier to treat and potentially curable.The Galleri test, made by American pharmaceutical firm Grail, can detect fragments of cancerous DNA that have broken off a tumour and are circulating in the blood. It is currently being trialled by the NHS.The trial followed 25,000 adults from the US and Canada over a year, with nearly one in 100 getting a positive result. For 62% of these cases, cancer was later confirmed.  Lead researcher Dr Nima Nabavizadeh, associate professor of radiation medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, said the data showed that the test could \"fundamentally change\" their approach to cancer screening. He explained that it could help detect many types of cancer \"earlier, when the chance of successful treatment or even cure are the greatest\".The test correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative.  When combined with breast, bowel and cervical screening it increased the number of cancers detected overall seven-fold.  Crucially, three-quarters of cancers detected were those which have no screening programme such as ovarian, liver, stomach, bladder and pancreatic cancer.The blood test correctly identified the origin of the cancer in nine out of 10 cases.These impressive results suggest the blood test could eventually have a major role to play in diagnosing cancer earlier.But scientists not involved in the research say more evidence is needed to show whether the blood test reduces deaths from cancer.Clare Turnbull, professor of translational cancer genetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"Data from randomised studies, with mortality as an endpoint, will be absolutely essential to establish whether seemingly earlier-stage detection by Galleri translates into benefits in mortality.\"The topline results are to be released at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Berlin on Saturday, but the full details have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Much will depend on the results of a three-year trial involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, which will be published next year.The NHS has previously said that if the results are successful, it would extend the tests to a further one million people.Sir Harpal Kumar, president of biopharma at Grail called the results \"very compelling\".  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"The vast majority of people who die from cancer do so because we find their cancers too late.\"Many cancers are found when they are \"already very advanced\" he added, explaining that the aim is to \"shift to earlier detection, when we have the chance to use treatments that are much more effective and potentially curative\".But Naser Turabi of Cancer Research UK cautioned that further research is needed to \"avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm\". \"The UK National Screening Committee will \"play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS,\" he added.",

    "body": "10 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentPA MediaPrince Andrew has faced growing pressure over his links with Jeffrey EpsteinPrince Andrew is giving up his titles, including the Duke of York, he has announced in a personal statement.He has been under increasing pressure over his links with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with calls for Buckingham Palace to take action against him.That now seems to have resulted in the prince deciding to voluntarily hand back his titles and to give up membership of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.In his statement he said he continued to \"vigorously deny the accusations against me\".\"In discussion with the King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" said a statement from Prince Andrew.\"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first.\"I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"Andrew's decision to stop using his titles was made in consultation with William, Prince of Wales, as well as the King.He will remain a prince - but will cease to be the Duke of York, a title received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth.Andrew had already ceased to be a \"working royal\" and had lost the use of his HRH title and no longer appeared at official royal events. His role now will be even more diminished.The prince has faced a series of scandals over recent years, including a court case he settled with Virginia Giuffre, questions about his finances and his involvement with an alleged Chinese spy.ReutersPrince Andrew speaks with King Charles at the funeral of Katharine, Duchess of Kent, in September His ex-wife will be known as Sarah Ferguson and no longer Duchess of York, but their daughters will continue to have the title of princess. He is expected to stay in his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, on which he has his own private lease which runs until 2078.Prince Andrew has faced intense scrutiny over his links with disgraced financier Epstein, more recently including questions about when he had really cut off contact.In a now-infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019, Prince Andrew said that he had severed all links with Epstein after they had been photographed together in New York in December 2010.But emails sent in February 2011 later emerged suggesting that he had privately stayed in touch with Epstein, including swapping a message: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!\"There had been growing frustration in Buckingham Palace at the scandals that continued to surround the prince.Next week a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year, will be published, which is likely to cast further attention on Prince Andrew's involvement with her and Epstein.Ms Giuffre claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections.She alleged that Andrew had sex with her at his friend Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London in 2001, when Ms Giuffre was 17 years old.Her memoir describes two other occasions on which she alleges she had sex with Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.Prince Andrew made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him. He denies all the accusations made against him.Members of the public react to Prince Andrew giving up his royal titlesSpeaking to BBC Newsnight following the announcement that Andrew was giving up his titles, Sky Roberts, Ms Giuffre's brother, said the news had brought mixed emotions, but that his late sister \"would be very proud\" of the development.\"We have shed a lot of happy and sad tears today. I think happy because in a lot of ways this vindicates Virginia,\" Mr Roberts said.\"All the years of work that she put in is now coming to some sort of justice,\" he added.Sky also called on the King to \"potentially go ahead and take out the 'Prince' in the Andrew.\"Also speaking to BBC Newsnight, Epstein accuser Haley Robson said it was a \"bittersweet\" moment.Ms Robson said Ms Giuffre \"started this fight and we're going to see it through\", adding that \"I really wish that she could have been here to see all of what she started\".\"Having him [Prince Andrew] step down and be stripped of his titles is something that is long delayed, and it is very appropriate, and kudos to King Charles,\" Ms Robson said.Andrew withdrew from Royal Family events last Christmas after an alleged Chinese spy who he was linked to was named in a High Court judgement.His office said nothing sensitive had ever been discussed with Yang Tengbo, also known as Chris Yang, who became a close advisor on Andrew's business ventures.In 2022, Andrew was repeatedly named in a court dispute between a Turkish millionaire and her former business adviser.There were no suggestions of wrongdoing by the prince, but the court case highlighted the prince as receiving payments in a complex set of financial deals. A gift of £750,000 was returned to the Turkish millionaire by the prince.",

    "body": "Israel's military has confirmed that the latest remains handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza and returned to Israel are those of a dead hostage. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the returned hostage is Eliyahu Margalit, 75, who was killed on 7 October and his body taken into Gaza from Nir Oz kibbutz.His death was announced by Israel in December 2023, a month after his daughter Nili - who was also taken hostage - was released during a temporary truce. Mr Margalit, who was known to his family and friends as Churchill, is the tenth dead hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of a further 18 people have yet to be repatriated. In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum described Mr Margalit as \"a cowboy at heart\" who managed a cattle branch and horse stables at Nir Oz for many years.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement on Friday night that its team had taken \"all possible measures to ensure the deceased are managed with respect\", and that Israeli forensic authorities would identify the remains in Tel Aviv.There has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.On Friday night, the IDF again stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has said it remained committed to the ceasefire, including \"keenness to hand over all remaining corpses\".The Palestinian group accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of impeding its ability to search for hostages' remains by not allowing heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza. It has blamed Israel for making the task of finding bodies difficult, because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble.BBC Verify - Aid group suspends Gaza operations after ceasefireUS plays down claims Hamas is violating ceasefire dealSpeaking on Thursday at a memorial for victims of the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack, Netanyahu said he was \"determined\" to secure the return of all the dead hostages, and that the country would continue to fight terrorism with \"full force\".As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.After Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior Trump advisers said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing.The advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe that Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.While the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,967 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "Chen Ning Yang, Nobel laureate and one of the world's most influential physicists, has died at the age of 103, according to Chinese state media.An obituary released by CCTV cited illness as the cause of death.Yang and fellow theoretical physicist, Lee Tsung-Dao, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their work in parity laws, which led to important discoveries regarding elementary particles - the building blocks of matter. Yang was also a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University and an honorary dean of the Institute for Advanced Study at the institution.Born in 1922 in China's eastern Anhui province, he was the oldest of five children and raised on the campus of Tsinghua University where his father was a professor of mathematics.As a teenager, Yang told his parents: \"One day, I want to win the Nobel Prize.\"He achieved that dream at the age of 35, when his work with Lee studying the law of parity earned them the honour in 1957.The Nobel committee praised \"their penetrating investigation... which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\".Yang received his science degree in 1942 from National Southwest Associated University in Kunming, and later completed a master's degree at Tsinghua University.At the end of the Sino-Japanese War, he travelled to the US on a fellowship from Tsinghua and studied at the University of Chicago, where he worked under Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, inventor of the world's first nuclear reactor.Throughout a prolific career, he worked across all areas of physics, but maintained particular interest in the fields of statistical mechanics and symmetry principles.Yang received the Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in 1957 and was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Princeton University in 1958.Yang married his first wife Chih Li Tu in 1950, with whom he had three children.After Tu's death in 2003, Yang married his second wife Weng Fan, who is more than 50 years his junior.The pair had first met in 1995 when Weng was a student in a physics seminar, and later reconnected in 2004. At the time, Yang called her his \"final blessing from God\".",

    "body": "Donald Trump is the \"only one who can force\" Russian leader Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table over the war in Ukraine, Finland's president has told the BBC.Alexander Stubb also said that Finland would never recognise occupied Crimea as part of Russia, and that he wanted to ensure Ukraine became an EU and hopefully Nato member once the war was over.BBC Radio 4's Today programme spoke to President Stubb ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday, where he told the US president: \"I think we can end this war with your help.\"Meanwhile, Trump said that Putin has agreed to meet face-to-face with him in Hungary.The US leader said on Friday that Putin \"wants to get it ended. I think that President Zelensky wants to get it ended. Now we have to get it done\".Zelensky said in the White House that Ukraine was ready to talk in any format and wanted peace, but argued that Putin needed to be \"pressured\" into ending the war.In August, Trump and Putin met in Alaska for a summit that did not result in a breakthrough, or yield a further meeting involving Zelensky.Stubb said Trump had once asked him - over a game of golf - whether he could trust Putin; and Stubb's answer was no. \"What we need is not so much the power of the carrot to convince Russia to the negotiating table, it's more of the stick that will bring them. \"So you have to force Russia to come to the negotiating table for peace and that's the deal President Trump is trying to make.\"He said Trump \"has been giving the carrot to President Putin, and the carrot was in Alaska, and of course now if you look at the language that he has put forward lately, there has been more stick\".Stubb was optimistic about Trump's ability, saying he believed peace negotiations had probably advanced more in the past eight months during Trump's second term than in the previous three years.In maps: The war-ravaged Ukrainian territoriesRussia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Stubb said Finland would never recognise Crimea, or the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk, as Russian. Russia controls 70% of Donetsk and nearly all of neighbouring Luhansk.He said \"the only ones who can decide on the land issue are the Ukrainians themselves\".\"I want to make sure that Ukraine, when this war is over, retains its independence, retains its sovereignty - in other words becomes an EU member state and hopefully a Nato member - and also maintains its territorial integrity. That is what we are all fighting for right now,\" Stubb said.Trump said in August that there would be \"no going into Nato by Ukraine\" as part of a peace deal.The US president previously floated the idea that there may be some \"land swaps\" in a future peace deal, but then, in September, said Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\".When asked why Trump had apparently changed his tune, Stubb said it was because Russia was not advancing - seizing only 1% of Ukrainian territory in the past 1,000 days. Ukraine had also been able to push back, he said.Trump is 'the only one who can force' Putin to negotiating table, Finland's president tells BBCStubb said Russia's economy - smaller than Italy's - was suffering, with the country's reserves depleted, growth \"pretty much around zero\", and inflation raised to between 10% and 20%.Stubb said economic threats should be used to bring Russia to the table, most importantly giving €200bn (£173bn) worth of frozen Russian assets to Ukraine as a loan that would stay there if Russia did not pay compensation after peace negotiations.He also wanted to see exports of Russian oil and gas to Europe - which have dropped by 80% - cut off. Sanctions could be put on countries that buy Russian oil and gas, he said, in addition to the 19th European sanctions package targeting Russia.Stubb said \"all the strategic games of Putin have been an utter failure\". Russia had been unsuccessful in trying to take over Ukraine, to divide Europe and to split Nato, with two new members - Finland and Sweden - added instead.He said Europe's \"coalition of the willing\" was ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, with the key help in the air, on the seas and with intelligence.But they needed a backstop from the US, specifically in air defences, intelligence and operations, he said.Stubb said he hoped to see some results from a two-phase peace process - the first a ceasefire to stop the killing and the second an extended peace process - \"in coming days and weeks\". \"We'll keep on working at it. The key is to engage and try to find solutions and be pragmatic. In foreign policy you always have to deal with the world as it is, not what you would wish it to be, but let's do peace.\"",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identify theft. In a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"The former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023. Santos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people - including from his own family members, was serving his sentence at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey. He was released on Friday night, US media report.\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.In April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"He reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"Prosecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.In his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.Trump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old. \"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month. Santos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.From there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.He was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.A report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.Santos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.Earlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned. The letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"He wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions. \"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. \"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"Santos began serving his sentence in July.Trump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.In May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.He also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.Commutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMost papers lead with Prince Andrew giving up his titles, including the Duke of York. The Times writes that the decision marks a \"fall from grace\" over his links to the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and alleged links to a Chinese spy.Prince Andrew will retain the title of a prince because, as the son of a monarch, it is his \"birthright\", the Daily Express reports. His former wife Sarah Ferguson will no longer be the Duchess of York. In his statement, Prince Andrew wrote that he had agreed to stop using his titles because he had \"always put my duty to my family and country first\", the Daily Telegraph reports. King Charles III is said to be \"glad\" about the outcome, the paper reports.\"Andrew falls on his sword\" is the headline for the Daily Mail, which reports that Prince Andrew's decision came after \"intense pressure\" from the King. The prince will also be stepping down from membership of the Order of the Garter, which the paper describes as the country's \"most ancient order of chivalry\".\"Banned old Duke of York\" is the Daily Star's take. The paper says reports suggest the decision comes after the King reached \"tipping point\" over Prince Andrew's involvement with Epstein.The Sun also splashes its front page with the same headline, reporting that the Prince of Wales was also involved in telling Prince Andrew to give up his titles.The i weekend says that while Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson will lose their titles, their daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie are unaffected. The paper reports that despite the move, a private lease agreement with the Crown Estate means the prince can stay in residence at Royal Lodge in Windsor.The Financial Times leads with the latest meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss ending the Ukraine war. It marks the pair's third meeting this year and comes a day after Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The paper reports that Zelensky appealed to Trump to provide Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, saying the US leader \"now has a big chance to finish this war\".Chancellor Rachel Reeves says she \"can't leave welfare untouched\" as the Treasury is considering axing up to £1bn in tax breaks for cars for disabled people, reports the Guardian. When asked about benefits, the paper quotes an interview Reeves gave to Channel 4 on Friday, saying, \"We have to do reform in the right way and take people with us\".Finally, the Daily Mirror teases an exclusive interview with former England footballer Paul Gascoigne on his struggle with alcohol addiction.Prince Andrew features on most of the front pages, after announcing he’ll give up his titles, including the Duke of York. \"Fall from grace\" says the Times. The Daily Mirror calls it a \"royal bombshell\". The i Weekend says Buckingham Palace has sent Prince Andrew into \"exile\", as it tries to end the \"distractions\" amid the continuing controversy about his links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \"Andrew falls on his sword\" says the Daily Mail, which reports that the prince's decision came after \"intense pressure\" from the King. Both the Sun and the Daily Star use the headline \"the banned old Duke of York\".The Daily Telegraph reports the King is said to be \"glad\" Prince Andrew has agreed to give up his titles. The Guardian says the agreement was made after high-level meetings at Buckingham Palace as aides were said to have finally reached a \"tipping point\". The papers also report that the prince used his announcement to say he \"vigorously\" denies the allegations against him.The Daily Express welcomes the news in its leader column saying \"common sense has prevailed\". The Daily Mail says it was a \"long time coming\" but the prince has \"finally done the right thing\". The Daily Mirror notes that it took pressure from the King to push him \"grudgingly into action\". The papers sums up by saying \"what a final and apt humiliation\".According to the Sun, the chancellor is looking at raising taxes on electric vehicle drivers. The paper says proposals are being drawn up as EV drivers do not pay fuel duty, but still contribute to congestion and wear and tear on the roads. The Treasury is said to be keen to ensure all drivers pay their \"fair share\", but no decisions have been made yet.And the Daily Telegraph reports that fishing is to be offered on the school curriculum for the first time. Students are going to be able to study a course called Angling and Countryside as an equivalent to GCSE, BTEC and A-Levels. The chief executive of the Angling Trust, Jamie Cook, tells the paper the qualification will offer a route into the natural world for young people.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "How and when to see the Orionids meteor showerImage source, Getty ImagesByShireen Jordan BBC WeatherPrepare yourself for a fireworks spectacle this coming week as the Orionids grace our night sky with the peak of their annual display.The Orionid meteor shower happens 60 miles up in space and is thought to be one of the most impressive displays of the celestial calendar. They are known for being bright and fast and will be visible between until 7 November, peaking for about seven days around the 22 October.The best viewing conditions will be between midnight and dawn.What are the Orionids?Image source, Chris HornbyImage caption, Meteors are often referred to as shooting starsThe Orionids are fast-moving meteors travelling at a speed of around 41 miles per second.They have long streaks of light and originate from the well- known Halley's Comet as it follows its orbit around the Sun. The comet itself only passes by Earth roughly every 75 years, with the next date expected to be the summer of 2061.As Earth passes through debris left by the comet, tiny particles the size of a grain of sand burn up in our atmosphere and leave a streak of light through the sky.  They can appear faint but they leave a distinctive light trail. Larger meteors will produce bright trails. Sometimes meteors can even appear brighter than the planet Venus – these are called fireballs, external.How can I watch the Orionids?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Meteor showers are usually named after a star or constellation that is close to where the meteors appear to originate in the skyThe radiant is the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate, and for the Orionids this is the constellation of Orion.Orion rises in the east after midnight, just to the north of its red-tinged star Betelgeuse. To track down Orion, external, look out for a line of three bright stars, close together, known as Orion's Belt.The quality of the display is measured by how many meteors are visible every hour - known as the zenithal hourly rate. There could be around 15 meteors an hour during the peak of the Orionids around the 22 October travelling at speeds of 148,000mph (238,000km/h).For the best viewing conditions, find a dark spot, away from city lights after midnight with an unobstructed wide, open sky. Let your eyes adjust to the dark and look towards the constellation of Orion. You will not need binoculars or a telescope as the shower will be visible to the naked eye.Will the skies be clear?The arrival of low cloud this week means that opportunities for viewing the shower may be limited.Expect areas of fog, showers interspersed with brighter spells and some thunderstorms. As areas of low pressure continue to sweep in from the Atlantic, there is the potential for the arrival of stormy weather mid-week, which may make it too dangerous to spend any length of time outdoors.But as the peak is just after the new Moon on 21 October, a viewing window may be possible for some when the cloud breaks with no moonlight pollution.Keep across your local forecast on the BBC Weather website or app.",

    "body": "Every week it seems US financial markets are hit by another bout of fear. The latest worries spread this week from the banking sector in the US, after two regional lenders warned they would be hit by losses from alleged fraud. But before that, markets swooned over signs of rekindled US-China tensions, as the two superpowers face off over tariffs, advanced technology and access to rare earths.The bankruptcies of car parts supplier First Brands and subprime car lender Tricolor acted as a trigger for nervous chatter in September.    Over the last month, US shares, which had been climbing since their tariff-induced rout in April, have flattened.But in many ways the market swings so far - down roughly 3% at the steepest - are not unusual. Zooming out, the major indexes have still posted gains since the start of the year, with the S&P 500 up roughly 13%. That's smaller than 2024 but still solid. \"The market has done surprisingly well so far this year ... driven by an improvement in corporate profits and the enthusiasm surrounding AI,\" says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The resilience of the stock market is, ironically, exactly what is driving some of the jitters.Put simply, when set against other standard metrics like profits, share prices in the US are very high. Meanwhile, concerns about a possible bubble emerging in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry have generated a steady undercurrent of talk since the start of the year - discussions that have ramped up as analysts struggle to see how the vast sums of money the biggest players are throwing at one another all fit together.The Bank of England warned recently of \"stretched valuations\" and rising risk of a \"sharp market correction\". Those concerns were echoed in remarks from JP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon and to some extent US central bank chair Jerome Powell.The International Monetary Fund was the latest to chime in this week.\"Markets appear complacent as the ground shifts,\" it said in its financial stability report, which noted risks from trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty and rising sovereign indebtedness.James Reilley, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, said the market falls triggered by the regional banks were a sign of investors alert to risk and moving quickly to reduce exposure amid uncertainty about whether the losses were indicative of wider issues.But he said the brief nature of the drops showed how quickly such worries could clear.Many investors remain optimistic, with analysts at firms such as Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo in recent weeks boosting their forecasts for where the S&P 500 might climb by the end of the year. David Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said he thought a sharp sell-off was unlikely at a time when growth in the US remains solid and the US central bank is lowering borrowing costs. He is expecting the S&P 500 to end the year hovering around 6,900 points, about 4% higher than where it sits on Friday.While he acknowledged the troubles popping up at banks, he noted that the lenders involved have alleged fraud. He said the overall picture, when looking at default levels, appears healthy, and he saw little risk that demand for AI would suddenly decline, puncturing valuations. \"I'm not saying we're in a bubble. I'm not saying we're not in a bubble. The question is what's going to drive the downside,\" he said. \"Things don't usually spontaneously decline.\" A typical bull market - when shares are rising - lasts about four and a half years, said Mr Stovall. With inflation still sticky, and investors wary of events in Washington, like the government shutdown and Trump administration's efforts to influence the US central bank, this year's market rally has been \"unloved\", said Mr Stovall.On the other hand, he noted: \"It's just a matter of time. Corrections and bear markets have not been repealed. They might simply be delayed.\"",

    "body": "33 minutes agoBernd Debusmannat the White House andJohn SudworthKyivPresident Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have come away empty-handed from a White House meeting after US President Donald Trump indicated he was not ready to supply sought-after Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.Zelensky said after the cordial bilateral that he and Trump had talked about long-range missiles, but decided not to make statements on the issue \"because the United States does not want an escalation\".Following the meeting, Trump took to social media to call for Kyiv and Moscow to \"stop where they are\" and end the war.The Trump-Zelensky meeting came a day after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone and agreed to meet him in Hungary soon.Zelensky believes using Tomahawks to strike at Russian oil and energy facilities would severely weaken Putin's war economy. While Trump did not rule it out, his tone at the White House on Friday was non-committal. \"Hopefully they won't need it, hopefully we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks,\" the US president said, adding: \"I think we're fairly close to that.\"He described the weapons as \"a big deal\" and said that the US needed them for its own defence. He also said that supplying Tomahawks to Ukraine could mean a further escalation in the conflict, but that discussions about sending them would continue. Asked by the BBC if the Tomahawks had prompted Putin to meet Trump, the US president said: \"The threat of that [the missiles] is good, but the threat of that is always there.\"The Ukrainian leader suggested his country could offer drones in exchange for the Tomahawks, prompting smiles and nodding from Trump.Zelensky also complimented Trump on his role in securing the first phase of a peace deal in the Middle East, suggesting the US leader could build on that momentum to help end Russia's war in Ukraine. After the meeting, Zelensky was asked by a reporter outside the White House if he thought Putin wanted a deal or was just buying time with the planned meeting with Trump in Budapest. \"I don't know,\" he said, adding that the prospect of Ukraine having Tomahawks had caused Russia to be \"afraid because it is a strong weapon\".Asked if he was leaving Washington more optimistic that Ukraine would get the Tomahawks, he said: \"I am realistic.\"The Ukrainian leader also appeared to suggest he would be amenable to Trump's suggestion of stopping the war along the current front line.\"We have to stop where we are, he is right, the president is right,\" Zelensky said. He added that the step after that would be \"to speak\". He later posted on X, saying that he had called European leaders to share details of the meeting with Trump, adding that the \"main priority now is to protect as many lives as possible, guarantee security for Ukraine, and strengthen all of us in Europe.\"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the call with European leaders was \"productive\" and promised that \"the UK will continue to send humanitarian aid and military support\".While Trump had shown an openness to the idea of selling the Tomahawks in recent days, Putin warned that such a move would further strain the US-Russian relationship.On Thursday, Trump said \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks soon in Hungary - although no date has been set.Asked by a reporter on Friday if he was concerned Putin might be playing for time by agreeing to a new summit, Trump said: \"I am.\"\"But I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well. So, it's possible, a little time, it's alright. But I think that I'm pretty good at this stuff. I think that he wants to make a deal,\" he said.When asked by another reporter whether Zelensky would be involved in the prospective talks in Budapest, Trump - who was sat beside the Ukrainian president  said there was \"bad blood\" between Putin and Zelenksy. \"We want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" Trump said. \"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated.\" He added that the three leaders \"have to get together\". The US president said his call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow would meet next week.Trump had hoped a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August would help convince Putin to enter into comprehensive peace talks to end the war, but that meeting failed to produce a decisive breakthrough.They spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.Back in Ukraine, the BBC spoke on Friday to a couple repairing the small store they own in a suburb of Kyiv, after it was obliterated by Russian missiles last month.When the store-owner, Volodymyr, was asked about Trump's forthcoming summit meeting with Putin, he began to say: \"We appreciate all support\".But he stepped away as tears welled up in his eyes. After a long pause, he composed himself and started again.\"Truth and democracy will win, and all the terrorism and evil will disappear,\" he said. \"We just want to live, we don't want to give up, we just want them to leave us alone.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentGetty ImagesAfter so many scandals, Prince Andrew has given up the use of his titles and honours.He can no longer sign off as the Duke of York, or put \"KG\", a Knight of the Garter, after his name, with a flourish of medieval chivalry. The Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh are also scratched off his list of titles, with \"Andrew Inverness\" a name he'd sometimes used in his business dealings.But what's caused this sudden announcement? Particularly as this dramatic move, removing the remaining vestiges of his royal life, comes with an assertion of his innocence and that he continued to \"vigorously deny the accusations against me\".PA MediaPrince Andrew will no longer be at the Order of the Garter ceremoniesPrince Andrew has voluntarily given up the use of his titles - but he was clearly under pressure to jump before he was pushed.This way, the changes in his status are kept in-house and there doesn't have to be the intervention of Parliament, which would have needed to legislate to take away his title as Duke of York.That would have been messy, but the Palace was already sending signals it was prepared to take action, and it was confident that Parliament, and popular opinion, would have supported such a change.Allowing Andrew to voluntarily give up his titles, which theoretically remain in place, gave him a way out, still holding on to a little of the disappearing vapour trail of his pride.But it's no secret that Buckingham Palace was exasperated with the scandals surrounding Prince Andrew and what a royal source calls the \"constant parade of headlines\". He was one of their \"Dukes of Hazard\" that kept making news for all the wrong reasons.Questions about Andrew's links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were drowning out the work of the rest of the Royal Family. That was on top of unanswered questions about Andrew's finances and his connections to an alleged Chinese spy.ReutersPrince Andrew and King Charles at the funeral of the Duchess of Kent last monthNext week will see a historic state visit by the King and Queen to meet Pope Leo at the Vatican, and there was a deep irritation that such a solemn occasion was going to be overshadowed by lurid stories about Andrew and Epstein.According to royal sources, a \"tipping point\" had been reached and something had to be done. Arguably that should have happened earlier. But that would also have meant the Palace publicly accepting that it had a responsibility for Prince Andrew, when it had so long argued that as a \"non-working royal\", his problems were his own to resolve.But this latest move shows a recognition that even if Andrew isn't a royal responsibility, it's still their reputation he's been damaging.What added to the sense of this no longer being a tenable position was an email published last weekend that showed Prince Andrew had stayed in touch with Epstein longer than he had claimed in his BBC Newsnight interview.Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight in 2019A royal source said this was a significantly different moment when there were such clear \"fault lines\" exposed in Prince Andrew's version of events.Curiously, the same email had been partially published in January - again showing that Andrew had not cut ties to Epstein when he had claimed - but this time in October the impact has been like the pebble that has started an avalanche.It followed a similar awkwardness for Sarah Ferguson, where a private email contradicted her own public claims to have cut links with Epstein.And it added to the pressure from extracts published from a posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, the Epstein victim who had reached a financial settlement with Prince Andrew, and had earlier this year taken her own life.Getty ImagesVirginia Giuffre's memoir raises more questions about Andrew and EpsteinMs Giuffre's memoir, to be published next week, once again casts Andrew into toxic associations with Epstein.And the book's accusation that Prince Andrew was \"entitled\" echoed the title of a recent biography of Prince Andrew, by Andrew Lownie, that took another wrecking ball to his reputation.It's been a landslide of bad news, month after month, that showed no sign of losing momentum. He'd become the disastrous football manager, or the damaged political leader, who had no obvious way of being removed. Particularly when it was like a football manager whose brother was the chairman.There's always a tension between protecting an institution and a reluctance to remove the individuals within it. Even more so when the institution is also a family. It's where the Godfather movies meet the Crown.But something had to be done, and in the end, Andrew has handed back the keys to his royal life and walked away. More could still emerge in the United States in the trawling of documents related to Epstein.Ominously for Prince Andrew, among those quick to respond on Friday evening was the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee that has been pushing for the release of Epstein material.Robert Garcia, whose colleagues recently revealed documents showing an \"Andrew\" getting massages on Epstein's private jet, said: \"His decision to give up his royal titles is long overdue.\"\"We know rich and powerful men used their money and power to abuse girls and young women, and to shield themselves from justice. Prince Andrew's decision is just the beginning in the committee's work to deliver justice for the survivors.\"Prince Andrew has always denied wrongdoing but this has become a global story.When US President Trump arrived for his state visit, it was a picture of Andrew and Epstein that protesters projected on to the walls of Windsor Castle.Prince Andrew's decision to step away from his remaining titles will also mean he stays in step with his ex-wife, who is no longer the Duchess of York. They are back to where they began when they first met - as Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.They still live together and as Prince Andrew has his own long lease on Royal Lodge, they'll carry on there as before. The King had already financially cut off Prince Andrew, so there isn't any change there, he'll have to find his own funding.But by voluntarily stepping back, rather than being stripped of their honours, it means that their daughters will carry on with the titles of princess.Prince Andrew won't be at the royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham this year. And the guessing game about seeing him at the Order of the Garter parade won't happen again.But are the questions about his conduct really over?",

    "body": "'Appropriate and unambiguous': White House defends Trump over middle-finger gesture at hecklerThe White House has defended US President Donald Trump after he aimed an offensive gesture at a heckler during his appearance at a Ford factory in Detroit on Tuesday.Footage of the incident published by TMZ appears to show the president responding to a man who shouted at him from afar.The White House said: \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"The heckler has been suspended by Ford, the United Auto Workers union told the BBC's US partner, CBS News.A Ford spokesperson told CBS: \"One of our core values is respect and we don't condone anyone saying anything inappropriate like that within our facilities. \"When that happens, we have a process to deal with it but we don't get into specific personnel matters.\"According to the subtitles provided by TMZ, the heckler called Trump a \"paedophile protector\". In the clip, which shows Trump from a distance, the president can be seen speaking back at the heckler, allegedly mouthing an expletive as well as using a middle-finger gesture.  A man who spoke to The Washington Post, named TJ Sabula, reportedly identified himself as the man who shouted, saying he had \"no regrets\". He allegedly said he meant his remarks in reference to Trump's handling of the Epstein files. Trump has faced pressure for more transparency on what was uncovered by federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender.Trump signed a law that compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release all the files that it held on Epstein by 19 December, although only a fraction of the files have so far been made public.Trump was once friends with Epstein before they fell out, which Trump says was years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Trump was in Detroit on Tuesday to give a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. The president's public use of expletives have attracted headlines in the past - for example, when discussing the relationship between Iran and Israel last June.His predecessor Joe Biden also caused controversy for aiming an expletive at a worker during his own visit to a factory in Detroit while on the campaign trail in 2020.

    "body": "31 minutes agoTinshui YeungTSGT Scott Reed, USAFThe US is reducing the number of personnel at its Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News, which officials have called a \"precautionary measure\".A statement by the Qatar government said the step was being taken \"in response to the current regional tensions\".This comes after US President Donald Trump said the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if the authorities execute anti-government protesters. Iran says it will retaliate if attacked by the US.According to rights groups, more than 2,400 anti-government demonstrators have been killed in the recent violent crackdown by the Iranian authorities.The Qatar government said that it would continue to \"implement all necessary measures to safeguard the security and safety of its citizens and residents as a top priority, including actions related to the protection of critical infrastructure and military facilities\".Iran launched a missile attack on the Al-Udeid air base in June in what it said was retaliation for US strikes against its nuclear sites.The 24-hectare (59-acre) Al-Udeid air base in the desert outside the Qatari capital Doha is the largest US military base in the Middle East.It is also home to the US military's headquarters for all air operations in the region, housing about 10,000 personnel. Some UK military personnel also serve there on rotation.Citing diplomats, the Reuters news agency reported that while some personnel had been told to leave the base, there was no immediate sign of large numbers of troops being bussed out like in the hours before the Iranian strike last year.A senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Donald Trump on Wednesday that the June attack had demonstrated Iran's ability to respond to any attack.\"It would certainly help create a real understanding of Iran's will and capability to respond to any attack,\" Ali Shamkhani wrote in a post on X.The US Mission to Saudi Arabia also on Wednesday advised its personnel and citizens to \"exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region\".The US has been threatening to intervene in Iran over the killing of protesters. On Tuesday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Iranian authorities would \"pay a big price\" for the killings, and urged people to \"keep protesting\".He has also said that Iranian leaders had called him and that \"they want to negotiate\" but that the US \"may have to act before a meeting\".Iran's government has accused the US of seeking to \"manufacture a pretext for military intervention\", with the parliament speaker warning that if the US attacked, both Israeli and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets.The latest protests in Iran began at the end of December following the collapse of the currency and as the country deals with soaring living costs. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,403 protesters, as well as 12 children, despite an internet blackout. More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, the group also reported.",

    "body": "Ten British \"far-right activists\" have been banned from France after engaging in actions to stop migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, the French interior ministry said on Wednesday.It said the activists, who belonged to a group called Raise the Colours, had been searching for and destroying small boats along France's northern coast, and were involved in \"propaganda activity\".Authorities have not released their identities. BBC News has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment.In a statement, Raise the Colours said it had always maintained that its activities must remain peaceful and within the law and it \"does not support violence or any unlawful activity\".The ministry said it became aware of the group's actions in December 2025 which were likely to cause \"serious disturbances to public order\".Their efforts were \"aimed at the British public, called upon to strengthen the ranks of the movement to put an end to the migratory phenomenon\", the ministry said.The 10 British nationals are prohibited from entering and residing in France.French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said in a post on X that France's \"rule of law is non-negotiable; actions that are violent in nature or incite hatred have no place on our territory\".Raise the Colours said it had not received any formal notification of France's measure but understood the ban was against \"specific individuals, rather than the organisation as a whole\".The group described itself as a \"grassroots movement for unity and patriotism\" involved in a UK flag-raising campaign and that it had documented events in northern France around \"illegal Channel crossings\".Its website stated that it did not support \"vigilante behaviour, unauthorised activity, or attempts by individuals to take the law into their own hands\".Home Office figures show that 41,472 migrants crossed the Channel in 2025, a 13% rise from 2024. It is the highest number since 2022, when nearly 46,000 migrants crossed.Between 1 January and 5 January 2026, a total of 32 people crossed the English Channel by small boat from France.Since last year, a social media account called Raise the Colours has been circulating videos of its activities in France.Small boat crossings have become the most common way for people to be detected entering the UK illegally since 2020.In November, following months of pressure from the UK, France agreed to start intercepting small boats in the Channel.",

    "body": "You must have heard of Dubai chocolate: the sticky, indulgent confectionary filled with pistachio cream, tahini and shreds of knafeh pastry, which has become a global sensation.Now the decadent bar has inspired South Korea's latest dessert craze. The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market.Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow.Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported.This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram.While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. \"Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand,\" a company representative told Yonhap News.So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported.Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year.Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. \"I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking,\" wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily.Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are.\"It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours,\" food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily.

    "body": "17 minutes agoFaisal IslamEconomics editor\"Build it from the north\" was the cry from transport experts for years as tens of billions of pounds were channelled into projects in the south east, London, and even HS2's viaducts, verges, and bat tunnels in the home counties.The wide-ranging Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) plan is not just about rail expansion to realise the potential of the \"untapped goldmine of the North of England\" — although that is a big part of it.In the 2030s, it will see a new high speed line between Liverpool and Manchester, and later a line between Birmingham and Manchester to replace the cancelled leg of the HS2 project.As it seeks to right a long history of cross-party overpromising and under-delivery, the infrastructure plans unveiled on Tuesday are central to the political challenge facing Labour and its hopes of reviving economic growth.As well as championing HS2, former Chancellor George Osborne in 2015 pronounced in an old train shed near Old Trafford that the newly-elected majority Conservative government would roll out a high speed rail line across Labour's northern heartlands.Boris Johnson, elected on a pledge to \"level up\" northern England, latched onto the idea after winning a majority in 2019.But the political consensus behind the rail project was broken in 2023 by Rishi Sunak, who scrapped the northern leg of HS2 and left NPR alive in accounting terms only.Rail insiders said it had not even reached the \"crayons on a map\" stage.After winning a massive majority rooted in northern England, a nervous Labour government kicked a decision on NPR into the long grass.On Tuesday, however, its big decision finally came.Sources in Manchester suspect it was an upcoming headline on the use of powers over HS2 land along this route that forced the government's hand in recommitting to a plan of some sort.What we are left with includes Manchester Airport becoming the most connected airport outside London with high speed. Better connections from Liverpool to Manchester and on to Leeds and Hull could also help create even more economic growth than the vital Oxford to Cambridge link currently being constructed.The timing is crucial. Manchester's council leader has warned the government the cancellation of HS2 was starting to see long-term investment in office space and regeneration shifted to Birmingham instead.Buildings that take a decade to open need at least the outline of a plan for connectivity, even if passengers won't see trains for a decade and a half.HS2's entire premise was \"for the north\", but its budget was blown on overspecified beautified lines in the south, so much so that it will never actually reach the north. It is effectively an extension of the London Tube to Birmingham.What has changed since 2015 is that Greater Manchester is now the fastest growing city in the UK. It boasts two Premier League big beasts, a teeming music scene, and has even snaffled the Brit awards. Manchester also has designs on a World Cup Final in 2035 and is rumoured to be mulling an Olympic bid.The difference in the government's plans this time, it argues, is that the planning has come first. There is a strategy in the sequencing of lines. The costs of the line will be cheaper as they will not be built to HS2 specifications. They have actively decided to go for a pricier line via the airport because of the growth impact. There is almost political consensus here.But there are pitfalls and mined areas ahead, quite literally.Some of the NPR route is over old unmapped mining areas, especially the Cheshire salt mines. No one is quite sure what lies beneath the green vistas which will be replaced by high speed rail.It is also quite the political junction. It delivers a win to Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who held out until this week on agreeing the deal, potentially providing Sir Keir Starmer some breathing room.Tuesday's move assuages what had been growing frustration at the lack of a big picture vision from the Labour government.And Burnham's people say that, as he weighs a leadership challenge after May's local elections, he is genuinely enjoying running booming Manchester.As interesting is the Reform factor. To some surprise, the insurgent party's leadership backed scrapping the London to Liverpool plan, though it would have supported an underground station in Greater Manchester.Deputy leader Richard Tice told contractors \"not to bother\" bidding for contracts, which a prospective Farage-Tice government would scrap.Labour's northern leaders implored the government to seize what they saw as an opportunity to push Reform back and appeal to northern England's pride in its infrastructure and concern about the money always found for projects \"down south\". It may be another reason for this green light.The chancellor says it is the most important decision she has made and it needed time to get right. It's going to take time to see a line, a train, or even a passenger. But for the long suffering rail commuters of the historic pioneering routes of northern England, there may be new tunnels, and there may be light in them too.It's a green signal, if not quite full speed ahead.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJemma CrewBusiness reporterPA MediaTGI Fridays has closed 16 of its UK restaurants, putting 456 employees out of work.The American-inspired casual dining chain's remaining 33 restaurants will continue to operate after the business was sold in a rescue deal.Interpath was appointed as administrator to Liberty Bar and Restaurant group, which managed the operations of TGI Fridays' UK restaurants, on Tuesday.TGI Fridays' business and assets were immediately sold to a company owned by Sugarloaf, the manager of the global TGI Fridays brand. Some 1,384 jobs were safeguarded in the deal, administrators said.  Phil Broad, TGI Fridays' Global President, said: \"We have been working closely to explore all available options for securing the long-term future of TGI Fridays in the UK, and believe that this is the best outcome for the business, preserves jobs, and offers a strong platform for success and growth.\"Ryan Grant, managing director at Interpath and joint administrator, said: \"We are pleased to have been able to secure this transaction which will see this well-known brand continue to trade across the UK. \"While these have been difficult times for hospitality operators generally, this marks a pivotal step in TGI Fridays' wider turnaround plan, putting in place stable foundations upon which it can begin to move forward.\"The 16 TGI Fridays sites that closed immediately are:- Ashton Under Lyne, Greater Manchester- Doncaster, South Yorkshire- Staines, Surrey- Stevenage, Hertfordshire- Walsall, West Midlands- Bournemouth, Dorset- Telford, Shropshire- Reading, Berkshire- Coventry, Warwickshire- Edinburgh, Scotland- Crawley, West Sussex- Aberdeen Beach, Scotland- Nottingham, Nottinghamshire- Sheffield, South Yorkshire- Stratford, Greater London- Braintree, EssexOver summer 2025, casual and fast-food restaurants saw a 6% drop in customers compared to the previous summer, according to research from Worldpanel by Numerator.In December, trade body UKHospitality warned the hospitality sector could lose a further 100,000 workers as a result of the Autumn Budget.The government has said it is \"protecting pubs, restaurants and cafés with the Budget's £4.3bn support package\".Last month, the High Street food chain Leon said it will close 20 restaurants and cut jobs as part of a major restructure.Its co-founder said he believed the company had drifted from its core values under EG and Asda's leadership, and also cited internal challenges, changing work patterns driven by the Covid pandemic and tax increases – all of which have affected the broader hospitality sector.Leon's administration process comes after Pizza Hut's UK operator DC London Pie announced it was closing 68 restaurants and 11 delivery sites in October, making more than 1,200 workers redundant.Administrators said DC London Pie had been hit by a combination of \"challenging trading conditions and increased costs\", including \"tax-related obligations\".",

    "body": "39 minutes agoBrian Farmer,at the Old Bailey, LondonandAlice Cunningham,SuffolkSuffolk serial killer Steve Wright has been charged with murdering a 17-year-old girl more than 25 years ago, it can be reported.Victoria Hall's body was found five days after a night out in Felixstowe in September 1999.Wright, 67, who is already serving a whole life jail sentence, denies killing her and is due to stand trial next month. At a hearing at the Old Bailey in London, the judge has ruled a jury can be made aware of Wright's previous convictions for the murder of five women who worked as prostitutes in the Ipswich area in 2006.Victoria had been on a night out at the Bandbox nightclub on Felixstowe seafront and was last seen in the early hours of Sunday, 19 September, 1999, near her home in the neighbouring village of Trimley St Mary. She was reported missing and her naked body was found five days later about 20 miles (32km) away in a ditch in Creeting St Peter, near Stowmarket.Wright, formerly of London Road in Ipswich, is also charged with kidnapping Victoria and the attempted kidnap of a 22-year-old woman that same weekend.In 2008, Wright was convicted of murdering Tania Nicol, Gemma Adams, Anneli Alderton, Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls after a trial at Ipswich Crown Court.He was given a whole life order, which means he will never be released from jail. Wright was charged with Victoria's murder in 2024.Juries are not usually told about a defendant's previous criminal convictions.Court reporting restrictions meant the media had not been able to mention the 2006 killings until this latest court ruling in central London. Wright appeared at the Old Bailey by video link from HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.He was wearing a white, short-sleeved T-shirt and grey tracksuit bottoms and was sitting behind a desk.He could be seen using crutches at the start of the hearing. His trial is due to begin at the same court on 2 February. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoMatt ChorleyPresenter, BBC Radio 5 LiveGetty ImagesPolitics is a game of compromise. Labour MPs know that to get the bits they like, they might have to put up, possibly even publicly defend, the things they don't. But another government U-turn, this time on digital ID for right-to-work checks, has left them privately wondering if they should bother in future.As one North East MP, elected for the first time in 2024, put it, Labour MPs now have \"a choice between loyalty and dignity\". Do they go out and defend a government policy in the media, in the Commons and to their constituents, or risk looking \"daft\" when Downing Street U-turns on it.Another publicly loyal new MP said: \"There's no point defending anything remotely difficult the leadership announces, because it's likely to be rowed back on. Whatever the merits of individual policy, we're in a position where we can't ever say for sure it'll happen. Absolutely ridiculous.\"For my show on BBC Radio 5 Live, I have been in touch with dozens of Labour MPs and ministers since it was announced that Sir Keir Starmer was dropping plans to force people to sign up to its digital ID scheme in order to prove their right to work in the UK.Some were disappointed that an idea they supported had been ditched. \"I'm probably one of the few Labour MPs who supports digital ID,\" said one. \"I think we sold it badly though from start.\"Another said: \"Why are we U-turning on this? Pick what you think is right and argue for it. It's all 12-dimensional chess. We're too simple to understand. Problem is everyone else is too.\"Others were pleased. A minister said: \"It was unpopular and expensive. It should never have been announced without being costed first.\" A backbencher added: \"It was clearly meant to appeal to Reform-leaning voters, but in fact had the opposite effect.\" 'Dead on arrival'A steadfast few tried to insist that this change of heart was just the business of government. \"They were still consulting,\" said one loyalist. \"Changing things with public mood is how consultation works. It's all fine.\"This, it has to be said, is a minority view. Instead, there is widespread anger and dismay at the handling of the policy reversal, coming hot on the heels of others related to business rate rises for pubs and inheritance tax changes for farmers.One minister who supported digital ID told me: \"Sadly it was dead on arrival due to the utterly hopeless and half-hearted way in which it was announced. No attempt to prepare the ground, no out-riders, no strategy for winning the argument.\"It almost felt like a reluctant concession rather than a front-foot policy or campaign. Arguably the worst bit of comms since July '24, and that's a very crowded field…This really was a case study in how not to do politics.\"'Inevitable'Long-serving Labour MPs blamed the lack of long-term planning by the prime minister's team. \"The problem comes from having had no deeply considered policy programme that the government came in to implement. They are constantly chasing after policies and trying to implement them without stress-testing them against backbenchers and the public.\"Another said: \"This one was inevitable. Policy making on the hoof inevitably sees the horse fall at the first fence.\"So what now? Several MPs highlighted recent comments from Wes Streeting, the health secretary seen by some as a frontrunner to replace Sir Keir, who said the government should try to \"get it right first time\" hours before the ID about-turn.Some went further, and brought up the prospect of the next change being a change in leader. \"The PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] are utterly sick to death of being marched up the hill,\" said one. \"They're trying to clear the decks to reset, but we all know the reset that's now required.\"Another furious MP was disappointed that it was Sir Keir himself who had ditched the policy: \"I'd hoped that the PM's successor would do it to signal a change of direction. We'll have to find something else…\"Listen to Matt Chorley live from Westminster, weekdays from 14.00 on BBC Radio 5 Live. ",

    "body": "China announced record export numbers for 2025, a year when US President Donald Trump's tariffs and trade policy caused turmoil in the global economy.Beijing on Wednesday reported the world's largest-ever trade surplus - the value of goods and services sold overseas compared to its imports - at $1.19tn (£890bn).It's the first time China's full-year trade surplus has passed $1tn, beating 2024's record figure of $993bn.China's monthly export surpluses passed $100bn seven times last year - a sign that Trump's tariff campaign have barely affected its overall trade with the rest of the world.Trade with the US did weaken, but this was made up for by a rise in Chinese exports elsewhere, especially to South East Asia, Africa and Latin America.Wang Jun, the deputy director of China's customs, said during a press conference on Wednesday that the figures are \"extraordinary and hard-won\" given the \"profound changes\" and challenges in global trade.He noted a rise in exports of green technology, artificial intelligence-related products and robotics.The huge surplus can be explained by strong overseas demand for Chinese goods as trade with global partners including South Asian countries and others in Africa and Europe grew, as well as a weak domestic market.China's economy has been weighed by a property crisis and rising debt, which has made businesses more hesitant to invest and consumers cautious about spending.As a result, there is less of a need to import goods, and imports rose by just 0.5%, according to the new figures.Meanwhile, a weaker yuan, a strong supply of goods and inflation in Western countries have also made Chinese exports more attractive.The results are a \"mixed blessing\" for Beijing, said trade policy analyst Deborah Elms from the Hinrich Foundation.China has benefited from sales and more jobs created from its business abroad, but its goods could face \"greater scrutiny\" from foreign markets that are under pressure to compete with its products, she said.China's success will likely continue in 2026 as Chinese goods and services become more deeply entrenched into global businesses, said Elms.These latest figures will be seen in Beijing as a sign that China has customers all around the world, besides the US, but Wang warned that China faces an uncertain external environment.Several countries have raised concerns that their markets are being flooded with low-priced Chinese products they cannot compete with.Businesses are also bracing for another year of turbulence and tariff tensions from the Trump administration.In April last year, Trump caused turmoil in the global economy by announcing sweeping tariffs on goods from more than 90 countries. Some of the most severe tariffs were reserved for China, which exports more to the US than any other country.An escalating war of words between the world's two largest economies saw threats of blanket triple-digit tariffs.At the time, trade experts saw this as a test of China's reliance on the US market, which Beijing insisted was just one of many places that Chinese businesses could sell to.Both sides managed to pause hostilities after a meeting between Trump and China's leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, avoiding a complete breakdown in trade relations.Other more moderate tariffs remain in place, which have severely dampened Chinese exports to the US.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMark Savage,music correspondentandLizo Mzimba,culture correspondentGetty ImagesThe Police, pictured on tour in Japan in 1981, from left to right: Andy Summers, Sting and Stewart Copeland Sting has paid his former bandmates in The Police more than half a million pounds after acknowledging underpaying royalties, court documents show.In a filing in London's High Court, the musician's lawyers said Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland received a payment of \"over $800,000\" after they launched legal proceedings last year.The three musicians are arguing over royalties to songs such as Roxanne and Every Breath You Take. Summers and Copeland contend that they are owed more than $2m (£1.5m) from Sting and his publishing company. But Sting denies that they are entitled to a portion of his income from streaming and download sales.His bandmates did not receive writing credits on most of The Police's hits, but argue that the band entered an \"oral agreement\" to share income in 1977, which was later formalised in written contracts.The  agreement acknowledged that, although Sting was the chief composer, the other two members sometimes made crucial contributions - such as Summers' guitar line on Every Breath You Take.As a result, the trio decided that when any of them received publishing income for a song they had written, they would share a percentage of that money - usually 15% - with the other two members, in what was termed an arrangers' fee.Summers and Copeland sued Sting last year, saying he had been withholding some of those payments. Getty ImagesThe trio famously have a fractious relationship, despite a reunion tour in 2008None of the band members were in court for the start of a two-day preliminary hearing on Wednesday.But lawyers for guitarist Summers and drummer Copeland are asking the court for permission to bring new and additional arguments that they are owed money from all downloads and streaming income, under the terms of their prior agreements in 1997 and 2016.They say that the language of those agreements should be interpreted in light of the changes to the record industry, where streaming income has largely replaced the sale of vinyl, CDs and cassettes.In court papers, they acknowledged a recent payment from Sting and his publishing company, disclosing a figure of $870,000 (£647,000), but noted that no interest had been added to the \"historic underpayment\".Meanwhile, Sting's lawyers argue that he shouldn't have to give his former bandmates royalties when The Police's music is played on streaming services like Spotify, because that counts as \"public performance\", rather than a sale.Furthermore, they say that Summers and Copeland are not eligible for royalties from streaming and digital sales, because their 2016 agreement only allows for royalty payments derived \"from the manufacture of records\".They added that the musicians' attempt to amend their case should be thrown out as it has \"no real prospect of success\".Success, collapse and reunionThe Police formed in 1977 and quickly became one of the UK's most commercially successful bands.Their innovative fusion of rock guitars with reggae rhythms spawned chart-topping hits like Message in a Bottle, Walking on the Moon and Every Little Thing She Does is Magic.They earned a US number one single with Every Breath You Take, taken from their fifth album, Synchronicity, in 1983.It was later recognised as the most-played radio song of all time and was heavily sampled on P Diddy and Faith Evans' 1997 song I'll Be Missing You.However, The Police split up in 1984 amid personal and musical animosity.Copeland later told The Guardian that the members \"beat the crap out of each other\" during the \"very dark\" recording sessions for Synchronicity.They reformed in 2007 to open the Grammy Awards, before setting out on a lucrative world tour. Tickets for the British leg sold out in just 30 minutes, but the band dissolved again after the final date.In 2022, Sting sold the rights to his songwriting catalogue to Universal Music Group, with the deal covering both his solo hits and songs he penned for The Police.The deal was estimated to be worth $200m.",

    "body": "50 minutes agoRegan Morris,Los Angeles, CaliforniaandChristal Hayes,Los Angeles, CaliforniaSport fans can now sign up for a chance to attend the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games - with tickets starting at $28 (£21).Registration has opened for fans to enter a random ticket draw covering all events that will take place at the Games. The window will remain open until mid-March. If chosen, fans will be notified via email and will be given a time slot to purchase tickets in April. One million of those tickets will sell for $28, and about one-third are set to cost less than $100 (£74.41).\"These Games belong to everyone,\" Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA 2028 said on Tuesday. \"These Games have to be affordable and inclusive.\"The announcement of affordable ticket prices come after the price of tickets for the 2026 men's football World Cup - which will also be hosted in the US, as well as Canada and Mexico - received some public criticism. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, LA officials said affordability and accessibility were central to their ticketing plan - and their hope that sport fans around the globe would be able to attend. Tickets for the 2024 Olympics in Paris started at $27.95 (£21).A special early purchase window will also be open for residents in the Los Angeles area and Oklahoma City, where some Olympic Games are also being held.2028 will be the first time the Olympics will be held in the US since the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Los Angeles has twice hosted the Olympics - in 1932 and 1984 - and plans to use its already established infrastructure to host the Games. Event organisers, along with hundreds of Olympians and Paralympians, gathered at the LA Memorial Coliseum on Tuesday for a ceremonial lighting of the Olympic venue's cauldron ahead of the opening of ticket registration. The Coliseum hosted events on both the previous occasions that the Olympics were held in LA, and it is set to co-host the opening ceremony along with track and field events in 2028. Organisers at the event on Tuesday explained how the ticketing would work. Once registered - using their name, email and zip code - fans will be entered into the random draw for time slots to buy tickets in April. The earlier slot a fan is given, the better their chances at securing tickets - as being given a time slot does not guarantee that there will be tickets available once a time slot is open.The first set of tickets will be up for purchase from 9-19 April. Admission for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games will be among the tickets on offer.Most of the Games will be held across Los Angeles and southern California, but both canoeing and softball will be held in Oklahoma. LA28 chief Allison Katz-Mayfield called the random ticket-drawing process \"the fairest way to ensure that the broadest number of people can get access to tickets and that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged\". \"No matter when you go in, whether you're the first person in or the last person in, you have the same opportunity,\" she added.Registration for tickets will be open until 18 March, and there is no advantage to registering early.",

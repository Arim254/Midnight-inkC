    "body": "4 hours agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday night in his insistence that the US \"has to have\" Greenland for national security reasons. He predicted that Europe's leaders aren't \"gonna push back too much\". But that's not the plan they have in mind when their paths cross with the US president at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato.President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums, especially those reliant on exporting to the US like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said “we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” after an emergency meeting ahead of the WEF with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "31 minutes agoYang TianandBBC WeatherWatch: Security camera footage show the skies illuminated in pink and green tonesSkies across the UK have been illuminated in hues of green and pink by the Northern Lights.The natural phenomenon - known as the Aurora Borealis - is the result of solar eruptions sending particles towards the Earth and interacting with particles in the atmosphere.The Northern Lights are mostly visible near the Arctic Circle but at times of high solar activity can be seen in other areas.Photos sent in to the BBC show dazzling images of light experienced on Monday evening across Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales as well as in parts of south-west, southern, eastern and northern England. Hang Ross/BBC Weather WatchersNorthern Lights seen in bursts of green, pink and yellow in Lyndhurst, Hampshire, EnglandGDW/BBC Weather WatchersA scarlet, pink and green-toned sky in Dartington, Devon, EnglandAuroras were reportedly visible as far south as Veneto and Emilia-Romagna in northern Italy, Murcia in southern Spain, and Côte d'Azur in the south of France.The signal for aurora is not as strong for Tuesday night, so it will not extend as far south, and skies will be cloudier across the UK.However, there will be some clear skies across northern and eastern Scotland, and possibly in Northern Ireland early in the night as well.Monday's stunning aurora was the result of a severe geomagnetic storm caused by a coronal mass ejection (CME) - waves of charged particles that erupt from the sun's surface.As they approach Earth, they interact with gases in the Earth's atmosphere, creating the colours we see in the night sky. Oxygen atoms glow green and nitrogen red, blue and pink.We are currently in a period of high solar activity, called solar maximum, during the sun's 21-year cycle. The sun has more sunspots which emit CMEs and solar flares - waves of electromagnetic radiation - and so we see more aurorae on Earth.Geomagnetic storms and solar flares are perfectly safe for us as we are protected from the radiation by our atmosphere, but they can interfere with technology.The aurora is best viewed under clear skies. Look to the north for a faint glow at first and if you can't see the colours, try through a camera lens or on your phone.dani_photography83/BBC Weather WatchersA pink haze frames an overturned ship in Pin Mill, Suffolk, EnglandDenise CaseyGreen skies above Prestatyn, north WalesSkywatcher/BBC Weather WatchersBeams of green and pink light illuminate Haddington in East Lothian, ScotlandGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "36 minutes agoChris MasonPolitical editorIan Vogler/Getty ImagesJust yesterday, the prime minister made the case for \"calm discussion\" with the United States. He wakes up this morning to President Trump personifying a political Catherine wheel: spinning, unpredictable, colourful and firing off reactions at every angle.Every angle, including in the direction of the UK, and in particular Sir Keir Starmer.This moment, like no other before it, poses a massive strategic question for Sir Keir: What on earth to do now?He has courted Donald Trump and built his foreign policy around being seen to be a dependable, trustworthy ally of the president, who wouldn't sound off about him in public. In an extraordinarily difficult start for his government at home, Sir Keir's relationship with the US president was widely seen as an unlikely success story.Trump spoke very warmly of the prime minister in public, and Downing Street believed it had a stronger relationship with the White House than many European allies  - and that was to the UK's benefit.The deal the government did over the president's tariffs last year was talked up as a case study in the advantages of the relationship they had built.But now this. Firstly Greenland, now the Chagos Islands.The government is defending its deal to hand over the islands to Mauritius, announced last year, following President Trump's splenetic outrage about it on social media.Senior sources are making it clear there were very good reasons for the deal, and point out that it was publicly welcomed by the United States and Australia - two countries, alongside the UK, that are part of the 'Five Eyes' intelligence alliance.The argument ministers have long made is that legal challenges over the validity of the UK's claim to the Chagos Islands threatened the viability of the crucial military base on Diego Garcia - a site prized by both the UK and the US.The deal they did, they say, secures the long-term future of the base.Change of heartIt is almost a year since the president's view on the deal was first sought in public.I remember it - I was there, in the Oval Office of the White House.The reporter pack suspected the president might be sceptical about it. But we were wrong. When we asked, he sounded supportive.A few months later, last May, when the deal was formally done, it was welcomed by the United States. But now we see this colossal change of heart - delivered in a characteristic blitz of capital letters.And this might not be the end of it, even this week.The UK government has now approved plans for a new Chinese embassy in London, something Beijing has long coveted and critics have long said would be a big mistake and a security risk.I know from conversations I have had there are deep reservations in Washington about the UK being seen to cosy up, as they see it, to China.Could the approval of this new embassy, just a few weeks before the prime minister is expected to visit China, be the next stimulus for presidential outrage?That feels entirely possible, right now.

    "body": "2 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris correspondentandPaul Pradier,in ParisFrench officials have made their first interception on the water as part of a new policy aimed at stopping small boats carrying illegal migrants to the UK.A so-called \"taxi-boat\" was boarded by French officers on Saturday on the Aa canal in Gravelines, which is on the Channel coast above Calais.It follows a change of tactics agreed in November following growing pressure from the UK government to step up interventions.A photograph of the aftermath of the operation obtained by the BBC shows a number of men - apparently people-smugglers - on an inflatable dinghy with the police launch alongside. The inflatable is then towed to the dockside.The BBC has approached French authorities for comment.France agreed to the new tactics at a summit in the UK last July between President Emmanuel Macron and Sir Keir Starmer.Until then French police had only intervened to stop small boats as they were being prepared for launch on beaches. Intervening at sea was judged to be too dangerous.But smugglers' gangs learned to avoid police by using \"taxi-boats\", which enter the water some distance away and then travel along the coast picking up groups of migrants who themselves enter the water to get aboard.According to an official French documents, this method was proving extremely effective, with an 81% success rate in 2025.The number of migrants who reached the UK from France rose last year from 36,566 in 2024 to 41,472, but it was lower than the peak of 45,774 in 2022.After the July 2025 agreement to start on-water interventions, there were more delays because of worries about the risk to life, and about officers' liability to prosecution were migrants to die in an operation.These concerns appear now to have been addressed.  Under the terms of engagement, gendarmes will only intervene to stop \"taxi-boats\" before they take on migrants – and not when they are fully charged.This seems to have been the procedure used in Saturday's operation. Police suspected that the inflatable, which was moving down the canal to its mouth at the sea, was about to be used for picking up migrants, so they moved to arrest the men on board.",

    "body": "14 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesSir David and Lady Victoria Beckham have not publicly acknowledged the much-rumoured rift with their eldest son and his wife NicolaIn a series of posts on Instagram, the eldest child of Sir David Beckham and Lady Beckham accused his parents of \"attacking\" him and his wife in the press, saying they tried \"endlessly to ruin\" his relationship with Nicola Peltz Beckham.After months of speculation about a feud in the high-profile family, he said he had tried to keep the situation private but was left with \"no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth\".The BBC has contacted Sir David's and Lady Beckham's representatives for comment. The pair have never acknowledged the rift.The bombshell claims in Brooklyn Beckham's post - from wedding dress drama to the first dance\"I have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private,\" the 26-year-old wrote in a series of posts to his 16 million followers.\"Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.\"I do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life.\"He added: \"Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.\"Sir David was photographed on Tuesday morning before taking part in a podcast recording at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, but he has so far declined to comment on his eldest son's post.ReutersDavid Beckham was pictured ahead of a podcast recording in Davos on Tuesday morningMuch of Brooklyn Beckham's statement focused on his relationship with his wife - an American actress and the daughter of billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz - whom he said had been \"consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one\".He accused his parents of trying to derail their wedding, claiming his fashion designer mother had \"cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress\".Reports emerged at the time that Nicola, now 31, had refused to wear one of Lady Beckham's designs. She later told the Times that her mother-in-law had realised her atelier could not finish it in time, denying speculation that there was a feud.He also accused Lady Beckham of \"hijacking\" their first dance - claiming that when he was called to the stage, \"my mum was waiting to dance with me\" instead of his wife and \"danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone\".He said they renewed their vows in 2025 to create new memories \"that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment\".Peltz Beckham also alleged that his parents had \"repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name\" weeks before the ceremony. It is not clear to which rights he is referring.He said he had refrained from agreeing to do so - which \"affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since\".Getty ImagesThe pair joined the rest of the family at the premier of their Netflix documentary, Beckham, in October 2023He also addressed another incident which had fuelled speculation about the rift: the couple's absence from Sir David's 50th birthday party in May.Peltz Beckham said he and his wife had travelled to London for Sir David's birthday but were \"rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him\".\"He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner,\" the influencer wrote.He said his father \"finally agreed\" to meet him but on the condition that his wife was not present, which he called a \"slap in the face\", adding that his family then refused to see him on a subsequent trip to Los Angeles.At the time, a source told the BBC that the 26-year-old had chosen not to go to the party as his younger brother Romeo was attending with a woman to whom he had previously been linked.The influencer's post alleged that his mother had \"repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable\".The eldest son criticised his family for valuing \"public promotion and endorsements above all else\".\"Brand Beckham comes first,\" he wrote, adding that \"family 'love' is decided by how much you post on social media\".He said: \"I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared\".Peltz Beckham said he had been subject to \"endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders\".He added that his younger brothers had also been \"sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last summer\".Cruz Beckham, 20, said in December that their parents would \"never unfollow their son,\" in response to a Daily Mail story claiming they had done so.\"Not true. My mum and dad would never unfollow their son. Let's get the facts right,\" he wrote on Instagram.\"They woke up blocked as I did.\" Ex-England football captain Sir David and former Spice Girl Lady Beckham have two other sons and a daughter - Romeo, 23, Cruz, 20, and Harper Seven, 14.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "A series of text exchanges between Donald Trump and European leaders about ownership of Greenland have sensationally been released. The US president has pledged to tell European leaders at this week's forum in Davos, Switzerland, that \"we will have to have\" Greenland. Messages released on Monday between Trump and Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Støre revealed the president no longer felt obliged to think only of peace after he was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year. On Tuesday, Trump has posted his own text exchanges with French President Emmanuel Macron and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte. Here are the messages in full:Released by the office of Støre following a freedom of information request by the BBC), 18 January at 15:48 (14:48 GMT)Gahr Støre: Dear Mr President, dear Donald - on the contact across the Atlantic - on Greenland, Gaza, Ukraine - and your tariff announcement yesterday. You know our position on these issues. But we believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate - so much is happening around us where we need to stand together. We are proposing a call with you later today - with both of us or separately - give us a hint of what you prefer! Best - Alex [on behalf of Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb] and JonasTrump's response, 18 January 16:15 (15:15 GMT): Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a \"right of ownership\" anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJTFrom president Macron to President TrumpMy friend, We are totally in line on SyriaWe can do great things on Iran I do not understand what you are doing on GreenlandLet us try to build great things : 1) I can set up a G7 meeting after Davos in Paris on Thursday afternoon. I can invite the Ukrainians, the Danish, the Syrians and the Russians in the margins 2) Let us have a dinner together in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the USEmmanuelMr. President, dear Donald - what you accomplished in Syria today is incredible. I will use my media engagements in Davos to highlight your work there, in Gaza, and in Ukraine. I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Can't wait to see you. Yours, Mark",

    "body": "20 hours agoSteve RosenbergRussia EditorReutersListen to Donald Trump and you would think Moscow and Beijing were lying in wait off the coast of Greenland, ready to pounce to boost their power in the Arctic.\"There are Russian destroyers, there are Chinese destroyers and, bigger, there are Russian submarines all over the place,\" President Trump said recently.That is why, according to America's president, US control of Greenland is essential.So how do you think Moscow has reacted to its alleged plot being uncovered and potentially thwarted by a US takeover of Greenland?The Russians can't be pleased. Right?Wrong.In an astonishing article, the Russian government paper is full of praise for Trump and critical of European leaders who oppose a US annexation of Greenland.\"Standing in the way of the US president's historic breakthrough is the stubbornness of Copenhagen and the mock solidarity of intransigent European countries, including so-called friends of America, Britain and France,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\"Europe does not need the American greatness that Trump is promoting. Brussels is counting on 'drowning' the US president in the midterm congressional elections, on preventing him from concluding the greatest deal of his life.\"\"Greatest deal\"? The reporter explains what he means. I have to keep reminding myself I am reading the Russian government newspaper, not a pro-Trump publication in America.\"If Trump annexes Greenland by July 4 2026, when America celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, he will go down in history as a figure who asserted the greatness of the United States,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\"With Greenland, the US becomes the second largest country in the world after Russia, surpassing Canada in area. For Americans, that's on par with such planetary events as the abolition of slavery by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 or the territorial conquests of the Napoleonic Wars.\"If, thanks to Trump, Greenland becomes part of America…for sure the American people will not forget such an achievement.\"And the Russian reporter has this message for America's president: don't U-turn.\"It is dangerous for the American president to back down over Greenland. This would weaken the position of the Republican Party in the midterm elections and likely result in a Democrat majority on Capitol Hill with the ensuing consequences for Trump. Whereas a rapid annexation of Greenland before the elections can change this political trend.\"In other words, it's in Trump's interest to push ahead with his plans to take over Greenland: according to the Russian government paper.Let that sink in.But why the praise from Moscow? Why the apparent encouragement?It's because Russia has much to gain from the current situation.Trump's fixation with Greenland, his determination to take over the island and impose tariffs on European countries that oppose his plan have put a huge strain on the transatlantic alliance: both on America's relations with Europe, and within Nato.Anything that weakens – or threatens to split – the Western alliance is viewed by Moscow as a huge positive for Russia.\"Europe is at a total loss and, to be honest, it's a pleasure to watch this,\" gloated the Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets in one of its articles about Greenland.What's more, American threats to annex Greenland are being used by pro-Kremlin commentators to try to justify Russia's war on Ukraine.Victory in Ukraine remains the Kremlin's priority. Moscow believes that maintaining a positive relationship with the Trump administration will help achieve this.Hence Russia's criticism of Europe.

    "body": "2 hours agoAnnabel RackhamBBC NewsGetty Images\"There was definitely a moment of discomfort at the start,\" says Deena, but she says her visit to a so-called rage room felt very different to what she'd expected.She didn't feel chaotic or aggressive smashing things up, but instead \"surprisingly controlled and a lot more intentional\".\"Once I settled into it, it felt like more of a physical release as opposed to an emotional outburst,\" she told the BBC.Deena is one of a reportedly growing number of women choosing to pay to hammer and bash old items such as TVs,  furniture and crockery whilst kitted out in specialist protective gear.The concept of rage rooms is believed to have originated in Japan in the late 2000s, whilst a woman called Donna Alexander says she created an \"anger room\" in her Texas garage around the same time, allowing people to come in and smash up items that had been fly tipped.There are still only a small number of venues in the UK where people are handed a baseball bat and let loose. They've been touted as one way to alleviate stress and release pent-up anger.But what seems surprising is the client base, with some owners saying most of their customers are women.Deena says she visited a rage room to try something differentDeena says she initially tried one \"out of curiosity\".\"I'm not an angry or volatile person, I come across as a very calm and composed individual so initially it did feel quite strange and almost wrong.Afterwards, she \"felt a lot lighter, a lot calmer,\" comparing the experience to hitting \"a reset switch\" or having \"a really good deep tissue massage\".Deena says her job is fast paced and involves \"a lot of responsibility and constant decision making,\" and now thinks a rage room could help her with this. If she gets too stressed, she would visit one again, she says. Shuka PiryaeeShuka says going to a rage room is \"a fun and ridiculous way to reset\".'Weirdly freeing'Similarly, Shuka says she didn't feel angry, but wanted to see how it felt to \"let loose\" and was given a car to smash up whilst listening to a playlist of her favourite songs.\"It was way more satisfying than I expected, there was something weirdly freeing about smashing things and not having to be careful.\"Afterwards I felt like I'd done a workout for my brain as well as my body,\" she says.Kate Cutler,  the co-owner and founder of a rage room in East Sussex, says it's \"getting busier and busier\" with female customers.She decided to set it up whilst her daughter, who has since died, was battling brain cancer. Going to a rage room had been on her bucket list. She says some women come in because they've been cheated on or had a difficult break-up and sometimes just because \"they have anger coming from nowhere.\"Author and psychotherapist Jennifer Cox told Radio 4 Woman's Hour she believes women are \"conditioned\" to repress feelings of \"frustration, anger, aggression and rage\".Often, she says women, in particular -  end up \"sandwiched\" between the demands of work, parents and small children, and can end up \"furious.\"Really they should let it out, she says, and thinks spaces like this, which allow women to release their anger can be very helpful.She suggests setting up  \"mini rage rooms in the home\" by piling up cushions and pillows and \"really going for it\" in order to release some of that anger and stress.\"When we repress [rage] it comes out in our bodies in all sorts of different ways – anxiety, depression, OCD, migraines, stomach problems,\" she added.Rage rooms have been around since the late 2000s and have grown in popularity around the world'Anger is healthy'Shelly Dar, a mental health therapist, agrees, telling Radio 5 Live rage rooms can provide \"an instant relief\", and you can feel calmer and clearer afterwards.It's healthy to feel angry, she says, but it gets a bad reputation because we see the outburst, not the build up.\"And because we are so overloaded with life, there isn't a safe space to express anything messy,\" Shelly said.Spaces like these are one way for women to get their feelings out safely, she says. \"A lot of the problem for women nowadays is that we don't want to be judged, so we have to keep all of these emotions in, playing the good girl role, maybe being the calm mother, the calm reflective parent, and we have been socialised to be nice.\" ",

    "body": "22 hours agoDearbail Jordan,Theo LeggettandJonathan Josephs,BBC Business News Getty ImagesEC President Ursula von der Leyen struck a deal with Donald Trump last yearDonald Trump's threat on Saturday to impose tariffs on eight European countries unless they support his plan to buy Greenland came as a shock. The US president said he would introduce a 10% levy on imports into the US on 1 February, rising to 25% from the summer if no deal is done.  It is unclear whether these tariffs would be added to existing levies.France and Germany - part of the group of eight which includes the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland - have said the European Union (EU) should be ready to act if Trump goes ahead with the taxes.But what options does Europe have to respond to the US? Could Europe hit back with tariffs?Less than six months ago, the US and the EU agreed a deal that was supposed to stabilise transatlantic trade and provide certainty to businesses and consumers.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen came away from President Trump's golf course in Scotland with tariffs of 15% on everything the EU sells to the US - far better than the 30% America had threatened.Along the way, Brussels also prepared a package of tariffs that would come into force if it was unable to reach an agreement with the US.It included tariffs on everything from livestock to aircraft parts to whiskey, totalling €93bn (£80bn; $108bn) worth of goods that the US sells to the EU.The high-level agreement meant those taxes were suspended while details were worked out, and the European Parliament was set to ratify the EU-US trade deal next week.  But within hours of Trump's threat, influential German MEP Manfred Weber said approval was \"not possible at this stage\".Without the EU signing off on last year's deal or extending the suspension, the tariffs on billions of euros worth of American goods will kick in on 7 February.That risks a political backlash in the US for Trump from companies that export to Europe.As for his threats of tariffs on some but not all EU countries, the commission said while it was technically possible, it would be very difficult to implement given the number of times goods cross EU borders before they are exported to the US.European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said Brussels would do \"everything necessary to protect EU economic interests\" - but ultimately, tariffs would only serve to harm businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.What is the EU's 'trade bazooka'?The so-called \"trade bazooka\", officially known as the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), is a law that allows the European Union to respond to economic blackmail from non-EU countries.It threatens very severe consequences if they attempt to impose their will on the EU or its members. Specifically, it targets trade and investment measures by countries who are seen to interfere in the \"legitimate, sovereign choices\" of the EU or its member states.This response can include a vast swathe of trade measures such as tariffs, import and export restrictions, curbs on trade in services as well as reduced access to banking and capital markets.Ultimately, it allows the EU to block access to most of the single market while ignoring existing international treaties.However, this is the nuclear option.The real purpose of the bazooka is to bring other countries to the negotiating table. Actually deploying it could cause serious economic damage within the EU itself, so it is seen very much as a last resort.It is also not a rapid response measure.Under the current rules, the European Commission can spend up to four months investigating any alleged coercion. Another six months can be spent negotiating with the country concerned and deciding whether there is a case for retaliation. Then, the EU's member states have up to 10 weeks to authorise any action.So even if the commission were to pull the trigger now, it could be a year before the bazooka is actually fired.What about the UK? Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has made it clear he wants to avoid a trade war with Trump, more or less ruling out immediate retaliatory tariffs against the US in a speech on Monday.While he said Trump should not be using the threat of trade taxes \"against allies in this way\", Sir Keir also said: \"A tariff war is in nobody's interests.\"He continued: \"We have not got to that stage and my focus therefore is making sure that we don't get to that stage.\" There are other levers the government could use if the UK, the EU and the US are unable to reach an accord over Greenland.The UK could, for example, increase the Digital Services Tax, potentially affecting some of the US's largest tech companies like Amazon and Meta, the owner of Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook.The tax rate is currently 2% and is charged against tech giants with sales of £500m worldwide and £25m in the UK.But at this stage, so much is unclear including the legality of some Trump tariffs. The US Supreme Court is set to rule on whether the president overstepped his authority by imposing taxes using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.That includes the so-called \"retaliatory\" tariffs Trump introduced last year under which American businesses importing a range of British goods have to pay a 10% tax when they reach US shores.

    "body": "3 hours agoSimon Jack,Business editorandJonah Fisher,Climate correspondentGetty ImagesInspections without notice, regular MOT-style checks and compulsory water efficiency labels on appliances are among the key measures in the government's overhaul of the water industry.The government is describing the measures as the biggest overhaul of the water industry in England and Wales since privatisation.Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said there would be \"nowhere to hide\" for poor performing water companies.The proposed changes come after widespread public anger at increasing numbers of pollution incidents, leaks and water outages that have affected thousands of customers across England and Wales in recent years.\"We've had a system whereby water companies are marking their own homework,\" Reynolds told the BBC.\"This has been a whole system failure,\" she said. \"A failure of regulation, a failure of regulators, of the water companies themselves.\"The Water White Paper promises to set up company-specific teams to monitor, supervise and support individual firms and their particular issues rather than rely on a \"desk based, one size fits all\" approach.Smart meters and mandatory water efficiency labels on appliances including dishwashers and washing machines will also help households monitor their usage and costs, the government said.It is also creating a chief engineer role at the regulator that will be set up to replace Ofwat.Government officials have told the BBC that the establishment of a new regulator may take a year or more and water companies say it will take time for the benefits of new investments to be felt.The government's reforms come after a review by Sir Jon Cunliffe, who issued 88 recommendations to improve the industry.However, he was asked not to consider whether to nationalise the sector, which was privatised in the late 1980s.Campaigners said the proposed reforms did not go far enough.River Action chief executive James Wallace said the measures showed the government \"recognises the scale of the freshwater emergency, but lacks the urgency and bold reform to tackle it\".The new regulator must be \"truly independent\" and properly funded, he warned, and said major gaps remain. \"None of these reforms will make a meaningful difference unless the failed privatised model is confronted head on. Pollution for profit is the root cause of this crisis,\" Wallace said.Surfers Against Sewage chief executive Giles Bristow said the government's proposed changes were \"frankly insulting\" and fell short of much needed structural reform.\"The truth is glaringly obvious to everyone except this government. As long as the industry is structured to prioritise profit, the public will keep paying the price through soaring bills and polluted water,\" he said.Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at Oxford University, said the government had not wanted to explore nationalisation because its self-imposed spending rules have already been stretched to the limits.\"In addition to that, I think there's a very sensible view around government that the government probably isn't competent and capable to run these businesses,\" he said.\"The government should think really quite carefully about this, because if they're supervising the companies, and something goes wrong, whose fault is it?\"Problems in the beleaguered sector have been thrown into focus recently after tens of thousands of South East Water customers were cut off for several days both before and after Christmas.Mike Keil, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), said the \"miserable disruption\" underlined the importance of \"meaningful change\" in water regulation.A new, powerful ombudsman service would also be welcome, Keil said, given CCW has had a 50% increase in customers asking for help with complaints relating to their water provider.\"One of our key asks of the Independent Water Commission was to make our existing voluntary ombudsman service mandatory, as this is vital to giving customers robust protection,\" he said.A spokesperson for Water UK welcomed the government's white paper, and added \"the focus must now shift from diagnosis to delivery.\"The spokesperson continued: \"Our country will not have the environment it wants or the economic growth it needs until a new water regulator is established. Interim leadership should be appointed as soon as possible. We cannot afford for any more long-term decisions to be taken by a system everyone knows has failed.\"'Proof in the river'Peter Devery testing the water of the River PangThe River Pang in Berkshire is regarded by some as one of the inspirations for Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows classics. Its environmental status has deteriorated from \"good\" in 2015 to \"poor\" now, with campaigners blaming regular sewage discharges.On the banks of the Pang, Pete Devery from the Angling Trust told the BBC he was sceptical of the government's plans.\"I won't hold my breath,\" he said.\"The proof will be in the river. Do the rivers across the country improve? That's the end result. Doesn't matter what you call that regulator. It doesn't matter how many regulators there are. If the difference isn't made in the rivers, they will have failed.\"In 2024, water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours, a slight increase on 2023.Ageing infrastructure, wetter winters and drier springs and farming runoff into rivers and lakes have all contributed to poor water service and quality.Ofwat is currently the water industry's economic regulator for both England and Wales. In October 2025 the Welsh government said that when Ofwat is abolished it plans to form its own stand-alone economic regulator to replace it.In 2025, water supply interruptions across England and Wales rose by 8% and pollution incidents by 27%, while customer satisfaction fell by 9%.Average water bills rose by 26%, or £123 a year, from last April after years of below-inflation increases that some have blamed, along with high executive pay and shareholder dividends, on under-investment in the sector.The sharp rise in bills is meant to address that under-investment by funding spending of £104bn over the next five years, more than 40% of which is earmarked for new infrastructure.",

    "body": "UK consulting on bringing in social media ban for under 16s2 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe government has launched a consultation on banning social media for under 16s in the UK as a part of a series of measures which it says are intended to \"protect young people's wellbeing.\"The package will also see England's education inspectorate, Ofsted, given the power to check policies on phone use when it goes into schools, with ministers saying they expect schools to be \"phone-free by default\" as a result.The world's first social media ban for young people took effect in Australia in December 2025, prompting other countries, including the UK, to consider following suit.Some experts and children's charities have cautioned against the idea - but it has strong backing elsewhere.On Sunday, more than 60 Labour MPs wrote to the prime minister saying the backed a ban with the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey also calling on the government to act.\"Some argue that vulnerable children need access to social media to find their community,\" Brianna's mother Esther Ghey wrote in a letter seen by the BBC. \"As the parent of an extremely vulnerable and trans child, I strongly disagree. \"In Brianna's case, social media limited her ability to engage in real-world social interactions. She had real friends, but she chose to live online instead.\"The former school standards minister Catherine McKinnell, who is one of the MPs who signed the open letter to Sir Keir Starmer, told BBC News parents currently \"felt unprepared to deal with the pace at which social media has changed.\"Speaking on Breakfast, on BBC 5Live, she added that while children should still be able to be \"connected in an online world\", she didn't believe that meant \"being bombarded with information sent to you by algorithms devised to create money by tech companies.\"According to The Department of Science, Innovation and Technology, the consultation will \"seek views from parents, young people and civil society\" to determine the effectiveness of a ban.It would also look at whether more robust age checks could be implemented by social media firms, which could be forced to remove or limit features \"which drive compulsive use of social media\".And Ofsted will give tougher guidance to schools to reduce phone use - including telling staff not to use their devices for personal reasons in front of pupils.The government will respond to the consultation in the summer.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the laws in the Online Safety Act were \"never meant to be the end point\" and said she understood \"parents still have serious concerns\".\"We are determined to ensure technology enriches children's lives, not harms them - and to give every child the childhood they deserve,\" she said.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has already said her party would introduce a social media ban for under-16s if it was in power.She said the consultation was \"more dither and delay\" from Labour.\"The prime minister is trying to copy an announcement that the Conservatives made a week ago, and still not getting it right,\" she said. Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Munira Wilson said there was \"no time to waste in protecting our children from social media giants\" and \"this consultation risks kicking the can down the road yet again\".National Education Union (NEU) general secretary Daniel Kebede called the move a \"welcome shift\". \"Every day, parents and teachers see how social media shapes children's identities and attention long before they sit their GCSEs, pulling them into isolating, endless loops of content,\" he said.Getty ImagesThe Association of School and College Leaders also welcomed the consultation on social media, but said the government had been \"sluggish\" in responding to the online risks posed to children.The union's general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio said there was \"clearly a much wider problem of children and young people spending far too much time on screens and being exposed to inappropriate content\".And Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, also welcomed the plans to consult on a potential social media ban.But he said the suggestion that Ofsted should \"police\" phones in schools was \"deeply unhelpful and misguided\".\"School leaders need support from government, not the threat of heavy-handed inspection,\" he added.'Not strong evidence'It comes as the government faces additional pressure from the House of Lords, which is expected to vote on a proposed ban on Wednesday.The amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill has backing from several prominent figures such as former children's TV presenter Baroness Benjamin and former education minister Lord Nash.There is also a separate amendment calling for the introduction of film-style age ratings which could limit the social media apps children can access.Professor Amy Orben, who leads the Digital Mental Health programme at the University of Cambridge's MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, told the BBC there was \"broad agreement\" more needed to be done to keep children safe online.However, she said there was still \"not strong evidence\" that age-based social media bans were effective.Dr Holly Bear from Oxford University, whose work focuses on developing, evaluating, and implementing mental health interventions for young people, agreed the evidence for the effects of a social media ban was \"still unfolding\".\"A balanced approach might be trying to reduce algorithm-driven exposure to harmful content, improving safeguards, supporting digital literacy and carefully evaluating any major policy interventions,\" she said.The NSPCC, Childnet, and suicide prevention charity the Molly Rose Foundation were among 42 individuals and bodies to argue a ban would be the \"wrong solution\" on Saturday.\"It would create a false sense of safety that would see children - but also the threats to them - migrate to other areas online,\" the organisations wrote.\"Though well-intentioned, blanket bans on social media would fail to deliver the improvement in children's safety and wellbeing that they so urgently need.\"",

    "body": "\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle final (10:20-11:40) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (13:30-14:50 - rearranged from Tuesday because of weather)British teenager Mia Brookes was a potential medal hope in this event but she is not in the final after finishing 16th in qualification. Reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand topped qualification, ahead of Japan's Kokomo Murase.The rest of the field were well behind the pair. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykUS Department of Justice/PAEpstein took dozens more flights to the UK than were previously knownEssex Police has said it is assessing information about private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the Epstein files.The BBC understands that while the police is \"assessing\" the information, it would not necessarily lead to a full investigation.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the New Statesman last week that police \"urgently\" need to re-examine whether Jeffrey Epstein's victims were trafficked within and outside of the UK.An Essex Police spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\"In December, BBC News discovered that three British women who were allegedly trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK alongside other documents related to the convicted sex offender.US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims told the BBC it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a \"full-scale\" investigation into his activities in the UK.The former PM wrote to the chief police constables and commissioner of the Met, Essex and Thames Valley Police.He added that Stansted, located around 40 miles away from central London, was one of the airports \"where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\".Stansted Airport said in a statement: \"All private aircraft at London Stansted operate through independent Fixed Base Operators, which handle all aspects of private and corporate aviation in line with regulatory requirements.\"The airport said that these terminals are \"entirely independent\" and that \"no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal\". Immigration and customs checks for passengers arriving via private jets are carried out \"directly by Border Force\", it said, adding that it does not \"manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft\".BBC News has again contacted police forces in areas where Epstein-linked flights landed or took off from, including Police Scotland, Merseyside, Belfast, West Midlands, and Bedfordshire.Our investigations team is sifting through the latest Epstein documents released by the US Department of Justice to see what other flights and trains Epstein may have used to travel in the UK.The Essex Police statement comes as a new national group has been set up to support UK forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has said.The force previously said it has held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein during his time as the UK's trade envoy.Elsewhere, Norfolk Constabulary said it was \"reviewing documents\" released in the US to \"ensure that all relevant information has been properly assessed\".A spokesperson said the force had \"not received any allegations and is not currently conducting any investigation\", but that it was \"reviewing documents\" released in the US to \"ensure that all relevant information has been properly assessed\".Last year, a BBC News investigation found one arrival and departure of an Epstein-linked flight at RAF Marham in west Norfolk.Separately, the tranche of documents released in December included a photograph taken the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk of Andrew lying across the laps of women, with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell standing in the background.The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.He was dismissed from his role as ambassador in September, after Downing Street said new information had emerged about the depth of this relationship with Epstein.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "1 hour agoLaura GozziReutersRussian, American and Ukrainian representatives met in Geneva on Tuesday and WednesdayTalks between Russia, Ukraine and the US aimed at ending Moscow's war in Ukraine have concluded without a breakthrough. The trilateral meetings, held in Geneva, went on late on Tuesday but only lasted two hours on Wednesday. Although US envoy Steve Witkoff had expressed optimism over the talks, both the Russian and Ukrainian sides indicated they had been \"difficult.\"Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on key issues of territory and the terms of a potential ceasefire in the four-year conflict.While conceding talks were challenging, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky added that they had been \"businesslike\" and said another meeting would take place \"soon\".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also described the negotiations as \"not easy\" due to the difference in the two sides' positions. Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov cut a less downbeat tone, saying the discussions had been \"substantive and intensive\" and that while there had been progress, no details could be disclosed \"at this stage\".\"This is complex work that requires alignment among all parties and sufficient time,\" Umerov said.Shortly before the end of the talks was announced, Zelensky accused Russia of \"trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage\".The Russian and Ukrainian delegations last met in US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi in January, which led to the first prisoner exchange in several months. On Wednesday, Zelensky indicated that another swap might be forthcoming. US President Donald Trump, who spearheaded diplomatic efforts to end the war, has been signalling impatience with the deadlock between the two sides. On Monday, he said Ukraine had \"better come to the table, fast\" - a sentiment Zelensky has since rejected, saying it was \"not fair\" that his country should be the one asked to compromise.Four years on from the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, substantial distance still exists between Moscow's demands and what Kyiv might consider a \"just peace\".Russia has been pushing for full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas, made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Kyiv has long rejected this demand, which would mean relinquishing Ukrainian sovereign territory, including several heavily fortified cities and a long defensive line in the region of Donetsk. Many Ukrainians believe giving that territory up would leave the country vulnerable to another Russian invasion. On Tuesday, Zelensky told US media outlet Axios that any plan to hand over the Donbas would be rejected by Ukrainians if it were put to a referendum. Another sticking point in the talks is the status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. Ukraine wants Moscow to return it and Zelensky has previously said Kyiv could share control of the plant with the Americans - an arrangement Moscow is unlikely to agree to.",

Two other skiers who where part of the group in La Grave, a German and an Australian, escaped without injury.On Tuesday, the French weather service marked the avalanche risk in the La Greve area as \"high\" or four on a five-point scale due to fresh snow and wind.At the Valloire resort, the risk was categorised at the maximum of five.Local authorities have launched investigations to determine the cause of death in both avalanches.Following the deaths of the two British nationals on Friday, a spokesperson for the Foreign Office told the BBC they were \"in contact with the local authorities and stand ready to offer consular assistance\".There have been a number of fatal avalanches in the French Alps since the start of the year, including six deaths in one weekend in January.",

    "body": "1 hour agoKathryn ArmstrongGetty ImagesThe former prince has come under renewed scrutiny in recent months over his past ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein The Metropolitan Police is carrying out \"initial inquiries\" into close protection officers formerly assigned to Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. It comes after an unnamed former senior Met protection officer told LBC that members of the Royalty and Specialist Protection (RaSP) may have \"wilfully turned a blind eye\" during visits to a private island owned by Jeffery Epstein. Multiple survivors have alleged they were trafficked to and abused on the island, known as Little St James, which Epstein purchased in 1998.In a statement, the Met said it had so far \"not identified any wrongdoing\" but that it was working to \"establish the facts\" around the allegations. Speaking to LBC on Tuesday, the former Met protection officer claimed Andrew's protection team travelled with him to the private island on at least two occasions, including travelling on Epstein's private jet on one of those occasions. The unnamed former officer said there were \"real concerns\" in the late 1990s and early 2000s that the \"royal protection team became too close to their principals\", and staff were \"terrified\" of being demoted.Under the rules governing how police forces are held to account, the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) would carry out any further investigation should the initial Met assessment identify concerns. Andrew's accuser Virginia Giuffre alleged she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions, including on Little St James in the early 2000s.While Andrew reached a financial settlement with Giuffre, it did not constitute an admission of wrongdoing, and the former prince has always strenuously denied any offence. Epstein was found dead in his prison cell on 10 August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Additional reporting by Chi Chi Izundu ",

    "body": "As that rain shifts northwards into Wales, the west Midlands and northern England during the late afternoon and evening, some of it will turn to snow, especially over the hills.Several centimetres of snow are expected to accumulate over high ground, above around 150-200m elevation, with the possibility of up to 15cm over the highest ground of mid and south-east Wales, as well as Herefordshire, Shropshire and the southern Pennines.At low levels a mix of rain and sleet is more likely, with the possibility of a little wet snow at times.This wet and wintry mix could mean difficult travelling conditions for some during Wednesday evening and overnight, as well as possible power cuts.Some snow could also start to affect the Peak District, Pennines and possibly south-west Scotland during the night.There remains some uncertainty in the forecast so it will be worth keeping up to date with the hour-by-hour details on the BBC Weather website and app.Low temperatures will remain part of the story, with the UKHSA cold alert, external covering all of England except for London and the South East.  This warns of the risk of minor impacts on health and social care services. Vulnerable people in particular may be affected by this spell of colder weather, with more use of healthcare services and an increased risk to life.However, significantly milder weather is expected by the weekend.",

    "body": "'I don't pay attention': Cynthia Erivo ignores online criticism as Dracula gets mixed reviews2 hours agoYasmin RufoNoël Coward Theatre, LondonDaniel BoudAfter years defying gravity, Wicked star Cynthia Erivo has traded the shimmering world of Oz for something darker and far more demanding. On the stage at London's Noël Coward Theatre, Erivo stands alone, carrying an entire gothic epic on her shoulders in a new adaptation of Dracula. There are no flying monkeys or emerald cities here. Instead, the actress alone carries a two-hour theatrical marathon, playing 23 characters with 20,000 words of dialogue in a constant dance with live technology that blurs the boundary between film and stage.During early preview performances, the show attracted attention for more than its ambition, as some audience members complained online that Erivo appeared to still be learning sections of the script and at moments relied on an autocue. But speaking after the show's opening night on Tuesday, the 39-year-old told the BBC she blocks out those comments. \"I'm not paying attention to any of them as no-one knows the experience except me,\" she said. \"It's not for me.\" \"I have a job to do and I want to do it as well as I can and I want to do it with all my heart. I don't let the comments take the energy that I should be spending on the stage.\" Daniel BoudErivo accepts that she was \"still learning my lines and figuring it out\" during the preview shows, adding that \"bit by bit it's become something that's a part of me, and everyone's learning process is different\". The production is stripped back and minimal. Erivo conjures the Victorian world  through voice and movement and her Dracula, delivered in a Nigerian accent and crowned with bright red hair, is only one of dozens of transformations. She slips between characters through rapid costume changes as several cameras film her live, projecting close-ups of her face onto a screen where the audience watches much of the action unfold.'I choose the challenges'Bram Stoker's 1897 novel about a Transylvanian vampire whose move to England unleashes terror, obsession and desire is one of the most frequently adapted works of fiction in history, with hundreds of stage and screen versions reinventing the vampire for new generations.Erivo said she hopes Stoker would like this adaptation and explained why she chose to take on the role. \"It challenges me and makes me learn in a different way so I am forced to grow as an artist,\" she said.\"If things were easy it would be boring so I choose the challenges.\" A stage performer at heart, Erivo made her West End debut in 2011 and has since become one of the few artists nominated for an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award, winning all but the Oscar.Daniel BoudAsked what it actually takes to prepare for a performance of that scale night after night, Erivo described a routine built on discipline and repetition.\"You have some good people who can help and it takes time and patience,\" she said. \"You find your way in and the through-line, and it becomes easier to learn.\" She added that before every show she meditates, has an extensive vocal warm-up and \"runs sections of the show\". Erivo is not the only Wicked star performing in the West End. Her former co-stars Ariana Grande and Jonathan Bailey are set to reunite for a London revival of Stephen Sondheim's Sunday in the Park with George at the Barbican in 2027.Erivo tells BBC News she would not rule out sharing a stage with them in future. \"Maybe it's something I'd consider,\" she said. \"I'd never say no.\" Middling reviewsDracula has divided critics so far. \"From defying gravity to defying mortality – Cynthia Erivo gives an extraordinary, shape shifting performance,\" wrote the Standard's Nick Curtis in a four-star review.\"Her performance triumphantly walks a knife edge between virtuosity and absurdity.But many critics were far less positive. In a two-star review, Sam Marlowe of the Stage said that the show had \"sounded like such a toothsome prospect\", but that the result is \"bloodless\". \"What could possibly go wrong? Sadly, the answer is: almost everything,\" she said. \"I wouldn't go so far as to say it sucks, but it certainly doesn't bite.\"Getty Images\"The story is narrated by Erivo, with only snippets in dialogue,\" she explained, \"which gives the sense of an audiobook accompanied by screen illustrations.\"\"Over a very long and testing two hours and five minutes – unrelieved by the mercy of an interval – [Erivo] gives an astonishing performance,\" he said.\"I didn't come here to watch a film about Dracula, I came here to watch a live show,\" he said. \"The production disassociates you with much of the feeling and heft of live performance.\"Olivia Garrett of the Radio Times agreed the show is \"let down by overproduction\" in a three-star review, adding: \"Like Dracula himself, this production sits stranded in the middle, not dead, not alive, but somewhere in between.\"\"The British actress proves any doubters wrong,\" he said in his four-star review. \"This isn't a flawless night but it's a tour de force even so.\"Additional reporting by Steven McIntosh.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJoe Pike,Political correspondentandBrian Wheeler,Political reporterGetty ImagesMinisters are considering slowing down plans to pay adults of all ages the same minimum wage.Labour committed in their election manifesto to remove \"discretionary age bands\" and increase the wages of 18 to 20-year-olds so they are paid the same as those over 21.But government sources have confirmed ministers are interested in delaying that rise, though are unlikely to reverse the commitment entirely.Some business leaders say minimum wage increases are making it too expensive for them to hire young people - but unions say it is unfair that the young can be paid less for doing the same job as older people.The government has already made a start on ending the gap between minimum pay for younger and older workers.The hourly for rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will rise by 85p to £10.85 in April, with under-18s and apprentices getting 45p more to £8 an hour. That comes on top of 16.3% rise for 18 to 20-year-olds in 2024.The minimum wage for those aged 21 and over has been rising at a slower rate and is due to go up by 50p to £12.71 an hour in April.That leaves a gap of £1.86 an hour between younger and older workers, which the government has committed to closing before the next election in 2029.The Times newspaper first reported that ministers were weighing up whether to drop the pledge.Chancellor Rachel Reeves did not deny that the process could now be delayed when asked about it on a visit to a supermarket in south London.She said: \"We already have incentives to hire young people with the apprenticeship rate of the minimum wage, but also for no national insurance contributions for the youngest workers.\"But we do recognise there are challenges and that is why we're extending the number of further education college places, extending the number of apprenticeship places to help young people get the skills and the experience that they need to move into work.\"On Tuesday, it was confirmed unemployment had risen to a near five-year high, with the jobless rate among young people at its worst level for more than a decade.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of unemployment rose to 5.2% in the three months to December, up from 5.1% in the three months to November.Luke Johnson, the former chairman of Pizza Express and a director of Gail's bakery and Brompton Bicycles, said: \"The government is making it more expensive and more risky to employ people and so I think entrepreneurs and managers will not create the jobs.\"He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The mood amongst employers and those who invest in this country is the darkest I have ever seen.\"He argued that it was fair to pay a lower rate to young workers because \"if someone is less experienced and less well trained than someone who has been doing the job for a while they are not necessarily going to be as productive\".Johnson said the timing of the planned increases in the minimum wage was a \"tragedy\" for young people because there was set to be a \"substantial rise in unemployment\" in the coming years due to Artificial Intelligence and other factors.But Andy Prendergast, national secretary of the GMB Union, which represents workers across public utilities, engineering and food and drink manufacturing, said it was \"nonsense\" to suggest equalising minimum wage rates would destroy jobs.He said youth unemployment was a \"big problem that needs to be dealt with\" but it had been increasing for \"a very long time\" and equalised rates had not even come in yet.\"Employers tell us that every single improvement in workers' rights is going to cause a problem and time and time again they have been proved wrong,\" he told Today.",

The 18 defendants continue to face other allegations in relation to the break-in.At the first trial, Corner was accused of causing grievous bodily harm with intent but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on that charge. Head, Corner, Kamio, Rajwani, Rogers and Devlin will face a retrial in relation to all charges against them which did not end in verdicts, Heer said.Woolwich Crown Court was told this retrial was planned for 16 February 2027.More from BristolPalestine Action allege Elbit Systems UK is involved in the manufacture and supply of weapons to the Israeli military - a claim the company strongly denies.The charges relate to a break-in at Elbit Systems' site in Filton in the early hours of 6 August 2024The jury at the first trial - which began in November and finished on 4 February - deliberated for more than 36 hours.Rajwani, Rogers and Devlin were acquitted of violent disorder.All the defendants from the first trial - except Corner - are on conditional bail after spending about 18 months in custody.Related internet links",

    "body": "32 minutes agoAngus CochraneSenior political journalist, BBC ScotlandPA MediaFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell is yet to respond to the criminal charges First Minister John Swinney was given details of a criminal charge against former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell weeks before it became public.Scotland's top law officer told Swinney on 19 January that Murrell had been accused of embezzling almost £460,000 from the party.It was not until 13 February that details of the indictment were first published in the media. Murrell, 61, is yet to make a plea, with a preliminary hearing scheduled for 25 May.Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain - who has a dual role as the country's most senior law officer and a Scottish government minister - notified Swinney in an email on 19 January that Murrell had been indicted that day. Getty ImagesLord Advocate Dorothy Bain has a dual role as chief of the prosecution service and a minister in the Scottish governmentThe memo - first reported by the Scottish Sun and seen by BBC Scotland News - reiterated a \"longstanding tradition\" that the lord advocate would not be involved in decisions about a case involving a politician. The email was passed on to senior civil servants and special advisers, according to the Sun. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said Bain had sent the memo to ensure transparency. Swinney insisted he would respect \"the independence of the criminal process within our country and within our courts\".Operation BranchformMurrell, the estranged husband of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, stepped down as SNP chief executive in 2023 after more than two decades in the role. He was arrested that year as part of Operation Branchform, a police investigation into SNP finances. He was charged with embezzlement in April 2024.Murrell is accused of embezzling £459,000 from the party between August 2010 and January 2023.Details of a charge against him - including the illicit purchase of luxury goods, two cars and a motorhome, using party funds - were first reported in the media last week. Murrell had been expected to appear at the High Court in Glasgow for the preliminary hearing on Friday, but it has been postponed to 25 May at the High Court in Edinburgh.The Scottish government insisted it had no involvement in the decision to push back the hearing, which will now take place after the Holyrood election on 7 May. Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay has called for the lord advocate to explain to parliament why she sent the memo. He said: \"Why were the public kept in the dark while John Swinney was given a detailed private briefing which he then shared with civil servants and SNP spin doctors?\"An SNP minister has already denied any government meddling around delays to the case, but these new revelations will only fuel public suspicion and concern.\" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also called for Bain to appear before MSPs. In a letter to the law officer, he raised concerns that her dual role was \"structurally vulnerable in high-profile or politically sensitive cases\". \"It appears to many that your act was designed to confer clear political advantage in the run up to an election,\" Sarwar wrote. \"Scotland's top prosecutor cannot be involved in conduct that allows any party to gauge political exposure from a live indictment, or appears to do so, and still expect public confidence to hold.\" PA MediaFirst Minister John Swinney was sent the email last month The COPFS said previously that Bain and her deputy, Solicitor General Ruth Charteris, were not involved in the Murrell case because it involves politicians.A spokesperson for the COPFS said: \"The lord advocate provided the first minister with an update to ensure it was understood she was not involved in the case, that it was active for contempt of court, and therefore it should not be commented upon.\"This message was sent formally after the indictment had been served in order to form part of the record and ensure transparency in due course.\"Once an indictment has been served on an accused it stands to become public at any point.\"The Scottish government said it would not be appropriate to comment on live criminal proceedings.

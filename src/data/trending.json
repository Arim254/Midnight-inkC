    "body": "4 hours agoPaulin KolaEPAThe community in Crans-Montana remains in shock two weeks after the fireThe Swiss canton of Valais has banned pyrotechnic devices in all indoor public venues following the devastating fire at a bar on New Year's Eve where 40 people were killed and 116 were injured.Authorities said each of the victims would get a 10,000 franc ($12,500; £9,200) emergency payment, with a fund being set up to collect donations.The canton of Geneva also announced a ban on pyrotechnics in indoor venues - days after Vaud became the first of Switzerland's 26 regions to take such a decision.The blaze at Le Constellation bar in the ski resort of Crans-Montana is believed to have started when sparklers attached to champagne bottles set light to sound-insulating foam padding on the ceiling.EPA/ShutterstockJacques and Jessica Moretti, French owners of Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, say they are co-operating with the investigationAuthorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.The two co-owners of Le Constallation, French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. His wife has had to surrender her passport and report to police every day.The news that the bar had not been inspected for five years has shocked families of the victims, most of whom were young - eight were under the age of 16.Many of the injured have severe burns. Eighty remain in hospitals in Switzerland and other European countries.One of the lawyers representing families of the victims said on Tuesday that an online platform had been launched to receive testimonies related to the disaster.\"This initiative aims to facilitate the investigation for the benefit of the victims,\" Romain Jordan said - not to replace the official investigation.Among those who have died was the waitress who was seen in a video wearing a helmet and holding a champagne bottle with a sparkler attached and the ceiling catching fire.Identified widely as Cyane Panine, 24, and from Sète in south-east France, she is said to have been close to the managers of the bar. Her family have issued a statement saying: \"Whatever the outcome of the investigation, this young woman followed her employers' instructions. She did what the general manager asked her to do. Nothing unusual. This young employee is in no way responsible.\" ",

    "body": "'Appropriate and unambiguous': White House defends Trump over middle-finger gesture at hecklerThe White House has defended US President Donald Trump after he aimed an offensive gesture at a heckler during his appearance at a Ford factory in Detroit on Tuesday.Footage of the incident published by TMZ appears to show the president responding to a man who shouted at him from afar.The White House said: \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"The heckler has been suspended by Ford, the United Auto Workers union told the BBC's US partner, CBS News.A Ford spokesperson told CBS: \"One of our core values is respect and we don't condone anyone saying anything inappropriate like that within our facilities. \"When that happens, we have a process to deal with it but we don't get into specific personnel matters.\"According to the subtitles provided by TMZ, the heckler called Trump a \"paedophile protector\". In the clip, which shows Trump from a distance, the president can be seen speaking back at the heckler, allegedly mouthing an expletive as well as using a middle-finger gesture.  A man who spoke to The Washington Post, named TJ Sabula, reportedly identified himself as the man who shouted, saying he had \"no regrets\". He allegedly said he meant his remarks in reference to Trump's handling of the Epstein files. Trump has faced pressure for more transparency on what was uncovered by federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender.Trump signed a law that compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release all the files that it held on Epstein by 19 December, although only a fraction of the files have so far been made public.Trump was once friends with Epstein before they fell out, which Trump says was years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Trump was in Detroit on Tuesday to give a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. The president's public use of expletives have attracted headlines in the past - for example, when discussing the relationship between Iran and Israel last June.His predecessor Joe Biden also caused controversy for uttering an expletive during a conversation with a worker during his own visit to a factory in Detroit while on the campaign trail in 2020, before he was elected president.

    "body": "US envoy Steve Witkoff has announced the start of phase two of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, with a technocratic Palestinian government established in the territory.He said the second phase would also see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.\"The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations,\" he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Following the US announcement, regional mediators Egypt, Gaza and Turkey welcomed the formation of what they called the \"Palestinian Technocratic Committee to Administer the Gaza Strip\", saying it would \"contribute to strengthening efforts aimed at consolidating stability and improving the humanitarian situation\".They also revealed that the 15-member body would be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy planning minister in the Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control.The transitional administration will operate under the supervision of a \"Board of Peace\", which will be chaired by Trump, according to the 20-point plan he unveiled three months ago.Announcements related to the board are expected in the coming days, including when the president visits the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.Former UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov, who has been meeting Israeli and Palestinian officials, is set to be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza.Earlier on Wednesday, Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said in a joint statement that they had agreed to support the efforts to form the technocratic Palestinian government \"while providing the appropriate environment\" for it to begin work.The PA - which is dominated by Fatah, Hamas's rival - also expressed its support. Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh said Trump's leadership had \"contributed to creating a new opportunity for peace, stability, and good governance\", and urged all Palestinian factions, institutions and segments of society to \"ensure the success of this critical transitional phase\".The office of Israel's prime minister meanwhile said he had spoken on Wednesday evening with the parents of Ran Gvili, the last dead hostage in Gaza.Benjamin Netanyahu made it clear to Itzik and Talik Gvili \"that Ran's return is our top priority and that the declarative move to establish a technocratic committee will not affect efforts to return Ran for burial in Israel\", his office added.The 24-year-old police officer was among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,430 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMark Savage,music correspondentandLizo Mzimba,culture correspondent, High Court, LondonGetty ImagesThe Police, pictured on tour in Japan in 1981, from left to right: Andy Summers, Sting and Stewart Copeland Sting has paid his former bandmates in The Police more than half a million pounds after acknowledging underpaying royalties, court documents show.In a filing at London's High Court, the musician's lawyers said Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland received a payment of \"over $800,000\" (£595,000) after they launched legal proceedings last year.The pair sued Sting and his publishing company in September, claiming they were owed between $2m (£1.5m) and $10.75m (£8m) in royalties for hit songs like Roxanne and Every Breath You Take. At a hearing on Wednesday, their lawyers said their claim could rise above £8m.Sting denies that they are entitled to a portion of his income from streaming and download sales.His bandmates did not receive writing credits on most of The Police's hits, but argue that the group entered an \"oral agreement\" to share income in 1977, which was later formalised in written contracts.The agreement acknowledged that, although Sting was the chief composer, the other two members sometimes made crucial contributions - such as Summers' guitar line on Every Breath You Take.As a result, the trio decided that when any of them received publishing income for a song they had written, they would share a percentage of that money - usually 15% - with the other two members, in what was termed an arrangers' fee.Summers and Copeland argue he has withheld some of those payments. Getty ImagesThe trio famously have a fractious relationship, despite a reunion tour in 2008None of the band members were in court for the start of the two-day preliminary hearing on Wednesday.But lawyers for guitarist Summers and drummer Copeland are asking the court for permission to bring new and additional arguments that they are owed money from all downloads and streaming income, under the terms of their prior agreements made in 1997 and 2016.They say the language of those agreements should be interpreted in light of changes to the music industry, where streaming income has largely replaced the sale of vinyl, CDs and cassettes.In court papers, they acknowledged a recent payment from Sting and his publishing company, disclosing a figure of $870,000 (£647,000), but noted that no interest had been added to the \"historic underpayment\".Speaking in court on Wednesday, the musicians' lawyers said the total value of their claim was \"not less than £8m\" and \"will be considerably larger\" if their amended case is allowed to proceed.Meanwhile, Sting's lawyers argue that he shouldn't have to give his former bandmates royalties when The Police's music is played on streaming services like Spotify because that counts as \"public performance\" rather than a sale.Furthermore, they say Summers and Copeland are not eligible for royalties from streaming and digital sales because their 2016 agreement only allows for royalty payments derived \"from the manufacture of records\".They added that the musicians' attempt to amend their case should be thrown out as it has \"no real prospect of success\".The hearing, before Mr Justice Bright, is due to conclude on Thursday, with a trial expected at a later date.Success, collapse and reunionThe Police formed in 1977 and quickly became one of the UK's most successful bands.Their innovative fusion of rock guitars with reggae rhythms spawned chart-topping hits like Message in a Bottle, Walking on the Moon and Every Little Thing She Does is Magic.They earned a US number one single with Every Breath You Take, taken from their fifth album, Synchronicity, in 1983.It was later recognised as the most-played radio song of all time and was heavily sampled on P Diddy and Faith Evans' 1997 song I'll Be Missing You.However, The Police split up in 1984 amid personal and musical animosity.Copeland later told The Guardian that the members \"beat the crap out of each other\" during the \"very dark\" recording sessions for Synchronicity.They reformed in 2007 to open the Grammy Awards, before setting out on a lucrative world tour. Tickets for the British leg sold out in just 30 minutes, but the band dissolved again after the final date.In 2022, Sting sold the rights to his songwriting catalogue to Universal Music Group, with the deal covering both his solo hits and songs he penned for The Police.The deal was estimated to be worth $200m.",

    "body": "3 hours agoTinshui YeungTSGT Scott Reed, USAFAl-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle EastThe US and UK are reducing the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, as US President Donald Trump considers whether to take action against Iran over its crackdown on anti-government protests. Officials have told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\". The BBC understands some UK military personnel are also being removed. A Qatari government statement said the measures reportedly being taken by the US were \"in response to the current regional tensions\".Trump earlier said the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if the authorities execute protesters. Iran has said it will retaliate if attacked by the US.According to rights groups, more than 2,400 anti-government demonstrators have been killed in the recent violent crackdown by the Iranian authorities.Regarding the removal of military personnel, the Qatari government said it would continue to \"implement all necessary measures to safeguard the security and safety of its citizens and residents as a top priority, including actions related to the protection of critical infrastructure and military facilities\".Al-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle East and about 10,000 personnel are based there, as well as about 100 UK staff. It is not clear how many will be leaving.A UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson declined to comment on reports that UK personnel were being withdrawn \"due to operational security\".Citing diplomats, the Reuters news agency reported that while some personnel had been told to leave the base, there was no immediate sign of large numbers of troops being bussed out like in the hours before an Iranian strike last year.A senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Donald Trump on Wednesday that the June attack had demonstrated Iran's ability to respond to any attack.\"It would certainly help create a real understanding of Iran's will and capability to respond to any attack,\" Ali Shamkhani wrote in a post on X.The US Mission to Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has advised its personnel and citizens to \"exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region\".The US has been threatening to intervene in Iran over the killing of protesters. On Tuesday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Iranian authorities would \"pay a big price\" for the killings, and urged people to \"keep protesting\".He has also said that Iranian leaders had called him and that \"they want to negotiate\" but that the US \"may have to act before a meeting\".Iran's government has accused the US of seeking to \"manufacture a pretext for military intervention\", with the parliament speaker warning that if the US attacked, both Israeli and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets.The latest protests in Iran began at the end of December following the collapse of the currency and as the country deals with soaring living costs. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,403 protesters, as well as 12 children, despite an internet blackout. More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, the group also reported.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDanny FullbrookBedfordshire, Hertfordshire and BuckinghamshireHertfordshire PoliceJohn Alford was sentenced to eight and a half years in jail after sexually assaulting two teenagersActor John Alford has been sentenced to eight and a half years in jail after sexually assaulting two teenage girls.The former London's Burning and Grange Hill star bought a bottle of vodka for the 14 and 15-year-old girls which they drank at a friend's house in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, in April 2022.The 54-year-old, of Holloway, north London, stood trial at St Albans Crown Court under his real name of John Shannon.Jurors found him guilty on four counts of sexual activity with the younger girl, and of sexual assault and assault by penetration relating to the older teenager.Recorder Caroline Overton said the offences had a \"significant and ongoing impact\" on the victims' lives.Prosecuting lawyer Chris White added: \"John Shannon was fully aware of the girls' ages, yet he chose to exploit them – giving them alcohol and then committing sexual offences against them.\"Alford had denied the offences, and when the verdicts were delivered in September, he put his head in his hands and shouted \"wrong, I didn't do this\".He played Billy Ray in the ITV drama London's Burning and Robbie Wright in BBC series Grange Hill.PA MediaJohn Alford appeared in the ITV drama London's BurningBoth girls were at the house on the 9 April 2022 when he arrived after drinking with the homeowner at a nearby pub.The man who owned the house was friends with Alford and was the father of a third girl in the group.Alford bought about £250 worth of food, alcohol and cigarettes from a nearby petrol station in the early hours of the morning.According to the younger girl, Alford had sex with her in the garden of the house and in a toilet.She told police she asked him to stop \"three or four times\", adding: \"I told him to stop because I didn't want to have sex with an old man.\"The former actor sexually touched the older girl as she was half asleep on a living room sofa.Police then received a report from the 15-year-old's mother two days later.John Alford (left) played Robbie Wright in Grange Hill, alongside George Christopher (right) who appeared as Ziggy GreavesAlford told police the girls were attempting to extort money from him, and claimed he was the victim of a \"set-up\".He began to cry as he told jurors: \"I haven't done this.\"No DNA. I didn't touch them. I think science proves me not guilty.\"Alford had previous convictions - which included supplying drugs in 1999 when he was jailed for nine months - although none for sex offences.He had told jurors he was \"blacklisted\" from acting roles, after he was lured to a hotel by News of the World journalist Mazher \"Fake Sheikh\" Mahmood, who was posing as an Arabian prince.At sentencing, defence barrister Mohammed Bashir said: \"The impact upon the girls has been great but it's important to note that in that time Mr Shannon has not committed any further offences.\"The younger girl said in a statement, read at court on Wednesday, that being sexually assaulted had \"affected me and my family in every way\".In her impact statement, the older girl said \"this man destroyed my mental wellbeing\".More on this storyHM Courts & Tribunals Service",

    "body": "4 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editor\"Build it from the north\" was the cry from transport experts for years as tens of billions of pounds were channelled into projects in the south east, London, and even HS2's viaducts, verges, and bat tunnels in the home counties.The wide-ranging Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) plan is not just about rail expansion to realise the potential of the \"untapped goldmine of the North of England\" — although that is a big part of it.In the 2030s, it will see a new high speed line between Liverpool and Manchester, and later a line between Birmingham and Manchester to replace the cancelled leg of the HS2 project.As it seeks to right a long history of cross-party overpromising and under-delivery, the infrastructure plans unveiled on Tuesday are central to the political challenge facing Labour and its hopes of reviving economic growth.As well as championing HS2, former Chancellor George Osborne in 2015 pronounced in an old train shed near Old Trafford that the newly-elected majority Conservative government would roll out a high speed rail line across Labour's northern heartlands.Boris Johnson, elected on a pledge to \"level up\" northern England, latched onto the idea after winning a majority in 2019.But the political consensus behind the rail project was broken in 2023 by Rishi Sunak, who scrapped the northern leg of HS2 and left NPR alive in accounting terms only.Rail insiders said it had not even reached the \"crayons on a map\" stage.After winning a massive majority rooted in northern England, a nervous Labour government kicked a decision on NPR into the long grass.On Tuesday, however, its big decision finally came.Sources in Manchester suspect it was an upcoming deadline on the use of powers over HS2 land along this route that forced the government's hand in recommitting to a plan of some sort.What we are left with includes Manchester Airport becoming the most connected airport outside London with high speed. Better connections from Liverpool to Manchester and on to Leeds and Hull could also help create even more economic growth than the vital Oxford to Cambridge link currently being constructed.The timing is crucial. Manchester's council leader has warned the government the cancellation of HS2 was starting to see long-term investment in office space and regeneration shifted to Birmingham instead.Buildings that take a decade to open need at least the outline of a plan for connectivity, even if passengers won't see trains for a decade and a half.HS2's entire premise was \"for the north\", but its budget was blown on overspecified beautified lines in the south, so much so that it will never actually reach the north. It is effectively an extension of the London Tube to Birmingham.What has changed since 2015 is that Greater Manchester is now the fastest growing city in the UK. It boasts two Premier League big beasts, a teeming music scene, and has even snaffled the Brit awards. Manchester also has designs on a World Cup Final in 2035 and is rumoured to be mulling an Olympic bid.The difference in the government's plans this time, it argues, is that the planning has come first. There is a strategy in the sequencing of lines. The costs of the line will be cheaper as they will not be built to HS2 specifications. They have actively decided to go for a pricier line via the airport because of the growth impact. There is almost political consensus here.But there are pitfalls and mined areas ahead, quite literally.Some of the NPR route is over old unmapped mining areas, especially the Cheshire salt mines. No one is quite sure what lies beneath the green vistas which will be replaced by high speed rail.It is also quite the political junction. It delivers a win to Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who held out until this week on agreeing the deal, potentially providing Sir Keir Starmer some breathing room.Tuesday's move assuages what had been growing frustration at the lack of a big picture vision from the Labour government.And Burnham's people say that, as he weighs a leadership challenge after May's local elections, he is genuinely enjoying running booming Manchester.Reeves told me that, while the government would like to better connect the north and the south, it has chosen here to prioritise connections between northern towns and cities.Interesting, here, is the Reform factor. To some surprise, the insurgent party's leadership backed scrapping the London to Liverpool plan, though it would have supported an underground station in Greater Manchester.Deputy leader Richard Tice told contractors \"not to bother\" bidding for contracts, which a prospective Farage-Tice government would scrap.Labour's northern leaders implored the government to seize what they saw as an opportunity to push Reform back and appeal to northern England's pride in its infrastructure and concern about the money always found for projects \"down south\". It may be another reason for this green light.The chancellor says it is the most important decision she has made and it needed time to get right. It's going to take time to see a line, a train, or even a passenger. But for the long suffering rail commuters of the historic pioneering routes of northern England, there may be new tunnels, and there may be light in them too.It's a green signal, if not quite full speed ahead.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAlys DaviesAFPChiara Ferragni told reporters she was very happy her \"nightmare\" was overAn Italian fashion influencer has been acquitted of aggravated fraud, bringing a long-running scandal involving a charity Christmas cake to an end.Chiara Ferragni had been accused of misleading consumers by promoting the sale of a designer pink pandoro as well as Easter eggs that were said to be helping to raise money for a children's hospital and a charity.After a fast-track trial in Milan, a judge found her and two other defendants not guilty. Had she been convicted, she could have faced a jail term.Ferragni, 38, told reporters the judgment marked \"the end of a nightmare that lasted two years\".The scandal - dubbed \"pandorogate\" - started with the sale of pink special edition Christmas cakes in 2022.Consumers were led to believe that sales of the pandoro would go towards raising funds for a children's hospital in Turin. But it turned out that the cake's producer, Balocco, had given a one-off €50,000 (£43,300) donation to the hospital before the cake's launch.Ferragni has 28 million followers on Instagram and, after her companies made €1m from the promotion, she pledged to donate the same sum to the hospital.The outcry led authorities to initiate a formal investigation and the influencer was handed a €1m fine in 2023 by Italy's competition authority over the pandoro cakes, branded with her name and mentioning the children's hospital.Ferragni-branded Easter eggs also became part of the scandal, leading the influencer to agree to pay €1.2m to a children's charity to settle complaints that the eggs' sales allegedly misled consumers.She was later indicted on the aggravated fraud charges, along with business associate Fabio Damato. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of one year and eight months in prison for Ferragni but the judge rejected their accusation that the fraud should be seen as aggravated.The Milan court found that no aggravation had been involved as a consumer group had withdrawn its original complaint. Ferragni had agreed with consumer organisation Codacons that she would compensate consumers and donate money to a charity for women who had suffered gender violence.\"We are all moved,\" Ferragni told reporters at the end of the trial. \"The last two years have been very hard. I had faith in justice, and justice has been done.\"Despite her acquittal the scandal has proved damaging to Ferragni's brand and affected her personal life. Her marriage to Italian rapper Fedez fell apart last year.It has also led to tighter rules for Italian influencers to show greater transparency in their fund-raising initiatives.",

    "body": "3 hours agoShayan Sardarizadeh,Merlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianBBCCrowds of masked protesters gather in Tehran Warning: this story contains content which some readers might find distressingDistressing new videos have emerged from a mortuary in Tehran showing rows of bodies, blood soaked floors and crowds of people searching for loved ones following a deadly government crackdown on protesters in Iran.The videos analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian, which are too graphic to show, contain some of the most shocking examples so far of how brutal the government's retaliation has been since the unrest began on 28 December.Forensic examination of the footage reveals nearly 200 bodies laid throughout the mortuary complex, many with visible wounds and one victim identified as young as 16. Anti-government demonstrations have spread to more than 68 towns and cities, verified videos show, though the true figure is likely to be much higher. The near total internet blackout imposed by the government since last week has left more than 90 million Iranians almost completely cut off from the outside world.The number of people who have been killed in the protests is not fully known. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) places the estimate at more than 2,500. An Iranian official previously told Reuters 2,000 people have been killed but claimed \"terrorists\" were to blame.A black body bag shows the date of birth of a 16-year-old victimBBC Verify and BBC Persian have previously reported on images emerging from this mortuary but we are not showing these new videos because the images are too graphic.The footage was posted on Tuesday by Vahid, a US-based Iranian social media influencer and activist, who said they were filmed on 10 January inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in south Tehran.Vahid said the videos were filmed by a man who had travelled nearly 1,000km to find internet access. The man told BBC Persian he used mobile networks from neighbouring countries to upload the footage. Vahid has been posting dozens of videos documenting events inside the country for the outside world to see. Two of the videos show rows of body bags on the floor as the man walks up and down a road that runs through the northern section of the vast mortuary complex. He later moves through a courtyard and inside a large warehouse, and walks in and out of adjacent rooms filled with more body bags. At one point he is heard describing the scene as \"the apocalypse\".The man filming is heard saying, \"Today is Saturday, a day after the call\". He is referring to the call made by Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah, for nationwide protests that took place last Thursday and Friday night.Two more clips contain a collection of photos taken from the mortuary showing several bodies wrapped in the zip-up bags, including one which appears burnt.BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in the five-minute video and at least 178 bodies in the 16-minute clip. The two videos likely show some of the same bodies so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.The videos contain at least nine separate clips edited together. The positions of shadows in the footage indicate these sections were likely filmed at different times throughout the day. We have matched identifiable features from the complex, including separate buildings, the red roof of a warehouse and fences with satellite images on Google.The man films as he moves around inside the centre, where more bodies are kept on stretchers as well as the floor. The footage shows some body bags fully zipped up while others are either half or entirely unzipped, revealing victims' faces and injuries. Some are completely uncovered. We can see blood-soaked towels and sheets scattered around the complex with streaks of blood on the floor.Body bags laid outside in the courtyard of the mortuary complexA number of the bodies have visible wounds. Two bodies appear to be soaked in blood, and another is seen with a deep stomach wound.Some body bags have papers attached to them or details written on the body bags in a white marker such as a name, national ID number, date of birth and death, and in some cases their father's name. At least two men are described as unidentified on a sheet of paper attached to their bag, and at least one woman and one teenager are among the victims.The date of death on three of the male victims' body bags states 9 January. Another body bag shows a date of birth using the Iranian calendar. It says 1/1/1388, which corresponds to 21/3/2009, indicating that it belongs to a 16-year-old.During one moment in the 16-minute clip the man points his phone at a building to his right and a voice can be heard saying: \"There are many [bodies] inside. It's not possible to go inside… this is the women's area\". Iranian mortuaries separate the bodies of men and women for religious reasons.At a different point we can see a body bag at the back of a hearse and a man nearby is heard telling a female official that it is his sister.  Verifying Iran protest footage as internet blackout passes 100 hoursSeveral ambulances, hearses and vans are filmed around the grounds. Officials are seen inspecting the rows of bodies, taking swabs from the victims, and talking to potential loved ones.It is not clear why the bodies of those killed in anti-government protests may have been transferred to the centre, but eyewitness accounts provided to BBC Persian suggest hospitals have been overwhelmed with the number of casualties in the protests.HRANA, which has been tracking the death toll since the unrest began, has reported that 2,403 protesters, 147 people affiliated with the government, nine civilians and 12 children have been killed so far.Crowds of people, many who appear to be family members and friends, are seen walking in and out of the complex as they try to identify the bodies. Cries and wails are repeatedly heard throughout the videos as people mourn the loss of their loves ones.\"Some of our best people have been killed,\" the man filming is heard saying.Iranian state TV has since reported that a \"substantial\" number of bodies had been taken to the mortuary. It claimed the majority of the victims were members of Iran's security forces or passers-by who had nothing to do with the demonstrations.Most international news organisation, including the BBC, are restricted from operating inside the country so we have to rely on verifying footage on social media.Additional reporting by Roja Assadi and Richard Irvine-Brown",

    "body": "Mahmood has no confidence in police chief after Israeli fan ban47 minutes agoSusie RackandAlex McIntyre,West MidlandsHouse of CommonsHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood told MPs she had lost confidence in West Midlands Chief Constable Craig Guildford over the Maccabi Tel Aviv fan banHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood says she has lost confidence in West Midlands Police's chief constable after Israeli football fans were banned from a match against Aston Villa.Mahmood told MPs a \"damning\" review from the policing watchdog over the intelligence that led to Maccabi Tel Aviv fans being banned showed a \"failure of leadership\".The force has apologised saying it did not deliberately distort evidence that was used by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group for the 6 November game.Chief Constable Craig Guildford remains in post, but faces a meeting on 27 January to be questioned by Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster who has the authority to sack him.Mahmood told the Commons on Wednesday she intended to restore the power for home secretaries to dismiss chief constables \"who fail their communities\". Guildford has written a letter to her, in which he apologised for providing incorrect evidence to a Home Affairs Select Committee, which included the denial that AI was used in a report that led to the Israeli fans' ban.Mahmood told MPs His Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Andy Cooke had found \"confirmation bias\" in police intelligence gathering. She said: \"The force, we now discover, conducted little engagement with the Jewish community and none with the Jewish community in Birmingham before a decision was taken.\"Sir Andy's interim report, commissioned by Mahmood, found that \"rather than follow the evidence, the force sought only the details to support their desired position to ban the fans,\" Mahmood told MPs.\"He shows that the police overstated the threat posed by the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, while understating the risk that was posed to the Israeli fans if they travelled to the area,\" she said.Watch: Police chief blames non-existent game on \"social media scraping\" and Google searchThe decision to ban the fans from match was taken by the city's safety group based on evidence shared by police. In his apology, Guildford admitted AI had assisted searches and provided incorrect evidence that helped inform the decision.Some of the intelligence referred to a fixture between Maccabi Tel Aviv and West Ham that did not take place.At appearances on 1 December and 6 January, Guildford told the Home Affairs Select Committee the force \"do not use AI\", rather that it was a Google search that provided the erroneous information.In his letter to the chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee published on Wednesday, Guildford said the information \"arose as a result of a use of Microsoft Copilot\" and offered a \"profound apology\" for the mistake.Sir Andy's review found eight inaccuracies in a report from the force to Birmingham's safety group, including a reference to the non-existent Tel Aviv-West Ham game.Others included overstating the number of Dutch police officers deployed during a Maccabi match in Amsterdam and claims Muslim communities had been intentionally targeted by Tel Aviv fans.The decision on the ban from the safety group - which is made up of representatives from the council, police and other authorities - prompted political outrage, including from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.Guildford has insisted the decision was not politically influenced.'Wider concerns'In a joint statement, the Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews said the interim report confirmed their \"long-held concerns\".\"The threats posed by Maccabi Tel Aviv fans were overstated based on numerous inaccurate claims, and the genuine risk to them was understated,\" they said.\"The HMIC report has also confirmed there was a failure to engage with the local Jewish community.\"They called on Foster to \"exercise his authority\" and dismiss Guildford \"without delay\".\"This case signals wider concerns about the factors influencing police judgement and decision making,\" they added.West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster is to question Guildford on issues around the ban later in JanuaryWest Midlands Police (WMP) said it would continue to engage with the inspection and said the findings recognised the \"unintentional nature\" of its errors.\"We are extremely sorry for the impact these have had on individuals and their communities,\" a spokesperson said.\"We are taking immediate action to address the matters raised in these preliminary findings.\"We know that mistakes were made, but reiterate the findings that none of this was done with an intent of deliberate distortion or discrimination.\"They said planning around the football match was about \"public safety of all communities\".\"We will now work tirelessly to rebuild confidence in West Midlands Police,\" the force added.Foster said he wanted to question Guildford further at his Accountability and Governance Board, in a meeting scheduled for 27 January.He said he acknowledged the \"significant strength of feeling\" on the matter and said he had read Sir Andy's \"preliminary views\".\"I have been sent that letter having had no sight of, or briefing on, its contents before today. I must now give it careful and detailed consideration,\" Foster said.'Weakness and fear'Foster added it was his statutory duty to hold Guildford to account and he planned to give issues \"full and proper consideration\".The West Midlands Mayor, Richard Parker, and Birmingham City Council leader John Cotton have both also called for Guildford to resign.Following Mahmood's statement Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, also called for the chief constable to be sacked, describing the saga as a \"shameful episode\".He said WMP failed to act on the threat of \"vicious antisemitism\" and that this was done \"through weakness and fear\".Philp also challenged Mahmood over her point about restoring home secretaries' authority to sack chief constables, adding: \"She must stop pretending to have no power and actually act.\"More on this story",

    "body": "9 hours agoMatt ChorleyPresenter, BBC Radio 5 LiveGetty ImagesPolitics is a game of compromise. Labour MPs know that to get the bits they like, they might have to put up, possibly even publicly defend, the things they don't. But another government U-turn, this time on digital ID for right-to-work checks, has left them privately wondering if they should bother in future.As one North East MP, elected for the first time in 2024, put it, Labour MPs now have \"a choice between loyalty and dignity\". Do they go out and defend a government policy in the media, in the Commons and to their constituents, or risk looking \"daft\" when Downing Street U-turns on it.Another publicly loyal new MP said: \"There's no point defending anything remotely difficult the leadership announces, because it's likely to be rowed back on. Whatever the merits of individual policy, we're in a position where we can't ever say for sure it'll happen. Absolutely ridiculous.\"For my show on BBC Radio 5 Live, I have been in touch with dozens of Labour MPs and ministers since it was announced that Sir Keir Starmer was dropping plans to force people to sign up to its digital ID scheme in order to prove their right to work in the UK.Some were disappointed that an idea they supported had been ditched. \"I'm probably one of the few Labour MPs who supports digital ID,\" said one. \"I think we sold it badly though from start.\"Another said: \"Why are we U-turning on this? Pick what you think is right and argue for it. It's all 12-dimensional chess. We're too simple to understand. Problem is everyone else is too.\"Others were pleased. A minister said: \"It was unpopular and expensive. It should never have been announced without being costed first.\" A backbencher added: \"It was clearly meant to appeal to Reform-leaning voters, but in fact had the opposite effect.\" 'Dead on arrival'A steadfast few tried to insist that this change of heart was just the business of government. \"They were still consulting,\" said one loyalist. \"Changing things with public mood is how consultation works. It's all fine.\"This, it has to be said, is a minority view. Instead, there is widespread anger and dismay at the handling of the policy reversal, coming hot on the heels of others related to business rate rises for pubs and inheritance tax changes for farmers.One minister who supported digital ID told me: \"Sadly it was dead on arrival due to the utterly hopeless and half-hearted way in which it was announced. No attempt to prepare the ground, no out-riders, no strategy for winning the argument.\"It almost felt like a reluctant concession rather than a front-foot policy or campaign. Arguably the worst bit of comms since July '24, and that's a very crowded field…This really was a case study in how not to do politics.\"'Inevitable'Long-serving Labour MPs blamed the lack of long-term planning by the prime minister's team. \"The problem comes from having had no deeply considered policy programme that the government came in to implement. They are constantly chasing after policies and trying to implement them without stress-testing them against backbenchers and the public.\"Another said: \"This one was inevitable. Policy making on the hoof inevitably sees the horse fall at the first fence.\"So what now? Several MPs highlighted recent comments from Wes Streeting, the health secretary seen by some as a frontrunner to replace Sir Keir, who said the government should try to \"get it right first time\" hours before the ID about-turn.Some went further, and brought up the prospect of the next change being a change in leader. \"The PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] are utterly sick to death of being marched up the hill,\" said one. \"They're trying to clear the decks to reset, but we all know the reset that's now required.\"Another furious MP was disappointed that it was Sir Keir himself who had ditched the policy: \"I'd hoped that the PM's successor would do it to signal a change of direction. We'll have to find something else…\"Listen to Matt Chorley live from Westminster, weekdays from 14.00 on BBC Radio 5 Live. ",

    "body": "Ten British \"far-right activists\" have been banned from France after engaging in actions to stop migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, the French interior ministry said on Wednesday.It said the activists, who belonged to a group called Raise the Colours, had been searching for and destroying small boats along France's northern coast, and were involved in \"propaganda activity\".Authorities have not released their identities. BBC News has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment.In a statement, Raise the Colours said it had always maintained that its activities must remain peaceful and within the law and it \"does not support violence or any unlawful activity\".The ministry said it became aware of the group's actions in December 2025 which were likely to cause \"serious disturbances to public order\".Their efforts were \"aimed at the British public, called upon to strengthen the ranks of the movement to put an end to the migratory phenomenon\", the ministry said.The 10 British nationals are prohibited from entering and residing in France.French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said in a post on X that France's \"rule of law is non-negotiable; actions that are violent in nature or incite hatred have no place on our territory\".Raise the Colours said it had not received any formal notification of France's measure but understood the ban was against \"specific individuals, rather than the organisation as a whole\".The group described itself as a \"grassroots movement for unity and patriotism\" involved in a UK flag-raising campaign and that it had documented events in northern France around \"illegal Channel crossings\".Its website stated that it did not support \"vigilante behaviour, unauthorised activity, or attempts by individuals to take the law into their own hands\".Home Office figures show that 41,472 migrants crossed the Channel in 2025, a 13% rise from 2024. It is the highest number since 2022, when nearly 46,000 migrants crossed.Between 1 January and 5 January 2026, a total of 32 people crossed the English Channel by small boat from France.Since last year, a social media account called Raise the Colours has been circulating videos of its activities in France.Small boat crossings have become the most common way for people to be detected entering the UK illegally since 2020.In November, following months of pressure from the UK, France agreed to start intercepting small boats in the Channel.",

    "body": "Bafta names rising stars who are tipped for film success8 hours agoFreddy TennysonBBC NewsGetty ImagesLeft-right: Chase Infiniti, Miles Caton and Robert Aramayo are among the actors on the shortlistThe nominees for Bafta's Rising Star award have been announced, shining a spotlight on some of the film industry's most exciting up-and-coming acting talent.This year's list features a mix of British actors and American names, with the US represented by Sinners star Miles Caton and One Battle After Another's Chase Infiniti.They are joined by three Brits - Robert Aramayo, who starred in I Swear; Archie Madekwe, who appeared in Lurker; and Posy Sterling, from films including Lollipop.The EE Rising Star Award is the only Bafta film prize to be voted for by the public. Previous recipients include James McAvoy, John Boyega and Emma Mackey.This year's winner will be announced at the Bafta Film Awards ceremony in February.Getty ImagesHull's Aramayo makes the shortlist for his performance as a young man growing up with Tourette's syndrome in the 1980s in I Swear.The film was based on the real-life experience of John Davidson, the subject of an acclaimed BBC documentary in the 80s, and 33-year-old Aramayo called it \"the hardest role I've ever done\".His star has been steadily rising over the past decade. After graduating from the renowned Juilliard School in New York in 2018, Aramayo made his mark with his breakthrough role as a young Ned Stark in Game of Thrones.On his Bafta nomination, Aramayo said: \"If young Robert only knew he'd be standing here as an EE Rising Star nominee today, he'd be very proud.\"Miles CatonEPACaton, 20, is having a breakout moment. His performance as Sammie in Sinners has already earned him a Critics' Choice Award for best young actor and a nomination for best supporting actor at the Actor Awards (formerly the Screen Actors Guild Awards).Growing up in a musical family in New York, Caton began performing at an early age. He is the son of gospel singer Timiney Figueroa, and a childhood video of him singing Nina Simone's Feeling Good was later used in a short film by Jay-Z. By the age of 16, he had gone on a global tour as a backing singer for H.E.R.Sinners is his only film role so far, but he said acting \"has become something that I definitely want to take seriously and move further in\".Chase InfinitiReutersIn her breakthrough role as Willa in One Battle After Another, Infiniti stars opposite Leonardo DiCaprio as the fiercely independent daughter of a former revolutionary.Before that, the US actress, 25, had already started making a name for herself. She first came to wider attention in Apple TV+ legal thriller Presumed Innocent, playing Jaden Sabich opposite Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Negga.Infiniti graduated with a theatre arts BFA from Columbia College Chicago in 2022, where she honed her acting on stage before shifting focus to film and television.Archie MadekweGetty ImagesMadekwe is nominated off the back of his role in Lurker, a psychological thriller in which he plays an up-and-coming pop star who is blackmailed by a superfan.Madekwe originally auditioned to play the superfan but ended up being cast in the lead role. He has also appeared in films like Saltburn and Midsommar.The south London-born actor, like previous Bafta Rising Star Award winner Tom Holland, is an alumni of the Brit School, a training ground for some of the UK's most notable names. Eagle-eyed fans may also recognise him from early bit parts in Channel 4 sitcoms such as Fresh Meat and Hang Ups.Madekwe said it feels \"surreal to be included this year\" in the line up. Posy SterlingReutersManchester-born Sterling is nominated for Lollipop, in which she plays a single mum who emerges from prison only to find herself battling her own mother for custody of her children.The raw, emotionally charged performance has already earned Sterling the British Independent Film Award for breakthrough performance.It is her first leading role in a feature film, but she has been steadily building a reputation on screen with standout appearances in TV dramas including The Road Trip and You Don't Know Me.Sterling said she felt \"genuinely overwhelmed by this recognition\".The rest of the Bafta Film Awards nominations will be announced on 27 January.The ceremony will take place at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 22 February, hosted by Alan Cumming, and will be broadcast on BBC One and iPlayer.",

    "body": "'Sentenced to death within days': Who is Erfan Soltani, Iranian protester reportedly facing execution?4 hours agoMalu CursinoHengaw Organization for Human RightsA man arrested in connection with the current wave of protests in Iran has been sentenced to death and told he faces imminent execution, his family and a human rights group say.Erfan Soltani, 26, was arrested last Thursday in the city of Fardis, just west of Tehran. Days later, authorities informed his family his execution had been scheduled for Wednesday without giving any additional details, according to Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw.Iran's judiciary has not yet commented on Soltani's case or announced any execution in connections with the protests. The internet blackout imposed by the government has also made obtaining information on his status - and others in potentially similar situations - difficult.Awyer Shekhi of Hengaw told the BBC she feared there were \"many\" cases like Soltani's, highlighting the scale and speed to which Iranian authorities were carrying out violent crackdowns compared to previous protests.On Tuesday, one of Soltani's relatives told BBC Persian that a court had issued a death sentence \"in an extremely rapid process, within just two days\".Soltani is a resident of Fardis, Karaj, where he owns a clothes shop. He was arrested \"at his private residence\", Hengaw said in a statement.Iranian authorities have reportedly failed to give Soltani's family any more information about his case, citing only that he had been arrested in connection with a protest.His sister, who is a lawyer, tried to pursue the case but authorities told her there was nothing to pursue, Shekhi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\"He is just someone who is against the current situation in Iran... now he's received a death sentence for expressing his opinion.\" Shekhi said prisoners on death row in Iran were typically granted a final visit by their loved ones before their execution.While the Iranian authorities had told the family they would allow a meeting with Erfan before his execution, he had not been allowed any contact with his family since his arrest, she added.There was a \"high chance\" other people in Iran were in a similar position to Soltani, but there was little information about them because of the internet shutdown, according to Shekhi.President Donald Trump has said the US will take \"very strong action\" against Iran if it executes protesters - telling Iranians to \"KEEP PROTESTING\" in a post on his Truth Social platform. He also said he has cancelled all meetings with Iranian officials \"until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY\".Authorities in Tehran imposed an internet blackout last Thursday, as the protests escalated and authorities stepped up their deadly crackdown.The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,417 protesters, as well as 12 children and 10 uninvolved civilians, despite the blackout. Nearly 150 people affiliated with the security forces or government had also been killed, the group said.At least 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, according to HRANA.Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei has pledged swift legal action against what he called \"rioters\". According to Mohseni-Ejei, those who have \"committed terrorist acts should definitely be given priority for trial and punishment\".Authorities were planning to hold open trials for some of the main figures involved in recent unrest, with proceedings accessible to the media, he said on Wednesday.But Iran's handling of Soltani's case \"constitutes a clear violation of international human rights law\", Hengaw's statement said, adding: \"The rushed and non-transparent handling of this case has heightened concerns over the use of the death penalty as a tool to suppress public protests.\"\"Erfan is the first protester to be sentenced to death, but he won't be the last,\" the US State Department said on its Farsi-language X account.The protests, which have reportedly spread to more than 180 cities and towns in all 31 provinces, were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living.They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.At least 12 men have been executed in Iran over the past three years after being sentenced to death in connection with the 2022 \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" protests. That nationwide unrest was triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was accused by morality police of wearing \"improper\" hijab.Human rights groups say the last such execution happened on 6 September, when Mehran Bahramian was hanged in Isfahan.The Norway-based group, Iran Human Rights, reported at the time that the authorities had tortured Bahramian to obtain confessions and that he did not receive a fair trial. He was sentenced to death by a court in January 2024 on the charge of \"enmity against God\" for allegedly killing a member of the Revolutionary Guards at a protest in Semirom in December 2022, it said.",

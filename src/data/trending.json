    "body": "Do Liverpool fans think Slot is under pressure?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arne Slot was added to the banner above - created by the Irish Kop website - before the 2025-26 seasonByEmily SalleyBBC Sport journalist and Ellie ThomasonBBC Sport Senior JournalistArne Slot has already cemented his place in Liverpool history.The 47-year-old Reds manager is one of the iconic faces on a banner displayed on the Kop before every home game, alongside Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Kenny Dalglish, Rafael Benitez and Jurgen Klopp - Liverpool managers who have won either a top-flight title or European Cup.After winning the Premier League in his first season, and spending almost £450m on a new-look squad in the summer, it seemed as though Slot was going to carry on in the same fashion this season.They started their title defence with five straight wins - albeit leaving it late at times - but have now gone over a month without a Premier League victory.They sit seventh in the table, seven points behind leaders Arsenal, and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, losing 3-0 at home to Crystal Palace.After six defeats in their past seven games, BBC Sport spoke to Liverpool fans to find out what's going on this season and how they feel towards the manager.'We are losing patience'Slot's squad selection for Wednesday's EFL Cup defeat by Crystal Palace sparked huge debate.He made 10 changes from Liverpool's last outing, handing out two debuts and naming three teenagers in his starting line-up, plus a further five among his substitutes.The likes of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Dominik Szoboszlai, Cody Gakpo, Florian Wirtz, Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike were all absent as the Reds made a tame exit in a competition they have won twice in the past four seasons.Liverpool fan Abigail Rudkin told BBC Sport she is disappointed by Slot's decision-making.\"Walking to the game last night, me and my dad got the team sheet and we were like 'he's sacrificed this',\" she said. \"I understand we are losing games at the moment but you need to try and get a winning mentality back.\"We are losing patience. I think there are two different sides of the fanbase at the minute. \"There are those on social media that are calling on him to lose his job, and there are the people I see at the ground, like me, who are losing patience going to these games and not enjoying it as much with losing the games, but they also want to stay patient with him because we are very grateful to him for what we've had from last season when we thought it would all fall apart without Jurgen Klopp.\"Jordan Chamberlain from Empire of the Kop said he will forgive Slot's team selection on Wednesday if Liverpool beat Aston Villa on Saturday.\"This is the one that matters,\" he said. \"Then Real Madrid and Manchester City. If we get three negative results in the next week, then Slot's job will be genuinely under threat.\"But to suggest he should lose his job on the back of a match [against Palace, in which] he fielded players many fans haven't heard of is ludicrous. \"Slot's been very poor and has made some horrible tactical choices this season that have restricted his best players and left us wide open. We've also had some bad luck and missed too many chances. It's football. He deserves time to turn it around and I back him to do so.\"Fellow fan Ryan agreed it's \"way too soon\" to be talking about getting rid of Slot, but said players need to take responsibility and shoulder some of the blame too.\"We don't turn into a bad team overnight,\" he said. \"But Slot doesn't help himself with some of his decisions - and that is what he can control.\"Liverpool operate differently and I can't see us cutting Slot and his staff so soon. However, results are what count, ultimately, and if things don't improve - and quickly - then we all know how the road ends.\"The players have to step up too, by the way - it shouldn't all be on the manager. Some have been way, way below an acceptable standard for Liverpool.\"'More than footballing reasons behind slump'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jota had two years remaining on his Liverpool contract when he diedLiverpool fan Josh Sexton - who contributes to The Anfield Wrap - told BBC Sport there are a multitude of reasons why this season's form has been suffering.\"Key players are out of form, a few players are struggling for fitness, or suffering from injury issues, and there is a lack of continuity from last season,\" he said.\"A lot of those continuity issues stem from the business done in the summer, most of which was necessary for one reason or another and I don't think many Liverpool fans would look back and say that they regret the departures of any players besides possibly Luis Diaz and the profile of the player that Trent Alexander-Arnold is - the emotion attached to that exit causes this supporter to not miss the man himself as such.\"The variable within all of this is that one player we lost in the summer was lost in the most tragic of circumstances very unexpectedly, and there are more reasons than just footballing ones why that loss is absolutely immeasurable.\"Sexton said the emotions of Mohamed Salah after Liverpool's first game against Bournemouth showed how Diogo Jota's death has impacted not only the players who were his team-mates, but also the new arrivals, who have come into a dressing room that has been hit hard by the loss of a close friend.\"The tributes from within the club and from the supporters serve as a constant celebration of the magnificent human being that we were lucky enough to call one of our own, but of course they can also stir up feelings of grief and loss which can't be easy to perform through at an elite level,\" he added.\"And yet that is exactly what Liverpool have to do with the target on their back as Premier League champions, and I've not noticed any drop in heads or performance per se when those vocal tributes have been paid (the song the fans sing in Jota's memory actually started later than 20 minutes against Manchester United as Cody Gakpo went through on goal and hit the post).\"It will no doubt be having a general impact, but we'd all do well to remember everybody has their own grieving process and give each other the leeway to carry on despite such an unspeakable tragedy.\"'Always going to be a tough season'Earlier this month Liverpool captain Van Dijk addressed the fact that the club was mourning the death of Jota, who died in a car crash in July.\"It was always going to be a tough season,\" he said after a 2-1 defeat by Chelsea on 4 October.\"Nobody said that it was going to be plain sailing whatsoever.\"It was always going to be ups and downs for multiple reasons that we shouldn't forget, and all we have to do is stick together.\"Speaking on Radio 5 Live on Wednesday night, former Liverpool full-back Stephen Warnock said: \"You've got a team that's mourning in that changing room. How do the new players integrate into that? It's a horrible situation.\"It has to have an effect. They are human beings.\"One thing I notice every time I come to Anfield or watch Liverpool play is the Diogo Jota song after 20 minutes goes up and there is a 5-10 min spell where the tempo drops completely.\"The players are hearing that song and your mind will wander in that moment to one of their friends and close colleagues. In the changing room his locker is still there, so you're sat with a constant reminder of that person you've lost and that can't be easy. \"Some people will be able to put that to one side but for some it will weigh really heavy on their shoulders.\"Just a lull, or time for change?Media caption, Fans react as Liverpool lose againWe asked if it is too soon to talk about Slot's job being under threat, or if change should not be ruled out.Here are some of your comments:Paschal: Just a lull Liverpool are going through. Slot will turn it around. Just a matter of putting the players in positions they are comfortable and happy to play in. Time to put Joe Gomez at right-back and give him a chance. Let the new players have time to settle in. Patience is needed - it will come right.James: If Slot can't turn things around quickly then his position does need consideration. You can't make the financial commitment Liverpool have made and not see results. People continually mention transition and bedding in, but top, top players should hit the ground running - likewise managers.Karl: He should be given more time. We aren't a knee-jerk reaction team. Everyone is still dealing with the loss of Diogo Jota, and then adding so many new players into the mix. He is still the right man for the job.Barry: Lose the next three and I honestly feel something has to done before we fall too far behind for even a top-four spot.Paul: To suggest Slot is in trouble would be akin to saying last season never happened! We are not, and never have been, a 'sacking club'. We leave desperation to others. The guy has earned a year at least to sort this new team out. The talent is clearly there, but they haven't clicked yet. Time, ladies and gentlemen, please.Terry: Not sure Slot is the right man to get us out of trouble. We spent so much money on players and he doesn't seem to know how to play them. I think he's under pressure now, he needs to win games soon or he's gone.",

    "body": "10 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe UK's winter flu season has begun five weeks earlier than usual, health officials are warning.The UK Health Security Agency said cases were rising quickly among children and young people – and warned the virus would soon start to spread across older age groups.The organisation urged people eligible for the flu vaccine to come forward to get protected.But they said it was too early to say how difficult and serious this year's flu season would be.One of the concerns is that the flu season could peak before the majority of the vulnerable groups have got immunised - the vaccination campaign has only been running a few weeks.Two of the worst winter flu seasons of the past decade have been seen in the last three years, something partly attributed to the bounce-back of the virus after Covid restrictions and when immunity has been low.Last year nearly 8,000 people died from flu and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths.UKHSA flu lead Dr Suzanna McDonald said: \"We are worried that flu has started to circulate a little bit earlier than usual.\"It's a very serious disease. It's not just a nasty cold. \"We have started to see early activity, particularly in young adults, mainly sort of university age students, and also with school-aged children. \"We would expect in the coming weeks that this will start to spread throughout the community and this is something that we will monitor very closely.\"Dr Alex Allen, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, urged all eligible people to come forward for vaccination.Everyone aged 65 and over, pregnant women and those with certain long-term health conditions can get a free flu jab on the NHS.\"If you're eligible for a vaccine it is because you are at greater risk of severe illness – every year we see many thousands end up in hospital and far too many deaths from flu. \"It's crucial that everyone eligible books their appointment as soon as possible. The vaccine is our best defence.\"He also reminded parents of under 16-year-olds to return consent forms to school so their children can get vaccinated, or if they are aged two and three to arrange a vaccine via their GP.\"The nasal spray vaccine can help stop your child from getting very unwell and reduce the risk of passing flu to vulnerable family members.\"Anyone with flu or Covid symptoms – including high temperature, cough, and feeling tired or achy – should minimise contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable. \"If you need to go out with symptoms, consider wearing a face covering, wash hands regularly and ensure indoor spaces are well ventilated,\" he added. Meanwhile, UKHSA said Covid cases were decreasing and the virus was now at baseline levels.",

It is also understood that he did not object to the King's decision to remove his titles.His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew.Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation.

    "body": "19 hours agoJonathan GeddesGlasgow and west reporterGetty ImagesAt least 32 people in Dumbarton were accused of witchcraftToday it sits as a nondescript car park behind a large council office.Yet hundreds of years ago an unassuming patch of land in Dumbarton was the location for some of Scotland's darkest moments - as locals who had been accused of witchcraft were led there to be executed. More than two dozen people in the town were accused and tortured in the belief that they were doing Satan's bidding, as religious fervour swept the area during the 17th Century.Now campaigners are hoping to spotlight the names of those accused and pay tribute to them with a memorial.In 2022 Nicola Sturgeon offered a formal apology to people accused of witchcraft between the 16th and 18th Centuries.About 4,000 Scots, mostly women, were accused of breaking the Witchcraft Act between 1563 and 1736, and the vast majority were executed.Louise Wilson has been researching the history of witches in Dumbarton, where she believes suspicion of witchcraft was common. Through historical records she has already found 32 cases of people accused from 1624 to 1697 - with 22 of those executed.Of the remaining 10, one fled the region while the fates of the other nine have been lost to history.\"Port towns had a lot of accused in Scotland,\" explains Louise, the secretary of Remembering The Accused Witches of Scotland.\"A lot of hustle and bustle leads to more accusations, so as well as Dumbarton it was the same on the coast of Fife and in Ayr. The failing of the crops, or bad trade or a ship having trouble – these would all be blamed on witches.\"RAWSRemembering The Accused Witches of Scotland would like a memorial placed in DumbartonWitch hunts took place in many countries during that period, but academics have previously said Scotland's execution rate was five times the European average.For Louise, the most terrifying aspect of the accusations lies in how easily they could be made, often with little evidence.   \"These were ordinary people doing ordinary jobs, but if you argue with your neighbour you could end up accused of witchcraft,\" says Louise.\"There is a woman called Jonet Boyd, in 1628.  A man called Robert Glen, who was a notary, accused her. \"He had met her on the street and said she threw words and obscenities at him, grabbed his clock, whipped him around and threw a stone at him. Two witnesses also confirmed this happened. \"The next morning he accused her of witchcraft – however there is nothing in the records about whether he had done something to her to make her act like that.  Maybe she turned him down – we don't know.\"Jonet Boyd was executed as a result of the accusations from Robert Glen.Not all the accused were women, though the majority were. Louise recounts a slater called John McWilliam, who fled to Stranraer after being accused of witchcraft for a second time, before going on trial in Edinburgh. He was then executed in 1655.Louise WilsonLouise Wilson believes it is important to remember those falsely accused Other signs of witchcraft listed in local records include not attending church and talking to animals, which were assumed to be a witch's familiar - meaning a supernatural creature helping the accused.If someone was accused, they would be subject to brutal torture aimed at securing a confession. However methods often associated with witch trials, such throwing them into water with hands tied behind their back, were more common in England rather than Scotland.Scottish alternatives were not any more pleasant, however.\"Things like dooking or hanging weren't done in Scotland – they were strangled and burned instead,\" says Louise.\"They would be kept awake for three days and three nights, getting beaten told to keep walking while have accusations screamed at them. They also used thumb and finger screws, iron boots and crimp claws.\"They would be stripped naked and their hair shaved, then brought in front of a judiciary of ministers and highly ranked men in the town.\"Someone would search for the devil's mark to prove they were in league with Satan - that could be something like a mole or a birthmark.  So by the time they were executed they looked the typical stereotype of a Halloween witch.\"GoogleThe site for witches' executions is now a car park for the council.Those stereotypes might bring to mind images of black hats, broomsticks and cackling over cauldrons, common in much media.However for the accused, the effect of the accusations - even if later cleared - were immense. In Dumbarton the situation was stoked by zealous local ministers, with the Covenanter movement having considerable influence at the time.\"You had ministers saying witches were among us, they are in thrall to Satan and it was being drummed in people that witches were among the community. \"This lasted for over 150 years but it's not well known about, it's not being taught in history classes.\"Louise and the rest of the RAWS team are now seeking to place a memorial at the execution site off Church Street in Dumbarton.They will also host a conference at Maryhill Burgh Halls on 8 November. Earlier councillors discussed the matter, and agreed that it was important to remember the victims.A West Dunbartonshire Council spokesperson said: \"We have been engaging with Remembering the Accused Witches of Scotland who are keen to install a fitting memorial.\"For Louise, a display would be important, as would telling the stories of those accused to future generations.\"When you say their names and tell their stories, it's a way of remembering them.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoCharlotte EdwardsBusiness reporterVirgin Trains has moved closer to being able to run rail services through the Channel Tunnel after the regulator approved its application to share a depot with Eurostar.The decision by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) means Eurostar's monopoly on passenger services is set to be broken for the first time since the tunnel opened in 1994.Temple Mills railway storehouse in east London is the only depot in the UK able to accommodate the larger trains used in continental Europe and which is already linked to the cross-Channel line.Virgin aims to start running services from 2030. Eurostar said it was reviewing the decision and \"considering our next steps to ensure we can continue to grow\".\"Our priority is to deliver for passengers the benefits of the investments in a new fleet, jobs, and depot facilities that we recently announced,\" a Eurostar spokesperson said.Previously, the ORR had said the Temple Mills depot had enough space to either house an expanded Eurostar fleet or accommodate a rival company's trains – but not both.The regulator said a number of steps needed to be taken before new international services could run. Virgin needs to enter into a commercial agreement with Eurostar, will have to secure finance, access to track and stations, and have to get safety approvals from UK and EU authorities.But the ORR said its decision unlocked plans for around £700m of investment and could create 400 new jobs, describing it as \"a win for passengers, customer choice, and economic growth\".Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, said: \"The ORR's decision is the right one for consumers – it's time to end this 30-year monopoly and bring some Virgin magic to the cross-Channel route.\"Rail Minister Lord Hendy said he was \"incredibly pleased\" with the ORR's decision and called it a \"significant step forward\".\"Allowing Virgin Trains to share this vital facility will give passengers greater choice, better value and improve connectivity for millions, as well as drive innovation, lower fares and promote greener connections with Europe,\" he said.Martin Jones, deputy director of Access and International at the ORR, said: \"While there is still some way to go before the first new services can run, we stand ready to work with Virgin Trains as their plans develop.\"Several firms had wanted to start operating services between London and mainland Europe, including Spanish start-up Evolyn, Richard Branson's Virgin and a partnership between Gemini Trains and Uber.The ORR only approved Virgin's application on Thursday and rejected applications from Evolyn, Gemini and Trenitalia.Virgin said it planned to launch rail services from London St Pancras to Europe from 2030.This will include services to Paris Gare du Nord, Brussels-Midi and Amsterdam Centraal, with future plans to expand further across France, and into Germany and Switzerland.The plans would mean Virgin Trains returning to the rails for the first time since 2019, when the company lost its contract to Avanti West Coast.Virgin Trains had operated a service running from London Euston via Birmingham and Manchester to Scotland for 22 years before it was disqualified from bidding for the franchise.",

    "body": "A 70-year-old man has died and three other people have been injured in a helicopter crash in Doncaster, police have confirmed.Emergency services were called to a field off Ings Lane, Bentley, at about 10:15 GMT.The pilot, a 41-year-old man, and two other passengers, a 58-year-old woman and a 10-year-old boy, received minor injuries, South Yorkshire Police said.The aircraft had taken off from Retford Gamston Airport, in Nottinghamshire, shortly before it crashed.South Yorkshire Police said the older man had died at the scene of the crash \"despite the best efforts of medical staff\".\"His family is aware and being supported by our officers,\" they added.Det Insp Matt Bolger said: \"Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the man who sadly died in this tragic incident.\"South Yorkshire Police and the government's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) have launched a joint investigation into the incident.Det Insp Bolger asked anyone who saw the crash or had information about the incident to contact officers.\"We are particularly keen to hear from those with footage of the helicopter leading up to the crash,\" he added.The road remains closed and officers and emergency services are also still at the scene.Retford Gamston Airport said in a short statement: \"We can confirm an aircraft based here, operated by an onsite tenant, has been involved in an incident. \"We've no further information at this time.\"A spokesperson for the AAIB said a team of experts in aircraft operations, engineering and recorded data had been deployed to the site.The BBC's Liz Roberts is at the scene and said a large police cordon had been put in place and a private ambulance had attended.\"About 500m down the lane from where I'm standing I can see more police activity, by the side of the field the helicopter crashed in,\" she said.\"The scene is no longer accessible. There's a no-fly zone for drones and the road has been closed by the Refood bioenergy site.\"Curtis Borkowski, who works on a building site nearby, said he had seen the helicopter going towards Bentley around ten minutes before learning of the crash.\"As it flew over Doncaster, the engine sounded really bad,\" he said.Rebecca Booth, who represents Bentley on Doncaster Council, said there were \"a lot of people in shock\" in the area.\"It's a lovely, thriving community and everyone sticks together,\" she said.\"Things like this will have an impact on people.\"Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, MP for Doncaster North, said the news of the crash was \"devastating\".\"My thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim of this terrible incident,\" he said.\"My office are in touch with the relevant authorities including South Yorkshire Police, and I know the whole of Doncaster will be united in having the victim in their thoughts today.\"Lee Needham, who also lives in the area, said the crash site was close to houses, train tracks, industrial units and electrical pylons.\"Whoever was piloting the helicopter more than likely saved numerous lives,\" he said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterReutersPrince Andrew is to lose his 'prince' title and leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, following weeks of intense scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement on Thursday night, Buckingham Palace said the King's brother will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.Andrew gave up his other royal titles earlier this month, including the Duke of York, after facing more questions about his private life.In a posthumous memoir published earlier this month, Virginia Giuffre repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions. Andrew has always denied the claims.Reacting to the latest developments, Ms Giuffre's family said she \"brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage\". Giuffre took her own life earlier this year.In its statement, the Palace said the King \"has today initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew\".As well as the title, the Palace said \"formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease\" on Royal Lodge.He will be moved into private accommodation in Sandringham Estate, which is understood to be privately funded by King Charles.\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement continued.The Palace also expressed its support for victims of \"any and all forms of abuse\".ShutterstockPrince Andrew has lived at Royal Lodge since 2004 but will now move outAndrew's two adult daughters, Eugenie and Beatrice, will retain their titles as princesses and Andrew is still eighth in line for the throne.It is understood that Sarah Ferguson, his ex-wife, will also move out of Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements.Until this month, she kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York - but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew voluntarily gave up the usage of the Duke of York title.It is understood that the government was consulted on the decision to strip Andrew of his prince title, and made clear it supported the decision.Reacting to the news on BBC Question Time, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said it sent a \"very powerful message to the victims of grooming and sex offences\".\"This is a huge development and a big step for the King to take. I have to say, just, you know, as an initial response, I really support the step that he's taken.\"Getty ImagesSarah Ferguson, pictured here with Andrew, will also move out of Royal LodgeThe stripping of Andrew's titles caps off weeks of mounting pressure on the Royal Family.The scandal over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was reignited by sexual abuse allegations in Ms Giuffre's memoir.While Andrew has always strenuously denied abusing Ms Giuffre, earlier this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.Details about Andrew's living arrangements have also come under the spotlight, with fresh questions being asked in recent days about how he is able to fund his lifestyle despite not being a working royal.Andrew has lived at Royal Lodge since 2004, after signing a 75-year lease deal the previous year with his landlord, the Crown Estate, which operates as an independent property company.The Grade II-listed Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate boasts a gardener's cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.Last week, more details emerged about how he could afford his mansion, after the lease agreement was revealed.The arrangement means he has only ever paid a token annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate, a lease document seen by BBC News confirms.The deal meant that instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments upfront, including for renovations.In effect, those payments - which totalled more than £8m and were detailed in a National Audit Office report - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the 75-year lease, based on paying in advance a notional rent of £260,000 per year.In a separate development, it emerged this week that Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge as part of his daughter Beatrice's birthday celebrations in 2006 - two months after a US arrest warrant had been issued for Epstein for the sexual assault of a minor. Andrew did not respond to a request for comment.For the Palace, Thursday's announcement is an attempt to draw a line under the scandals surrounding the former Prince Andrew - now simply Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.",

Every step on the soil or contact with the stump risks damaging the tree's chance of recovery.\"The tree was deliberately felled by Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, who travelled from Cumbria one night in September 2023 to chop it down. They were convicted of criminal damage in July and sentenced to more than four years in prison.The tree was a much-loved landmark that inspired photographers and artists.Since its felling, some visitors have been leaving tributes such as stones or small items at the site by Hadrian's Wall.However, disturbing the remains of the tree or the ground around it could hamper any possible regrowth.Sarah Bennett/National Trust/PA MediaAdditional netting has been added to protect the stumpPeople have been asked to enjoy the site from the designated path and share their memories through \"photographs and stories\" rather than physical tributes.\"The regeneration of the stump offers hope to many people, and it has been uplifting to see the tree defiantly growing despite the trauma it endured,\" said Tony Gates, CEO of the Northumberland National Park Authority.\"This is a moment for patience and care, allowing nature to do what it does best.\"More on this topicRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesAfter weeks, months, years and even decades of scandals, all the titles and privileges of the former Prince Andrew have been completely removed. There are no modern precedents for such a colossal loss of royal status.Unlike the previous statement on his future, this was from Buckingham Palace rather than Andrew himself. It's a ripping off the bandage moment, which the Palace will hope will finally draw a line under the endless oil slick of bad news stories about Andrew.The sliver of dignity given to him, that he was voluntarily choosing not to use his titles, has been taken away.Titles such as Duke of York, the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh will be forcibly removed.All that remains is his place in the line of succession, and new guidance from the House of Commons Library has shown that too could be removed by Parliament, if Commonwealth realms give their consent.After more than a year of pressure, the so-called Siege of Royal Lodge is over, with Andrew losing his independent lease and moving to the King's estate in Sandringham. It's not revealed where exactly, but it's not Wood Farm.Sandringham is privately owned by the King, ending any reliance on a Crown Estate property.His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is said to be making her own separate arrangements, not currently expected to be with Andrew in Norfolk.It makes Andrew dependent on the King for his home and his money. And also it has to be said, a duty of care for his brother's welfare.This announcement might head off the immediate threat of Parliament taking matters into its own hands and voting to strip Andrew of his titles. MPs had become increasingly vocal about debating the scandal and the Public Accounts Committee had been flexing its muscles over protecting public funding.But it's going to be much harder for the Palace to settle an authentic feeling of public outrage. The sense of unchecked privilege surrounding Andrew has genuinely irritated the public and it will take more than taking away his titles to dispel the sense of ugly entitlement.Polling by YouGov published on Thursday showed Andrew now has the worst ever popularity ratings for a royal, with 91% holding a negative view of him.And the King heard that unhappiness first hand from a heckler in Lichfield this week, who shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\"Watch: Moment King gets heckled about Prince AndrewFor the Palace, there will be questions about why such longstanding problems around Andrew weren't dealt with before now. So much of this has been known for so many years, the unsuitable business links, the unexplained funding, the connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The cast list changes - alleged Chinese spies or dictators' wealthy relatives - but the story has remained the same.The unsavoury link with Epstein was being widely discussed 14 years ago when Andrew was stripped of his role as trade representative.Andrew has been losing jobs but continuing to live in a royal style for many years now and it's stretched public patience. It felt arrogant and out of touch.A few clicks on Google will find decades of stories raising doubts about his suitability, often accompanied by pictures of Andrew in a top hat, like a renegade Monopoly piece.BBC NewsnightPrince Andrew pictured during his Newsnight interview in 2019There might be some public fatigue around this Andrew story, people might feel they've heard enough and are sick of it. But there was also an angry public mood that expected a clearer sense of accountability.What remains to be seen now is whether a wider can of worms has been opened.Who knew what and when at the Palace about Andrew and Epstein? Do we need more transparency around royal property and finance? How many houses do they have up their sleeve in Windsor? And what fresh scandals about Andrew could still emerge?But this scorched earth approach to Andrew's future might also show an unexpectedly steely side to the King. While other members of the Royal Family were part of the decision, including Prince William, it's understood that it was the King who made this big call on his brother's future. Whatever the grandstanding of pundits, it can't have been an easy decision.There seemed to have been an irrevocable change of attitude when an email from Andrew to Epstein emerged, showing their continued contact. It seemed to destroy Andrew's promises in the Newsnight interview to have cut ties.It no longer seemed tenable that Andrew should have the honour of being a prince and living in some splendour among the royals in Windsor.Instead the King highlighted the victims of abuse, whose stories lie at the dark heart of Epstein's circle.It's not long since Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was grinning on the Buckingham Palace balcony, waving to the crowds. He'll wake up tomorrow morning for the first time in his life as Mr Mountbatten Windsor, private citizen.",

The previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.The notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would \"primarily\" be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands\".In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community - who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers - to settle in the US as refugees.South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years. The tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.The South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.Watch: 'Turn the lights down' - how the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting took an unexpected turnOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".The US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups. Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in USIs there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Some have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East. \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\" \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added. The South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement. During the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".Earlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances. While the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. ",

    "body": "Verdicts in as Liam Hemsworth takes over as The Witcher9 hours agoPeter GillibrandBBC NewsbeatNetflixGeralt is used to battles, but Netflix might have one if it wants to convince fans to give Liam Hemsworth a chanceThe latest season of Netflix's The Witcher has landed - with one big difference.Former lead actor Henry Cavill has been replaced as main character Geralt of Rivia by Liam Hemsworth.The Australian has stepped in for the final two seasons of the fantasy show, based on a popular series of novels and video games.Previously, British actor Cavill had portrayed the title character, a monster hunter with supernatural abilities known as the White Wolf.When he announced he was \"passing the torch\" to Hemsworth in October 2022, describing him as a \"fantastic\" actor, not all fans agreed.Some even threatened to boycott the series without, and Hemsworth has admitted Cavill is a \"daunting\" act to follow.Early reviews have been mixed, with US magazine Variety calling season four an \"upgrade\", while the Guardian says Hemsworth is \"as charismatic as a bollard in a wig\".BBC Newsbeat caught up with professional reviewers to get their thoughts on the latest episodes - and whether the new Geralt is up to the job.Why did Henry Cavill leave the Witcher? NetflixHenry Cavill is well-liked by fans due to his passion for all things nerdyHenry Cavill's love of nerd culture is well-known, and he's been vocal about his love of video games, sci-fi and fantasy.There's been no official explanation for his departure from The Witcher, but it's been suggested creative differences played a part.He's spoken in interviews about being \"loyal to the source material\" and the importance of keeping Geralt the same as the character in the books. Since leaving, he's landed a role as a producer and star of Amazon's upcoming Warhammer 40,000 series - something he's described as a dream role.Sabrina Barr, TV Editor at Metro, says Henry Cavill was the \"epitome of Geralt\", and admits seeing Hemsworth in the role was \"jarring\" at first.But she tells Newsbeat he he does a \"good job\" and is \"brave\" for taking on the character. People would criticise 'no matter who it was'Sabrina BarrMetro journalist Sabrina Barr interviewed cast members including Laurence Fishburne ahead of the new seriesIn her three-and-a-half star review, Sabrina says apprehensive Witcher fans should \"give it a chance\".\"I've got to give them credit for taking a really difficult situation and deciding to run with their creative vision,\" she says.\"In my opinion, this season isn't the best of them but I still had a really good time with it. I was gripped by the very different story lines.\"Sabrina tells Newsbeat it's \"extremely rare\" to change the main actor in between seasons but this, in her opinion, is an example of \"how it can work\" if there's no other choice.\"I personally would have been a lot more upset if they just cancelled the show,\" she says.\"I have to give them credit for carrying on the story, knowing full well that from the very start there would be people criticising the choice of main actor no matter who it was.\"Dawson RobertsDawson Roberts thinks the season is \"really fun\" even without Henry Cavill.Dawson Roberts, a content creator who focuses on TV, film and gaming as DawsOnScreen, was invited to the premiere of the new season.He agrees the actor swap is \"definitely a bit weird\" but tells Newsbeat the transition is handled well by the show's cast and crew.In his view, Liam Hemsworth does a \"pretty good\" job in the main role.\"I'm not going to lie and say he's better than Henry Cavill,\" says Dawson.\"But I do think Liam Hemsworth does a really solid job. You get used to it really quickly. He's got the right energy.\"Losing Henry Cavill is tough but I do think they have built that trust with the audience so now it does work.\"Dawson says the unsung hero of the series is actor Laurence Fishburne, who joins the cast as vampire Regis.\"People aren't giving enough credit to Laurence Fishburne,\" he says.\"He's never done a fantasy role before and I think he kills it.\"As for Dawson's verdict, he says he's closer to \"the seven or eight out of 10 than the two-star reviews\".\"It's definitely not the best show ever,\" he says.\"But it's still really exciting to see the game world brought to life on the screen - even if it is without Henry Cavill.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

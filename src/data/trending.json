    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Fifa president Gianni Infantino gave US president Donald Trump the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize in DecemberBySports editorA group of cross-party MPs have called on Fifa to consider expelling the United States from the World Cup until the country demonstrates \"clear compliance with international law and respect for the sovereignty of other nations\".It follows the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid on the capital city Caracas this month, along with warnings that US president Donald Trump has recently issued to a host of other countries.So with the US due to host both the World Cup and Olympics over the next two and a half years, what questions does America's foreign policy raise for sports organisations, and could any take a stand?'Repeated veiled and overt threats'Back in December, Fifa awarded Trump its inaugural 'Peace Prize' at the 2026 World Cup draw ceremony in Washington, saying he had \"played a pivotal role\" in establishing a ceasefire and promoted peace between Israel and Palestine, and that he has sought to end other conflicts.In the few weeks since, the US has taken military action in both Venezuela and Nigeria and has hinted at possible further operations in Greenland, fellow World Cup co-host Mexico, and two other participants in the tournament - Colombia and Iran.Now, 23 politicians from Labour, the Lib Dems, Green Party and Plaid Cymru have signed a motion, external in parliament, calling on international sporting bodies to consider expelling the US from major international competitions, including the World Cup. They say such events \"should not be used to legitimise or normalise violations of international law by powerful states\".The MPs express concern about the \"escalation of US actions against Venezuela\", including \"the kidnapping of President Nicolas Maduro\", claiming that they amount to \"a direct intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign state\".Their motion also notes \"repeated veiled and overt threats made by senior US officials\", towards Denmark, Colombia and Cuba\", saying it \"undermines the rules-based international order\".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The United States launched a military strike on Venezuela and captured president Nicolas Maduro on 3 JanuaryWhat has the US done and said?While the White House is yet to respond to the BBC about the MPs' motion, it has previously claimed that the capture of Maduro was a law-enforcement operation against an illegitimate leader responsible for both drug-trafficking and terrorism. Trump said the US will now control Venezuela and its oil industry.Maduro insists he is a prisoner of war, and Trump faced strong criticism at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected\" during the US action.Meanwhile, Trump has also told Cuba to \"make a deal\" over Venezuelan oil exports \"before it is too late\", and said a military operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\".As with Venezuela, Trump has accused Colombia of not doing enough to tackle drug trafficking. Colombia president Gustavo Petro has told the BBC that he believes there is now a \"real threat\" of US military action against his country.Trump has also claimed that drugs are \"pouring\" through Mexico into America, adding \"we're gonna have to do something\", amid reports that he has started planning a mission to send in US troops. Mexico president Claudia Sheinbaum says she has rejected any US military action on Mexican soil.Trump has also insisted his country needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons and has not ruled out using military force. The mineral-rich Arctic territory is controlled by Denmark, a fellow Nato member, and potentially also in the World Cup if its team comes through the play-offs. The Trump administration has also faced mounting scrutiny over the legality of air strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific.Could Fifa act?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gianni Infantino was elected president of Fifa in February 2016Fifa declined to comment on the MPs' motion, and whether it may now reconsider the annual awarding of its peace prize in light of Trump's recent foreign policy.But few believe it will take any action against a country that is hosting the majority of its matches at the World Cup, especially given the close relationship the governing body's president Gianni Infantino has cultivated with Trump.Such ties have led to accusations that Fifa has become politicised, although it insists that as an organiser of football events it has a statutory duty to remain neutral. This is not the first time Fifa has come under pressure over the political actions of a World Cup host. In 2018, the tournament went ahead in Russia despite the country annexing Crimea four years earlier. Russia also stood accused of cyber attacks, meddling in western elections and carrying out the Novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury.However, comparisons have also been drawn with the way Fifa subsequently banned Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a sanction that remains in place.\"Let's have consistency,\" Brian Leishman, one of the MPs who has signed the motion, told the Daily Mirror when asked about the US action in Venezuela. \"It's an invasion of a sovereign nation and the kidnap of a president in Venezuela. I'm very critical of Maduro, I want to be very clear on that, but what we've seen is a breach of international law. When you see how Russia has been treated, which is absolutely correct, I just want there to be consistency.\"Some at Fifa privately point out that the Russian Football Union is still a member association and that the ban on playing internationals was more down to teams refusing to play against Russia and security concerns, rather than the governing body taking a moral position.An insight into Fifa's approach came in October when Infantino said Fifa \"cannot solve geopolitical problems\" amid pressure to sanction Israel after a United Nations commission of inquiry concluded that it had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as \"distorted and false\".What about the Olympics?The International Olympic Committee (IOC) also maintains a ban on Russian teams at the Games, with individual athletes only allowed to compete as neutrals, as long as they are admitted by the relevant sporting federations.However, it has ruled out the exclusion of any American athletes from February's Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina in Italy.In a statement issued to BBC Sport, it said: \"As a global organisation, the IOC has to manage a complex reality. The IOC has to deal with the current political context and the latest developments in the world. \"The ability to bring athletes together, no matter where they come from, is fundamental to the future of values-based, truly global sport, which can give hope to the world.\"For this reason, the IOC cannot involve itself directly in political matters or conflicts between countries, as these fall outside our remit. This is the realm of politics.\"Last year, the IOC also rejected calls to bar Israel over the Gaza war, stating that the country's national Olympic committee had complied with the Olympic Charter.IOC sources have told BBC Sport a distinction has to be made with Russia because  it took over Ukrainian territory and put athletes there under the control of the Russian Olympic Committee, which is against the Olympic Charter.Los Angeles is hosting the Olympics in 2028.'A looming stress-test'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams for the first timeSome believe that, depending on Trump's next moves, the situation could become harder for sports bodies to navigate.\"Fifa and the IOC could be heading towards one almighty headache,\" according to John Zerafa, a veteran advisor to countries and cities wanting to host major sports events.\"Both organisations' charters emphasise peace, respect for sovereignty, and non-discrimination.\"In Russia's case, that led to bans and restrictions on athletes and teams. If, in a worst-case scenario, the US were to use force against Greenland - a Nato ally's territory - would those same principles apply? If Denmark qualifies via the play-offs, would it boycott the World Cup? Would European or Nato leaders refuse to attend US-hosted events?\"This isn't just geopolitics. It's a looming stress-test for sporting institutions that pride themselves on neutrality, yet repeatedly find themselves forced to take political positions when international law and conflict collide with global competition.\"Trump's hardline immigration policy could also have an impact on the World Cup, which begins on 11 June.Fifa vowed to have a welcoming and unifying tournament, but there are now four competing countries - Iran, Haiti, Senegal and Ivory Coast - whose fans face full or partial travel bans, with the White House referencing a need to manage security threats.Meanwhile, domestic tensions in the US have intensified after Renee Good, 37, was shot dead by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, triggering large protests in the city.Even before the incident, human rights organisations had claimed the World Cup was at increasing danger of being \"weaponised for authoritarian aims\", external and criticised \"escalating attacks on immigrants in the US... and threats to press freedom and the rights of peaceful protesters\".As Fifa's biggest-ever tournament approaches it will be fascinating to see what further impact US action overseas has on ticket sales, collaboration between the co-hosts on issues such as security, and whether sports bodies feel they need to do more to navigate a complicated geopolitical landscape.",

A spokesperson said: \"Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels – and we will continue to do so.\"We will not comment on specific operational planning or give a running commentary on live maritime activity.\"It is understood US military aircraft landed at small civilian airports in Wick in Caithness and Benbecula in the Western Isles during the operation on 7 January.The MoD did confirm at the time that the Royal Navy tanker RFA Tideforce and RAF surveillance aircraft supported American personnel.",

    "body": "3 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorDitching his plans to make digital ID mandatory for workers in the UK is an almighty backtracking and dilution of one of the prime minister's flagship policy ideas of the autumn.I remember the first time Sir Keir Starmer talked publicly about his plans, because he was talking to me when he did so.It was September, and we were sheltering from the pouring rain, in an outside metal stairwell next to a giant ship being built by BAE Systems on the banks of the Clyde in Glasgow.What he had to say that day was rather overshadowed by the swirling storm around his then Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, who 24 hours later was out of a job.What those around him were describing as \"phase 2\" of his government was already off to a bumpy start, but digital ID was seen as a defining idea of the parliament that the prime minister could own and then lean into the arguments it provokes with his opponents, within his party and beyond it.The thing is it provoked a lot of arguments, perhaps more than he had anticipated, including among some Labour MPs.It was the mandatory element that became the magnet for the stickiest criticisms.The idea cratered in popularity. It revived so many of the arguments that nuked the last Labour government's plans for ID cards about two decades ago.The sense from critics of an overbearing state, a 'show us your papers' society.So what have ministers done? They have junked the mandatory element of it.People will still have to digitally prove they have the right to work – but could use other things to do it.This new government digital ID will not be essential.The argument I hear within government is they are ditching the bit that is unpopular, but keeping something people might choose to use themselves because it could make accessing public services easier, for instance.In short, the whole initial public pitch for why digital ID was a good idea - cracking down on illegal migration and illegal working - has been shelved.The emphasis now is on digital ID being an aide to consumers.\"Let's remove the whole culture war thing entirely and focus on the pragmatic element plenty of people will like and will choose to use,\" is how one government figure put it to me.Others say if the prime minister really is going to focus on the cost of living when he is addressing domestic policies, he needed to junk unpopular stuff that was getting in the way of that.The opposition parties have piled in with their criticisms, while welcoming the government's change of heart.Here is the political challenge for Downing Street: the climbdowns, dilutions, U turns, about turns, call them what you will, are mounting up.In just the last couple of weeks, there has been the issue of business rates on pubs in England and inheritance on farmers.Before that, among others, income tax, benefits cuts and winter fuel payments.Sir Keir Starmer's critics, external and internal, are taking note.Just hours before this latest backtracking, the Health Secretary Wes Streeting – who'd quite fancy being prime minister himself one day – said it was important the government \"gets it right first time\".That, to put it very politely, is a work in progress for Sir Keir Starmer.",

Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said Sutherland \"entered a ride-share vehicle, physically assaulted the driver (the victim), and made criminal threats\" in an incident at 00:15 PST (08:15 GMT) on Monday. The victim was not injured in the incident, the LAPD added.Sutherland, 59, was released after paying a bond of $50,000 (£37,000). He is due to appear in court on 2 February. The BBC has contacted his representatives for comment.The incident took place at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood and is under investigation by the LAPD's Hollywood Division.Sutherland, known for roles such as special agent Jack Bauer on Fox's 24, and as the US president in Designated Survivor, is the son of actor Donald Sutherland.The Canadian actor has been arrested several times in the past, and in 2007 he was sentenced to 48 days in jail for driving under the influence and violating probation.He was arrested for assault in 2009, although the charge was later dropped, and was most recently arrested after making an illegal U-turn in Hollywood in 2020.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDonald Trump's message to Iranians protesting against the regime dominates Wednesday's front pages. The Guardian quotes the US president with its headline \"help is on its way\", which the paper says is the \"clearest sign\" he may be preparing for military action against Tehran.The Daily Telegraph echoes Trump's pledge, spotlighting a photo of protesters in Iran holding up signs calling for America's help. The paper also reports that senior US national security and military officials met on Tuesday to discuss the Iranian government's violent crackdown, which has led to the deaths of around 2,000 people.The Financial Times follows with a \"dispatch from Tehran\", quoting protesters on the streets who say: \"We get killed if we go out.\"In news closer to home, the Times reports on the prime minister's \"U-turn over compulsory digital IDs\". The prime minister has abandoned plans to make the IDs mandatory to gain employment. Government sources tell the paper the cards will instead be optional, and workers will be able to verify their identity with other documents.The Daily Mail adds that the PM abandoning plans for mandatory digital IDs is the \"13th U-turn\" of his tenure.Staying with the government, plans for new rail links between major Northern cities will be unveiled on Wednesday, according to the i Paper. The next phase of the project is due to start in the 2030s and includes a new route between Liverpool and Manchester, the paper reports.\"The rail deal\" is the Daily Mirror's take on the government's \"Northern Powerhouse pledge\" for new lines and infrastructure. It quotes the PM saying: \"This government is rolling up its sleeves to deliver change.\"A court has been told a Russian ship captain did \"absolutely nothing\" to avoid a collision with a US tanker that killed one of his crew in the North Sea, the Metro says. The trial for the incident - which happened in March 2025 - has started, with the captain pleading not guilty as he is accused of \"grossly negligent conduct\".The Daily Express features a warning from campaigners that the total number of elderly people living in poverty risks exceeding two million. The paper refers to research by Age UK that says pensioners are taking \"drastic measures\" to make ends meet, including skipping meals and cutting their electricity use. Pubs are expected to be hit by higher prices as a hike in alcohol duty kicks in due to the Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Budget, the Sun says. The paper's front page pictures a smiling Reeves at the pump with the headline, \"the inn reaper\". Finally, the Daily Star focuses on Trump's interest in Greenland. The paper splashes on a picture released by the White House of the US president staring out a window at a map of Greenland, describing it as an \"arctic troll\". Related Internet Links",

    "body": "13 hours agoNeil HendersonBBC News, Stratford Magistrates' CourtBBCFrom left to right: Kristofer Deichler, Jatinder Kamra, and Sukhraj SinghThree men have been found guilty of harassing a BBC journalist who presented the podcast series and documentary A Very British Cult.Kristofer Deichler, 47, Jatinder Kamra, 46 and Sukhraj Singh, 39, were all convicted at Stratford Magistrates' Court of harassment without violence.All three are members of Lighthouse, which was investigated for the 2023 documentary and podcast fronted by BBC journalist Catrin Nye.The programmes raised concerns about the group and reported allegations about the way its leadership treated people who tried to leave it.A district judge sitting at Stratford Magistrates Court heard how the men held demonstrations outside the BBC and on three occasions turned up to Nye's home, claiming to be delivering a Bible and a letter.Prosecutor Simren Singh said the group's complaints about Nye's programme-making had begun before the episodes were even released.Judge Susan Holdham heard how attempts by the programme-makers to obtain an interview with the Lighthouse leader, Paul Waugh, had either been met with silence or demands for several hours of live primetime television.The court heard how the men turned up at BBC presenter Catrin Nye's home After the broadcast, Lighthouse staged demonstrations outside the BBC's offices in central London. The group's members held up placards accusing both the corporation and Nye of shielding child abusers and racists.The court was also shown a video featuring group members chanting: \"Stop paedophilia at the BBC.\"Lighthouse followers were seen shouting at BBC staff, accusing them of being \"complicit\" and asking \"don't you have any shame?\"The prosecutor told the judge that while these protests were lawful, the men \"crossed the line\" when they began visiting Nye's home in the summer of 2024.It was then that protests became illegal, he said, telling the court it was \"revenge\" for her journalism.It emerged in court that Lighthouse had hired a private investigator to trace Nye's home address.Members of the group then travelled to her house. They rang the doorbell and recorded themselves on their phones apparently trying to deliver a Bible and a letter.Three men charged with harassment of BBC presenterWhen there was no response they posted leaflets to neighbours and staged a demonstration nearby.They returned several days later, at 08:00, waiting until Nye's partner had left the house with their two small children before calling again. Nye, who was in the house with a security guard, didn't answer the door.The men claimed they had been attempting to produce their own documentary in response to A Very British Cult and said they had been acting as \"citizen journalists\".They described the group's relationship with the BBC and Nye as a \"David versus Goliath\" struggle.\"The purpose was doorstepping,\" Sukhraj Singh told the judge. \"The purpose was to interview any of her team. We wanted justice, compensation, reform and truth.\"He told the court he had joined Lighthouse as a mentor and then became an associate partner in 2010.After the programme's broadcast, he said many of his clients had cut their ties with him, leaving him without an income. He said he was currently living on benefits.Asked what justice would look like, he replied: \"Justice would be for the BBC to apologise and broadcast the facts to the audience.\"Instead of posting the letter and Bible through the letterbox, the court heard the men instead left an unsigned note saying they would \"be back\".Police have released footage showing Kristofer Deichler and Jatinder Kamra outside Nye's homeEarlier in the trial, both Nye and her partner gave evidence from behind a screen about the effects the visits had on them and their children.Nye said Lighthouse had been given \"multiple opportunities and deadline extensions to involve themselves in the production of the programme, and these were not responded to\".She added: \"Terrifying people in their neighbourhood and terrifying their children is not how you respond to an organisation.\"They distributed leaflets with my name and picture on it, said the most awful things possible, saying that I destroyed businesses and protected child abusers.\"The couple installed a Ring doorbell and CCTV in their house and Nye told the court how she became unwilling to leave home with her children, even for short trips. She was reduced to a \"paranoid\" state, the court heard.The case, which was initially scheduled to last four days, instead involved hearings staggered over several months.The defendants at first said they were ill. Proceedings were then further delayed when the men lost their legal representation in a dispute with their original solicitors.Finding all three men guilty, the judge said the visits to the journalist's house \"were intimidatory as well as retaliatory\" and that their conduct amounted to harassment.The three men were bailed and will be sentenced on 2 February.A BBC spokesperson welcomed the verdicts, adding: \"A free and independent press is fundamental to a democratic society, and it is essential that journalists are able to carry out their work without intimidation, harassment or abuse.\"We stand firmly behind our reporter and our journalists' right to report freely in the public interest.\"",

    "body": "Two women have accused the Spanish singer Julio Iglesias of sexually assaulting them while they were working for him and allege that he \"normalised abuse\" in a coercive, threatening and violent environment.The allegations, made in reports by Spanish news site elDiario.es and US outlet Univision, are being investigated by Spain's judiciary.The singer employed the two women at his properties in Punta Cana, in the Dominican Republic, and Lyford Cay, in the Bahamas. According to their testimonies, the sexual assaults took place in 2021.Iglesias, who is 82, has been a household name in Spain since the 1960s and has sold millions of records worldwide.According to elDiario.es and Univision, Iglesias and his lawyer did not respond to repeated requests for a response to the allegations ahead of their publication. However, a woman identified as a manager of one of the singer's Caribbean properties said the claims were \"nonsense\".The BBC has attempted to contact Iglesias's representatives for comment, but has not yet received a response.One of the women interviewed, a domestic worker whose name was changed to Rebeca in the reports, said he would regularly call her to his room at the end of the day and would touch her inappropriately without consent.\"He used me almost every night,\" she said. \"I felt like an object, like a slave.\"Rebeca, who is Dominican and was 22 when the alleged events described took place, also alleged that Iglesias had forced her to take part in threesomes with another female member of staff. She also described the singer slapping her in the face and grabbing her genitals.The other woman, a Venezuelan physical therapist named as Laura in the article, said Iglesias had touched her breasts and kissed her on the mouth against her will. She added that he constantly threatened to fire her, controlled how much food she ate and asked her about when her period was due.\"He always said I was fat and had to lose weight,\" Laura said, describing a working environment of \"normalised abuse\".Although she said she had frequently rejected his sexual advances, \"there were girls who couldn't say no. And he did what he wanted with them\".elDiario.es and Univision, which investigated the case together over a period of three years, state that the allegations are backed up by documentary evidence, including photographs, phone records, text messages and medical reports. Their reports cite other former employees of Iglesias who describe a threatening, highly stressful atmosphere for those working for him.It has emerged that Rebeca and Laura filed a legal complaint on 5 January against Iglesias for sexual assault and human trafficking before the national court, which investigates crimes allegedly committed beyond Spain's borders.An old friend of Iglesias, Jaime Peñafiel, labelled the accusations \"absolute lies\". Another ally, the journalist Miguel Ángel Pastor, said he had never heard \"any suggestion that he might have committed this kind of act\".However, the equality minister in Spain's Socialist-led government, Ana Redondo, said she hoped the case would be investigated \"all the way\".\"When there is no consent there is assault,\" she posted on social media.Ione Belarra, leader of the far-left Podemos party, called for an end to \"the silence\" in cases of sexual assault by \"famous assailants who are protected by their money\".Last month, a woman filed a legal complaint alleging that Adolfo Suárez, a former prime minister who was revered for his role during Spain's transition to democracy, had sexually abused her from when she was 17 years old. Suárez, a conservative, died in 2014 and police are investigating. Jesús Villegas, a magistrate, said that the case against Suárez was unlikely to flourish and that it was politically motivated.The president of the Madrid region, the conservative Isabel Díaz Ayuso, has come out in support of the Spanish singer.\"The Madrid region will never contribute to the vilifying of artists and even less so to that of the most universal of all singers: Julio Iglesias,\" she posted on social media.Iglesias's biographer Ignacio Peyró and the author's publishing house, Libros del Asteroide, have also responded, saying they will update last year's biography to include the allegations. They have also expressed their \"support and solidarity for the victims\".",

    "body": "Claudette Colvin, who helped end racial segregation in the US by refusing to give up her bus seat to a white person, has died. She was 86 years old. Colvin's protest, which led to her arrest, came in 1955 at the age of 15 while she was living in Montgomery, Alabama. It happened nine months before the arrest of Rosa Parks, who also famously refused to give her bus seat to a white person, in a move that led to widespread boycotting of public transportation in the city, and a Supreme Court decision that outlawed such racial discrimination. Colvin's arrest was largely unknown until 2009, when the first detailed book about her experience was published. \"She leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history,\" said a statement from the Claudette Colvin Legacy Foundation, which announced her death.One year after her arrest, the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses must end. The legal case turned on the testimony of four plaintiffs, one of whom was Colvin.In an interview with the BBC in 2018, Ms Colvin recalled that she \"was not frightened, but disappointed and angry\" because she knew she \"was sitting in the right seat\".She was the first person to be arrested for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies, but her story remained relatively unknown for decades. It was Rosa Parks who became one of the main figures of the civil rights movement after her very similar case led to the large-scale boycott of the bus system in the city. Colvin said she had been inspired by the great anti-slavery campaigners Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. \"Whenever people ask me: 'Why didn't you get up when the bus driver asked you?' I say it felt as though Harriet Tubman's hands were pushing me down on one shoulder and Sojourner Truth's hands were pushing me down on the other shoulder,\" she told the BBC.Later in life, she became a nurse in New York. According to her organisation, she died in Texas.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJosh ParryLGBT & identity reporter, Royal Courts of JusticeThe suspended boss of Pride in London has \"frustrated\" a disciplinary investigation into alleged theft and bullying by refusing to hand back control of company bank accounts and systems, court documents allege.Christopher Joell-Deshields appeared at London's High Court on Tuesday accused of not handing back the company's \"usernames, passwords and personal identification numbers\".Court papers seen by the BBC show Pride in London's lawyers accuse him of trying to prevent \"the full extent of his actions becoming apparent\".The 55-year-old denied one ground of failing to hand over the accounts, but admitted to a second ground of failing to submit a statement verifying he had complied with the order.In September 2025, London LGBT Community Pride CIC obtained an injunction against the 55-year-old, who is suspended from his role as CEO while a disciplinary investigation continues, which required him to hand back company devices, access to bank accounts and social media profiles.Lawyers for the organisation, which puts on one of the UK's largest annual pride events, accused Joell-Deshields of two counts of contempt of court for failing to comply with the order.Dr John Brown, representing Joell-Deshields, said his client would contest the claim he had not returned all that was required, but accepted he had not complied with the requirement to provide a witness statement verifying he had returned the property.Asked about a laptop which is yet to be returned, Brown said \"his case is that, though the laptop was purchased by the company, it was purchased to replace his laptop that was damaged at work\".Deputy judge Tim Maloney KC said a trial on the remaining allegation would take place on the first available date after 10 February.The hearing will address what sanction Joell-Deshields will face for failing to provide a witness statement, as well as hear Pride in London's argument relating to the first ground for contempt.A copy of the order seen by the BBC says that disobeying it could lead to imprisonment, fines or assets being seized.In September 2025, Joell-Deshields was suspended as CEO of Pride in London and removed as director after it was alleged he spent £7,000 worth of vouchers donated by sponsors on luxury perfumes and Apple products.Volunteers also accused him of sending bullying messages to a disabled volunteer and creating a \"toxic\" culture at the organisation, which has more than 100 year-round volunteers and a number of paid staff.The BBC understands that Joell-Deshields is still being paid an annual salary of more than £85,000 by the organisation while the investigation, now in its seventh month, continues.During an earlier hearing, lawyers representing Joell-Deshields said that their client's cooperation with the court order was not an admission of guilt relating to any of the allegations.The case comes at a difficult time for Pride organisations which say they are experiencing a drop in financial support and volunteers meaning several events were cancelled or scaled down in 2025.",

    "body": "Olympic champion snowboarder Chloe Kim says she will be fit to compete at the Winter Olympic Games next month despite dislocating her shoulder last week.Kim, 25, had an MRI scan on Friday after injuring her shoulder while training in Switzerland.The American is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe, after her triumphs in Pyeongchang in 2018 as a 17-year-old and in Beijing in 2022.Kim said in an update on Instagram she was \"good to go\" for the Milan-Cortina games in Italy, which take place from February 6-22.She said her labrum injury is less serious than feared, though it will prevent her from training before the Games.\"There are two different ways to do it, and the way I did it is less severe than the other, so I'm really happy about that,\" said Kim.\"Obviously, I'm really disappointed that I can't snowboard until right before the Olympics, which is going to be hard.\"I haven't gotten nearly the amount of reps that I would have liked, but that's OK. It's funny I've been doing this for so long, and every season I've met different challenges.\"But again, I'm so grateful that I will be good to go for the Olympics.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterGetty ImagesThe government has dropped plans requiring workers to sign up to its digital ID scheme in order to prove their right to work in the UK, the BBC understands. By 2029, right to work checks will be done digitally – for example by using biometric passports – but registering with the new digital ID programme will be optional.This marks a shift from last year when the government first announced the policy and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told an audience: \"You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said \"Good riddance. It was a terrible policy anyway.\"She said the move by Labour represented \"another U-turn\". The change of policy is the latest in a series of U-turns the government has made since it came to power – including climbdowns on welfare reforms, reducing winter fuel payments and inheritance tax for farmers.When the government first announced the policy plan, it argued that mandatory digital ID for workers would make it easier to clamp down on immigrants working illegally.The scheme, it is understood, will now deal less narrowly with immigration and the government will instead place more emphasis on the argument that digital ID can be a useful tool for the public when accessing public services.Asked about the issue at an Institute for Government conference earlier on Tuesday, Darren Jones, the minister responsible for rolling out the policy, said it would be a \"route to the digital transformation of customer-facing public services\". He said a consultation would be launched \"very shortly\", adding: \"I'm confident this time next year the polling will be in a much better place on digital ID than it is today.\"The policy had attracted criticism since it was announced last September, with nearly three million people signing a parliamentary petition opposing the introduction of digital IDs. There has also been nervousness among some Labour MPs over the compulsory aspect of the original proposal. The Liberal Democrats said the policy was \"doomed to failure\" from the start and called for \"the billions of pounds earmarked for their mandatory digital ID scheme\" to be spent \"on the NHS and frontline policing instead\".The party's Cabinet Office spokesperson, Lisa Smart, said: \"No 10 must be bulk ordering motion sickness tablets at this rate to cope with all their U-turns.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said in a post on X: \"This is a victory for individual liberty against a ghastly, authoritarian government. Reform UK would scrap it altogether.\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski welcomed the news on X, saying: \"The government have U-turned on ID cards. Good.\"A government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to mandatory digital right to work checks.\"Currently right to work checks include a hodge podge of paper-based systems with no record of checks ever taking place. This is open to fraud and abuse.\"Digital ID will make everyday life easier for people, ensuring public services are more personal, joined-up, and effective, while also remaining inclusive.\"Employers already have to check if someone they want to hire has the right to work in the UK. Since 2022, employers have been able to do checks on passport-holding British and Irish citizens using digital verification services certified by the government. There is also a Home Office online scheme which verifies the status of some non-British or Irish citizens, whose immigration status is held electronically.The details of how digital ID will work have yet to be set out but it is expected to be based on two government-built systems: Gov.uk One Login and Gov.uk Wallet.Currently more than 12 million people have signed up to One Login, which can be used for services such as applying for a veteran card, cancelling a lost passport or managing a lasting power of attorney. Gov.uk Wallet has not yet been launched but would allow people to store their digital ID on their smartphones.The digital ID would include name, date of birth, nationality and residence status and a photo.

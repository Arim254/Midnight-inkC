    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesByFootball issues correspondentTwo months ago Liverpool's huge summer transfer spend looked like it had made the Premier League title a formality.Arne Slot's side were five points clear at the top of the table after only five games, having strengthened their squad with £415m worth of talent. Florian Wirtz was signed from Bayer Leverkusen for an initial £100m, rising to a possible £116m. Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak joined on deadline day for a new record transfer fee of £125m, which could be £130m with add-ons.Nothing could go wrong, could it? Both signings have struggled and Liverpool's form has nosedived, leaving them 12th in the league. Wirtz has no goals or assists in 11 Premier League outings. Isak has yet to score a goal and has one assist.It is way too early to write off two of the most expensive Premier League signings of all time. After all, Thierry Henry scored only two goals in his first 17 appearances for Arsenal. By the end of that season he had netted 17 times in the Premier League, 26 in all competitions and went on to be one of the league's greatest-ever players. But curiously, when you look down the list of the Premier League's biggest incomings, there are not too many 'huge' successes.How do you judge this? I've looked at each deal and given my verdict relative to their own achievements and that of their clubs. Fees shown are without add-ons. Of course this is very subjective and you are free to disagree (or agree) in the comments below!Enzo Fernandez (£106.8) and Moises Caicedo (£100m) to ChelseaImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo won the Club World Cup with Chelsea in the summerThese two Chelsea players are grouped together because they were both signed in 2023, seven months apart, and their success is intrinsically linked. Fernandez arrived first from Benfica in the winter window, fresh from winning the World Cup with Argentina and taking the Fifa Young Player award.Caicedo followed in the summer from Brighton, just when it seemed the Ecuador international was bound for Liverpool.Two years on and they have won the Conference League and the Club World Cup. However, after a sixth-placed finish in 2023-24 and coming fourth last season, could you really say Chelsea have excelled?There is no doubting both players are real assets and they are two of the first names on the team sheet, with Caicedo playing all 38 Premier League games last season.There is plenty of time the duo to win major honours with Chelsea (count the Club World Cup if you wish), and they are the closest challengers to Arsenal for the title this season.Verdict: Promising. Chelsea have spent a lot of money on their squad in recent seasons but need more silverware, and a title bid, to show for it.Jack Grealish (£100m) to Manchester CityImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jack Grealish began to fall out of favour under Pep Guardiola after only two seasonsCould you really question a player who has won three Premier League titles, the Champions League, the FA Cup, the Uefa Super Cup and the Club World Cup?Grealish did start all of City's cup wins in 2023, but at no stage did he manage to reproduce the kind of consistent form he showed at Aston Villa. In 2021-22 it was six goals and four assists in all competitions for City. In 2022-23 it was five goals and 11 assists. Compare that to his last two seasons at Villa combined, when he scored 17 goals and set up 20 more. In the summer of 2023, City signed Jeremy Doku from Rennes in a clear signal that Pep Guardiola wasn't satisfied with Grealish. Across the next two seasons, Grealish only made 20 Premier League appearances in each, with a total of four goals and two assists. The writing was on the wall and he was loaned out to Everton for this season. Verdict: This is controversial, but can a player who cost £100m and was effectively discarded after two seasons be truly considered a success? It would be harsh to call Grealish a failure because he won almost all there is to win at City. But at the same time he did not kick on from his electric Villa form. Perhaps it is somewhere in the middle.Declan Rice (£100m) to ArsenalImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Declan Rice has scored 18 goals in 121 games since joining Arsenal If Grealish has the medals but not the kudos, then the opposite can be said of Rice.Rice was a very good midfielder at West Ham, but he has now proven himself to be world class and earned a reputation as a set-piece specialist too.The 26-year-old is a certain starter for England at the World Cup next year, and Arsenal look far less effective without him.But in terms of this discussion, the only honour Rice has picked up at Arsenal is the Community Shield in his very first appearance.Verdict: To be determined. Arsenal have been turned into genuine title contenders by signing quality players like Rice. But until Arsenal win silverware the outlay won't be fully justified. With the Gunners six points clear at the top of the table, maybe that will change this season.Romelu Lukaku (£97.5m) to ChelseaImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Romelu Lukaku's frustrating second spell at Chelsea lasted only one seasonThe first of two entries for Lukaku, and it is the move that was supposed to make him Chelsea's main striker at the second attempt (he was also on their books 2011-2014).Chelsea signed Lukaku in 2021 from Inter Milan, where he had scored 64 goals in 95 games in all competitions, won the Scudetto and was the Serie A Footballer of the Year. Surely Lukaku would be a success? He did score four goals in his first four games, but his impact very quickly waned and after the turn of the year he netted only three Premier League goals from a total of 15 goals in 44 matches across all competitions.After one season, he was gone again. Verdict: Failure. Lukaku won the Club World Cup in February 2022 but that's scant return for such a huge outlay. He returned to Inter on loan after just one season and eventually left Chelsea permanently in 2024, joining Napoli for just £30m where he would again win the Italian title.Paul Pogba (£89m) to Manchester UnitedImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Paul Pogba twice left Manchester United for Juventus on a free transferAll told, this is considered one of the worst pieces of transfer business.Pogba had left Manchester United for Juventus as a free agent in 2012, and four years later they spent £89m to bring him back to Old Trafford. Pogba did stay at United for six years in his second spell, but he was supposed to rejuvenate the team and there was little evidence of this.A return of 39 goals in 226 games isn't terrible, but only in the 2018-19 season -where he scored 13 in the Premier League and was named in the PFA Team of the Year - did he ever live up to his price tag.Verdict: Failure. United only won the Europa League and the EFL Cup during his second spell, with brief glimpses of his quality. At the end of his contract in 2022 he went back to Juve on a free.Antony (£82m) to Manchester UnitedImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Antony has won 16 senior caps for Brazil, but has not been called up since 2023Signed by Erik ten Hag from Ajax in 2022 as part of his rebuild of the squad, Antony was supposed to bring pace and creativity to the attack. The Brazilian had scored 24 goals and provided 22 assists in two seasons for the Dutch club. But at Old Trafford he looked a completely different player, devoid of confidence.Antony scored only five Premier League goals and provided three assists in two and a half seasons before he was loaned to Real Betis, a move which then became permanent.That he has excelled at Betis, with 15 goals and seven assists in 38 games across all competitions, makes his form at Old Trafford all the more mystifying.Verdict: Failure. Antony did win the FA Cup (although he was an unused substitute in the final victory over Manchester City) and EFL Cup, but his performances did not come close to the huge price tag. Harry Maguire (£80m) to Manchester UnitedImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Harry Maguire is not a first-choice selection for Manchester United despite his huge transfer feeMaguire became, and still is, the most expensive defender in the world when he moved from Leicester City in 2019.But his name is synonymous with a continued period of decline at Old Trafford and he only has one EFL Cup medal (he missed the FA Cup final win through injury) to show for it. Under Ten Hag he was stripped of the captaincy and came close to a cut-price move to West Ham in 2023. And since the 2021-22 season, he has not started more than half the club's Premier League games in any campaign.Verdict: Failure. For the world's most expensive defender to win so little, never make the PFA Team of the Year and play relatively few games in his six seasons means the deal does not come close to a success.Josko Gvardiol (£77m) to Manchester CityImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Josko Gvardiol has only been at Manchester City for two years so still has the time to live up to his price tagSigned in 2023 from RB Leipzig, Gvardiol became the second-most expensive defender of all time behind Maguire.The Croatia international won the Uefa Super Cup, the Club World Cup and the Premier League in his first season at Manchester City. Despite City suffering a poor season in 2024-25, Gvardiol was named the club's Player of the Season. Verdict: The jury's out. Gvardiol had a good start at the Etihad, and he is only 23 so has the best years of his career ahead of him. His versatility and composure are an asset, but at the moment the transfer fee looks excessive. Romelu Lukaku (£75m) to Manchester UnitedImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Romelu Lukaku had a good first season at Manchester United but it was diminishing returns for his Old Trafford careerManchester United thought they were solving their goalscoring problems in 2017 when they signed Lukaku from Everton, where he had netted 87 goals in 166 games. But like every United player on this list, it was a case of overpaying to little tangible return. Lukaku's numbers are not actually terrible. He scored 16 Premier League goals in his first season, and 27 goals in all competitions - one of only 11 players to break the 25-goal barrier since 1992-93.What started promisingly soon drifted off, with 26% of his goals - or 11 out of 42 - being scored in the first two months of his Old Trafford career. The club's tactical approach did not help, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer  at times playing him out on the wing.Verdict: Failure, though with a caveat as United did recoup £68.1m when he left for Inter Milan in 2019. Despite the initial goals, Manchester United won nothing in his two years. Virgil van Dijk (£75m) to LiverpoolImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Virgil van Dijk has won the Premier League under Jurgen Klopp and Arne Slot at LiverpoolWe have had to to get to the bottom of the list to find the only player who can be considered to have truly lived up to his price tag.Signed from Southampton in 2018, Van Dijk has earned a reputation as one of the world's very best defenders - with the trophies to boot - over an extended period.The central defender has made 336 appearances for Liverpool, scoring 30 goals, and has been named in the PFA Team of the Year five times. He was also PFA Player of the Season in his first year at Anfield. With one Champions League, two Premier League titles, one FA Cup, two EFL Cups, the Uefa Super Cup and the Club World Cup to his name, he's won the level of silverware you'd expect for a player in this price range.Verdict: Total success.",

    "body": "4 hours agoRuth ComerfordWatch: Keir Starmer does '6-7' hands meme with Peterborough school childrenThe prime minister has apologised to a head teacher after leading primary school children in a version of the viral 6-7 dance meme.Sir Keir Starmer visited Welland Academy in Peterborough with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson on Monday to promote the expansion of the free school meals programme.During the visit, Sir Keir was reading with pupils when one pointed out they were on page 67. The prime minister made the juggling hand gesture that accompanies the reference, prompting class-wide hilarity.\"You know children get into trouble for saying that our in school,\" a teacher told him afterwards.  \"We are not over that yet, the 6-7, it's still very much a thing.\"ReutersAs he left the room, Sir Keir told head teacher Jo Anderson it had been a \"bit wild\" in the class, only to be told the dance was banned at the school.He then apologised to the head, insisting: \"I didn't start it, Miss.\"The prime minister uploaded a video of his antics to Instagram, with the caption: \"I think I just got myself put in detention...\"The phrase \"6-7\", which first gained popularity with Generation Alpha, has gone on to become a viral internet sensation and was even named Dictionary.com's Word of the Year for 2025. The catchy phrase and its accompanying dance has gripped classrooms across the UK, much to the bafflement and annoyance of some parents and teachers. According to Dictonary.com, the phrase is thought to have originated from a song called Doot Doot (67) by US rapper Skrilla.The song went viral on TikTok and on other social media videos to describe the height of basketball players.Earlier this year, teenager Maverick Trevillian became known as the \"6-7\" kid after a viral video showed him yelling the phrase at a basketball game while performing the accompanying hand gesture.The video on YouTube has been viewed more than 7.7 million times.Its actual meaning is unclear, though some say it means \"so-so\" or \"maybe this, maybe that\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoIan YoungsandPaul Glynn,Culture reportersFather Ted co-creator Graham Linehan has been cleared of harassing a teenage trans activist on social media but convicted of damaging the campaigner's phone.Linehan \"deliberately whacked\" Sophia Brooks' phone and threw it in the road outside a conference last October, his trial was told.Westminster Magistrates' Court also heard that the Irish comedy writer \"relentlessly\" posted abusive comments on social media.On Tuesday, the judge said Linehan's social media posts did not amount to harassment but found him guilty of criminal damage in relation to the phone. He denied both charges.Linehan was accused of harassment after calling Brooks, who was 17 at the time, a \"sociopath\", \"psycho\", \"domestic terrorist\" and \"groomer\" on X.District Judge Briony Clarke said that while the posts were \"unattractive, annoying and irritating\", as well as \"deeply unpleasant and even unnecessary\", they were not \"oppressive or unacceptable\" and therefore did not meet the criminal standard for harassment.The pair met in person in October 2024 when Brooks, who was born a biological male but identifies as a woman, confronted Linehan and filmed him outside the Battle of Ideas conference in London.The judge found that Linehan \"took the phone and threw it because he was angry and fed up not because he was using reasonable force to prevent crime\", and that he damaged it in the process.The judge said she did not think \"the complainant was as 'alarmed and distressed' as they portrayed themself to be by these messages and this course of conduct\".She also ruled that \"the complainant was not giving entirely truthful evidence\" during the trial in September, while Linehan was \"generally a credible witness\".He has been fined £500 and ordered to pay costs of £650 and a statutory surcharge of £200.During the trial, Linehan told the court that knocking the phone was a \"reflex response\", and that his life had been \"made hell\" by transgender activists because of his views about gender identity.Speaking outside court on Tuesday, he said there was \"a group of dangerous men who are determined to bully women and girls, and to misuse the courts and police in furtherance of a misogynistic agenda\".He added: \"I'm proud to have stood up to them and I will continue to do so.\"Judge Clarke added that it was \"not for the court to pick a side\" on the \"continuing debate about rights of individuals regarding their sex and gender identity\".She explained that the prosecution used female pronouns to refer to the complainant during the trial, while Linehan's defence used male pronouns. The judge said she had chosen to refer to Brooks using \"gender neutral pronouns and as 'the complainant'\" in her ruling.This case was not connected to separate allegations that led to Linehan's much-publicised arrest at Heathrow Airport in September.He was met by armed officers and held on suspicion of inciting violence in posts on X, sparking a backlash from some public figures and politicians, and inflaming a fierce debate about policing and free speech.In October, the Metropolitan Police dropped its investigation after the Crown Prosecution Service decided no further action should be taken.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPoland has been told to recognise same-sex marriages registered elsewhere in the European Union, in a ruling by the EU's top court.The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that EU member states were obliged to recognise a same-sex marriage between two EU citizens that had been \"lawfully concluded in another member state\".The ruling covers the case of a Polish couple who married in Berlin in 2018. When they decided to move to Poland, authorities refused to accept their marriage certificate as Polish law does not recognise same-sex marriage.The ECJ made clear that Polish domestic law would not have to be changed to recognise marriages between people of the same sex.Since the Netherlands recognised same-sex unions in 2001, a number of other EU countries have followed suit, but others, such as Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, have not.In September, Slovakia's populist-nationalist government changed its constitution to allow only heterosexual couples to adopt children.In its ruling on Tuesday, the ECJ said that while marriage rules fell within each member state's competence, \"countries were required to comply with EU law in exercising that competence\".As EU citizens, the Polish couple who married in Germany had the right to freedom of movement and the right to lead a family life, the court explained. \"In particular by virtue of marriage, they must have the certainty to be able to pursue that family life upon returning to their member state of origin,\" it added, so forcing them to live as an unmarried couple in Poland was contrary to EU law and infringed their rights.Poland's pro-European coalition government has tried to advance the rights of same-sex couples, but its move could be vetoed by conservative President Karol Nawrocki.The ECJ's ruling was welcomed by Katarzyna Kotula, a secretary of state and coalition ally of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who said it was an important step on the path to marriage equality.Meanwhile, centre-left member of the European Parliament Krzysztof Smiszek wrote on social media that \"history is happening\".",

    "body": "7 minutes agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesMore people on low incomes will be encouraged to save through a scheme that offers a large government bonus, the Treasury has announced.About three million people on universal credit are currently eligible for the scheme, which sees the government add 50p for every pound saved after two and four years.An extra 1.5 million parents and carers will become eligible from 2028 and the scheme, which was due to end in 2027, will be made permanent.The change, to be formally announced in the Budget, comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to reduce the amount people can save in cash Isas (Individual Savings Accounts). Reports also suggest the chancellor will not cut VAT on energy bills, which had been the source of much speculation.How the scheme worksHelp to Save is widely regarded as a key incentive for people on low incomes to set money aside for emergencies and to develop a savings habit.To be eligible to open an account, savers need to be on universal credit and have take-home pay of £1 or more in the last monthly assessment period.Up to £50 a month can be saved, which is £2,400 over four years. Bonuses are paid after two and four years, straight into the saver's bank account. So the maximum bonus after four years would be £1,200. The account closes after four years and no more can be opened.The scheme will be expanded to an extra 1.5 million savers in 2028 to include universal credit claimants that have children in education or carers that provide 35 hours of care to someone with a disability.Isa changes expectedSeparately, the amount of money that can be saved tax-free each year in a cash Isa  is likely to be cut in the Budget.The annual allowance is expected to be reduced from £20,000 to £12,000, as the Treasury wants to encourage people to invest instead.That could help boost growth, a key objective for the government. But there are questions over whether people would naturally put their money into stocks and shares Isas as a result of the less generous tax break on cash Isas.About a quarter of those who save money into a cash Isa currently save more than £12,000 a year.Robin Fieth, chief executive of the Building Societies Association, which has campaigned against a cut, said: \"A cut to £12,000 will not encourage more people to invest but will add unnecessary complexity, particularly around Isa transfers, and risks damaging the overall Isa brand. \"This may also deter people from saving and investing. The best way to build a culture of investing is on a strong culture of savings.\"",

    "body": "Are we going to have a white Christmas this year?Image source, Getty ImagesBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter As the nights draw in and festive lights are getting strung up, some of us might start to hope - or dream - of seeing some Christmas snowfall.Christmas cards often depict scenes blanketed in snow. While this is a rare sight in much of the UK, a 'white Christmas' is more common than you might think.More than half of all Christmas Days in the UK have seen snow falling somewhere.So, although the odds are technically stacked in favour of a white Christmas, the detailed festive forecast for this year won't be confirmed for a while yet. At this early stage, what do we actually know about the chances of this Christmas being 'white'?What defines a 'white Christmas'?For a Christmas to be officially considered 'white', the snow doesn't need to be 'deep and crisp and even.'In fact, just a single snowflake has to be recorded falling at any point during the 24 hours of 25 December at any of the Met Office's network of around 300 observing stations.The definition has changed over the years and has been broadened to include data from automated weather-recording stations as well as manned or manual sites.Snow already lying on the ground on Christmas Day may make things look merry and bright, but it does not count under the official definition of a white Christmas.When will we know for sure that we'll have a white Christmas?Image caption, In December 2010, the UK experienced very low temperatures and significant snowfalls. Lying snow was reported in many places on Christmas Day It's still too early to know for sure. The festive forecast will become much clearer about five days before Christmas, so keep an eye on the BBC Weather app or website for the latest updates. You can also read our thoughts further ahead in our monthly outlook.Forecasting snow in the UK is notoriously difficult because, as an island nation, it is most frequently influenced by mild Atlantic weather patterns.However, longer-range weather forecasting models are beginning to show possible trends for the Christmas period, influenced by wider teleconnections - large-scale interactions in which weather patterns in distant regions create atmospheric waves and flows that affect conditions thousands of miles away.One such potential influence to our winter weather is a 'warm blob' in the Pacific Ocean which could favour higher pressure and colder conditions developing in Europe.Meteorologists are also keeping an eye on the development of a potential La Niña event over the coming months - the colder phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. Whilst the link between La Niña and UK weather isn't clear cut, the Met Office suggests that historically it promotes high pressure to develop in the Atlantic in early winter.  This could mean a higher than average chance of colder weather to start December.Overall most computer models are hinting at a trend towards slightly calmer and colder conditions developing towards 25 December, so perhaps there's a chance of seeing something white on the big day! When was the last white Christmas in the UK?The last time the UK saw a widespread white Christmas was back in 2010, when snow fell at 19% of weather stations, and very unusually, 83% of stations reported snow lying on the ground.Since 2020, every year except 2024 has officially been a white Christmas. However, in each of these years, very few places reported any snow actually settling on the ground.What are the \"white Christmas\" odds?The chances of festive snowfall vary a lot in different locations, with much better odds the further north and the higher up you venture. The places most likely to get a white Christmas Day are northern and eastern Scotland, northern England, north Wales and the north-west Midlands.Image caption, Christmas Eve snow is now less likely in much of Europe, some parts of the UK have seen an upward trend in recent yearsAs our climate warms, winters in the UK are becoming milder and wetter. A rise in land and sea temperatures has generally reduced the chances of a white Christmas, especially when compared to the 18th and 19th centuries. ",

    "body": "President Emmanuel Macron said he will announce a new military service aimed at boosting French army numbers later this week. Details are scant, but according to French media the scheme would be voluntary, remunerated and last 10 months.In an interview with local media he sought to reassure French people that the plan did not mean young people would be sent to fight in Ukraine.\"We really need to, right now, dispel any misconception that we're going to send our young people to Ukraine,\" he said. \"That's not at all what this is about.\"However, Macron stated the new framework was meant to address the \"desire for service\" among the youth - and to face the \"hybrid confrontation\" waged by Russia.\"If we French want to protect ourselves... we must show that we are not weak in the face of one power that threatens us the most.\"\"It is very important that as many of our fellow citizens as possible understand what our armed forces are and how they work,\" Macron added.No official details on the new military service have yet been shared, though it is expected Macron will elaborate on the proposal during a visit to an army base on Thursday.French media is reporting that the revamped voluntary military service could last 10 months. Volunteers will be paid between €900 (£790) and €1000 (£880) per month, according to La Tribune Dimanche.Conscription in France was scrapped in 1996. The current iteration of the national service, the Service national universel (SNU), only includes two weeks of training followed by another two weeks of community work. It was introduced in 2019 but never gained much traction.Raphaël Glucksmann of the centre-left Place Publique party said he was in favour of the proposal but suggested it should go further and be a universal and compulsory service - \"not necessarily military\" - which could create \"cohesion\". The National Rally (RN)'s Sébastien Chenu said he supported the idea, although he insisted it should start with a \"mandatory three-month military service for boys and girls\" which could then be extended further.Last week France's army chief-of-staff Gen Fabien Mandon sparked outrage when he told a congress of mayors that France's biggest weakness was the lack of a will to fight and warned the country risked \"losing its children\" in a potential war with Russia. Macron sounded the alarm over what he called a \"turning point in history\" earlier this year. In March, against the backdrop of the start of Donald Trump's second term in office and Russia's ongoing war on Ukraine, he gave a sombre address to the nation in which he said that France and Europe needed to be ready if the US was no longer by their side.\"We have to be united and determined to protect ourselves,\" Macron said at the time.Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, several European countries have brought back some form of military service. From next year Germany will mandate all 18-year-old men to fill out a questionnaire on their ability to serve, with the view of dramatically boosting troop numbers. Latvia and Sweden also recently restarted military service and Lithuania brought it back after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.",

    "body": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas have handed over to the Red Cross a coffin which the armed groups say contains the body of one of the last three deceased hostages still in Gaza, according to the Israeli military.The remains will be transferred to Israeli forces, who will take them to Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for identification.Earlier, PIJ and Hamas announced that the body of an Israeli hostage had been found in central Gaza on Monday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office warned that it viewed \"with severity the delay in the immediate transfer\", saying it constituted a \"further violation\" of the six-week-old Gaza ceasefire agreement.\"Israel demands the immediate return of the three deceased hostages still being held in the Gaza Strip,\" it added.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 22 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 330 Palestinians killed during the war.Two of the three remaining dead hostages are Israelis - Ran Gvili, 24, and Dror Or, 48 - and one is Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction.The dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 69,770 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentJustice Secretary David Lammy is proposing to massively restrict the ancient right to a jury trial by only guaranteeing it for defendants facing rape, murder, manslaughter or other cases passing a public interest test.An internal government briefing, produced by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) for all other Whitehall departments, confirms plans to create a new tier of jury-less courts in England and Wales. The new courts would deal with most crimes currently considered by juries in Crown Court.But the MoJ said no final decision had been taken by the government. The plans, obtained by BBC News, show that Lammy, who is also deputy prime minister, wants to ask Parliament to end jury trials for defendants who would be jailed for up to five years.The proposals are an attempt to end unprecedented delays and backlogs in courts, and do not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland.The MoJ presentation, produced earlier this month, sets out that Crown Courts are facing record backlogs with more than 78,000 cases waiting to be completed. In practice, this means that suspects being charged with serious crimes today may not have a trial until late 2029 or early 2030.Officials predict in the document that the caseload will grow to more than 100,000 before then, unless there is further action.Earlier this year, retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Brian Leveson recommended that the government ends jury trial for many serious offences, saying they could be dealt with by a judge alone or sitting with two magistrates.This would be done by creating a new intermediate tier of criminal court, dubbed the \"Crown Court Bench Division\" (CCBD) sitting in between magistrates' courts and Crown Courts, where juries decide cases.The CCBD would hear cases involving defendants facing sentences of up to three years, Sir Brian recommended.The \"DPM's [deputy prime minister's] decision\", according to the leaked MoJ document is to \"go further than Sir Brian's to achieve maximum impact\".The document says Lammy wants to: \"Introduce trial by judge alone for cases involving fraud and financial offences - if the judge considers the case to be suitably technical and lengthy. Exclusions for rape, murder, manslaughter and public interest.\"The CCBD would be introduced \"as a lower-tier of the Crown Court which hears cases likely to receive a sentence of up to five years by a judge alone\", the document said.This means that while jury trial would be guaranteed for murder, manslaughter and rape - almost all other defendants facing serious offences would be tried by a judge alone.The document continues: \"The reforms will improve timeliness in the Crown Court through extra hearing time... [and] not compromise the right to a fair trial - there is no right to a jury trial.\"Lammy is said by officials to have begun the \"write round\" - Whitehall jargon for obtaining final cross-Cabinet and departmental sign-off before going public.Assuming he gets that approval, an announcement would come in December, with legislation in the New Year.A spokesperson for the MoJ said: \"No final decision has been taken by government. We have been clear there is a crisis in the courts, causing pain and anguish to victims - with 78,000 cases in the backlog and rising - which will require bold action to put right.\"But Riel Karmy-Jones KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association which represents criminal barristers, said the proposals would not solve the crisis in justice.She said: \"What they propose simply won't work - it is not the magic pill that they promise.\"The consequences of their actions will be to destroy a criminal justice system that has been the pride of this country for centuries, and to destroy justice as we know it.\"Juries are not the cause of the backlog. The cause is the systematic underfunding and neglect that has been perpetrated by this government and its predecessors for years.\"",

    "body": "Sugar tax extended to milk-based drinks: What you need to know2 hours agoGetty ImagesMilkshakes, coffee drinks and milk substitutes are to be included in the government's sugar tax scheme for the first time in the UK in a renewed attempt to help tackle obesity.The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.The Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting announced the extension of the tax in the House of Commons on Tuesday, ahead of the budget.How will it work?Extending the sugar tax to milk-based drinks will happen from 1 January 2028. The government says companies which make these drinks will have to reduce the sugar they contain or face paying the tax.That means they could either taste different (less sugary) or cost a bit more.The tax was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to make diets healthier and tackle obesity, by cutting sugar intake.As he made the announcement, the health secretary said: \"Obesity robs children of the best possible start in life, hits the poorest hardest, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems and costs the NHS billions.\"What drinks are included?The sugar tax applies to pre-packaged soft drinks with added sugar.It already applies to most sugary and fizzy soft drinks sold in cans, bottles and cartons in supermarkets.It will now also apply to pre-packaged milk-based drinks with added sugar such as bottled milkshakes and coffee drinks. It will also now cover milk substitutes - plant-based drinks like soya, oat and rice milks with added sugar.Milk-based drinks have been exempt from the sugar tax because they contain calcium, which is encouraged in children and young people's diets.However, the high sugar content of some milk-based drinks means the government has removed that exemption.The government will introduce a 'lactose allowance' to account for the natural sugars in the milk content of these drinks.All milk substitute drinks, such as soya, almond or oat drinks, were previously exempt from the sugar tax if they contained 120mg of calcium per 100ml.But if these drinks contain added sugars beyond those derived from the main ingredient, they will now be taxed.Getty ImagesWhat drinks are not included?The sugar tax does not apply to drinks made and served in cafés, restaurants and bars. So coffees, lattes and other milky drinks made on café premises would not come under this tax.Soft drinks made only with natural sugars, such as plain cows' milk and pure fruit juice, are also not part of the tax.Unsweetened plant-based milks are also not included.Alcohol-free beer or wine, infant formula, drinks sold as powder and cocktails or mocktails served in an open container also don't fall within the scope of the sugar tax.How much do companies pay?Currently, the tax is charged at 19.4p per litre on drinks containing at least 5g of total sugar per 100ml, and 25.9p per litre on drinks with 8g of sugar or more.But the government is bringing down the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks. Instead of 5g, the limit will now be 4.5g per 100ml. What impact has the sugar tax had?To date, it's led to a 46% reduction in the sugar contained in soft drinks affected, the government says. Nearly 90% of the market now contains less sugar than the level at which the tax applies.But experts say there is still too much sugar in UK diets.Free sugars should account for no more than 5% of daily energy intake, current UK advice says.But the amount of sugar consumed in the UK is around double that. And obesity rates in children and adults show no signs of going down either, with nearly two-thirds of people in the UK overweight or obese.This is what has prompted the government to carry out a review of the tax, and extend it to milk-based drinks.How much sugar do children consume?The average free sugar intake among children aged 1.5 to 3 years old is 45g per day (about 11 sugar cubes).For 4-10 year olds, it's 55g per day and for teenagers aged 11-18, it's 70g per day (17 sugar cubes), according to the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey.Less than a third of children younger than three years old meet the recommended limit for free sugar intake.Fruit juices and smoothies make up 12% of free sugars consumed by the youngest children, and 15% in the 4-10 years age group.NHS advice says adults should have no more than 30g of free sugars a day, (equivalent to 7 sugar cubes) - and children much less (no more than 3 cubes for 2-3 year olds). There are different recommended limits for children of different ages.",

    "body": "Adolescence lasts into 30s - new study shows four pivotal ages for your brain6 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentMonty Rakusen/GettyThe brain goes through five distinct phases in life, with key turning points at ages nine, 32, 66 and 83, scientists have revealed.Around 4,000 people up to the age of 90 had scans to reveal the connections between their brain cells.Researchers at the University of Cambridge showed that the brain stays in the adolescent phase until our early thirties when we \"peak\".They say the results could help us understand why the risk of mental health disorders and dementia varies through life.The brain is constantly changing in response to new knowledge and experience – but the research shows this is not one smooth pattern from birth to death.Instead, these are the five brain phases:Childhood - from birth to age nineAdolescence - from nine to 32Adulthood - from 32 to 66Early ageing - from 66 to 83Late ageing - from 83 onwards\"The brain rewires across the lifespan. It's always strengthening and weakening connections and it's not one steady pattern - there are fluctuations and phases of brain rewiring,\" Dr Alexa Mousley told the BBC.Some people will reach these landmarks earlier or later than others – but the researchers said it was striking how clearly these ages stood out in the data. These patterns have only now been revealed due to the quantity of brain scans available in the study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications.The five brain phasesChildhood - The first period is when the brain is rapidly increasing in size but also thinning out the overabundance of connections between brain cells, called synapses, created at the start of life.The brain gets less efficient during this stage. It works like a child meandering around a park, going wherever takes their fancy, rather than heading straight from A to B.Adolescence - That changes abruptly from the age of nine when the connections in the brain go through a period of ruthless efficiency. \"It's a huge shift,\" said Dr Mousley, describing the most profound change between brain phases.This is also the time when there is the greatest risk of mental health disorders beginning.Unsurprisingly adolescence starts around the onset of puberty, but this is the latest evidence suggesting it ends much later than we assumed. It was once thought to be confined to the teenage years, before neuroscience suggested it continued into your 20s and now early 30s.This phase is the brain's only period when its network of neurons gets more efficient. Dr Mousely said this backs up many measures of brain function suggesting it peaks in your early thirties, but added it was \"very interesting\" that the brain stays in the same phase between nine and 32.Adulthood - Next comes a period of stability for the brain as it enters its longest era, lasting three decades.Change is slower during this time compared with the fireworks before, but here we see the improvements in brain efficiency flip into reverse.Dr Mousely said this \"aligns with a plateau of intelligence and personality\" that many of us will have witnessed or experienced.Early ageing - This kicks in at 66, but it is not an abrupt and sudden decline. Instead there are shifts in the patterns of connections in the brain.Instead of coordinating as one whole brain, the organ becomes increasingly separated into regions that work tightly together - like band members starting their own solo projects.Although the study looked at healthy brains, this is also the age at which dementia and high blood pressure, which affects brain health, are starting to show.Late ageing - Then, at the age of 83, we enter the final stage. There is less data than for the other groups as finding healthy brains to scan was more challenging. The brain changes are similar to early ageing, but even more pronounced.Dr Mousely said what really surprised her was how well the different \"ages align with a lot of important milestones\" such as puberty, health concerns later in life and even the pretty big social shifts in your early 30s such as parenthood.'A very cool study'The study did not look at men and women separately, but there will be questions such as the impact of menopause.Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at the University of Cambridge, said: \"Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviours.\"Prof Tara Spires-Jones, director of the centre for discovery brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"This is a very cool study highlighting how much our brains change over our lifetimes.\"She said the results \"fit well\" with our understanding of brain ageing, but cautioned \"not everyone will experience these network changes at exactly the same ages\".",

    "body": "Former Arsenal and France striker Thierry Henry will be honoured with the Lifetime Achievement award at BBC Sports Personality of the Year.The 48-year-old, widely considered to be one of the Premier League's greatest players, retired in 2014. He will be presented with the award at the 2025 BBC Sports Personality of the Year show on Thursday, live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 19:00 GMT. \"Football has given me everything and I gave it my all,\" said Henry. \"To be recognised as part of its history with this Lifetime Achievement award and to have made my mark for the fans and my team-mates is something I'll never take for granted.\"Henry scored 228 goals in 377 matches for Arsenal across his two spells with the Gunners, eclipsing Ian Wright to become the club's record goalscorer in 2005.  He won three FA Cups and two Premier League titles during his time in England - including the 2003-04 season when Arsenal's 'Invincibles' remained unbeaten throughout the Premier League campaign. The striker won the Premier League Golden Boot a record-equalling four times and was named in the PFA Team of the Year six seasons in a row. He holds the joint-record with Kevin de Bruyne for the most assists (20) in a single Premier League season.In 2024, the Lifetime Achievement award was awarded to British cycling great Sir Mark Cavendish.Other previous winners of the award include Billie Jean King, Pele, Sir Bobby Charlton, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Sir David Beckham, Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill and Sir Chris Hoy.Born in the Paris suburb of Les Ulis, Henry won the World Cup on home soil in 1998 and was an integral part of the side that won the European Championship in 2000. With 51 goals in 123 appearances for Les Bleus, Henry was the country's record scorer until former Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud surpassed his total in 2022. But his infamous handball against the Republic of Ireland during World Cup qualifying in 2009 caused huge controversy.He handled the ball in the build-up to William Gallas' decisive extra-time goal, which sealed a 1-1 draw on the night, and a 2-1 aggregate win for France, ending Ireland's chances of qualifying for the 2010 Finals.After eight seasons at Arsenal, Henry joined Barcelona in 2007 and won the treble - La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey - in 2009 with the Catalan giants, as they beat Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United in the Champions League final in Rome. The Frenchman joined Major League Soccer side New York Red Bulls in 2010 but returned to Arsenal for a seven-game loan spell in 2012.In his first appearance for the club in five years, Henry netted the winner in a 1-0 win against Leeds United.Henry scored his only other goal of the two-month loan spell in his final appearance for Arsenal, with a stoppage-time winner against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. After retiring in 2014, Henry assumed a career in punditry and worked for BBC Sport as a studio pundit at Euro 2016.Having worked with Arsenal's youth teams, Henry took his first steps into management as Belgium head coach Roberto Martinez's assistant in 2016. In October 2018, Henry was named head coach of his former team Monaco, but spent just three months in charge of the Ligue 1 side.He was appointed head coach of MLS outfit Montreal Impact in 2019 but left the Canadian club in 2021 in order to return to Europe. Henry was named France's Under-21s manager in 2023, and led their Olympic team at the 2024 Paris Games - where they won silver, losing to Spain in the final.

His influence extends far beyond his goals, shaping football culture and the way the sport is played and understood today. \"His legacy as one of the greatest footballers of all time makes him a truly deserving winner of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement award.\"",

Gill was jailed in November, after admitting to taking bribes for pro-Russian interviews and speeches when he was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP).\nAnnouncing the review, Communities Secretary Steve Reed said the government must \"learn the lessons\" from the case so \"this can never happen again\". Responding to Reed's statement in the Commons, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said his party welcomed the review but called on the government to also make sure it looked into the influence of China on the Labour Party. Victoria and Chris discuss what the review could mean\nPlus, President Trump has filed, what is being reported as, a $5 billion dollar lawsuit against the BBC.

    "body": "Left-wing candidate beats Starmer ally to lead UK's biggest union17 minutes agoBecky Morton,Political reporterandJoe Pike,Political correspondentGetty ImagesAndrea Egan was expelled from the Labour Party three years agoLeft-wing candidate Andrea Egan has been elected as the new leader of Unison, the UK's biggest trade union, in a blow to Sir Keir Starmer.Ms Egan, who was expelled from the Labour Party three years ago, beat the union's current general secretary Christina McAnea, an ally of the prime minister.Following her election, Ms Egan promised to \"stand up to any employer, politician or cabinet minister who acts against our interests\".During her campaign, she had pledged to hold Labour's \"feet to the fire\" and refuse to write the party \"blank cheques\".Congratulating Ms Egan on her victory, Sir Keir said he looked forward to working with her.The PM also praised Ms McAnea's \"outstanding contribution to the Labour and trade union movement\".\"She played an important role in securing the landmark Employment Rights Bill and her work has ensured this Labour government will bring in a fair pay agreement to boost the wages of social care workers,\" he added.With more than 1.3 million members working in sectors providing public services, including education, local government, the NHS and the police, Unison is the UK's biggest trade union.Ms Egan won just under 60% of the vote, although turnout was low, with fewer than 100,000 of the union's members taking part.She will begin her five-year term in January.In a statement following her victory, Ms Egan said: \"This result means ordinary Unison members are at long last taking charge of our union.\"We will put faith in members' decisions and stand up to any employer, politician or cabinet minister who acts against our interests.\"Ms Egan's election was welcomed by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his new left-wing group, Your Party.A Your Party spokesperson said: \"Andrea's victory on an anti-austerity ticket shows that working-class people won't take more cuts and more decline.\"Unison members have said no to Starmer's crumbs off the table, no to chronic low pay, no to underfunding and no to privatisation.\"Ms Egan, who has served as Unison's president since 2022, has criticised welfare cuts, backed a wealth tax and called for a reversal of \"austerity\" in schools and local government.During her campaign, she pledged to launch a review of Unison's relationship with Labour to ensure \"value for money\" and advance the union's policies.Unison is one of Labour's biggest financial backers, donating £1.49m during last year's general election campaign.Ms Egan has said she will not take the £181,000 salary on offer for Unison's general secretary, instead receiving the wage of social worker, her current career.PA MediaChristina McAnea has been Unison's general secretary since 2021Ms McAnea's defeat weakens Sir Keir's strong grip on the party's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC), which has two representatives from Unison.\"It makes [controlling] the NEC harder,\" a Labour source said.Ms McAnea was one of the PM's most solid and vocal supporters amongst trade union leaders and is close to Sir Keir's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney.In contrast, Ms Egan is to the left of Labour and was expelled from the party in 2022 for sharing online articles from a Marxist group.She could apply to rejoin in 2027, after a five-year block.\"The impact on Labour and Keir is huge,\" said one insider.\"But there's not much the party or government could have done. The campaigning work was clearly not done by Christina's team with such low turnout.\"Another Labour source said frustration with the state of the economy would have encouraged some Unison members to back a new leader.\"The general malaise and low real incomes will have mobilised the dissenters,\" they said. \"It can't help but be a reflection on Keir and Rachel [Reeves] but it's not primarily that.\"The UK's two biggest unions - Unite and Unison - will now be led by left-wing leaders who are critical of the government.Some in Labour believe this could put pressure on the bosses of moderate unions like USDAW and GMB to be more vocal in their criticism of government policies.Ms Egan's election and Unison's influence on the NEC could also make it easier for Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham to be selected to fight a by-election and potentially become an MP.The NEC has a key role in shortlisting candidates for parliamentary seats.Ms Egan, who is from Bolton, previously told House magazine: \"I am a fan of Andy. I mean, he's the King of the North!\"",

A post-mortem examination found the preliminary cause of Aria's death was a single stab wound, Avon and Somerset Police said.Flanked by three dock officers and wearing a grey prison-issue tracksuit, the teenager was remanded into custody by District Judge Nicholas Wattam and told his next court appearance would be at Bristol Crown Court on Friday.  His father was among those present in court. Floral tributes to Aria have been left close to the scene of the incident Supt Jen Appleford said it was \"impossible to adequately describe how traumatic the past 36 hours have been\" for Aria's family. \"The tragic loss of such a young girl has caused a huge amount of shock and upset, with there being a profound sense of loss felt throughout the community,\" she added.She said police officers were working with schools across the area to make sure those affected were being supported, adding: \"We are grateful to local residents for the patience shown while we have been carrying out enquiries in the area.\" A police cordon has been in place around Lime Close since Monday, with forensics teams working at the scene as officers carry out house-to-house inquiries.

    "body": "Finland's delegate to last month's Miss Universe pageant held in Thailand has sparked controversy and outrage after a photo of her pulling the corners of her eyes went viral.Sarah Dzafce, who has been stripped of her Miss Finland crown, uploaded the photo with the caption \"eating with a Chinese\". The slanted-eyes pose is often seen as disrespectful to East Asians.The post drew backlash in Japan, South Korea and China against the 22-year-old and even against her country's flag carrier, Finnair.Even Finland's prime minister weighed in on Monday, saying that making such gestures was \"thoughtless and stupid\" and that the controversy that ensued was \"damaging\" to the country.Ms Dzafce claimed the gesture was her reaction to a headache during dinner. She said a friend added the offensive caption to the 11 December post without her consent, according to local tabloid Ilta-Sanomat.Ms Dzafce has apologised for the photo, noting it has \"caused ill will in many people\".\"That was not my intention in any way... One of the most important things for me is respect for people, their backgrounds and differences,\" she wrote on an Instagram post.  The apology still drew criticism, with some calling it \"insincere\" given it was written in Finnish.\"Not sure Chinese outside of Finland would understand it. Such considerate and sincere apology,\" one wrote in a comment on her post.Another wrote: \"That was uncalled for, Asian people didn't do anything to you... We [are] still disappointed in you.\"Two right-wing MPs in Finland, Juho Eerola and Kaisa Garedew, posted photos of themselves mimicking Ms Dzafce's gesture to show their support for the beauty queen.The posts were taken down after backlash. Eerola apologised adding he felt Ms Dzafce was given \"disproportionately harsh punishment\".Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo condemned the MPs' actions as \"childish\", adding that lawmakers should set an example of proper conduct.The Finns Party is deliberating whether the MPs should face any sanctions for their actions, local media reported.Finnair told public broadcaster Yle that the controversy had affected the company, and that there had been calls for tourists to boycott Finland.\"The statements or posts mentioned by some Finnish members of parliament do not represent the values of Finnair,\" the airline wrote on its Japanese X account on Tuesday.\"As an airline supported by employees from diverse backgrounds and customers around the world, we promise to welcome everyone with respect,\" it wrote.The debacle has also drawn attention in Japan, South Korea and China, among other East Asian countries.A Japanese man living in Finland launched a petition calling for an investigation into anti-Asian discrimination, which had gathered more than 7,000 signatures as of Sunday evening, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.The Finnish embassy in Japan said it had received \"numerous opinions and questions\" on Finland's efforts to address racism. \"Racism remains a challenge in Finnish society, and its resolution requires continuous and resolute efforts,\" it acknowledged in an X post earlier this week.The controversy around Ms Dzafce is a postscript to a chaotic Miss Universe pageant hosted in Thailand that had been beset by walkouts and allegations of rigging.The Miss Finland Organisation said dethroning Ms Dzafce was a \"difficult but necessary\" move.\"Miss Finland holds a position of role-model status, which requires respecting all people regardless of their origin, background, or appearance,\" the organisation said in a statement.\"We are deeply sorry for the harm these events have caused. Especially to the Asian community, but also to everyone affected. Racism is never acceptable in any form,\" it wrote.",

    "body": "Naveed Akram, the surviving suspect in Sunday's mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act, the New South Wales police say.His father Sajid Akram, 50, was killed in an exchange of fire with police at the scene.Fifteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured in the attack, which targeted Australia's Jewish community at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. It was the country's deadliest shooting since 1996.Akram also faces 40 charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, as well as one charge of causing a public display of a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol.He was critically injured during the incident on Sunday, and had his first hearing from his hospital bedside, the local New South Wales court said. The case has been adjourned until April 2026, the court added. Earlier on Wednesday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said they were waiting for medication to wear off before formally questioning Akram.\"For his fairness, we need him to understand what is exactly happening,\" Lanyon said.As of Wednesday evening local time, 17 people are still being treated in hospitals across Sydney. One is in critical condition, with four others described as critical but stable.Police have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been \"motivated by Islamic State\" group ideology.On Tuesday, it emerged that the father and son had travelled to the Philippines in November.The Philippine immigration bureau told the BBC that they were in the country from 1 November to 28 November. Their final destination was the southern city of Davao, an immigration spokesperson said.Naveed Akram travelled to the Philippines using an Australian passport, while his father Sajid used an Indian passport, border authorities in Manila told the BBC.Sajid Akram was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, but had \"limited contact\" with his family there, a police official from the Indian state of Telangana said.Among those killed in the attack were two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl, named by her family as Matilda.Boris and Sofia Gurman, a couple filmed wrestling with one of the gunmen during the early stages of the attack, were also among the victims.Another 27 people were taken to hospital with injuries, including two police officers. One of the officers, named as 22-year-old Jack Hibbert, has lost vision in one eye and faces a \"long and challenging recovery\", his family said in a statement.Earlier in the day, thousands gathered to mourn British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, at the first funeral to be held for victims of the shooting.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was not present. Asked on ABC NewsRadio about his absence, he said: \"I would attend anything that I'm invited to. These are funerals that are taking place to farewell people's loved ones.\"The Jewish community has criticised Albanese for not taking enough action on antisemitism - he defended himself against those accusations, telling ABC NewsRadio he had taken a series of measures including appointing the country's first antisemitism envoy, toughening hate speech laws and increasing funding for social cohesion projects and Jewish institutions.Speaking at Rabbi Schlanger's funeral, Rabbi Levi Wolff described his death as an \"unspeakable loss\" for the community.\"Eli was ripped away from us, doing what he loved best,\" he said.\"Spreading love and joy and caring for his people with endless self-sacrifice in his life and in his death, he towered above as one of the highest and holiest souls.\"Rabbi Schlanger had helped organise Sunday's Hanukkah event.Funerals for the other victims are expected to happen over the coming days, including for the youngest victim, Matilda, on Thursday.",

    "body": "1 hour agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesNativity play nerves, Santa's grotto queues and Christmas lights crowds can make the festive season a sensory overload for children even before the big day arrives.And their mini-meltdowns only add to the stresses of parents dashing between school plays, present shopping and masterminding the family feast.Comedian and dad-of-three George Lewis tells CBeebies Parenting Download that while his children \"love the thought of Christmas\", the disruption in routine can make December \"a real inner conflict\" for them. Parenting and child behaviour specialist San Mehra explains the mismatch of high excitement layered with unpredictability is the perfect recipe for \"Christmas overwhelm\". George and San share four ways to create a calmer Christmas for your children.1. Stick to some routineChristmas disrupts normal routines, but San stresses that keeping anchor points like wake-ups, mealtimes and bedtimes the same helps children feel grounded.\"Chaos all day is hard for kids to cope with,\" she says. \"If one part of the routine changes, it's manageable but if everything changes, overwhelm builds quickly.\"She recommends putting up a calendar and marking on events like relatives arriving or a trip to see Santa so children can see what's coming up and ask questions.\"If you've got a child who's got anxiety around change you can have conversations around that and talk about any worries,\" she says. And crucially, she adds, parents should schedule downtime as deliberately as activities as it will help you anticipate if you do or don't have time for certain events. 2. Build your own traditionsGetty ImagesGeorge once clung to an idealised, movie-style Christmas - perfectly wrapped presents, big meals and a bustling house. But two of his children have autism and the unpredictability and crowds quickly became overwhelming.\"I always had this version of the perfect Christmas in my head,\" he says. \"But when my son spent an entire family gathering standing alone at the end of the garden, I thought: if this isn't for him, then who is it for?\"Now he builds Christmas around comfort and predictability: staying at home, keeping numbers low and spreading activities out. One major change was the meal itself.\"We've stopped having Christmas dinner on Christmas Day,\" he explains and instead they cook it on Christmas Eve or Boxing Day. \"Then on the day itself we're not stressing about a big project and we just play with the kids and order a curry in the evening.\"3. Acknowledge how they feelGetty ImagesEven with careful planning, festive outings can tip into overload quickly. And when a meltdown hits, often after a long queue or an overstimulating attraction, San says the first step for parents is to check in with yourself.\"Your first instinct is panic and you might feel embarrassed or stressed and that's okay,\" she says. But it's important to first make yourself calm.Then she recommends getting down to the child's level and helping them feel understood.A simple acknowledgement like: \"You've been waiting for ages, haven't you? You're probably fed up right now\" can ease the tension.\"If you can name what they are feeling, like frustration or boredom, it will reduce the intensity by 50%,\" she says.George adds that his family often chooses SEND-friendly sessions with reduced noise and fewer people to help keep outings enjoyable rather than overwhelming.4. . Teach children to navigate conflictGetty ImagesWith routines off-kilter and excitement running high squabbles can break out between siblings as well as cousins or friends they may not see regularly.When kids clash, San says parents don't always need to dive in immediately. But if things look like they're escalating she suggests guiding them through these stages:Separate the children and ask: \"Do you want my help, or do you want to sort it out yourselves?\"Set the rules: \"They have to be quiet while the other person is speaking and they have to listen and empathise.\"Let each child explain what happened, then briefly clarify the sequence.Brainstorm solutions together and agree on one Check back later to see how it's working.After a while San says that children will \"start to sort it out themselves\" using the same method.

    "body": "2 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesLower clothing prices in November helped to ease the UK inflation rateFalls in food, alcohol, and clothing prices last month helped drive inflation to its lowest level in eight months in November.The inflation rate fell to 3.2% from 3.6%, a larger fall than analysts expected.Lower food prices were the main driver of the fall, \"with decreases seen particularly for cakes, biscuits, and breakfast cereals\", according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) chief economist Grant Fitzner.It comes ahead of the Bank of England's decision on interest rates on Thursday, with a cut widely expected.The fall in inflation will foster hope that inflation has peaked, with this possibly paving the way for further interest rate cuts next year.Other items which also pushed down inflation were the cost of tobacco, restaurant meals and hotel stays, furniture, and transport.Prices are still rising on average across the economy, but there were decreases in some items between October and November.Food prices, which were the biggest driver of the lower inflation figure, fell month on month - bucking a trend for normally rising at this time of the year.   Between October and November, food prices fell by 0.2 of a percentage point, and increased 4.2% in the year to November - a decrease on the 4.9% in the year to November. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she knew that families across Britain \"will welcome this fall in inflation\".\"Getting bills down is my top priority. That is why I froze rail fares and prescription fees and cut £150 off average energy bills at the Budget this year,\" she said. Inflation in the UK is a measure of the Consumer Prices Index, which is a basket of goods and services selected by the ONS that includes things like bread, fruit, and different items of clothing. The fall in inflation triggered a sell off in the pound, with it falling 0.7% against the dollar. Falling food price inflationWhile food inflation has slowed, prices are still rising - and there is a mixed picture for some popular Christmas items. Beef prices are up 27.7% compared with this time last year, with big rises for chocolate (17.3%), milk (14.8%) and coffee (14.5%) according to the data. There were however drops in the price of olive oil (-16.2%), flours (-6.1%), and pasta (-4.2%). Other festive staples, like cheese, potatoes, and poultry, saw small changes in their prices. Reacting to the inflation figure, chief UK economist with Capital Economics, Paul Dales, said it was \"particularly good news\" that the rate of price rises had been \"dragged down by the fun things that we all want to indulge in around this time of year\". He added that clothing and footwear prices could also rebound after Black Friday discounts drop away, but that the overall picture \"shows that disinflation is happening faster than expected\".Black Friday discounts were heavier this year, which helped average clothing and footwear prices stay low in November, Sarah Coles, head of personal finance with Hargreaves Lansdown said.\"Sluggish sales persuaded retailers that they had to work harder to get people through the doors, so discounts were heavier this year - particularly for women's clothing and shoes.\"Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, said: \"As Christmas gifts go, this is a most welcome one. \"It's the time of year when people put a few more things in their supermarket trolley, so news that food and alcohol inflation has fallen will be a boon for cash-strapped families.\"She added that it must be noted that \"falling inflation doesn't mean the cost of living is getting cheaper\" and that \"many households are still reeling from the impact of the mega price hikes we've endured over the past few years\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoOlimpia ZagnatLeicesterBBCTara says she hopes to become a psychiatrist one day so she can read her \"opponent's next move\"\"People are a bit annoyed when I beat them and maybe a bit sad because they lost to a child.\"At just 4ft 2in (130cm), nine-year-old Tara keeps cool as a cucumber when she faces seasoned chess players in tournaments.She recently competed in the 2025 UK Open Blitz Championship qualifier, where she finished as the top performing girl in the tournament and made it to the Women's Final.The prodigy from Leicester says she is hoping to become the best chess player in the world in her age category.Tara says she started falling in love with the game at the age of four and her first opponents were her parents, who are both software engineers.\"When I was playing them I was jumping up and down because I was getting excited about what they will do,\" she says.\"I saw a piece - a knight - which can go in an L shape and I thought they all could go like they're in an army.\"Tara started going to chess clubs in Year 2 but is now privately tutored.Shalini SathiyaseelanTara, who made the women's final, hopes to become the best in the world at her age category\"I play much older people - they get a bit nervous. In big tournaments, when we play very fast, they ask 'how can this girl play like this?'\"And I just keep playing my game and don't worry about others,\" she says.Tara shows no sign of stopping anytime soon, and is constantly training or playing opponents online.She admits she does get nervous sometimes. \"When I played online games against a Master I was getting nervous. But then I started playing and I stopped being nervous.\"Sometimes emotion comes into it. Especially when you make a big move, it can feel emotional. \"Or when you miscalculate something, it can feel a bit sad. But if you keep playing confidently, you can win. Chess is like a mind game,\" Tara adds.She says she will never stop playing, however she would like to become a psychiatrist one day.\"I want to be a psychiatrist. I want to be able to read people's minds so I can find out my opponent's next move,\" she says.Shalini SathiyaseelanTara says chess has helped her with her studiesTara's mum Shalini Sathiyaseelan says she did not think her daughter was going to become a chess prodigy straight away.But as the young girl kept on playing, she said she could see something \"grow inside her\".\"We thought we could support her, get her a coach and get her to the next level,\" Mrs Sathiyaseelan adds.\"She is very quiet and calm. Whenever she goes to tournaments, she prepares for them because every game is different.\"She is really enjoying it. She would sit with her dad and talk about tricks and tactics.\"Head of Fairfield Prep School in Loughborough, Andrew Earnshaw, says watching Tara's development in chess has been \"truly amazing\".\"To qualify for the Women's Final at such a young age is extraordinary, and to hold her own against some of the strongest female players in the country speaks volumes about her talent, determination and composure.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "30 minutes agoDaniel Sandford,UK correspondent and Rachel HaganFar-right activist Tommy Robinson has been found not guilty of a terror offence after not giving police access to his phone in July 2024.The 42-year-old, who was charged under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was stopped by officers at the Channel Tunnel in Folkestone while driving a friend's silver Bentley to Benidorm, Spain. Police said they became suspicious of Robinson's \"vague replies\" about his travel plans. Officers seized Robinson's iPhone and asked him to provide the Pin but he refused arguing that the device contained confidential journalistic material.Delivering his verdict at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Judge Sam Goozee said he could not be sure the stop was lawful.Mr Goozee said: \"I cannot put out of my mind that it was actually what you stood for and your political beliefs that acted for the principle reason for this stop.\"Officers had detained him under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which allows officers to question people at UK ports to determine potential links to terrorism.Judge Goozee said he found it concerning that officers who detained Robinson had \"no real recollection\" of questions asked during the 40-minute stop on 28 July last year.He said the officers involved appeared confused about their powers and had failed to record clear reasons for selecting Robinson. The stop \"gave the impression of an arbitrary decision based on who you are\", the judge added.Alisdair Williamson KC, defending, said the \"predominant influence\" on PC Mitchell Thorogood's decision to stop him was \"'oh look, it's Tommy Robinson\"'.Supporters in the public gallery cheered as he was cleared of all charges. In a video recorded before the hearing, Robinson said his legal fees had been paid by Elon Musk, the Tesla boss billionaire.",

    "body": "53 minutes agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterPrimark saw sales drop in the UK as people spent less at the budget retailer, its owner Associated British Foods (ABF) said.In the year to September it saw a 3.1% fall in like-for-like sales compared with the year prior, which it said reflected weak consumer confidence.The company said it expected the \"subdued\" retail market to impact Primark sales into 2026.ABF said that it was exploring splitting off the fast-fashion retailer from its food business, where it owns brands like Twinings, Ovaltine and Ryvita.The entire business saw profits fall by 13% to £1.4bn for the year.Chief executive George Weston said though he was \"confident\" for 2026, it depended on the \"consumer environment\" which was was \"particularly unpredictable at the moment\".British shoppers have been tightening their belts amid rising prices on the UK high street, and turning to even cheaper competitors such as Shein and Temu. Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, has held stubbornly at 3.8% for the year to September. Although inflation is down from highs seen in 2022-2023, it remains above the Bank of England's target of 2%. The Associated British Foods boss said in a call after the financial results that there was a \"working assumption\" in ABF that a separation of Primark \"is where we would like to get to\", although no decision had been made.Dan Coatsworth from AJ Bell said it was not clear what triggered a rethink by the board, which had previously pushed back against the idea of a break-up, but did say Primark could command a much higher share price as a standalone company separate from its food business, which AB Foods said was \"less well-understood\" by the market.Mr Coatsworth said over the years many people have expressed a desire to only invest in Primark, rather than have its rapid growth \"diluted\" by non-retail interests.He added that \"the wheels are being greased for a corporate break-up\", especially as such demergers are \"all the rage\" at present, with Unilever, Kraft Heinz and Warner Bros Discovery among those currently in the process.\"The idea of 'slimming to greatness' is based on the principle that big companies might benefit from having a tighter focus rather than spinning three or four plates at the same time,\" he added.Laura Lambie from Rathbones added that ABF was a \"disparate mixture of businesses with no real strategic rationale behind it\". Primark, which has 475 stores in 18 countries, had reached the size where it requires extra focus to capitalise on its growth prospects, particularly overseas said analysts, with one saying Primark was the \"jewel\" in ABF's crown.But Primark's challenges in the UK could worsen as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in the Budget later this month.That would come on top of cost rises seen since the last Budget, including more expensive staffing costs as a result of the rise in minimum wage.The news comes as a series of casualties on the UK high street continue as the costs of maintaining bricks-and-mortar stores becomes too high amidst rising online competition and  pressure on consumer spending.Recent retail names that have had to close stores or enter administration include Bodycare, Claire's, and Pizza Hut which said it will be slashing the number of restaurants it operates.",

    "body": "47 minutes agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterPost Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates has reached a settlement with the government, more than 20 years after he started campaigning for justice for victims of the Horizon scandal.Sir Alan led a group of 555 subpostmasters who took part in a landmark legal action against the Post Office.The sum paid to Sir Alan has not been made public.Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 subpostmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT system indicated shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts.Hundreds more poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution.Marriages broke down, and some families believe the stress led to serious health conditions, addiction and even premature death.A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We pay tribute to Sir Alan Bates for his long record of campaigning on behalf of victims.\"We can confirm that Sir Alan's claim has reached the end of the scheme process and been settled.\"As of September 2025, a total of £1.23bn had been awarded to more than 9,100 sub-postmasters.Sir Alan first received an offer of redress in January 2024, which he rejected, describing it as \"cruel and derisory\".He was made another offer in May 2024 which he said was around a third of what he had requested. In May of this year, he said that he'd received a third offer for less than 50% of his original claim.Sir Alan was part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, under which claimants can either receive £75,000 or seek their own settlement.The Post Office/Horizon scandal reached new heights in the public consciousness last year after Sir Alan's campaign for justice was portrayed in the ITV drama series Mr Bates vs the Post Office.The government adopted all but one of the recommendations of a report published following an inquiry into the scandal.The inquiry detailed the full human impact of the scandal for the first time: the report said that more than 13 people may have taken their own lives as a result of what happened to them.Earlier this year, Sir Alan accused the government of putting forward a \"take it or leave it\" offer of compensation amounting to less than half of his claim.Many victims have previously complained about being forced to accept low offers of compensation, without the benefit of legal help.Last month, the government announced that all victims who are claiming compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice to help them with their offers.There are four different compensation schemes, which are aimed at different groups of victims.Individual eligibility for compensation depends on the particular circumstances of each case.However, the schemes have been criticised for being too slow and complicated, with many of the worst-affected victims receiving far less than their original claims.",

    "body": "New Attenborough doc captures lion saving pregnant hyena from wild dogs 12 hours agoElizabeth DawsonEnvironment ResearcherPregnant hyena forced to take risks, saved by lion-sized distractionRare hyena behaviours have been caught on camera, including a mother-to-be trying to steal food from wild dogs and outsmarting rivals by hiding a stolen carcass underwater to mask its scent.This is just some of the remarkable animal behaviour on display in the new BBC wildlife documentary series, Kingdom, which follows the lives of four rival carnivore families over five years.​​The scenes include poignant moments as the animals face threats from snare trappings to brutal ambushes and violent territorial battles. \"We could never have written a script like this, only nature could write this script,\" said executive producer Mike Gunton.​​Behind the scenes, the Zambia Carnivore Programme works to protect these animals.BBC StudiosLeopard Mutima was followed by filmmakers from a cub to an adult​​The team followed four animal families - leopards, hyena, wild dogs and lions - in Zambia's Luangwa Valley, capturing rare moments and revealing the intricate dynamics of life in one of Africa's wildest regions.Viewers will watch five-day-old lion cubs opening their eyes, alongside dramatic scenes shown in Kingdom for the first time, such as a pack of wild dogs rescuing one of their own from the jaws of a crocodile.Other wild animals like elephants and baboons also feature in the new series, which is narrated by Sir David Attenborough.BBC StudiosThe Luangwa Valley is home to Zambia's largest lion population​\"Everything about these species has been shaped by millions of years of competition alongside each other,\" said series producer Felicity Lanchester. \"Now…humans are changing that,\" she added.Filmmakers and scientific researchers in the region have collaborated behind the scenes as the footage is a valuable source of data, informing conservation strategies.​​\"We got a lot of information that we wouldn't have been able to get otherwise... on topography, diet, movement, births, and deaths,” said Dr Matthew Becker, scientific consultant for the series and CEO of the Zambia Carnivore Programme.BBC StudiosA cinematographer films a curious hyena in ZambiaThe greatest threat these large carnivores face is habitat loss, while snaring and a declining prey base also play a role. Wire traps, or snares, are often set for antelope - both for food and illegal trade - but many large mammals become victims as by-catch.These pressures are changing pack sizes, diets and survival strategies, according to Dr Becker. A single incident can have knock-on effects, impacting dozens or even hundreds of animals.​​In one scene, a wild dog reappears after losing a leg in a snare trap. Despite his injury, his natal pack welcomes him back, ensuring he eats his share and keeps up on hunts.​​For those not as fortunate, the Zambia Carnivore Programme exists to protect them. The organisation, along with other local groups, removes snares, safeguards dens and provides information for law enforcement on illegal trade in ivory and bushmeat.BBC StudiosA pride of lions plays beside a riverReflecting on the conservation focus of the series, Dr Becker said: \"Ultimately, it's a message of optimism in the face of some very concerning trends.\"​​Its incorporation in wildlife programmes is now an inevitability, according to the producers. The external forces acting on these creatures are clear and series like Kingdom can shed light on the need to protect them.Speaking about conservation, ​​series editor, Simon Blakeney, said: ​​\"It’s a challenge, but it's not hopeless.\"Kingdom begins on BBC One at 18:20 GMT on Sunday and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer.

    "body": "1 hour agoChris MasonPolitical editorIt has been called the 50-year tax taboo.It is more than half a century since a chancellor of the exchequer chose to put up the basic rate of income tax - that was Labour's Denis Healey, who delivered his Budget on 15 April 1975.Not once since have any of his successors done the same thing.Five decades later, could Rachel Reeves change all of that in three weeks time?That was one of the big questions hovering over Downing Street as us reporters headed in almost before dawn for the chancellor's breakfast time speech and news conference.Tradition dictates that three weeks out from a Budget the air is full of every conceivable voice but the chancellor's. But not this time.Why?You can pick your expression of choice: softening up, expectation management, pitch-rolling. They all translate as preparing us for unpopular choices to come.Reeves volunteering to commandeer the broadcasting apparatus of Downing Street – the specially built news conference room in No 9 – tells you everything about the scale of what she is toying with at the end of the month.Well, I say everything, not quite. The actual choices, the decisions, including which taxes will go up and by how much, will come at the end of the month.What we got this morning was the argument, the case for what she will do. One senior figure said to me, think of the news conference as being like the first five pages of the chancellor's speech on Budget Day, in which she sketches out the economic landscape as she sees it before she announces what she is going to do.On the day itself, reporters tend to gloss over those opening pages afterwards, because the choices are more newsworthy than the argument.So, the Treasury's rationale goes,  Reeves wanted to set out the argument in isolation today, so it does get heard.In the next three weeks, expect plenty of focus on page 21 of Labour's election manifesto from last year.Here is what it says, in black and white: \"Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.\"It is why I chose to read it out, word for word, to the chancellor in the news conference – scrutinising their promises on your behalf.Reeves told me she regarded it as a \"courtesy\" to you to set out in broad terms the trade-offs she is contemplating.Senior government figures know that driving a coach and horses through that manifesto promise will be visible from space and could be a, if not the, defining moment for Sir Keir Starmer and Reeves.Of course, perhaps in the end she will choose not to put up income tax – and be able to say words to the effect of \"it wasn't as bad as you thought\".  But economists are suggesting that perhaps, given the state of the books, the government might have run out of better ideas.And barely anyone now disputes taxes are going up, whichever ones they might be.",

It is also public recognition that it has to talk to the UK about its future - and about potential change.The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg The council, which is unrelated to the European Union, is the international political body in Strasbourg that oversees and enforces the work of the European Court of Human Rights.The court rules on how to interpret human rights law in its 46 member states. In the UK, the government and judges must take these rulings into account, but are not bound by judgments that do not closely relate to our circumstances.Sir Keir Starmer's government has committed to changing how the government interprets the right to privacy and family life so that it can't be used by illegal immigrants to frustrate their removal from the country.In a speech earlier this year in Strasbourg, Shabana Mahmood, then justice secretary and now home secretary, said the convention itself must evolve to maintain public confidence.The Conservatives and Reform are calling for the UK to walk away from the treaty, claiming Strasbourg's human rights law is a block on managing borders.Nine EU nations, led by Denmark and Italy,  have also called for major changes - which would need the agreement of all member states.Inside the courtroom at the ECHR In a rare interview about the ECHR's relationship with the UK at the council's headquarters in France, Berset told the BBC: \"I am ready, absolutely ready, and really open to engage in all political discussions, to see what we need to discuss, maybe to change or to adapt.\"Let us engage on migration issues and to see what we need to address and maybe to change.\"The most important point is to be ready to speak on all issues without taboo... and to see then what could be the possible consensus between member states.\"Critics of the ECHR say that the advantage of leaving for the UK would be to take back control over human rights law.But Berset said: \"The opposite is true. What I see is more the risk to be a bit isolated. It would mean to be not participating to all the discussion on migration, to take an influence.\"While he said he would not comment on internal politics in the UK, Berset appealed for the debate over the ECHR had to return to \"facts\".The original ECHR declaration, agreed by the UK Government and others in 1950 Last month, British ministers won the backing of 16 other countries at a meeting in Denmark to find ways to revise how their individual courts interpret parts of the ECHR. The aim would be to make it easier for governments to remove someone with no right to be in a country, even if they claim they have a settled family life. One British official involved in the talks described it as a \"pivotal\" meeting in the history of the ECHR It's not clear how long that work will take - and whether it will ultimately lead to a complete reworking of parts of the ECHR. That could take years to diplomatically agree while claims and counter-claims about ECHR continued.Mr Berset denied that the convention was a friend of terrorists or illegal immigrants, following claims that the court had prevented the deportation of illegal immigrants and migrants who commit criminal offences. He said the UK also had to consider how leaving would effect Northern Ireland's power sharing agreement and the post-Brexit deal with the EU, both of which include a legal commitment to shared human rights principles.Leaving, he argued, would send a \"really negative signal\" for Ukraine because of the Council of Europe's central role, supported by the UK, in preparations for tribunals in relation to war crimes.The world where we are now is bit more dangerous than  was the case 20 - 25 years ago,\" said Berset. \"And it's exactly for those moments that the Council of Europe was created.\"Churchill was the father of the Council of Europe, and the convention. It will be quite difficult and really hard to see this [the UK quitting]. There is no alternative. We need to have some room, places, where we are in discussion together.\"He added: \"Are we able to avoid the wars to make sure that in this phase of divergence that we are witnessing right now, are we strong enough to make sure again, that we have convergence, take control of what we want to have as a future collectively?\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoPhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterFor the first time in Great Britain, there are more over-16s using vapes or e-cigarettes than smoking cigarettes, according to the Office for National Statistics.Some 5.4 million adults use vapes daily or occasionally, compared with 4.9 million using cigarettes, an ONS survey for 2024 suggests.Daily use of vapes is most common among 25-49 year olds, with rising use among women. The popularity of cigarette smoking has been falling for the past decade as the harmful effects of tobacco encouraged many to quit, while less risky vape use has been rising - particularly among younger age groups.Vaping poses a small fraction of the risks of smoking, the NHS says, since cigarettes release thousands of chemicals when they burn, many of which are poisonous and can cause cancer. Switching to vaping reduces those risks.The ONS's Opinions and Lifestyle Survey suggests that 10% of adults aged 16 and over currently use an e-cigarette every day or occasionally - slightly more than the 9.1% who say they currently smoke.The number saying they've given up smoking has risen - 74.2% in 2024, up from 70.3% in 2023.Back in the 1970s, less than 30% had quit the habit. At that time, nearly half of the population were smokers.But much has changed since then. In 2006-2007, a ban on smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces was introduced and in 2015, a ban on smoking in cars with children was brought in.More recently in 2017, plain cigarette packaging was introduced.And government legislation currently progressing through parliament will soon mean anyone born on or after 1 January 2009 will not be legally allowed to buy tobacco in the UK.Rules on how vapes are packaged and displayed in shops are also set to be tightened over concerns that the devices are appealing to children.The ONS survey suggests 6.7% of people aged 16 and over in Great Britain use a vape or e-cigarette every day, up from 5.9% in 2023.Another 3.3% say they use one occasionally.This equates to 5.4 million current vape users, a rise from 5.1 million in 2023.The use of e-cigarettes \"daily or occasionally\" remained highest among 16 to 24 year olds in Great Britain in 2024 at 13.0%.  But this is down from 15.8% in 2023.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAna Faguy and Sakshi Venkatraman,New YorkWatch: 'Hard' to send money to New York City if Mamdani wins mayoral race, Trump saysUS President Donald Trump has endorsed Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayor's race, urging voters not to elect left-wing front-runner Zohran Mamdani. \"Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job,\" Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday evening. \"He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!\"The president earlier said he would be reluctant to send more than \"the very minimum\" level of federal funding to his hometown of New York if Mamdani was elected.This echoed comments he made in a television interview on Sunday, during which he referred to Mamdani as a communist - a label that Mamdani rejects.\"It's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York,\" Trump said in the interview. \"Because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there\". Responding to Trump's comments about funding, Mamdani said he would \"address that threat for what it is: it is a threat. It is not the law.\"He describes himself as a democratic socialist, and has rejected accusations he is a communist, joking in one television interview that he was \"kind of like a Scandinavian politician\", only browner. The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to cut federal grants and funding for projects primarily located in Democratic-run areas. New York City received $7.4bn (£5.7bn) in federal funding this fiscal year.  Three key races, California's map and the Trump factor - what to watch in US electionsIndependent candidate Cuomo, a long-term Trump critic who was formerly a Democratic governor for New York state, responded to the tepid backing from the president: \"He's not endorsing me. He's opposing Mamdani.\"Opinion polls suggest Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, is ahead of Cuomo, who is running as an Independent after Mamdani bested him in the Democratic primary. The Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, trails behind. Trump, also a Republican, declined to endorse Sliwa in Monday's social media post, saying: \"A vote for Curtis Sliwa ... is a vote for Mamdani.\"Mamdani said that \"the MAGA movement's embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump's understanding that this would be the best mayor for him\".\"Not the best mayor for New York City, not the best mayor for New Yorkers, but the best mayor for Donald Trump and his administration,\" Mamdani said.Getty ImagesMamdani won the Democratic mayoral primaryIn his wide-ranging interview with CBS programme 60 Minutes on Sunday, Trump said that Mamdani in office would make left-wing former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \"look great\". \"I got to see de Blasio, how bad a mayor he was, and this man will do a worse job than de Blasio by far,\" the president said. Trump grew up in the New York borough of Queens and still owns property in the city.  \"I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other, but if it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,\" the Republican president told CBS.If Mamdani wins, he will become the city's first Muslim mayor and its youngest in more than 100 years. Watch: Mamdani, Cuomo or Sliwa? New Yorkers on their choice for mayorThe 34-year-old state assemblyman has called Cuomo, the former New York governor, a puppet and parrot of Trump. \"The answer to a Donald Trump presidency is not to create its mirror image here in City Hall,\" Mamdani said on Monday. \"It is to create an alternative that can speak to what New Yorkers are so desperate to see in their own city and what they find in themselves and their neighbours every day - a city that believes in the dignity of everyone who calls this place home.\"Cuomo has sought to parry that line of attack by presenting himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the Trump administration.He was governor of New York state during the Covid-19 pandemic when many states clashed with the Trump administration, though Cuomo himself came under scrutiny after state investigators found nursing home deaths were significantly understated during the outbreak.\"I fought Donald Trump,\" Cuomo said during a recent debate ahead of the mayoral vote. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\" Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities as part of a crime crackdown, while seeking to strip funding from jurisdictions that limit their co-operation with federal immigration authorities.

    "body": "1 hour agoRuth CleggSenior health reporter BBCBack in the 1990s, Alan Reeves would regularly perform on stage, stripping off to thousands as a member of The Dreamboys. He was so sought after that he, along with his troupe of male dancers, popped up in the Spice Girls film, Spice World.The then 24-year-old was, by his own admission, \"a bit of a pin up\".But by the time Reeves was in his 30s, he found himself in a very different situation — his mood was low and his libido had virtually disappeared.\"I just didn't feel right,\" he says.Reeves, now aged 52, says his lack of a sex drive began to have a detrimental impact on his long term relationship.\"We were going without sex for three, four months at a time. I just wasn't interested,\" he says.\"This kind of thing can cause couples to break up.\"Fragile Films/ Icon Entertainment International/ Polygram Filmed EntertainmentGeri Halliwell and Alan Reeves in the Spice Girls film, Spice WorldNow a fitness and lifestyle coach based in London, Reeves began testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and says it has given him his libido back, turning him \"from a grumpy old man\" to feeling like he's back in his 20s. It just \"felt phenomenal\" he says.And women too are turning to testosterone.Rachel Mason, a 37‑year‑old menopause blogger, says the hormone has been \"amazing\" for her energy levels, concentration, and libido.Prescriptions for testosterone have surged. The latest data from the NHS Business Authority, compiled by the Care Quality Commission, shows that prescribing rose by 135% between 2021 and 2024.This increase comes at a time when sex drive across the UK appears to be waning. According to the National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), which questions more than 10,000 people roughly each decade with new figures due out later this year, the frequency of sex has steadily declined.In 1990, people aged 16 to 44 reported having sex an average of five times a month. By 2000, that had dropped to four times, and by 2010, to three. The next set of results are due later this year, and researchers expect the downward trend to continue — though they do not point to a singular reason for the decline.Against this backdrop, a debate is gathering pace. Can boosting testosterone improve libido, or is much of the attention solely hype, profit, and placebo?Diminishing sex driveAlan Reeves' experience of declining libido is just one example of a trend researchers say is becoming increasingly common.\"Over the years, we have noticed a drop across every demographic,\" says Soazig Clifton, Natsal academic director.\"There are fewer cohabiting couples than there were in the 90s, for example, so that could help explain the reduction in sex drive, but even when we looked specifically at that group, there was a decrease.\"In fact, some of the steepest declines in sexual frequency were among older, married or cohabiting couples.Clifton says it is difficult to say conclusively why sex drive seems to be declining.\"No data we have so far can really tell us with any confidence why, as a population, we are no longer having sex as much,\" she says.There are several studies which try to understand the reason, highlighting that the digital world could be a major factor, making it harder to switch off, as well as offering more choices of things to do.Our stress levels are also generally higher than they were 30 years ago, which may be a factor, says Dr Ben Davis, a GP and sex therapist.\"People have so much going on,\" he explains, \"There's tech obviously, but there's also an increase in stress, depression, loneliness […] all of these will add to a reduction in sex drives.\"And there is another possibility that has generated lots of interest online and become big business —  that low testosterone levels could be having an impact on sex drive.\"Testosterone levels in men are definitely reducing,\" says Prof Geoffrey Hackett, consultant urologist and member of the British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM).\"The rise in obesity, type 2 diabetes, the increasing number of people leading more sedentary lives — all of these reduce testosterone levels. And declining testosterone levels will be a factor in why our sex drive is diminishing.\"Several large scale studies over the past 20 years which have measured levels in men, suggest that testosterone levels have dropped, but Hackett stresses that the picture is nuanced — having low testosterone does increase the likelihood of a low libido, but that does not mean that everyone with low testosterone will have a low sex drive.Despite this complexity, tube stations, bus stops and social media feeds are now festooned with adverts like: Low libido? Brain fog? Tired? Time to get a testosterone check! Has your man lost his spark? It might be his hormones!So, can testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) really offer a cure‑all for low libido?Testosterone 'gave me my life back'Melissa Green has been taking testosterone for nearly a year. She says it not only gave \"her zest for life\" back – it saved her marriage.The 43-year-old says her low sex drive was having a huge impact on their relationship.Being perimenopausal, her GP had already prescribed her oestrogen and progesterone through hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but Green says the GP would not test her testosterone levels, saying she did not need that extra hormone.The NHS says it follows guidance from the National Institute of Care Excellence which states that testosterone should only be considered for women following a trial of HRT and all other factors which explain low sexual desire have been excluded. Those with concerns should speak to their GP, they add.Eventually, Green went to a private clinic, had blood tests done, and was told her levels were low. After taking her results back to her GP, she now receives some testosterone on the NHS, and a small top up through a private prescription.\"It's given me my life back. In some ways, I feel like I'm back in my 20s,\" she says, \"I've got more energy, I feel sharper, and my sex drive has come back.\"Melissa GreenMelissa Green and her husband, MarcusWhile some are effusive about the impact testosterone has on libido, others say it has had less welcome effects.Cheryl O'Malley was on testosterone for a year. She says while it may have helped return some of the energy she had lost during the menopause, it also boosted her sex drive too much, and left her with feelings of intense rage.\"I was really horny. I wanted to have sex with my husband, but at the same time I hated him.\"That's when you know this is not a good place to be, this was not me, I felt out of control.\"Rachel Mason says when she posts about TRT she finds \"many women are so scared to start testosterone, they worry they will become manly, develop facial hair, lose themselves.\"Rachel Mason @raysecommunityRachel Mason says testosterone has been \"amazing\" for her Mason says she has a \"particularly hairy part\" of her wrist where she applies her testosterone gel on a daily basis, but that the benefits she gets from the hormone are worth it.Along with increased body hair, TRT can come with a range of other side effects. For women, the most common effects are excess hair growth, acne and weight gain, which are usually reversible with reduction in dosage or discontinuation. Alopecia and deepening of the voice are rare with testosterone replacement.For men, it can cause side effects such as weight gain, painful and prolonged erections, male pattern baldness and mood swings. It can also lead to lower sperm production which can impact fertility. There are treatments that can help, but medical advice is recommended.'It's a gravy train'Some NHS GPs and secondary care consultants have told the BBC that private clinics are profiteering by selling TRT as a quick fix to a complicated problem.Dr Paula Briggs, an NHS consultant in sexual and reproductive health, describes it as a \"gravy train\" where people end up paying a lot of money for something they do not need.\"It's out of control,\" she says. \"The wellbeing industry has created this gap in the market they're using to their advantage.\"It's abusive.\"Private clinics, however, say they are improving people's lives by offering a service that the NHS is failing to provide.Jeff Foster, an NHS GP and medical director at Voy, a multi-million pound clinic specialising in men's health, says the private sector is filling a gap in care.\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone.\"TRT is offered via the NHS with most clinics functioning under either endocrinology or urology.Michael Kocsis has been offering TRT through his company, Balance My Hormones, since 2016. He says that he's seen demand grow \"exponentially\" over the past few years.Kocsis says some of his patients have gone through the NHS to be tested, and been told they do not have low levels of testosterone, so have decided to go private.\"Just because their level of testosterone might be a bit higher than the threshold set by the NHS, does not mean that TRT can't help them.\"It's not black and white, it's more nuanced than that.\"AFP via Getty Images\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone,\" says Jeff Foster, a medical director at VoyFor men, testosterone starts to decrease by around 1% from the age of 30 to 40. NHS advice states that this is a normal part of ageing and is unlikely to affect libido.Alan Reeves initially received TRT on the NHS. Two tests showed levels of 10nmol/L (nanomoles per litre) and 12nmol/L, and he was given a course of four injections, three weeks apart. But after his fourth treatment, Reeves was told it could no longer continue, \"without much of an explanation.\"\"I was back to square one,\" he explains. \"That's when I decided to go private.\"Alan Reeves @coachalreevesAlan Reeves is now a fitness and lifestyle coachSo, what is a healthy testosterone level for men? It differs depending on which organisation you ask and which study you read.Guidelines from the BSSM, which have been interpreted from major international studies, suggest that men with less than 12nmol/L, should be considered for TRT and will probably be showing symptoms of hypogonadism — a condition where the testes are not producing enough of this vital sex hormone.NHS guidance differs between trusts, but it states that a man with levels below 6 to 8nmol/L may have testosterone deficiency.For women, testosterone starts to decrease between the ages of 20 and 40 before it plateaus as they enter menopause. It's normal for levels to go down, but the question is how much that reduction has an impact on sex drive and overall wellbeing.There are tests available, but it's difficult to take accurate readings because, while testosterone is also vital for women, the amount needed is a lot less. And even if it is prescribed, it has to be given a \"off-label\" as there is currently no licensed treatments for women available on the NHS.More from InDepthBriggs is wary of the buzz around TRT. She says she has seen a huge surge in patients telling her they need testosterone because they feel low and not in the mood for sex anymore.\"They tell me they've done their research. Often that means they have seen the life changing impact this hormone has had on someone posting about it on social media.\"Just because it works for a celeb does not mean it works for the general population.\"She says GPs in her local area, Cheshire and Merseyside, are inundated with patients asking for testosterone checks. There are many, she says, that will leave with a TRT prescription, only to come back a few months later and say it's had very little impact.While it does help some people, she says, the proportion of those who say they need testosterone, and who will actually benefit from it, is small. Clinical evidence so far when it comes to women, suggests that TRT is only effective for treating those who are postmenopausal with low libido.Briggs says advertising by private clinics has \"blown everything out of proportion.\"\"I'm not against TRT when it's needed, what I am against is seeing it so over-promoted.\"GP Ben Davis also warns that TRT can have a placebo effect, leaving patients sometimes taking and paying for medication privately, that they do not need.Cheryl O'Malley has stopped taking testosterone. She says the intense anger and heightened sexual arousal she experienced during treatment have subsided, and her libido has returned to a level that feels comfortable for her.\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it,\" she says.'It's not a silver bullet'\"For some, medication can be really transformative,\" Davis says, but he adds that it is more than just handing out medication.\"GPs might not have time to discuss with a patient what is behind their low sex drive, could it be their relationship with their partner, could it be how they view themselves, could it be the sex they are currently having is longer turning them on?\"He says that there are so many factors that play into a low libido and testosterone is not the only answer.Cheryl O'Malley\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it [testosterone],\" says Cheryl O'Malley Alan Reeves, however, has been on TRT for seven years now and is prescribed testosterone by the private clinic, Balance My Hormones. He says his life has dramatically improved.\"My libido came back, so much so at first, I wanted sex every night for 10 nights.\"But now that's calmed down and I am just in a good place.\"Nonetheless, Reeves believes \"it is not a silver bullet\" and there is no point in taking testosterone without making other changes to your lifestyle.Otherwise, he says, it's like putting a Ferrari engine in a \"clapped out car\".\"I walk… taller now, that's partly down to testosterone, partly down to me.\"Additional reporting: Nat WrightTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "One giant boys' club? Why Westminster can still feel like a man's world12 hours agoLaura KuenssbergSunday with Laura KuenssbergBBCIs there a boys' club in politics? I ask a smart, tough, very experienced woman who has worked at the highest level of government.\"Yes,\" comes the answer - without a second's hesitation. \"The end.\"Yes, many more women than ever have taken up perches on the green benches - but that's not the same as having access to the inner sanctum where decisions are made.Yes, there are many more women working at senior levels in Whitehall - and all the main parties have made big efforts to get more women into parliament. But that's not the same as being listened to.And yes, as part of Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to prop up his administration, three senior men have used the exit – the boss of the civil service, his chief of staff, and his head of communications, to be replaced, at least in part, by women.But this week, a serving member of the cabinet, Lisa Nandy, suggested Labour had been operating as a \"boys' club\" and went on to complain \"some of the briefings have absolutely been dripping with misogyny\".Don't just casually ignore one of Labour's most senior politicians suggesting - quite openly - that a clique of men have had too much sway in government, and some of them have used woman-hating as a political tool.But what is the \"boys' club\" and how big a problem is it for Sir Keir?\"Massive,\" says one minister.PA WireDeputy leader Lucy Powell is the second-highest ranking politician in the Labour PartyIt's more than 100 years since the first woman took her seat as an MP - there weren't even women's loos when Nancy Astor arrived. She's said to have nipped down to the Ritz to use the facilities before a ladies' toilet was installed in Parliament's neo-gothic palace.More than 100 years later, Rachel Reeves arrived in the Treasury in 2024 to find a urinal in the chancellor's bathroom - that shows how long it has taken for women to get access to all areas of politics.Loos aside, one former Labour minister tells me the so-called \"boys' club\" is a particular problem for Starmer because, \"You have a prime minister who is not very political, so he has had to rely very heavily on the network that he has - which is the boys' network. He has been unable to see the pitfalls or the issues or problems of it\".There was even, one cabinet minister says, a \"whole network of Matts\". Others have joked before about the \"boys in blue suits\", or the \"ladz\" (yes, with a z), a group whose hero was Morgan McSweeney, the departed chief of staff.But there have been plenty of women at senior levels in and around Starmer's operation – the home secretary Shabana Mahmood, the foreign secretary Yvette Cooper, the general secretary of the Labour Party Hollie Ridley, some of the press team, and, of course, his chancellor.ReutersLabour peer Harriet Harman is urging the prime minister to name a woman as his first secretary of stateOne insider and Starmer ally told me that \"boys' club\" perception is \"totally unfair on all the brilliant women\" who have been involved. Another senior figure said they were \"boiling with rage\" when that accusation had been chucked around.Yet senior sources suggest No 10 has sometimes made it difficult for the very senior female ministers to get \"face time\" with the prime minister – access is one of the most precious commodities in politics.There does, at least for now, seem a determination that things will change with a new interim female chief of staff and a female political director in post.\"It probably doesn't exist anymore – because a lot of the people that gave rise to some of that culture have gone now,\" says a cabinet minister.But they suggest the perception of the \"boys' club\" was also a shorthand for something else. \"It wasn't just a boys' club, it was a factional group as well\".One veteran Labour figure told me: \"Not only is there a boys' club, but the most important thing is that there are all these cliques and all these factions that just don't talk to each other - people get together and talk to people only in their bubble.\"That is what has led to so many mistakes, many of Starmer's internal critics say.ReutersMorgan McSweeney quit as chief of staff after mounting scrutiny over his role in Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK ambassador to the USHe relied on too small a group of advisers, who came from one, more hard-edged wing of the Labour Party, favoured by Morgan McSweeney, and stuck his fingers in his ears to a wider range of views – it was about one faction dominating, not the deliberate exclusion of females.One Whitehall insider who deals with Downing Street said: \"It means you're not getting the best people if you exclude anyone, for any reason. It's not woke, it's just making sure you get the best people when it comes to the government.\"There are promises the prime minister will listen to a wider range of views, more voices from different parts of the party. Some are trying, very obviously, to make sure they get more of a look in from now.At the start of the week, Ed Miliband said the prime minister had to be \"bold\" and he wanted to focus on class. On Thursday Angela Rayner said the government had to do more for the hospitality industry, and Lisa Nandy made her remarks about misogyny and the \"unforgivable\" turmoil in government.One senior Labour politician warns against any attempt to brush off women's concerns by saying it's all about warring factions, telling me: \"It's not good enough to just say it's because people oppose Keir or Morgan's agenda - that gives them an excuse to not do anything and that would be hopeless\".And after the last few weeks, there are specific calls from women in the Labour Party for an inquiry into the behaviour of the late Mohammed Al Fayed, and a woman to be given the cabinet post as first secretary of state.PA WireOthers are sceptical – suggesting plenty of MPs have tried, and been disappointed, for years to get the party leadership to look outside its own narrow group.One told me: \"We would say, 'Why don't you engage with women? Why wouldn't you engage with backbenchers?' They just looked utterly baffled  - he wouldn't engage.\"Let's see. Does Westminster have a wider problem when it comes to how women are treated?There are far too many examples of sleazy or improper behaviour, or harassment. It is still a late-night working culture where the line between what's social and what's professional can be blurred, and power swirls around along with the warm white wine.As an experienced former cabinet minister admits, \"if you are a junior female in Westminster you can still find yourself in uncomfortable situations\" - or, for that matter, a young male staffer too.But the atmosphere, and what is considered acceptable, has completely transformed in recent years.Leaving aside behaviour that is clearly improper, are there features of the way the system works that make it not, perhaps one big giant boys' club, but a place that's easier for men?PA WireLisa Nandy has been culture secretary since 2024Let's spare the blushes of the frontbencher who asked a senior female adviser to get him a cup of coffee during the milling around before cabinet. She told him to get his own. He was mortified minutes later when the prime minister of the day called on her to answer the first question during the meeting.Politics is certainly not the only business where old-fashioned assumptions are still made, women are paid less, or find it harder to progress and are sometimes overlooked.But as one former cabinet minister suggests, perhaps, \"it's not deliberate, but the culture is just so male. There are a lot of what you'd call male characteristics that are deemed to be what you need to get on: saying you have all the answers, briefing against people who aren't doing what you want\", referring specifically to a combative way of doing interviews where \"No 10 comms would be yelling at you for not pushing back, when it's just not the way women operate\".A hugely experienced female party activist suggests politics, fundamentally, is just more attractive to men, some of whom just see \"women are like blobs, the men just hang out together, and they like risk more than women do. It goes back to the days when they went off and killed tigers, and it is in our DNA to be more risk averse\".You might raise your eyebrows, but votes need to be won. That means rivals need to be beaten.One senior Labour figure describes it as \"gang warfare\", saying, \"you rely on people who have been in the trenches with you and been through battles and that means you are exclusive rather than inclusive\".\"Does that mean people you need in the room to make decisions are not there? Does that mean women? Yes, but that is life.\"ReutersAngela Rayner resigned as deputy prime minister and housing secretary after failing to pay enough tax on a flat in HoveThat remark might drive some people round the twist. Perhaps that is about as honest an admission about why things sometimes work the way they do in SW1 as you're going to get.And there is widespread agreement in Westminster that women are so often held to different standards than the men they sit alongside. That's not new.We are a long way since the first female prime minister made time to iron her husband's shirts, and be pictured doing it. But despite record representation of women, parity seems way off. Whether it's how they look, how they act, what they wear, the lens applied to women is different.A senior Labour figure accepts Angela Rayner made mistakes in her tax affairs, but suggests she's always been treated more harshly than a man would have been in her position.\"She does manoeuvre, but she is also uncompromising and lives her life, has never changed her accent. And some of the men can't cope with that.\"Another source points to how Starmer's new pick for cabinet secretary, Dame Antonia Romeo, has been briefed against and written about in acid terms in the last few days. It's like, \"How dare she be glamorous? All the bits they talk about - her ambition, in any man those would be seen as strengths. But because it's her, it's used against her\". An investigation into one formal complaint against Romeo alleging bullying concluded there was no case to answer.\"The smears being thrown against her are reprehensible and hypocritical,\" Rupert McNeil, former head of HR at the Civil Service said recently.But does the notion of the \"boys' club\" really make a difference? In a narrow way, it does right now, because dismantling the perception of it, and listening to a wider range of his colleagues is one of the tasks Starmer's been set by his own MPs.It matters profoundly that one half of the population, the narrow majority after all, is fairly represented by the politicians we choose to serve us.And it matters too when it comes to having different perspectives in the rooms where decisions are taken.It's a matter of public record, from the second most senior civil servant in the country during the pandemic, that a lack of women in the room affected the decisions taken during an emergency.Helen MacNamara, who spoke to us about the Covid inquiry on Newscast, said there'd been a lack of thought about childcare during school closures, how domestic violence victims could be trapped during lockdown, and too much attention paid to how it affected more male pursuits - hunting, shooting and fishing.Another source told me opening up car showrooms and golf courses was considered before thinking about kids' playgrounds.Before you scream, of course issues like childcare, education and domestic violence affect men, and not just women. Of course, neither men nor women all care about the same things. But one activist who has been around for many years relates: \"I'm still a woman in a man's world. I count every meeting - there are 45 men and five women. They never count, or say, 'Hang on, we need some women around to see their point of view.' They don't think about it\".The numbers aren't always so outrageously heavily skewed. There has been enormous progress in the numbers of female politicians, senior civil servants, and in other parts of public life too.But as another Whitehall insider suggests: \"The habits of Westminster were set when nearly all politicians were men, nearly all journalists were men, and nearly all civil servants were men\".And it was the decision to appoint Peter Mandelson that has prompted this bout of soul searching about women's role in government, with some convinced Starmer would simply never have got into this mess if he'd included women in the decision. One senior figure said: \"At the heart of that decision was misogyny – it required you to think that the Epstein victims were neither here nor there\".Men may no longer always be in such a majority, but perhaps old habits formed years ago, really do die hard. If Starmer really wants to change the perception, the pressure is on him to respond.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Alpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (13:15-15:15)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in Tuesday's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Before them (09:15-11:15) the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.The first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

    "body": "Rejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup winMedia caption, Sensational Scotland stun England to seal Calcutta Cup gloryByBBC Scotland's chief sports writer at MurrayfieldMen's Six NationsScotland (24) 31Tries: Jones 2, Ritchie, White Cons: Russell 4 Pen: RussellEngland (10) 20Tries: Arundell, Earl Con: Ford Pens: Ford 2Rampant Scotland bounced back from Six Nations defeat by Italy to blow England away in a bonus-point win in a pulsating Calcutta Cup at a riotous Murrayfield.Orchestrated by the brilliant Finn Russell and playing with a ruthlessness that a shell-shocked England could not contain, the Scots were a team reborn.Pelted with flak in the build-up to facing an England team looking for a 13th-straight win and and a first in Edinburgh since 2020, Gregor Townsend's previously beleaguered boys motored into a stunning 17-0 lead inside the opening quarter.A penalty from Russell and tries from Huw Jones, Jamie Ritchie and Ben White were answered only by a converted Henry Arundell try and a George Ford penalty.For Arundell, it was a hair-raising experience. England played 30 minutes with only 14 men because of the two yellow cards given to the wing in the first half. Scotland scored 14 points on the back of his first yellow - and led 24-10 at the break. Ford narrowed the gap with the boot early in the new half, but Jones added a second soon after when the England fly-half's drop-goal attempt was charged down by Matt Fagerson and the centre ran 60 metres unopposed.Scotland have an unfortunate history of going to sleep when ahead in games, but not this time. England had some moments of pressure but they were met with Scottish thunder on both sides of the ball.Ben Earl scored late on to bring the gap down to 11. Not that it bothered Murrayfield all that much.  England, for all the improvements they have made, were sent rocketing back to the drawing board.Russell Scotland's architect once againImage source, SNSImage caption, Finn Russell was instrumental for ScotlandScotland promised a big performance and they delivered an intensity, an accuracy and a ruthlessness that was totally absent in Rome.They were utterly lethal in the opening minutes, Russell sending them on their way with an early penalty that was borne out of hard and direct rugby that England could not live with.Another Scottish blast inside 10 minutes saw the first yellow for Arundell and it proved so damaging for England. While the wing was away, Scotland didn't half play and Russell in full genius mode was at the heart of it.After stretching the England defence to breaking, Russell then finished them, beating the blitz - Tom Roebuck sold himself in the midst of it - with a gorgeous one-handed flick on to Jones who sprinted around Maro Itoje to score.The fly-half made it 10-0 and the promised Scottish reaction was being visited upon England. And there was more. Part of their woes in Rome was their lack of ruthlessness. Here, they fixed the problem.In their next visit to England's 22 they nailed their chance again, getting outside the defence with a speed and a skill-set of the highest class. Sione Tuipulotu flung a long pass out to Ritchie, standing free on the left wing, and the blindside scored with aplomb.Russell made it 17-0 with just 14 minutes on the clock. Breathless and brilliant. England, heavy favourites, were getting blown away. Rugby Union Weekly podcast: Inspired Scotland regain the Calcutta CupScotland Rugby Podcast: Reaction from a jubilant MurrayfieldThey got some joy at last. Their scrum, completely dominant, was key and their big runners took them deep into Scotland's 22. The resistance held, but only for so long. Ford's lovely delayed pass sent Arundell in. Quite a half for the wing.Ford narrowed the gap to seven points soon after as England threatened to build up a head of steam. Their respite was dismantled in quick order when Scotland struck for their third score.It was wonderful Russell invention once again that sparked it, the fly-half scampering down the short side, skipping past Guy Pepper and Sam Underhill and managing to kick through in the process of falling over.Ellis Genge was in the back field and seemingly in control of the situation only to slide and let the ball fall loose. White was on to him like a shot and touched down for a smash-and-grab that sickened England. Russell added the extras - a 14-point game now.Arundell's calamity came just before the end of a pulsating half when he took Steyn out in the air. A second yellow meant a 20-minute red - England were in deep trouble.The visitors' scrum superiority brought them three more points early in a second half that began without Ritchie on one side and Underhill. Both injured. On came Fagerson and Tom Curry and away we went.England's one area of joy was the scrum and their muscle in the set-piece saw Ford narrow the gap early in the second half. These were moments when Scotland had to dig deep.England were getting on the front foot, but the Scottish defence held. More than that, they frustrated England. Going nowhere in the hosts' 22. Ford opted to take an easy three with a drop goal in front of the posts.It backfired. Fagerson was out like a bullet from a gun and charged down the kick, then scooped up the loose ball and fed Jones who galloped away with Scottish delirium ringing in his ears all the way.Russell banged over the conversion and, incredibly, the underdogs were ahead by 18 with a bonus point in the bank.England emptied their bench, brought on any amount of heavy hitters, but could only manage a late, late try for Earl, converted by Ford. Scotland's lead was 11 - and to the utter ecstasy of the home fans, it stayed that way.Media caption, Townsend on Scotland's emphatic victory over EnglandMedia caption, Scotland players 'showed up' for Townsend - BorthwickLine-upsScotland: Jordan, Steyn, Jones, Tuipulotu (capt), Dobie, Russell, White; McBeth, Turner, Z Fagerson, Brown, Cummings, Ritchie, Darge, Dempsey.Replacements: Cherry, Schoeman, Millar-Mills, Williamson, M Fagerson, Horne, Hastings, Graham.England: Steward; Roebuck, Freeman, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Heyes, Chessum, Itoje, Pepper, Underhill, Earl.Replacements: George, Rodd, Davison, Coles, Pollock, T Curry, Spencer, F Smith.Sin-bin: Arundell (8)Sent-off: Arundell (38)Referee: Nika Amashukeli (Geo)",

As always when Grant is around, drama inevitably follows him…\".Kemp confirmed he would feature in a storyline about dementia, which he said holds \"deep personal meaning\" to him due to family connections.Kemp rose to prominence playing Grant throughout the 1990s, before pursuing other acting roles and fronting a series of documentaries on gangs.  He returned to the soap for several episodes between 2005-2006, before again making a comeback in 2016 for a number of guest appearances.In a statement, a spokesperson from the show said: \"This year, Grant is called upon by his estranged son Mark to return to Walford, marking the first time the pair will be reunited since Mark learned the truth about his true parentage.\"They promised \"viewers can expect explosive drama\" but that \"full details of Grant's comeback remain under wraps\".",

    "body": "35 minutes agoA number of Sunday's papers focus on the UK saying Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from dart frog toxins. Navalny died suddenly while incarcerated in a Siberian prison in February 2024, after being an outspoken critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin for years. The Sunday People says that Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper led the probe into his death, and \"points [her] finger\" at the Kremlin. According to the Russian news agency Tass, Moscow has dismissed the finding as \"an information campaign\"The Telegraph says that the poison responsible for killing Navalny was developed from an Ecuadorian frog, which it says serves as proof that Russia possesses illegal chemical weapons. Navalny's death has been investigated by Porton Down scientists, the paper says, with biological samples smuggled from his cell to the UK shortly after his deathThe Mail on Sunday leads with a call for police to investigate Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and his role as a UK trade envoy, saying it has compiled a \"dossier of evidence\" against the former prince. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously strenuously denied any wrongdoing relating to convicted sex offender Jeffrey EpsteinThe Mirror leads on \"Wills' agony\", and features a full-page rendition of a new photograph shared by the Prince and Princess of Wales for Valentines Day.

The front page also highlights an interview with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, with the headline: \"It's been tough but I'll fight on\"The Sunday Express claims the rise in pension age later this year will \"send 115,000 elderly into poverty\". The paper says it has based its figures on the previous rise in pension threshold from 65 to 66, which saw the proportion of 65-year-old's living in poverty rise from one in 10 to one in four\"Dr Ice and the skeleton crew\" reads the headline of the Observer, referencing Matt Weston's Winter Olympics gold in the skeleton on FridayThe Star says a woman is suing TV presenter and farmer Jeremy Clarkson, claiming she tripped and fell in his pub car park - the front page reads \"Clarkson's harm\".

    "body": "3 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesObama seen on the campaign trail in November 2025Former US President Barack Obama has indirectly addressed a racist video posted on President Donald Trump's social media, telling a podcast host that the \"shame\" and \"decorum\" that once guided public officials is now lost.The offensive video included a clip depicting Obama and his wife Michelle as apes, which drew widespread criticism from Democrats and Republicans. The White House initially defended the video, calling backlash \"fake outrage\". The post was later blamed on a staff member and deleted.Obama spoke to liberal podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, who asked the first black US president about the tone of political discourse. Cohen cited Trump's post among several recent controversies. The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was included at the end of a video Trump's Truth Social account shared containing unfounded claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. The post led to outrage from politicians, including from senior members of Trump's Republican party.Senator Tim Scott - the only black Republican senator - described it as \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The clip recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys, and appears to have been taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October.Trump has told reporters that he \"didn't see\" the part of the video that showed the Obamas.\"I didn't make a mistake,\" he told reporters when asked whether he planned to apologise.The 47-minute podcast featuring Obama was released on Saturday. The episode begins with the host asking him to comment on US \"discourse\", which he says \"has devolved to a level of cruelty that we haven't seen before\".Cohen notes claims by the White House that the \"victims\" of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are \"domestic terrorists\", and adds \"just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face, on an ape's body\".Obama responds by saying: \"It's important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling.\"It is true that it gets attention. It's true that it's a distraction.\"But Obama said that while travelling around the US, he found himself meeting people who \"still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness\".\"There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television,\" he continued. \"And what is true is that there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? \"That's been lost.\"He did not mention Trump by name in his response.During the interview, Obama spoke about a range of issues. He praised protesters who have peacefully organised against immigration operations, discussed electoral redistricting and talked about his presidential library, which is due to open in Chicago next year.Watch: Trump says he 'didn't see' racist clip depicting Obamas as apes",

He was a wonderful companion, with a gentle nature, and will be sorely missed,\" the post added.The black-and-white cat, who is named after the 19th-Century Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister Viscount Palmerston, joined the diplomatic service in 2016. He moved out of the department's central London building during the Covid pandemic, before formally retiring in 2020.Announcing his retirement, a letter to Lord Simon McDonald, then the most senior civil servant at the Foreign Office, read that Palmerston had enjoyed climbing trees and patrolling the fields around his new home and wanted to spend more time \"relaxing away from the limelight\".\"I have found life away from the frontline relaxed, quieter and easier,\" the letter signed in Palmerston's name read. Palmerston's account claimed he had been \"lured out of retirement\" by \"diplomacy and a purr-fect role\" with Bermuda's governor, Andrew Murdoch, who he had been living with since his retirement - with news of his return a cause of celebration by many of the cat's 99,000 social media followers.Leading tributes to Palmerston was his former rival, Number 10's chief mouser, Larry who this weekend celebrates 15 years in post - having served under six prime ministers.\"Farewell old friend x,\" read a post by the cat's unofficial X account.The four-legged felines were rumoured to have had a long-running feud, with highly publicised spats during their overlapping time in Westminster.",

Footage it published showed officers, still in their masks, leading the two suspect away and into a waiting police car. Among the disguises was the red overalls and mask from the Spanish Netflix show Money Heist.Police said the two seen being detained in the footage had 30 criminal records between them, and that the woman pretended to be pregnant to avoid arrest.Police added that the arrests form part of Operation Tracking, a state initiative aimed at tacking the theft and resale of mobile phones, which has led to more than 13,000 devices being located and approximately 4,400 being returned.It is not the first time Latin American officers have used fancy dress while apprehending suspected criminals.Peruvian police often use the tactics, disguising their agents in elaborate costumes on occasions such as Valentine's Day, Halloween and Christmas.Raids have also been carried out dressed as the Grinch, a capybara and various other Marvel superheroes.",

    "body": "8 hours agoAdam GoldsmithandTom McArthurGetty ImagesRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin, the UK and European allies have said.Two years on from the death of Navalny at a Siberian penal colony, Britain and its allies have blamed the Kremlin following analysis of material samples found on his body.Speaking from the Munich Security Conference, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said \"only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity\" to use the poison while Navalny was imprisoned in Russia.According to Tass news agency Moscow has dismissed the finding as \"an information campaign\", but Cooper said there is no explanation for the toxin, called epibatidine, being found.While Cooper announced the findings, a joint statement was issued by the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.Cooper met with Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya at the conference this weekend.\"Russia saw Navalny as a threat,\" Cooper said at the event.\"By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition,\" she added.In the statement the allies said: \"Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.\"Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia.\"There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny's body.\"The Foreign Office said the UK has informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of Russia's alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Praising Navalny's \"huge courage\", UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"his determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy\".\"I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin's murderous intent,\" he added.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot also said his country \"pays tribute\" to Navalny, who he suggested was \"killed for his fight in favour of a free and democratic Russia\".Navalny – an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's most vociferous opposition leader - died suddenly in jail on 16 February 2024 at the age of 47.In 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.Watch: 'Only Russian state had means' to poison Navalny, says Yvette CooperBefore Saturday's announcement, Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently argued that her husband was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024.She did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results.Reacting to the announcement, Navalnaya said: \"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof.\"I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,\" she added.German Federal Foreign Office via Getty ImagesNavalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently claimed that her husband was poisoned by RussiaAccording to the state-run news agency Tass, Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: \"All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to the penal colony.According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk at his Siberian penal colony, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.Speaking to BBC Russian, toxicology expert Jill Johnson said epibatidine was \"200 times more potent than morphine\". By acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause \"muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death,\" she said.The extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in one wild frog species in tiny quantities, and only when the frog eats a specific diet, Johnson said, describing it as an \"incredibly rare way to poison a person\".She said: \"Finding the wild frog in the correct location that is eating the specific diet to create the correct alkaloids is almost impossible...almost.\"",

    "body": "Reinventing Football - what do we do with handball, penalties and VAR?Media caption, What if pundits could change one thing about football...ByDale JohnsonFootball issues correspondentImagine a world in which you could reinvent football.It's a dream, of course. Just a bit of fun. But stick with us.What if you had the power to change any of the game's laws and potentially bring to an end countless hours of discussion about handball, offside, video assistant referees, or anything else you want to?In that spirit, we asked players, pundits and even referees what football could look like if we ripped up the rulebook and started afresh.Think of it as a manifesto for reinventing the game so many of us love. Here's what we came up with...Penalties: Make the punishment fit the crimeThink here about that relatively innocuous trip as an attacker is moving away from goal - or a handball decision when there's no immediate likelihood of a goal.The result? A penalty - and a very high chance of a goal (historically, Opta says, 78%) when no such opportunity existed.Is it fair, for example, that Brentford were given such a high chance of scoring when Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk tapped the boot of Dango Ouattara right on the edge of the 18-yard area last month?Is a shot from 12 yards with only the goalkeeper to beat a just punishment? We already define an obvious goalscoring opportunity for a red card, so we'd only have to tweak this to any kind of scoring chance for a penalty. If it's a foul with no clear attacking impact, why not a free-kick?Could this incentivise defenders to bring opponents down in areas where a penalty would not be the result? Any deliberate or cynical act would still result in a spot-kick.Penalties: One and done - no more reboundsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Goals scored from rebounds on penalties have produced exhilarating, match-defining moments   Imagine when a penalty is saved or hits the woodwork and bounces back into play that the game is stopped and the ball given to the goalkeeper.Pierluigi Collina - perhaps the most famous football referee of all time, and now head of Fifa's referees' committee - is already on board.Collina argues that if the attacking team have squandered such a big chance of scoring, why should they be allowed a second or even third opportunity?In recent campaigns an average of just under three goals a season have been scored in such circumstances, so is it really that important?And would we want to risk losing some of the game's most memorable moments?Think Chloe Kelly's 119th-minute goal for England against Italy in the semi-final of Euro 2025. Or Liverpool's Xabi Alonso netting at the second attempt against AC Milan in their dramatic comeback in the second half of the 2005 Champions League final. Or Harry Kane's winning goal for England against Denmark at Euro 2020.If this adaptation was made, the look of the pitch could change, too - because the 'D' at the edge of the penalty area to keep players 10 yards away from the ball at a spot-kick would no longer be needed.VAR: Bring in a challenge systemImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Football Video Support - a Fifa-trialled challenge system - gives each team two chances to request a review of a referee's decisionWill VAR ever be accepted? Perhaps not in its current form, so how about adapting it to a challenge system? You might not have heard of Fifa's Football Video Support (FVS), which is being trialled in several leagues including Liga F - the top flight of the women's game in Spain.Under FVS, a coach is given two challenges per game. When they are activated, the on-field referee goes to the monitor to watch the incident back and make a decision. There isn't a VAR poring over the footage, just a replay operator to show the incident to the referee.Everton and England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford likes the theory.\"With VAR involved, I'd do it like cricket,\" Pickford said. \"They've got two decisions and the captain has got to make sure they review at the right time, in so many seconds. I think that would keep the speed of the game up, and keep it flowing.\"Sound good? It has its merits. The assumption is there will be better final outcomes, though trials have shown that's not always the case, and mistakes are still made by a referee at the screen.Match of the Day presenter Gabby Logan thinks there's a different way of doing it.\"It's to have a time limit on VAR,\" she said. \"We all agree now it's here to stay, and it often does good things, but the time it can take is tiresome. It stops the game. People get angry with it.\"If it was 90 seconds only, I think we'd sort a lot of that out because if it's not clear and obvious in 90 seconds, it's not clear and obvious.\"But for former England defender Stephen Warnock, the solution is simpler - get rid of VAR.\"I'm fed up of players not celebrating goals, the fans not knowing what's going on in the stadium, and there's far too many inconsistencies with it and it's down to human error which is still a massive problem,\" he said.Reinventing FootballTuesday 11 November from 21:30 GMTVAR offsides: Lose the microscopic techImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, In Major League Soccer, offside decisions are made with the naked eye. In the Premier League, fans are shown an image which is often unclearThe concept of offside is very different from its first iteration in 1863 when - a little bit like rugby - you were offside if you were in front of the ball.Three years after its introduction, the law changed to consider the position of the defenders closest to their own goal, and it hasn't altered much since. But the initial idea surely wasn't that players should be penalised for having a toe in front of the 'offside line'? After all, you only had the judgement of the assistant.We're told VAR tech is uber-reliable, but we're in the hands of AI and a VAR who has to manually confirm a frame that might not be the exact point the ball has been played anyway. And how confusing can those animations be?So, how about ditching the microscopic tech, and just relying on a TV picture with no lines or funky graphics and an official's eye?That's how it's done in Major League Soccer - largely because of problems with wildly differing stadium configurations.The VAR looks at the images and decides if it's possible the assistant has got the decision wrong. If so, the referee is sent to the monitor to look. In other words, MLS judges offside at the clear and obvious threshold and not to millimetres.Would TV companies still draw their own lines? Probably, which would undoutedly mean the controversy around offside decisions would not dissipate.Premier League referee Anthony Taylor had a more radical suggestion.\"One of the best tournaments I refereed in was a prison officer tournament and we had no offside... and we had so many goals it was unbelievable,\" he said. \"So maybe scrapping offside might be the answer.\"Handball: Make it like it used to beIf you asked a football fan to define handball a decade ago, you'd get a simple answer, like: \"Ball to hand isn't a penalty.\"Put that question to them today, and they probably wouldn't know where to start.Former England captain Alan Shearer pointed to some of the phraseology that has come into the football lexicon around handball as he called for change.\"Proximity... obvious position... not in an obvious position... natural,\" he said. \"For me, it's pretty simple - is it deliberate handball or not?\"Some of the confusion has come from a big rewrite of the lawbook in 2019, when the considerations for handball went from just three lines to an entire page. Referees were served with a whole menu of reasons to give handball.The aim was to give a \"clearer and more consistent definition and interpretation\". What it brought was consistently more penalties, because there were many more reasons to give one.The micro-definition of handball has left people guessing, so how about getting back to basics? Let the referee make handball decisions how they used to - on instinct.Stop the clock when the ball goes outThis idea has been kicking around for many years, with the intention that if the watch is stopped, teams can't waste time.The plan could be for each half to last 30 minutes, with the clock halted when the ball isn't in play. That guarantees 60 minutes of effective playing time, and means much of the incentive to take vital seconds out of the match is removed.Fans would actually gain rather than lose out, too, with the average ball-in-play time this season 55 minutes 05 seconds - 114 seconds down from last season.It's not a magic bullet, because teams who are looking to see out a lead - or hold on to a draw - could still go slowly to break up the momentum of the opposition.And if the clock is going to stop, how long will it take to play 60 minutes? There's no clear footprint for the match. The average 60-minute NFL game takes more than three hours to complete.Introduce tactical timeoutsFor this, we turn to former Wales captain Ashley Williams.\"I would give each team at least one timeout per half, and you can use that whenever you want,\" he said.\"It might be before a corner, before a free-kick, if someone's injured. If the manager needs to get hold of their team and change something, I'd let them have a timeout like they do in other sports.\"The modern trend seems to be for teams to secure themselves an 'unofficial' tactical timeout by telling a goalkeeper to go down injured, though we should point out - for the avoidance of doubt - that sometimes goalkeeper injuries are genuine!As the physio runs on, all of the outfield players head over to the technical area for a team talk. When the manager has passed on his key messages, the goalkeeper is often fine to play on.This little interlude can change the direction of a game, and adversely impact the opposition. While they have the chance to speak to their manager too, it often is the case that they don't need to change anything, so any team talk has less impact.Would an allocated tactical timeout stop this? In some cases, but not all.So how about banning players from going over to the touchline as a group? Or if a goalkeeper needs attention from a physio, their team has to nominate an outfield player to go off for 30 seconds instead?Bring in bonus points - and punish 0-0 drawsArsene Wenger, when he was manager of Arsenal, often spoke about giving teams extra points to award attacking play.It never caught on widely, though he did get his way in the pre-season Emirates Cup in the summer of 2009. There, clubs were awarded three points for a win plus an extra point for every goal scored.Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha is thinking along the same lines.  \"I like the idea of a bonus point for every time you score two goals,\" he said. \"Instead of just getting three points, you score two goals and that's four points. You score four goals, that's five points. \"From an attacking perspective, you can really start to climb the ladder. You'll see more goals in the league, which means fans would be more entertained.\"There's another option.Former Barcelona and Manchester United defender Gerard Pique flipped the logic earlier this year by suggesting teams should get zero points if a match ends 0-0.Pique believes boring games would explode into life for the final 20 minutes because a 0-0 draw would give teams as many points as a 1-0 defeat.The counterpoint is there could times it would be more advantageous to take the same points as the opposition - even if that's zero - rather take a risk and be three worse off.Let players take quick free-kicks to themselvesConsider these two scenarios:  a player is breaking forward and is brought down by a tactical foul, or a goalkeeper comes out of his area and boots the ball into the crowd.Play often can't restart instantly, because a team needs to set up. But what if a player could take a free-kick, throw-in or corner to themselves and run with the ball?It might seem a little out there, but it would make the game faster and might even bring more goals.Former England midfielder Danny Murphy said: \"It's your advantage, you've got the ball, so why do you have to pass it to somebody else so you can get the game going quickly?\"Murphy also had a more radical suggestion, saying if anyone is caught cheating or diving, the other team should be awarded an automatic penalty.Make the goals biggerImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, At 6ft 9in, Kjell Scherpen set a record as the tallest goalkeeper to play in the Premier League when he was at Brighton  In 1996, former Fifa president Sepp Blatter wanted to increase the size of football goals by 50cm in width and 25cm in height, but didn't have enough support.Is it time to look again?The size of the goals - 24ft wide and 8ft high – hasn't changed in 150 years.But the average height of people has increased in that time, which would suggest goalkeepers are now at an advantage.There are two sides to this, though.In 1875, footballs were made of hand-stitched leather, often weighed down by the rain. Today they are lightweight and made of synthetic leather and designed to aid movement through the air.Goalkeepers would argue that any advantage they have is only matched by the evolution of the ball and the athleticism of outfield players. Do attackers really need more goal to aim at?",

    "body": "4 hours agoEmily HoltBBC NewsGetty ImagesNow the clocks have gone back and the evenings are darker, many of us are trudging to work and back in the dark and sometimes our mood is lower as well.We can feel more tired than normal, lack energy or find it difficult to concentrate. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), or \"winter depression\" can affect anyone. For those struggling to stick to their normal daily activites, the NHS advises contacting their local GP. For those with milder symptoms, here are three ways to help you manage the darker days and even embrace them.1. Focus on what you can do Getty ImagesPsychologist Kari Leibowitz says growing up in the US in a summer-centric town meant she used to view winter as limiting and uncomfortable, but travelling to Norway where some places get almost no daylight in the depths of winter changed her mindset.She found that instead of people succumbing to a darker mood, they embraced their circumstances, finding different hobbies from snow sports to knitting and cooking. \"They're looking at winter as a time of year that's full of opportunities,\" she says. Kari said it taught her that changing your approach to focus on what you can do during this time, rather than what you can't, was surprisingly effective.This could include winter walks, movie nights, cooking a new meal or ice skating.\"So often we only focus on the things that are harder to do in the winter when really there's a whole world of seasonal activities that feel better when it's cold out.\" 2. Accept you need more restGetty ImagesWith our work and social calendars ticking along as normal, we may wonder why we feel so tired but Kari says we need to accept our bodies need more rest in winter.\"It's actually good not to be as productive or active as you would be during the summer months because our bodies are biologically hardwired for rest during winter,\" she says. Just like animals and plants, she says we should be slowing down and changing our behaviour.Dr Em May Armstrong, a plant researcher, says the key is finding the balance between resting more and becoming too lethargic. She suggests so called \"active dormancy\" - mixing a slower restful lifestyle with activities that still keep us mentally engaged. This could include activities such as knitting, repairing clothes or practices that help get you ready for the year ahead. \"And while that's not as active as, say, travelling or camping, it's just as active in a more restorative way.\"3. Make plansGetty ImagesWhile resting more is natural, it is still important to make time for the things that make us happy and to mix with other people, according to GP Gavin Francis.\"We're very social animals, even the most solitary human being doesn't live completely alone. We all depend on others.\"He suggests planning activities in advance, focusing on spending time with those who make you feel good, and activities which can boost your mood.Doing this means you're committed, and a low mood nearer the time won't be able to stop you.\"You can then start planning in your diary to do more things with these people over winter,\" he says. Simple practical things to improve your mood, such as making sure you get a good night's sleep, avoiding too much alcohol or late night parties and maintaining a healthy diet are also important, he says.\"These things are not rocket science, but they're really fundamental to having a good, healthy circadian rhythm and a good healthy physiology through the winter.\"  Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "Australian scientists have discovered a new native bee species with tiny horns - and given it a suitably devilish name. Researchers found the Megachile Lucifer while observing a rare wildflower that only grows in the Bremer Ranges in Western Australia's Goldfields region, 470km (292mi) east of Perth.The \"highly distinctive, prominent horns\" are only on the female bee and may be used as a defence mechanism, to gather pollen or nectar, or to collect materials such as resin for nests.The study's lead scientist said she was inspired to use the name Lucifer as she was watching the Netflix show of the same name at the time. She adds that it is the first new member of this bee group in 20 years. \"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" said Dr Kit Prendergast from Curtin University .\"When writing up the new species description I was watching the Netflix show Lucifer at the time, and the name just fit perfectly. I am also a huge fan of the Netflix character Lucifer so it was a no-brainer.\"Lucifer - which means \"light bringer\" in Latin - is also a reference to shining light on the need for better conservation of native bee species and greater understanding of how endangered plants are pollinated, she said. The report, which was published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, also called for the area in and around where the new bee species and rare wildflowers were found to be \"formally protected and gazetted as conservation land that cannot be cleared\".\"Because the new species was found in the same small area as the endangered wildflower, both could be at risk from habitat disturbance and other threatening processes like climate change,\" she said, adding that many mining companies do not include native bees when assessing the environmental impact of their operations.\"So we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems.\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realise they're there.\"",

    "body": "13 minutes agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterThe rate of UK unemployment has risen to 5% in the three months to September, showing signs the jobs market has weakened, according to new official figures. It is the highest rate since the period covering December 2020 to February 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The increase in the unemployment rate was higher than expected, coming in above the 4.9% projected by many analysts ahead of the Budget on 26 November.  Average wage growth was 4.6% in the third quarter, down from 4.7% over the three months to August.Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics for the ONS, said: \"Taken together, these figures point to a weakening labour market. \"Meanwhile the unemployment rate is up in the latest quarter to a post pandemic high. The number of job vacancies, however, remains broadly unchanged.\"In the three months to September 2025, the number of payrolled employees also fell by 109,000 (0.4%) over a year.The ONS data also shows nearly 1.7m people are claiming unemployment benefits, a slight decrease on the figure from a year ago.Responding to the latest statistics, Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said: \"Over 329,000 more people have moved into work this year already, but today's figures are exactly why we're stepping up our plan to get Britain working.\"Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, said with the Budget two weeks away \"many businesses will have shelved any major hiring plans\".\"Having already faced a significant rise in national insurance costs earlier in the year, they will likely be nervous to make any real commitments until they know whether further costs are heading their way,\" he said. Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the increase in unemployment and drop in the number of people on payroll shows the government's \"complacent attitude to jobs and businesses\".She said small businesses had been stopped from employing staff by \"ever increasing regulation, litigation and tax\", and called for Rachel Reeves to \"take action that backs jobs and growth\".Broadly, the number of job vacancies have remained unchanged, with about 723,000 between August and October 2025.The ONS has said the unemployment rate should be treated with caution and it is taking additional steps to address concerns about the quality of the data.",

    "body": "11 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media EditorI don't like the word unprecedented. But I've used it twice in less than 24 hours.The first time was on Sunday night, after the resignations of Tim Davie and Deborah Turness. That, in fact, might have involved a bit of overreach.After all, this has happened before at the BBC. Back in 2004, two senior figures departed - admittedly not on the same day, but on subsequent days.The then BBC chairman, Gavyn Davies, and the director general, Greg Dyke, resigned in light of the Hutton report. That was the inquiry into the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly which found that the BBC's reporting on the Iraq \"sexed-up dossier\" was flawed.But my use of unprecedented on Monday feels entirely appropriate.A US president threatening to sue the BBC for $1bn is completely new territory for the corporation.We've seen a succession of US media operations previously cave in as Donald Trump launched lawsuits. Paramount Global paid him $16m to settle a dispute over an interview broadcast on CBS with former vice-president Kamala Harris. ABC News paid him $15m to settle a defamation lawsuit after its anchor falsely claimed he had been found \"liable for rape\".Now the president has the BBC in his sights. He wants a full retraction of the Panorama documentary, an apology for the \"false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading and inflammatory statements\" made about him in it, and appropriate compensation \"for the harm caused\".If he doesn't get them by Friday, he's put the BBC \"on notice\" that he will be looking for damages of \"no less than $1,000,000,000\".Whether you are a supporter or a detractor of the BBC, I think everyone would agree these are incredibly testing times for the corporation.Events have developed rapidly over a week.First we got the series of claims about the Panorama documentary and also wider systemic bias first made in the Telegraph.Six days later came the resignations of director general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness.Quickly some were voicing concerns about a politically orchestrated campaign against the BBC from the right. Others said this was all about accountability in the face of gross failures.Now the BBC faces a potentially very costly legal battle with Donald Trump.It should be basking in the success of Celebrity Traitors with the programme's hugely popular finale broadcast just last Thursday. Instead the BBC is plunged into a crisis some would argue of its own making.It's taken until Monday to apologise for the Panorama edit and to push back on the notion that the corporation suffers from institutional bias.The interview I did with BBC chair Samir Shah should have been done much earlier - with the DG or Deborah Turness last week, as the headlines ramped up.The apology should have come then. Now the BBC is on the back foot.It will take robust leadership to steer a course through. But two of the leaders most likely to have been able to steady the ship are now on the way out.",

    "body": "'Trump's $1bn BBC threat' and 'You will pay the price' warning for Reeves3 hours agoDonald's Trump's threat to sue the BBC over the editing of his speech in a documentary dominates Tuesday's papers. The Daily Telegraph reports that the US president is demanding an apology, retraction and payout by Friday if the broadcaster wants to avoid legal action. Trump's threat comes as BBC chairman Samir Shah apologised for the editing of the Panorama documentary and acknowledged that an \"error of judgement\" had been made. However, Shah denied the BBC \"sought to bury\" issues raised in an internal memo regarding editorial decisions.\"Trump's $1bn battle with 'corrupt' BBC\" is the Metro's take. The paper quotes the US president's letter to the BBC, accusing the broadcaster of making \"false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading, and inflammatory statements\" about him. In her statement, outgoing head of news Deborah Turness acknowledged that \"mistakes have been made\" but insisted the corporation was not \"institutionally biased\".The Sun splashes its front page with \"Beeb's billion dollar bungle\", quoting Trump's legal letter which said he suffered \"overwhelming harm\" due to the editing of the Panorama documentary. BBC chair Samir Shah has insisted it was \"simply not true\" the organisation has done nothing to tackle problems that were raised.\"Trump does a Dr Evil\" declares the Daily Star, alongside a photoshopped image of Trump in a Dr Evil pose from the Austin Powers film series.\"Future of the BBC licence fee in jeopardy\" says the i Paper, as it reports that Labour  is considering \"a range of options\" to replace the broadcaster's licence fee. The paper also features quotes from news executives still reeling from the resignation of director general Tim Davie, who say \"the mood is dark. We need leadership\".A photo of BBC's outgoing head of news Deborah Turness is front and centre on the Independent. The paper features Turness' comments to reporters outside Broadcasting House after her resignation, saying: \"The buck stops with me.\"Turness is also pictured on the front page of the Daily Mail, as the paper predicts that \"BBC suits\" might regret turning on \"Hurricane Deborah\".  In its main story, the Mail says lawyers for Trump have put the BBC \"on notice\" - a situation that prompts the headline \"Grovel - or I'll sue you for $1bn\".The Financial Times describes the current crisis at the BBC as a \"fight for the broadcaster's soul\". The paper reports that Downing Street has defended the broadcaster by expressing its \"huge support for a strong and independent BBC\".While other front pages focus on Trump and the BBC's two big departures, the Guardian moves its focus on to a third key BBC figure under pressure. The paper says board member Robbie Gibb, who was appointed to his BBC role by Boris Johnson and previously worked for Theresa May as her communications chief, \"led the charge\" in pressuring the broadcaster's leadership over allegations of systemic bias. The front page references an article inside the paper by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey,  in which he labels Gibb a Conservative crony and urges his removal from the board.\"BBC is told: say sorry or Trump will sue for $1bn\" is the headline leading The Times. But also on the front page, the paper says Chancellor Rachel Reeves has given her \"clearest indication\" that she is prepared to break Labour's manifesto by raising income tax. Reeves says she \"of course\" would like to stick to the pledge, but doing so would require cuts to spending that would damage productivity, the Times reports.The Daily Express follows with a warning to the chancellor from campaigners, who urge her to spare pensioners from \"vindictive\" tax rises. Alongside, the paper teases a \"Wicked reunion\" with a photo of Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande at the film's London premiere.Finally, the Daily Mirror features Prince William opening up on the challenges of dealing with wife Catherine's cancer battle. The paper quotes the prince, saying: \"Hiding stuff doesn't work. We chose to communicate a lot more.\"President Donald Trump's threat of legal action against the BBC features on most of the front pages, including the Sun which describes Panorama's edit of his speech as the \"Beeb's Billion Dollar Bungle\".\"Trump Tells BBC: Grovel - Or I'll Sue\", says the Daily Mail's headline.The Daily Telegraph says the \"extraordinary\" move by the US president has \"turned the screw\" on a corporation that's \"reeling\" from the resignations of the director general and the head of news.While the i Paper says the future of the licence fee is now in jeopardy, with the BBC \"left weakened\" ahead of negotiations with the government.The Guardian claims a BBC board member with links to the Conservatives \"led the charge\" in pressuring the corporation's leadership over claims of systemic bias, before Tim Davie and Deborah Turness announced they were stepping down.Sources have told the paper that Theresa May's former director of communications, Sir Robbie Gibb, \"amplified the criticism\" in key meetings.  Writing in the Guardian, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says Sir Robbie should be removed from the BBC board before the search begins for a new director general.Comments to the BBC by the chancellor - signalling she could scrap the two-child benefit cap - are highlighted by the Times. It says Rachel Reeves appeared confident of funding the move - thought to cost more than £3bn - despite Treasury concerns that levies on gambling will not be enough.The Guardian says Reeves is hoping that removing the cap will placate many Labour MPs who are concerned about the political consequences of raising income tax.The main news for the Daily Mirror is a new interview by the Prince of Wales - given to a TV channel in Brazil - in which the heir to the throne revealed that he and the Princess of Wales were honest with their children about her cancer diagnosis. \"Hiding stuff doesn't work. We chose to communicate a lot more\", he says.  The paper's leader column applauds the \"openness\" of the royal couple, noting honesty is the \"best policy\", allowing love, patience and clarity to steady even the stormiest seas.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Ariana Grande: Going brunette is not about saying goodbye to Glinda10 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporter, Leicester Square, LondonPress AssociationAriana Grande has said her new darker hair is not about saying goodbye to her Wicked character Glinda, but rather a way of “doing something different”.The singer and actress, 32, has recently swapped her signature, Glinda-era blonde locks with a brunette tone, sending fans wild on social media.It comes as she resumes her role as the Good Witch of the North alongside Cynthia Erivo, who returns as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, in Wicked: For Good.On Monday night, London’s Leicester Square was transformed into the magical Land of Oz, with Wicked-inspired shades of pink and green and a sprawling yellow brick road running through the middle.Fans came dressed in witches' hats and green makeup, while others channelled their inner Glinda in sparkly floor length gowns.Speaking to BBC News, Erivo, who was recently nominated for two Grammys, said it felt “overwhelming” to be closing the Wicked chapter.“It feels beautiful though,” said Grande. “This project will always be part of our lives.”The sequel will see Grande and Erivo joined once again by co-stars Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Bailey and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard.Bridgerton star Bailey, 37, who reprises his role of Prince Fiyero, has recently made history by becoming People's first-ever openly gay \"Sexiest Man Alive\".When asked by BBC News who his sexiest man of the year is, he didn’t skip a beat.“Jon M Chu,” he said, naming Wicked’s film director. “Because his genius, and his compassion, knows no end.”He then laughed, adding: “And because he cast me in this film, so that is entirely sexy.”PA MediaJonathan Bailey reprises his role of Prince Fiyero in the new filmThe sequel has a romantic plotline, which could lead some to wonder whether Bailey was channelling his inner Anthony (his Bridgerton character).“I’m sure I’m mining something that’s in my bones somewhere,” he says.As a sidebar, I also had to ask him whether would ever do Celebrity Traitors.“The answer is, we’ll have to find out,” he said, pausing dramatically before laughing. “I feel like I’m already exposing my game play.”When Grande unveiled her new look on Instagram recently, many fans speculated that it was a way for her to bid farewell to her Good Witch character.But when asked about that, she said: “No, I think it was just a way of doing something different for the second movie, and playing into the darker tones, with clothing and beauty.“It’s fun,” she said, while Erivo smiled and nodded.The sequel picks up where the first film left off and covers the years after Elphaba and Glinda's decision to part ways.Elphaba is now an enemy of the state of Oz, while Glinda has become a public figure controlled by the Wizard.The films have been adapted from the hugely successful Broadway and West End musical, which itself was based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel.However, the stage musical was split into two films for its big-screen adaptation.They were shot simultaneously between December 2022 and January 2024, with production interrupted mid-way through by the Hollywood actors' strike.PA MediaThe sequel will see co-star Michelle Yeoh join Grande and ErivoWicked was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations - winning two for best costume and production design.At two hours 40 minutes, the first film alone was almost as long as the entire length of the stage show.But the second film is slightly shorter, at 2 hours and 18 minutes.Erivo and Grande's chemistry and real-life friendship prompted several viral interview moments during the first film's promotional run last year, and the pair jointly opened the Academy Awards in March with a Wicked medley.One challenge facing the sequel is that most of the best known songs from the musical, such as Defying Gravity, Popular and The Wizard And I, featured in the first film.But the forthcoming follow-up will feature two brand new songs, with Chu telling BBC News that the first time Grande and Erivo heard them, “they just cried”.“It means a lot to now, however many years later, we’re here and people get to see it on the big screen. I’m so excited.”Wicked For Good is in cinemas on 21 November.",

    "body": "3 hours agoEd Thomas,UK editor, Rebecca Wearn and Patrick ClahaneNational Crime AgencyMillions of illegal vapes and tobacco were seized in the month-long crackdown Targeted raids on High Street premises such as mini-marts, vape shops, barbers and takeaways have seen more than 920 people arrested, in the largest action of its kind coordinated by the National Crime Agency (NCA).More than 340 notices for illegal working and renting were issued by authorities, which could see businesses and landlords fined tens of thousands of pounds.Last week the BBC exposed Kurdish crime fixers who claimed to be able to make £60,000 illegal working fines disappear. The BBC's reporting also uncovered a Kurdish criminal network using \"ghost directors\" to represent companies' official paperwork while remaining uninvolved in day-to-day operations.Undercover journalists posing as asylum seekers were told how easy it was to take over a shop and make thousands of pounds a week from illegal tobacco.The Home Office said it would investigate the BBC's findings.The NCA led the month-long crackdown – which saw 2,734 High Street premises visited and over £10.7m criminal proceeds seized, including millions of illegal tobacco and vapes, over half a million pounds in cash and 70kg of cannabis.The illicit tobacco alone equates to more than £3.5m worth of duty evaded, the NCA estimates.Over 450 registered businesses have been referred to Companies House for further investigation.\"Thousands of officers have been deployed up and down our country, targeting criminal profits and the means of generating them,\" Rachael Herbert, director of the national economic crime centre at the NCA, said.\"Hundreds of thousands of harmful and illegal products have been taken off our streets, and over £10m in cash, frozen in bank accounts and criminal assets seized.\"National Crime AgencyIllegal vapes and tobacco were among contraband seized in a mart in PortsmouthThe NCA estimates that at least £12bn of criminal cash is generated in the UK each year, which is typically smuggled out of the country or siphoned through financial systems to be reinvested in criminal enterprise.Senior politicians have warned that a UK-wide criminal network uncovered by the BBC is acting as a pull factor for illegal migration to the UK.The BBC also understands that 25 Labour MPs have joined a campaign to \"shut down dodgy shops\" following concerns in their constituencies.The group, led by Melanie Onn, MP for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, is calling for new legislative powers and tougher penalties for offenders.PAOperation Machinize was launched by the NCA responding to reports of money launderingHome Office security minister Dan Jarvis said: \"Criminals are using these dodgy shops as fronts for serious organised crime, money laundering and illegal working, risking the future of the British High Street.\"We have intensified our joint efforts with law enforcement to dismantle criminal networks and relentlessly pursue those who use dirty money for personal gain.\"October was the second month-long intensification of High Street visits since March this year, under the NCA's Operation Machinize.The joint action saw every police force in the UK work with partners including Trading Standards, HM Revenue & Customs and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CSTI), which represents officers working in councils across the UK, told the BBC: \"The threat of serious and organised crime on our High Streets was identified as the number one threat facing our members.\"CSTI would like officers' resources and powers to close businesses strengthened as a result.",

    "body": "Booker Prize won by 'extraordinary' Flesh by David Szalay9 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterPA MediaDavid Szalay has won the Booker Prize for his sixth novel, Flesh British-Hungarian author David Szalay has won this year's Booker Prize for his novel Flesh, which the judges described as \"extraordinary\" and \"a very special book\".Flesh tells the story of an alluring, enigmatic and emotionally detached man who is swept through different phases of his life, from a Hungarian housing estate to the world of the ultra-rich in London.\"What we particularly liked about Flesh was its singularity. It's just not like any other book,\" said author Roddy Doyle, who chaired the judging panel. \"It's a dark book, but we all found it a joy to read.\"Actress Sarah Jessica Parker was among the other Booker judges, while Flesh has been championed by Dua Lipa and Stormzy.Getty ImagesDua Lipa interviewed David Szalay at New York Public Library in SeptemberSzalay told the BBC he was feeling a \"bit dazed\" after winning the prize and it was going to take a while to \"sink in\". \"I did maybe too thorough a job of convincing myself that I wasn't going to win in order to get through the evening without too much stress, and now I have to catch up a bit in my head,\" he said. \"But it's fantastic, of course.\" Stormzy recorded an extract of the book for a short film that was played at the Booker Prize ceremony in London on Monday.And Dua Lipa described it as a \"tense and gripping read\" when she picked it for her book club last month.Flesh has had rave reviews across the board.The Guardian called it a \"brilliantly spare portrait of a man\" and a \"thrilling exploration of what it means to be alive\", while the Sunday Times praised how Szalay uses \"just one character, Istvan, to tell these three stages of modern man\".Blank pagesCritics and judges have also praised Szalay's pared-down, minimalist dialogue and descriptions.\"We loved the spareness of the writing,\" Doyle explained. \"We loved how so much is revealed without us being overly aware of it being revealed. \"It's just extraordinary how he uses white space. Grief is depicted by a few blank pages.\"Referring to the writing style, Doyle added: \"I found it riveting, and I thought the dialogue was superb - and the absence of it was superb.\"Booker organisers described Flesh as \"a meditation on class, power, intimacy, migration and masculinity\", and called it \"a compelling portrait of one man, and the formative experiences that can reverberate across a lifetime\".'Honest and heartbreaking'The judges spent more than five hours discussing the six shortlisted novels before settling on the winner. Doyle said it became \"very clear that this was the book that all five of us liked most\".\"They found it spare, disciplined, urgent, honest and heartbreaking,\" said Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation.\"With Flesh, they all agreed, David Szalay breaks new ground. I share the judges' excitement over the work of an author who has been writing with ferocious and stark commitment for many years.\"Flesh is Szalay's sixth novel, and he was previously nominated for the Booker for All That Man Is, another exploration of modern masculinity, in 2016.He collected £50,000 as this year's winner.The other shortlisted novels were:Yuki Sugiura/Booker Prize FoundationSusan Choi - FlashlightKiran Desai - The Loneliness of Sonia and SunnyKatie Kitamura - AuditionBen Markovits - The Rest of Our LivesAndrew Miller - The Land in WinterThe Booker Prize is the UK's most prestigious fiction award and is open to novels written in the English language.Past winners include Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Bernardine Evaristo, Hilary Mantel and Douglas Stuart.",

    "body": "8 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesSmith said he immediately agreed to star in The Death of Bunny Munro after meeting Nick CaveWhen Nick Cave first saw Matt Smith playing Bunny Munro - the sex-obsessed door-to-door salesman from his 2009 novel The Death of Bunny Munro - he was taken aback.\"In the book, Bunny's not good at what he does - he wants to sleep with everyone he can and he's an unsuccessful lothario who women treat like a joke,\" Cave explains.\"Whereas Matt is hot and that adds a complexity that the original Bunny didn't have because when Matt's Bunny hits on women, they kind of like it and he draws them in.\"The Australian musician's darkly comic tale of sex, guilt and grief has been reimagined as a TV series with Doctor Who and The Crown star Smith taking on the titular role of a man spiralling after his wife's suicide.Having kidnapped his son, Bunny sets off on a chaotic road trip, clinging to his job and desires as everything else falls apart around him.Smith says that he signed up to play Bunny immediately after he first met Cave - and thought the role was \"an amazing opportunity and challenge to play a man pushed to the edge by grief, sex and life\".For Cave, the project revisits one of his morally complex characters and the 68-year-old stands by the fact that Bunny isn't wholly a bad person.\"When I look at Bunny, I don't see an aberration,\" he says. \"He's a flawed human being struggling with grief, his own legacy and all the things that make us human.\"Sky UKMatt Smith as Bunny MunroSmith agrees and his version of Bunny is more beguiling and dangerous, and his appeal makes his downfall harder to dismiss.\"He's selfish and difficult, but also funny, mad and kind of charismatic,\" he explains. \"He's human and I saw the good in him, thought he was quite funny and became quite attached to him.\"It's that tension of Bunny being both repellent and relatable that gives the story its emotional punch. Smith says that beneath the chaos, it's \"a really touching story about a father and son\". Cave nods in agreement, adding that the tale of Bunny makes him want to hug his kids. \"It's a reminder of the vulnerability of our children and of the need to hold them while there's still time.\"Set in 2003 in Brighton, the adaptation turns Cave's novel into a period piece that feels close enough to the present day but distant enough to reflect how the world, and its tolerance for men like Bunny, has changed.But both men resist saying that the show makes a statement about masculinity.\"That's for other people to decide,\" Smith says. \"But for me, it's really a story about the sins of the father and about Bunny Junior breaking that cycle.\"Cave calls it a story about inheritance - what we carry from our parents and what we choose to leave behind. \"Little Bunny needs to get away from his father as he's chaotic and a threat to his safety but Bunny is essentially good and we wouldn't want his son to escape those parts of him.\" Sky UKBunny takes his son on a chaotic road trip after his wife takes her own lifeThe singer also suggests it's much deeper than an exploration of masculinity as it reflects \"how we deal with our own nature and humanity.\"That sense of humanity has always been at the core of Cave's work and his music with The Bad Seeds is \"essentially autobiographical\".In 2015, Cave's son Arthur died after falling from a cliff in Brighton and in 2022 his eldest son, Jethro, died at the age of 30.The singer has previously written about the \"vastness\" of his grief and about how the death of his sons changed him. He also moved to Los Angeles because \"Brighton had just become too sad\" but he later returned after he \"realised that, regardless of where we lived, we just took our sadness with us\".\"If you listen to my songs and the words, they paint a very clear picture of what I'm like and what I've gone through,\" he tells the BBC. \"Even the despicable characters, they're not removed from me, they are just part of a complex character.\"In contrast, Cave explains that Bunny Munro isn't autobiographical but there is some overlap between his life and that of his creation.\"I wasn't writing about someone I didn't understand,\" he says. \"I felt extremely connected to Bunny - not that I went around trying to seduce women, though there was a bit of that, being in a band and all – but that interior masculine monologue, that first impulse towards being in the world.\"Most men, if they're honest, understand Bunny on some level.\"However, Cave says that where he differs most from Bunny is when it comes to women as he's \"much shyer around women\".His confession strips away any rock-star bravado as he admits that he's \"quite terrified of women and their power and I've just never been that comfortable around them\".The Death of Bunny Munro is on Sky Atlantic from 20 November.",

    "body": "14 hours agoAlys DaviesAFP via Getty ImagesThe Prince of Wales has described how he and the Princess of Wales approached telling their children about difficult moments they have faced over the past two years, such as Catherine and King Charles' cancer diagnoses. \"We choose to communicate a lot more with our children... most of the time, hiding stuff from them doesn't work\", Prince William said during an interview in Brazil.\"Every family has its own difficulties and its own challenges. It's very individual and sort of moment-dependent as to how you deal with those problems\", he added.The prince visited the Latin American country for the first time last week to mark the fifth Earthshot Prize, of which he is the founder and president.The prize celebrates people who have come up with ideas to help tackle issues affecting the planet. The winners of each category win £1m to further develop their ideas.Speaking to Brazilian TV host Luciano Huck in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the awards ceremony, which took place on 5 November, Prince William was asked how he and Catherine navigated the difficult things they have faced over the past two years.\"Sometimes you feel you're oversharing with the children\", said Prince William, who is father to Prince George, 12, Princess Charlotte, 10, and Prince Louis, seven. \"But most of the time, hiding stuff from them doesn't work, and so explaining how they feel, why that's happening, giving them other viewpoints as to why they might be feeling like they are sometimes helps give them a bigger picture, and they can relax more into it rather than being really anxious about 'what are you hiding from me'?\".\"There's a lot more questions when there's no answers.\"\"But it's always a balancing act\", he added, \"How much do I say? What do I say? When do I say it? There's no manual for being a parent, you've just got to go with it\".The Princess of Wales revealed she was in remission from cancer in January. King Charles continues to undergo treatment.In the interview, which covered a range of subjects, Prince William also said they do not allow their children to have phones.\"It's really hard. Our children don't have phones, I think when George moves onto secondary school then maybe he might have a phone that has limited access,\" he said.\"It's getting to the point where it's becoming a little bit of a tense issue but I think [Prince George] understands why, we communicate why we don't think it's right, and again I think it's the internet access we have a problem with. \"I think children can access too much stuff they don't need to see online,\" he said.He added that either he or Catherine do the school run most days and jokingly referred to himself as a taxi driver when conversing with Huck.Speaking about the Earthshot Prize, being held in Brazil for the first time this year, Prince William said: \"We're halfway through the ten years that we've identified as the decade of change, where if we want to leave a lasting legacy and really change the way we protect and restore and live on the planet we have to do it in this decade of change. \"So am I pleased with the progress the Earthshot has made and where the world is headed in environmental and climate leadership? Yes, I think we've made progress. Is there a lot more to do? Yes.\" Winners of this year's prize included a project to restore tropical forests and a global ocean treaty initiative.Following the trip to Rio, officials announced they would be making Prince William an honorary citizen of the city, known as a carioca.",

    "body": "13 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporter, Belém, BrazilShutterstockBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva speaks during the opening of the COP30 conferences in Belem, Brazil.The world must \"defeat\" climate denialism and fight fake news, Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has told the opening meeting of the UN climate talks. In a rallying cry to COP30, President Lula again made thinly veiled references to President Donald Trump who branded climate change \"a con job\" in September.The two weeks of talks kicked off on Monday in the lush Brazilian city of Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest.They take place against a fraught political backdrop and the US has sent no senior officials.On Monday thousands of delegates poured into the COP venue in a heavily air-conditioned former aerodrome, some coming from accommodation in shipping containers and cruise ships moored on the riverside.Members of the Guajajara indigenous group, in traditional dress, performed a welcome song and dance for assembled diplomats.Addressing the conference, President Lula said \"COP30 will be the COP of truth\" in an era of \"fake news and misrepresentation\" and \"rejection of scientific evidence\".Without naming President Trump, President Lula continued, \"they control the algorithms, sow hatred and spread fear\".\"It's time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers,\" he said.ReutersSince President Trump took office in January, he has promised to invest heavily in fossil fuels, saying that this will secure greater economic prosperity for the US.His administration has cancelled more than $13bn of funding for renewable energy and is taking steps to open up more areas of the US to oil and gas exploration.That puts the country at odds with the majority of nations still committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green energy.UNFCCThe latest UN climate talks talk place in Belém, a city of 1.5 million people in northern BrazilThis backdrop has put the COP talks in a difficult position as nations aim to make progress on tackling climate change without the participation of the world's biggest economy.Some delegates fear that the US could still decide to send officials to undermine the talks. Other environmental talks collapsed this year following US pressure, labelled \"bully-boy tactics\" by some participants.Addressing officials in Belém, UN climate chief Simon Stiell initially struck an optimistic tone. He said significant progress had been made in the last decade to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases.But then he took aim at \"squabbling\" between countries.\"Not one single nation among you can afford this, as climate disasters rip double-digits off GDP,\" he said.Brazil wants to use its presidency of the talks to secure progress on key promises made in previous years.That includes moving away from the use of planet-warming fossil fuels, finance for developing countries on the frontline of climate change, and protecting nature.President Lula's centrepiece is a fund called the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) that Brazil hopes will raise $125bn to protect tropical forests globally.Fund-raising got off to a slow start. Last week UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, at the last minute, that the UK would not contribute public money.But on Monday, UK climate envoy Rachel Kyte told BBC News that the fund was a \"brilliant idea\" and that the UK \"will make the investment at some point\".After a fight, nations finally agreed a conference agenda on Monday.It promises to consider the question of whether countries can still work towards keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.Groups on the frontline of climate change, including coalition called Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) that mostly represents Caribbean and Pacific countries, had insisted the talks address the long-held goal.In recent weeks even the UN has said it accepts that overshooting this temperature is \"inevitable\".Last week UN General Secretary General António Guterres told leaders in Belém that the failure to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C was a \"moral failure and deadly negligence\".Additional reporting by Esme Stallard",

    "body": "5 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesSam Fender won the Mercury Prize in his hometown of Newcastle last monthSam Fender has donated the entirety of his £25,000 Mercury Prize winnings to the Music Venue Trust (MVT), which works to preserve the UK's grassroots music venues.The star was presented with the cheque on 16 October as his third album People Watching was named the best record of the last 12 months.He has decided to hand the money over to the MVT, in recognition of the vital role grassroots venues played in his early career.\"I wouldn't be doing what I am doing today if it wasn't for all the gigs I played around the North East, and beyond, when I was starting out,\" said Fender. \"These venues are legendary, but they are struggling.\"Since the start of 2023, more than 150 of these venues have permanently closed their doors – about 16% of the entire UK sector.In the last year, major artists including Pulp, Coldplay, Katy Perry, Enter Shikari and Ed Sheeran have all supported the grassroots scene by adding a small levy to their ticket prices, which goes to help smaller concert halls.Fender also took part, raising more than £100,000 on his 2024 arena tour to support 38 grassroots venues across England, Scotland, and Wales.The money helped venues that were facing imminent closure due to challenges arising from floods, fires and bereavements, as well as licensing issues, legal disputes and noise complaints.Other venues received financial assistance in upgrading facilities and technical equipment that directly benefitted artists and audiences.\"The idea that money from shows in big venues supports the smaller venues, where it all starts for musicians like me, is just common sense,\" Fender has said.Getty ImagesPulp are one of the many acts who donated their Mercury Prize winnings to charityHe is not the first artist to donate his Mercury Prize winnings to worthy causes. When Pulp won the trophy in 1996 for their album Different Class, lead singer Jarvis Cocker announced that the band would donate their prize money to the charity War Child.In 2002, rapper and singer Ms Dynamite split her bounty between several good causes, including the NSPCC and a Sickle Cell charity.\"And I donated a grand to Highgate Newtown, my local community centre, to their gymnastics class, because I did gymnastics when I was younger and they needed new equipment,\" she told the Guardian in 2013.Two years ago, Ezra Collective gave their winnings to the local youth club that nurtured their band, alongside other grassroots music organisations.And 1994 winners M People donated their prize to a multiple sclerosis charity after a friend was diagnosed with the condition.\"Winning was quite enough,\" said singer Heather Small. \"The money was the cherry on top but we didn't need the cherry, because we had the cake. So our winning touched somebody else's life.\" Last week, the MVT announced it had saved two grassroots venues in south-east England, by bringing them into community ownership.The Joiners in Southampton and The Croft in Bristol were purchased under the  Own Our Venues initiative, which is supported by Arts Council England and music fans who buy \"shares\" in the properties.",

    "body": "Nearly all NHS trusts failing to hit cancer target3 hours agoChloe Hayward, Nick Triggle & Daniel WainwrightBBC NewsBBCJust three trusts out of 121 in England are treating cancer patients quickly enoughAlmost every hospital trust in England is failing to meet the key NHS waiting time target for cancer care, BBC analysis shows.Just three trusts out of 121 in England are treating cancer patients quickly enough - within 62 days - with experts warning delays could be putting lives at risk.The government accepted waits were too long, but said it was investing in the NHS to improve performance.Research shows getting treatment quickly is crucial, with every four-week delay reducing patient survival by an average of 10%.Dr Timothy Hanna, a leading global expert on cancer who led that research, said the BBC findings were \"worrying\".\"It's not a few outliers. It's the norm for trusts in England to not hit these waiting time targets and they are set for a reason - timely treatment can improve survival rates.\"Paul, who has stage three colon cancer, is one of many patients who has faced delays. His first biopsy was taken in January 2024 when cancer was suspected.He did not receive any further contact from his cancer services, despite his best efforts, until January this year. He eventually had surgery on his colon in February.“The waiting was horrendous and now I think that if I had been treated properly and not had to wait so long it wouldn't have progressed to stage three,” Paul said.He is due to have further surgery next year.Why hospitals are strugglingHospitals say demand for testing and care is outstripping capacity.The BBC has also been told about when things go wrong, including scanning and radiotherapy machines breaking down, GP referral letters being lost and staffing issues mean appointments are cancelled at the last minute.BBC Verify looked at performance across every major cancer service in England over the past 12 months – from September 2024 to August 2025.There are targets for each part of the cancer journey. Hospitals should:diagnose or rule out cancer in 75% of cases within 28 days of urgent referralbegin treatment in 96% of cases within another 31 daysensure the whole journey takes no longer than 62 days in 85% of casesNearly one in four trusts have been missing all three targets over the past 12 months.Some of the major regional cancer hubs say they are struggling with inherited waits.Larger hospitals that offer specialist services often get complex patients passed on to them from smaller hospitals.'We can't deliver care we want'One service that is struggling with inherited waits is London's Royal Free NHS Trust, which is ranked 109 out of 121 when it comes 62-day waits - although, like so many low ranking trusts, the performance is improving. It acts as a specialist kidney cancer centre for patients across south-east England. And while it has some new equipment, including robotic surgery theatres, administration problems can result in operations being cancelled. The day before the BBC filmed a report at the hospital, the theatre sat empty as a patient had not received the letter confirming surgery.Radiotherapy is another area the Royal Free wants to improve. One of its two machines is more than 10 years old - the age at which they should be retired because they become less efficient and less reliable.Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, says old equipment is an issue.Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, said: \"We can't deliver the service we want to and it can cause delays to patient treatment.\"We need a newer machine – it delivers better treatment faster so means we can treat more people per hour.\"The trust submitted a business plan to the government earlier this year for funding to buy a new machine, but was turned down.How best-performers are doing itThere are just three cancer services that are achieving the 62-day target over the past 12 months - Calderdale and Huddersfield, East and North Hertfordshire and Bolton NHS trusts.Streamlined communication, state-of-the-art equipment and joined-up team work appear to be key.Paul, who is in his 50s, was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few weeks ago at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, part of East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust.On the day he was told his diagnosis he also met with a surgeon and an oncologist to discuss his treatment options.His treatment choice was between a long course of radiotherapy or to have the prostate surgically removed.Once he had made up his mind to have an operation, it was booked in. His procedure will be done using robotic surgery. It not only reduces side effects, but also helps speed up recovery. Paul will only be in hospital for one night so the bed he uses will be free for another patient after only 24 hours.Paul has decided to have his prostate surgically removed \"He [the surgeon] got his diary out, flicked through a couple of pages and gave me a date. I said, that's a Saturday. The surgeon said, yes, I work Saturdays,\" laughs Paul.Over in the chemotherapy ward there are more steps being taken to ease capacity issues. A new initiative - one of the first in England - is allowing patients on certain types of chemotherapy to be taught how to do the treatment for themselves at home.Josephine Hoskins is one of them. She has to have chemotherapy injections every three weeks and lives between London and Devon. \"It's revolutionised things for me,\" she said.Moving patients like Josephine to 'at-home chemo' immediately opens up another slot for someone that needs more complex treatment.'Determined to improve'The government said it was determined to improve waiting times. A new cancer strategy is expected to be published by the government early next year. It comes after cancer was named as a ‘core priority’ in the 10-year NHS plan published in July.A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"Cancer care is a priority as we turn around more than a decade of neglect of our NHS.\"We're working at pace to ensure patients get timely diagnoses and treatment -  building more community diagnostic centres, offering evening and weekend appointments and spending £70 million on new radiotherapy machines to get patients faster access to the tests, checks and scans they require.\"But Sarah Scobie of the Nuffield Trust health think tank believes ministers will struggle to address the problems highlighted by the BBC analysis.\"The reality for the government is that it will be incredibly challenging to make meaningful progress on waiting times when finances are so tight.\"About the dataBBC News analysed official cancer waiting time statistics from NHS England, covering the 12 months from September 2024 to August 2025.The NHS publishes data monthly, but we have analysed the performance over the whole year.We looked at performance against the three national targets.Trusts were ranked according to their performance on the 62-day measure, which covers the entire waiting time between urgent referral and starting treatment.Additional reporting by Jess Carr and Muskeen Liddar",

    "body": "36 minutes agoReutersDamien Egan first won his parliamentary seat in a by-election in 2024A visit by a Jewish MP to a school in their constituency was cancelled, after concerns were raised by local pro-Palestine campaigners.Palestine Solidarity Bristol said it had opposed the visit by Damien Egan, the Labour MP for Bristol North East, due to his support for Israel. The cancellation took place in September but was highlighted by Communities Secretary Steve Reed during a speech to the Jewish Labour Movement at the weekend.Reed did not name Egan but told the audience: \"I have a colleague who is Jewish, who has been banned from visiting a school and refused permission to visit a school in his own constituency, in case his presence inflames the teachers.\"That is an absolute outrage... and they will be called in, and they will be held to account for doing that, because you cannot have people with those kinds of attitudes teaching our children. \"You just can't have it.\"Egan confirmed the event had been cancelled but declined to comment further. In a statement to the Times, the school said it postponed Egan's appearance because of a planned protest near the school grounds, and said it had a concern it would clash with the end of the school day. The school rearranged a date for the MP's visit and contacted police for advice.The BBC has reached out to the school for comment. On 5 September, when the event had been due to go ahead, the Palestine Solidarity Bristol group published a social media post celebrating the cancellation. It said the event had been axed after \"concerns were raised by the National Education Union trade union staff group, parents and local constituents\".It said the cancellation was \"a clear message\" that politicians who support Israel's actions in Gaza \"are not welcome in our schools\". The National Education Union has been contacted for a comment. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoNicholas Watt,Newsnight political editorandHarry SekulichBBCLord Mandelson has offered a personal apology to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein over his friendship with the convicted paedophile.The intervention by the former cabinet minister came after he faced criticism for limiting his apology over the weekend to an apology for system failures that let down the women.In a statement to BBC Newsnight on Monday evening, Lord Mandelson went further. He said: \"Yesterday, I did not want to be held responsible for his [Jeffrey Epstein's] crimes of which I was ignorant, not indifferent, because of the lies he told me and so many others.\"I was wrong to believe him following his conviction and to continue my association with him afterwards. I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.\"The UK government dismissed Lord Mandelson as its ambassador to the US last September. Downing Street said \"new information\" had emerged relating to the former ambassador's friendship with Epstein. Emails revealed Lord Mandelson had been in contact with Epstein after the American financier's first conviction in 2008, where he advised Epstein to clear his name in a string of supportive messages.Epstein's first conviction was part of a plea bargain Epstein reached in Florida. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to two charges, including soliciting girls as young as 14 for prostitution.In 2019, Epstein died in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.In his first interview since his dismissal as ambassador on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Mandelson did not apologise for maintaining his friendship with Epstein, insisting that he would have done so if he were \"in any way complicit or culpable\".During the interview, Mandelson also said he believed he was \"kept separate\" from Epstein's sex life because he is gay and denied seeing young girls at Epstein's properties.Watch: Mandelson initially declined on Sunday to apologise for Epstein emailsOne cabinet minister told BBC Newsnight that Mandelson was now \"persona non grata\". Another minister described his interview as \"horrendous and toe curling\".Lord Mandelson has now offered a personal apology after a backlash against his interview with Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday.In his statement to BBC Newsnight, Lord Mandelson said: \"I was never culpable or complicit in his crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death.\"But his victims did know what he was doing, their voices were not heard and I am sorry I was amongst those who believed him over them.\"Labour peer Baroness Kennedy told Newsnight on Monday it was \"shocking\" Lord Mandelson had not initially apologised.She said: \"I think it was shocking to many people that he didn't.\"I'm glad he's come out tonight and at least now is saying that his preoccupation was that people should understand that he did not himself know and had been persuaded.\"She added: \"Somebody like Peter Mandelson should have known better than to go on television and not to be apologising to those women who have suffered so terribly.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoThere's a mix of stories on Tuesday's front pages. The Daily Telegraph says it has seen previously redacted plans for China's mega embassy in London that show a \"hidden chamber\" to be built alongside a network of critical internet cables. The paper reports the underground complex could be a \"security risk\" as the prime minister is expected to approve the embassy later this month.The Financial Times reports on former US Federal Reserve chiefs uniting to hit back at the Department of Justice's criminal investigation into the head of the central bank, Jay Powell. The group have issued a joint statement calling the move an \"unprecedented attempt\" to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence, the paper says.The Metro joins the Met police in a dawn drug raid in their lead story. The paper says the operation is part of a blitz on drug gangs which has helped drive down London's murder rate.The UK government is open to following Australia in a social media ban for under-16s amid fears over its harm to children, the i Paper reports. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall is understood to be open to the move and says she will be \"driven by the evidence\".The Daily Express leads on a report that the government's net zero project could cost taxpayers £9tn, far above official figures. The paper describes this costing as a \"fantasy\" and according a study from free-market think thank the Institute of Economic Affairs, officials have \"underestimated\" the price of heat pumps, renewables, and electric vehicles.In international news, UK special forces are being lined up to storm Russian shadow fleet vessels and could target hundreds of illegal oil tankers, the Times reports. Elsewhere, the top picture spot shows a fire burning on the streets of Iran as anti-regime protests stretch into their their third week.\"Fury over Labour payout\" to a detainee at Guantanamo Bay who was tortured by the CIA after the 11 September 2001 attacks, fills the Daily Mail's front page. It was revealed the government paid \"substantial\" compensation to Abu Zubaydah, who brought a legal claim against the UK on the basis that its intelligence services were \"complicit\" in his torture. The NHS is overspending by £164m a year on ADHD services, according to an investigation by the Guardian.

    "body": "The BBC will file a motion to dismiss Donald Trump's lawsuit over how his 6 January 2021 speech was edited in a Panorama documentary.The US president filed a $5bn (£3.7bn) lawsuit in a Florida court last month, accusing the BBC of defamation and of violating a trade practices law.Court papers filed on Monday show the broadcaster will argue the Florida court lacks \"personal jurisdiction\" over the BBC, the court venue is \"improper\" and that Trump has \"failed to state a claim\".The BBC previously apologised to Trump over the edit, but rejected his demands for compensation and disagreed there was a basis for a defamation claim.The corporation will also argue that Panorama programme was not aired in the US and did not defame the US president.It will also assert that the president has not demonstrated that the documentary caused any actual damage to him, noting that he was re-elected after the programme aired and carried Florida with a commanding majority.Trump claims that the documentary aired on Britbox, which the BBC said is not correct.The BBC will add that Trump cannot plausibly allege that the documentary was published with \"actual malice\". It points out that the clip is some 15 seconds of an hour-long programme containing extensive coverage of his supporters and balanced coverage of his path to re-election.During Trump's speech on 6 January 2021, before a riot at the US Capitol, he told a crowd: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme, a clip showed him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"The BBC previously acknowledged the edit had given \"the mistaken impression\" Trump had \"made a direct call for violent action\", but disagreed that there was basis for a defamation claim.An internal BBC memo leaked in November criticised how the speech was edited, and led to the resignations of the corporation's director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness.In Monday's court documents, the broadcaster also asked the court \"to stay all other discovery\" - a pre-trial process in which opposing parties exchange evidence and information - pending the decision on the motion.A proposed trial date in 2027 has been indicated should the case progress.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterUS President Donald Trump on Monday said he had imposed a 25% tariff on goods from countries with commercial ties to Iran, a move that could put pressure on Tehran as anti-government protests enter a third week.Trump said on social media that the tariff was \"effective immediately\", without offering details of what constituted \"doing business\" with Iran.China is Iran's largest trading partners, followed by Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and India.The new tariff comes after Trump threatened to intervene militarily if Tehran killed protesters. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that military options including air strikes were still \"on the table\".\"Any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.\"This Order is final and conclusive,\" he added.The White House did not share additional information about the tariffs, including which countries' imports will be hit hardest.Anger over the plummeting value of the Iranian currency, the rial, sparked protests in late December, which have grown into a crisis of legitimacy for Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) says it has verified the deaths of nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel in Iran, while sources tell the BBC the death toll could be much higher. Thousands more have reportedly been arrested.However, an internet blackout since Thursday evening has made it difficult to obtain and verify information. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran.Trump has threatened to intervene, and said on Sunday that Iranian officials had called him \"to negotiate\" - but added \"we may have to act before a meeting\".International sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme have had a severe impact on the country's economy, which has also been weakened by government mismanagement and corruption.On 28 December shopkeepers took to the streets of Tehran to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the rial against the US dollar on the open market.Iran's currency has sunk to a record low over the past year while inflation has soared to more than 40%, resulting in sharp price rises for everyday items like cooking oil and meat.

I was angry because people thought I was sidelined based on injuries, when in reality, it was internal homophobia that kept me on the bench.\"A change in management meant \"politics\" kept him off the pitch and limited his career opportunities, Cavallo said, also alleging a photo of him and his partner was mocked by his teammates in a group chat.\"For the first time, I actually questioned if I should have kept my sexuality a secret.\"A spokesperson for Adelaide United - which is due to take part in its fourth Pride Cup match on Saturday - said it was \"extremely disappointed by the claims made\".\"Adelaide United has always been committed to fostering an inclusive environment for players, staff and supporters, and we remain proud of our ongoing work to promote inclusion across football.\"Cavallo has previously spoken about receiving death threats on a near daily basis after his decision to publicly come out, but has said that his only regret is not coming out sooner.His 2021 revelation inspired Jake Daniels, who in 2022, at the age of 17, became the first British professional male footballer to come out in more than 30 years.",

    "body": "Watch: \"This has to stop\" - Minnesota sues federal government over surge of ICE agentsThe US state of Minnesota has sued the Trump administration in an attempt to block a surge of federal immigration agents into the state.The lawsuit argues the deployment amounts to an unconstitutional \"federal invasion\". Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison said immigration operations had upended life for millions and caused \"chaos and violence\".It comes after Renee Good, 37, was shot dead by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, triggering large protests in the city. The lawsuit asks a federal court to declare the deployment illegal. The Trump administration has described the legal action as \"baseless\".It has said said the agents are targeting undocumented migrants, and further agents are needed to ensure their safety during operations.In a news conference on Monday, Ellison said the deployment violated the state's \"sovereign authority to protect the health and wellbeing of every single person who lives within our borders\".Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey alleged that agents were illegally targeting people who they assumed to be immigrants based on racial profiling. He said their actions had led to an increase in calls to 911, and forced city police to work overtime to investigate incidents involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\"The unlawful deployment of thousands of armed, masked, and poorly trained federal agents is hurting Minnesota,\" Ellison said.He accused the Trump administration of \"persecuting the state of Minnesota because of our political views\". Democrats currently hold the governorship and control the state legislature.\"Keith Ellison made it abundantly clear today he is prioritising politics over public safety,\" Tricia McLaughlin from the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. \"This is a baseless lawsuit, and we look forward to proving that in court.\"During the news conference, prosecutors said they would attempt to get a court to issue a temporary restraining order to block the deployment as early as Tuesday.It comes as the US Department of Homeland Security says it plans to send more agents into the state as part of its Operation Metro Surge.The department says the deployment is necessary to combat illegal immigration and crime. According to recent estimates, around 2,000 agents have been deployed to Minnesota.Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News that \"hundreds more\" will be sent to the area \"in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely\".The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a similar lawsuit on Monday against what it called an \"organized bombardment\" and \"occupation\" by federal immigration agents.\"Uniformed, military-trained personnel, carrying semi-automatic firearms and military-grade weaponry, have rampaged for months through Chicago and the surrounding areas,\" the Illinois lawsuit states.The shooting of Good last week led to fierce debate over federal law enforcement operations in US cities. Federal officials allege that the 37-year-old was attempting to run over immigration agents with her car when she was shot. Local officials have disputed this, and say firing shots was not necessary. The FBI has said it will investigate the shooting. Local officials say they are being shut out of the federal investigation.",

It was very difficult.\"There were 15 of us all together, and we were there for four days. We prayed and prayed.\"We had nothing to eat, and the children cried and cried, but we could do nothing for them.\"In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Carolina went into labour and shortly afterwards she and the newborn were spotted by a South African military helicopter that was helping in the rescue operations.The two became symbols of the aftermath of the disaster, and they travelled to the US later in 2000 to speak to Congress and help raise awareness about what had happened.AFP via Getty ImagesCarolina and Rosita were photographed in Washington in July 2000 during a short trip thereOn Monday, confirming the news of Rosita's death at 25, her sister Celia Salvador told the BBC that she had \"passed away after a prolonged illness. I'm extremely sad. She died of an illness I am unable to explain what it was.\"According to other family sources, Rosita had been battling against the blood disorder anaemia for years. As a result of the worsening of her condition, she had been in hospital for more than two weeks, where she eventually died on Monday morning.\"My God. Very bad news. My condolences to the bereaved family,\" the president told the BBC.\"She was a symbol for girls in Mozambique. That's why, I extend my condolences to all the Mozambican people, especially to Mozambican girls.\"Rosita grew up with her family and graduated from high school in the same rural area – Chibuto – where she was born. She herself had a daughter five years ago.Political analyst Charles Mangwiro described her death as a \"wake-up call for the government to improve service delivery in the entire health system in the country. \"You cannot expect to survive when health professionals complain every day about unpaid salaries for months and about the shortage of essentials like protective materials and antibiotics.\"Despite recruiting more health workers in recent years, analysts continue to describe an overstretched health system short of basic drugs and equipment.Chibuto Mayor Henriques Machava told the press that conversations were under way with the family to formalise the funeral arrangements, which, according to him, would be taken care of by the municipality.More about Mozambique from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "58 minutes agoLaura CressTechnology reporterBBCThe UK will bring into force a law which will make it illegal to create non-consensual intimate images, following widespread concerns over Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot.Speaking to Labour MPs on Monday, Sir Keir Starmer warned X could lose the \"right to self regulate\". \"If X cannot control Grok, we will\", he said, saying the government would act quickly in response to the issue. The government also plans to unveil legislation to make it illegal to supply online tools used to create such images.The BBC has approached X for comment. It previously said: \"Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"It comes hours after Ofcom announced it was launching an investigation into X over \"deeply concerning reports\" about Grok altering images of people.If found to have broken the law, Ofcom can potentially issue X with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18 million, whichever is greater.And if X does not comply, Ofcom can seek a court order to force internet service providers to block access to the site in the UK altogether.In a statement, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall urged the regulator not to take \"months and months\" to conclude its investigation, and demanded it set out a timeline \"as soon as possible\".It is currently illegal to share deepfakes of adults in the UK, but legislation in the Data (Use and Access) Act which would make it a criminal offence to create or request them has not been enforced until now, despite passing in June 2025.Last week, campaigners accused the government of dragging its heels on implementing that law.Liz Kendall told the Commons that the offence \"will be brought into force this week\". In addition to the Data Act, Kendall said she would also make it a \"priority offence\" in the Online Safety Act. Kendall said AI-generated pictures of women and children in states of undress, created without a person's consent, were not \"harmless images\" but \"weapons of abuse\".\"The content which has circulated on X is vile. It's not just an affront to decent society, it is illegal,\" she said.\"Let me be crystal clear - under the Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images of people without their consent, or threatening to share them, including pictures of people in their underwear, is a criminal offence for individuals and for platforms.\"This means individuals are committing a criminal offence if they create or seek to create such content including on X, and anyone who does this should expect to face the full extent of the law.\"Watch: UK to bring into force law to tackle Grok AI deepfakes this week'Not about' restricting free speechBut the technology secretary said the \"responsibilities do not just lie with individuals for their own behaviour\" - and \"the platforms that host such material must be held accountable, including X\".She said the government would also build on measures outlined in the Crime and Policing Bill to criminalise nudification apps. \"This new criminal offence will make it illegal for companies to supply tools designed to create non-consensual intimate images, targeting the problem at its source,\" she said.\"In addition to all of these actions, we expect technology companies to introduce the steps recommended by Ofcom's guidance on how to make platforms safer for women and girls without delay.\"If they do not, I am prepared to go further.\"Legal expert Jamie Hurworth said Kendall's comments were \"an indicator of how seriously the government are now taking this issue\".  \"It remains to be seen whether an overstretched police force has sufficient resources to investigate and bring perpetrators before the courts but it is important that each link in the chain - from individual creators to social media platforms - is held to account for their involvement in this type of behaviour.\"Ofcom's investigation will examine whether X has failed to take down illegal content quickly when it became aware of it, and taken \"appropriate steps\" to prevent people in the UK from seeing it.The decision follows a global backlash over Grok's image creation feature, with both Malaysia and Indonesia temporarily blocking access to the tool over the weekend.An Ofcom spokesperson did not give an indication on how long the investigation would take but said it would be a \"matter of the highest priority\".In a response to an earlier post questioning why other AI platforms were not being looked at, Elon Musk said the UK government wanted \"any excuse for censorship\".But Kendall refuted this.\"This is not, as some would claim, about restricting freedom of speech,\" she said. \"It is about tackling violence against women and girls.\"Watch: Backlash against Elon Musk's Grok AI explainedShadow technology secretary Julia Lopez welcomed Ofcom's investigation, and said her party supported the government on nudification tools.But she criticised the government over comments Kendall made last week, when she said she would back Ofcom if it blocked UK access to X for failing to comply with laws.Ms Lopez said despite the internet being used by criminals before, websites have not been banned before.\"It is an extraordinarily serious move against a platform that can be used for good, for uncovering scandal, sparking democratic revolution, and allowing day-to-day the free exchange of ideas, including ideas we don't like.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondentBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe proposed new embassy at Royal Mint Court would be the biggest in EuropeA group of Labour MPs have urged the government to reject China's controversial plan to build a mega embassy in London, just days before the deadline for the decision.In a letter to Communities Secretary Steve Reed, the nine MPs raise security concerns about the proposed site, while warning it would be used to \"step up intimidation\" against dissidents.It come as local residents, who live in flats that are part of Royal Mint Court which Beijing wants to develop, say they are already gearing up to bring a legal challenge if Reed approves the project.Downing Street has argued consolidating China's diplomatic premises into a single site would have security advantages for the UK.The government has said a decision will be made by 20 January and local residents have been told there will be no further delay.Sir Keir Starmer has been planning a trip to China for early this year, which would be the first by a British Prime Minister since 2018. Approval for the London embassy has long been a priority for China's government, which bought the site for £255m in 2018.In their letter, the MPs, who say they represent \"the breadth and depth of our party\", write that \"the concerns surrounding the proposed site remain significant and unresolved\".The site, opposite the Tower of London and once home to the Royal Mint, would be the biggest embassy any country has in Europe.Among the issues the MPs highlight are \"the recent track record of Chinese espionage cases, interference activities, and issuing of bounties against UK-based Hong Kongers\", as well as \"the fact that this embassy would sit above sensitive infrastructure critical to both the UK's economic and national security\".One of the signatories, Sarah Champion, who sits on parliament's Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy has, in the past, had Chinese spyware found on her parliamentary computer.\"I'm hugely concerned by the level and range of security risks raised over the embassy, and I'm not reassured that they're being taken seriously,\" she told the BBC.Several of the MPs who signed the letter, including Emily Darlington, MP for Milton Keynes Central, James Naish, MP for Rushcliffe, and Mark Sewards, MP for Leeds South West and Morely, have spoken out in the past about \"transnational repression\" by China seeking to silence critics abroad, including people from Hong Kong who have sought sanctuary in the UK.In their letter the MPs say \"an embassy of this size, in such a strategic position, would be used to step up intimidation against diaspora and dissidents\". \"Should this application be approved, we would feel unable to reassure our constituents that we are doing everything possible to protect them on British soil,\" they add.Among the other signatories, Phil Brickell, MP for Bolton West, Marie Rimmer, MP for St Helens South and Whiston, and Alex Sobel, MP for Leeds Central and Headingley, have all previously raised the case of Jimmy Lai, a British citizen who is a former Hong Kong newspaper tycoon and one of the territory's highest profile pro-democracy figures. He is facing a possible life sentence after being found guilty of \"conspiracy to collude with foreign forces\" under a controversial security law imposed on Hong Kong by China.Sobel told the BBC, his concerns centred on national security and China's ability to use the embassy site to \"hack or disrupt\" communications to the City of London, as well as concerns about Lai.\"We shouldn't approve the plan before we see Jimmy Lai released and put on a plane to the UK. Our diplomacy should be more robust,\" he said.The letter was organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, (IPAC) an international group which seeks to campaign against what it sees as threats posed by China.BBC visited the location where China plans to put its mega-embassyDowning Street has said the UK would not allow China to \"interfere in our sovereign affairs\" but has insisted approving the new London embassy would \"clearly bring security advantages for the UK\".China has agreed to close more than half a dozen sites it currently uses as diplomatic premises in London and consolidate its activities at Royal Mint Court if gets approved.It is understood UK security services have scrutinised China's proposal for its new embassy and not objected to it.At the same time, the UK is waiting for its own £100m plan to redevelop the British Embassy in Beijing to be approved by China's authorities.The applications are not connected.But the BBC has seen a letter obtained by IPAC, which was written by Boris Johnson in 2018 when he was foreign secretary, addressed to China's Foreign Minister and State Councillor, Wang Yi.In it Johnson said he welcomed \"China's larges overseas diplomatic investment\" at Royal Mint Court and is happy for it to be \"designated as diplomatic premises\", adding that \"the re-development of our Embassy in Beijing will be one of our largest overseas diplomatic investments\".\"Once both these projects are complete, they will be bold expressions of the strength of UK-China bilateral relations,\" he said.\"I am committed, as I am convinced you are, to ensuring that our projects develop alongside each other.\"The UK Embassy in Beijing was established on its current site in 1959. It is understood to be in urgent need of redevelopment as it is considered by diplomats to be unsuitable for modern needs .In London, China's planning application will be considered by the environment secretary, with advice from officials. He alone will take the final decision in the coming days.Mark Nygate, of the Royal Mint Court Residents' Association, told the BBC: \"If the government grants the application then the residents plan to challenge.\"While he said residents could not appoint legal representation until the decision is made, Nygate said they had already seen \"legal opinions that also give us a good starting point for our challenge\".",

    "body": "'They just kept killing': Eyewitnesses describe deadly crackdown in Iran9 hours agoRoja AssadiandSarah Namjoo,BBC PersianPublic domainA protester holds up a picture of crown prince Reza Pahlavi in Kaj Square, north-western Tehran on Friday\"I saw it with my own eyes - they fired directly into lines of protesters, and people fell where they stood.\" Omid's voice was shaking as he spoke, fearful of being traced. Breaking the wall of silence between Iran and the rest of the world takes immense courage, given the risk of reprisals by the authorities.Omid, in his early 40s and whose name we have changed for his safety, has been protesting on the streets of a small city in southern Iran over the past few days against worsening economic hardship.He said security forces had opened fire at unarmed protesters in his city with Kalashnikov-style assault rifles.\"We are fighting a brutal regime with empty hands,\" he said. The BBC has received similar accounts of the crackdown by security forces following the widespread protests across the country last week. Since then, internet access has been cut by the authorities, making reporting from Iran more difficult than ever. BBC Persian is banned from reporting inside Iran by the government.One of the largest nationwide anti-government protests took place on Thursday, the twelfth night of demonstrations. Many people appear to have joined the protests on Thursday and Friday after calls from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution.The following day, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said: \"The Islamic Republic will not back down.\" It appears that the worst bloodshed occurred after that warning as security forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps take their orders from him.Iranian authorities accused the US and Israel of fomenting trouble and condemned \"terrorist actions\", state media reported.A young woman from Tehran said last Thursday felt like \"the day of judgement\".\"Even remote neighbourhoods of Tehran were packed with protesters - places you wouldn't believe,\" she said. \"But on Friday, security forces only killed and killed and killed. Seeing it with my own eyes made me so unwell that I completely lost morale. Friday was a bloody day.\"She said that, after Friday's killings, people were afraid to go out and that many were now chanting from alleys and inside their homes.Tehran was a battlefield, she said, with protesters and security forces taking positions and cover on the streets.But she added: \"In war, both sides have weapons. Here, people only chant and get killed. It is a one-sided war.\"Mortuary videos shows violent government crackdown in IranEyewitnesses in Fardis, a city just to the west of Tehran, said that on Friday, members of the paramilitary Basij force under the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) suddenly attacked protesters after hours without a police presence on the streets.The forces, who were in uniform and riding motorcycles, fired live ammunition directly at protesters, according to the witnesses. Unmarked cars were also driven into alleys, with occupants shooting at residents who were not involved in the protests, they said. \"Two or three people were killed in every alley,\" one witness alleged.Those who have given accounts to BBC Persian say the reality inside Iran is hard for the outside world to imagine, and the death toll reported by international media so far only represents a fraction of their own estimates. International news outlets are not allowed to work freely inside Iran and they are mostly relying on Iranian human rights groups who are active outside the country. On Monday the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 648 protesters in Iran had been killed, including nine people under the age of 18.Some local sources and eyewitnesses report very high numbers of people killed across different cities, ranging from several hundreds to thousands. The BBC is currently unable to independently verify these figures and, so far, Iranian authorities have not provided official or transparent statistics on the number of deaths of protesters. However, Iranian media has reported that 100 security personnel had been killed during the protests, saying that protesters - whom they refer to as \"rioters\" - set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities. Eyewitness imageFootage posted on Thursday showed large crowds in Babol, northern IranEyewitness imageImages posted on Thursday from Khorramabad in western Iran showed a man holding Iran's pre-revolutionary flagVideos verified by BBC Persian's fact-checking team also show police vehicles and some government buildings being set alight in different locations during the protests.Testimonies and video sent to BBC Persian are mainly from larger cities such as Tehran, nearby Karaj, Rasht in the north, Mashhad in the north-east, and Shiraz in the south. These areas have greater access to the internet via the Starlink satellite network. Information from small towns - where many early casualties occurred -  is scarce as their access to Starlink is very limited.But the volume, consistency, and similarity of the accounts received from various cities point to the severity of the crackdown and the widespread use of lethal violence.Nurses and medics who spoke to the BBC said they had seen numerous dead bodies and injured protesters.They reported that hospitals in many cities had been overwhelmed and were unable to treat those with severe injuries, especially to the head and eyes. Some witnesses reported bodies \"stacked on top of each other\" and not handed over to families.Eyewitness image / ReutersFootage from Tehran that emerged on Friday showed cars ablaze Graphic videos published on the activist-run Telegram channel Vahid Online on Sunday showed a large number of bodies at the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in Tehran, with many families either mourning or attempting to identify the corpses.In one of the videos apparently from Kahrizak, relatives are seen looking at the photos of unidentified bodies displayed on a screen.Many bodies in black bags were visible in the facility and on the street outside, only some of which seem to have been identified.One video showed the inside of a warehouse containing several bodies, while another showed a truck being unloaded with people removing corpses from it.A mortuary worker in a cemetery in Mashhad said that before sunrise on Friday morning between 180 and 200 bodies with severe head injuries were brought in and buried immediately.A source in Rasht told BBC Persian that 70 bodies of protesters were transferred to a hospital mortuary in the city on Thursday. According to the source, security forces demanded \"payment for bullets\" before releasing bodies to families.At the same time, a medical staff member at a hospital in eastern Tehran told BBC Persian that on Thursday, around 40 bodies were brought there the same day. The hospital's name has been withheld to protect the identity of the medic.UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Sunday that he was \"shocked by reports of violence and excessive use of force by the Iranian authorities against protesters resulting in deaths and injuries in recent days\". \"I want to emphasise that regardless of the death toll, the use of lethal force by security forces is concerning,\" Mai Sato, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, told BBC Persian.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMaryLou CostaTechnology ReporterBoard IntelligenceCo-chief executives Jennifer Sundberg (left) and Pippa BeggFor almost 16 years, Pippa Begg ran Board Intelligence as co-chief executive with Jennifer Sundberg.Together they grew the business, which provides analysis and services for company boards, and today it employs 200 staff and has big big name clients, including Nationwide, Rolls-Royce and Reckitt.\"We are quite different people - very much yin and yang - but I think decisions are better made with two brains rather than one as it stops hubris,\" says Begg, who is London-based.Begg and Sundberg are part of a trend, that's seen more companies experimenting with a co-CEO leadership structure.In 2015, there were 11 companies with co-CEOs in the Russell 3000 group of the biggest public companies in the US, while in 2024, this had more than doubled to 24, according to an analysis by public company intelligence firm MyLogIQ.A raft of major companies also made such appointments in 2024, such as Oracle, Comcast, and Spotify. Netflix, meanwhile, has had co-CEOs since 2020.Top corporate executives are well rewarded - a report from last year showed that chief executives at the UK's biggest firms are paid, on average, 122 times the salary of the average full-time, UK worker.However, there are downsides to being in charge. According to a survey by leadership advisory firm ICEO, 56% of top executives felt burnt out in 2024.A co-CEO model divides responsibility, accountability, and, ultimately, the burden between two people.Leadership coach Audrey Hametner has observed that co-CEOs can take time out that sole CEOs might otherwise feel they can't do. She recalls a CEO client who had not taken a holiday in five years, but was finally able to have a family holiday once he found a co-CEO partner.Hametner says it also allows bosses to play to their strengths.She gives the example of a previous client where one co-CEO worked more closely with the marketing and product departments, and the other mainly with finance, government regulatory bodies and legal.\"You may have co-CEOs where one is an outgoing and high-level thinker, who may find it more challenging to focus on all the small tasks, and the other CEO is more detail-oriented and loves to speak to the data and the nuances,\" she says.Sharing the workload may also give the co-CEOs more time with their family. That's something they might be lacking - 60% of CEOs report spending too little time with their family, according to a study by executive search firm Russell Reynolds.Begg took three maternity leaves of around six months in the space of five years, returning to work each time in a four-day week capacity.Similarly, Sundberg took two maternity leaves in that period. Begg notes that it's unusual for a CEO on both counts.Some female CEOs have been public about taking minimal maternity leave, with 71% of women in leadership positions taking less than six months' leave for fear of jeopardising their jobs, according to data from That Works For Me.The same study reveals a 32% drop in women at managerial level after having children.Begg credits her co-CEO partnership for not turning her into another statistic.\"Without the co-CEO structure, the trade off would have either been too great for the business, or too great for the way that we wanted to have our children and have maternity leave,\" she reflects.\"If we hadn't had the co-CEO model, we probably would have felt that we needed to find a new CEO, or even sell the business, which are things that happen to so many female-run businesses because they don't see how it's going to work. Our experience was that this can really work.\"AnythingDhruv Amin (left) and Marcus Lowe, the co-CEOs of AnythingIt's been the case for Dhruv Amin and Marcus Lowe, the co-founders and co-CEOs of Anything, a startup focused on \"vibe coding\", which allows anyone to create an app without knowing how to code.Thanks to the set up, Amin was able to take two paternity leaves of three weeks each in 2024 and 2025.\"Marcus has covered for me twice. We've both had times when we're gunning hard for the company, and times we're not. The structure gives us permission to be human without everything falling apart,\" says Amin, who is based in San Francisco.In Finland, Denise Johansson was able to take three weeks away from work when her father died suddenly in 2024. She has been co-CEO and co-founder of payment processing platform Enfuce with Monika Liikamaa since 2016.\"It was not only a huge emotional shock, it also came with a lot of unexpected responsibility as I inherited another business at the same time,\" says Johansson, who is based in Mariehamn, in the Åland Islands.\"Monika stepped in without hesitation, took on more of the day-to-day load, and created the space I needed to deal with both grief and practical issues.\"With six children between them, Johansson and Liikamaa are also able to take time with family while the other one holds the fort.\"If my kids need me, I will be off with them - no question. We coordinate so that key moments for our children are protected, while the company still has a steady hand on the wheel,\" says Johansson.Piranha PhotographyDenise Johansson (right) has been co-CEO with Monika Liikamaa since 2016Yet a co-CEO model has yet to become a mainstream, long-term solution. Salesforce, SAP and Marks and Spencer all appointed co-CEOs in the early 2020s, lasting no more than two years.Tierney Remick is a Chicago-based vice chairman and co-leader of the global board and CEO practice at business consultancy Korn Ferry.She's observed that co-CEOs tend to work best at independent companies without complex structures, and with two people that have already worked together.Otherwise, there can be power struggles, misalignment in vision, and confusion amongst the wider company.\"Leaders trying to establish their partnership, as well as drive the business and evolve the strategy - and doing it in a way that doesn't create confusion in the organisation - is usually very difficult if they don't know each other,\" says Remick.Co-CEO pairings can also be used as a type of succession planning to see if one will ultimately become the sole, core CEO, she adds.\"There's a tremendous amount of succession planning happening at the moment. And there is the reality that the pipeline of 'ready-now' CEOs has decreased over the last several years,\" she says.\"So we are seeing boards find different ways to expand the roles and responsibilities of high potential leaders, to see how they accelerate and grow in a market that is creating a lot of change and ambiguity every day.\"For Begg, her co-CEO days came to an end in 2024 when Board Intelligence acquired private equity backers, which became a natural point for Sundberg to stand down. Sundberg remains on the company's advisory board.Now Begg is the sole CEO, she acknowledges she has less time to spend with family, so her husband left his job to be more present at home.After their youngest child started school last September, he set up a consultancy that he works on during school hours.\"He carries the load of home and family life. It still probably raises an eyebrow when he's called into a meeting and he says it has to be between 10am and 3pm. They'll be shocked that a man has said that,\" says Begg.More Technology of Business",

    "body": "9 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorBBCOne of these images is a real photo, while the other two have been digitally altered by Grok to change what I'm wearing. Can you tell which is real?Here's me, at the end of a pier in Dorset in the summer.Two of these images were generated using the artificial intelligence tool Grok, which is free to use and belongs to Elon Musk.It's pretty convincing. I've never worn the rather fetching yellow ski suit, or the red and blue jacket - the middle photo is the original - but I don't know how I could prove that if I needed to, because of those pictures.Of course, Grok is under fire for undressing rather than redressing women. And doing so without their consent.It made pictures of people in bikinis, or worse, when prompted by others. And shared the results in public on the social network X. There is also evidence it has generated sexualised images of children.Following days of outrage and condemnation, the UK's online regulator Ofcom has said it is urgently investigating whether Grok has broken British online safety laws.The government wants Ofcom to get on with it - and fast.But Ofcom will have to be thorough and follow its own processes if it wants to avoid criticism of attacking free speech, which has dogged the Online Safety Act from its earliest stages.Elon Musk has been uncharacteristically quiet on the subject in recent days, which suggests even he realises how serious this all is. But he did fire off a post accusing the British government of seeking \"any excuse\" for censorship.Not everyone agrees that on this occasion, the defence is acceptable.\"AI undressing people in photos isn't free speech - it's abuse,\" says campaigner Ed Newton Rex.\"When every photo a woman posts of themselves on X immediately attracts public replies in which they've been stripped down to a bikini, something has gone very, very wrong.\"With all this in mind, Ofcom's investigation could take time, and a lot of back-and-forth – testing the patience of both politicians and the public.It's a major moment not only for Britain's Online Safety Act, but the regulator itself. It can't afford to get this wrong.Ofcom has previously been accused of lacking teeth. The Act, which was years in the making, only came fully into force last year. It has so far issued three relatively small fines for non-compliance, none of which have been paid.The Online Safety Act doesn't specifically mention AI products either. And while it is currently illegal to share intimate, non-consensual images, including deepfakes, it is not currently illegal to ask an AI tool to create them. That's about to change. The government will this week bring into force a law which will make it illegal to create these images.And the UK says it will amend another law - currently going through Parliament - which would make it illegal for companies to supply the tools designed to make them, too.These rules have been around for a while, they're not actually part of the Online Safety Act but a completely different piece of legislation called the Data (Use and Access) Act.They've not been brought into enforcement despite repeated announcements from the government over many months that they were incoming.Today's announcement shows a government determined to quell criticisms that regulation moves too slowly, by showing it can act quickly when it wants to.It's not just Grok that will be affected. A political bombshell?The new law that will be enforced this week could prove to be a headache for other owners of AI tools which are technically mostly capable of generating these images as well.And there are already questions around how on earth it will be enforced - Grok only came under the spotlight because it was publishing its output on X.If a tool is used privately by an individual user, they find a way around the guardrails and the resulting content is only shared with those who want to see it, how will it come to light?If X is found to have broken the law, Ofcom could issue it with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18m, whichever is greater. It could even seek to block Grok or X in the UK. But this could also be a political bombshell.I sat at the AI Summit in Paris last year and watched Vice President JD Vance thunder that the US administration was \"getting tired\" of foreign countries attempting to regulate its tech companies.His audience, which included a huge number of world leaders, sat in stony silence.But the tech firms have a lot of firepower inside the White House – and several of them have also invested billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the UK. Can the country afford to fall out with them?",

The White House Chief of Staff, referred to by the president as the “most powerful woman in the world”, is the gatekeeper to the Oval Office and a crucial figure in delivering Trump’s national agenda. \nShe also rarely speaks to the media, making her an elusive figure in the president’s top team despite her significant influence. But in a series of interviews for Vanity Fair, she refers to Donald Trump as having an “alcoholic’s personality”, describes JD Vance as a “conspiracy theorist” and Elon Musk as an “odd, odd duck”. The White House has described the articles as a “framed hit piece” and accused Vanity Fair of taking statements out of context.\nIn today’s podcast, Justin and Anthony go through some of the most revealing lines from the interviews, and speak to the journalist who sat down with Susie Wiles - Chris Whipple - to find out why he thinks Wiles wanted to speak with him, and how he responds to White House criticism of the interviews.\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\nChris Whipple, Journalist and author of several White House books, including Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History \nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

    "body": "Police in Sri Lanka have arrested three men for allegedly burning a wild elephant with flaming torches while trying to chase it away, local media reported.A video of the incident, which took place in a village in the country's north, triggered fierce backlash as it circulated on social media this week.Despite receiving treatment from veterinarians, the male elephant died on Tuesday. The suspects, who were arrested on Thursday, are aged between 42 and 50, local media reported.The male elephant was found with severe burns and a gunshot wound on its leg. It had also been treated by vets on several occasions earlier this year, local media reported.The case has drawn sharp criticism among animal rights advocates and social media users.A petition created on Thursday, demanding prosecution of the perpetrators and measures to prevent similar acts of cruelty, has garnered more than 400 signatures.Elephants are considered sacred in Sri Lanka, where the majority of the population is Buddhist. Domesticated elephants are often part of religious ceremonies, as well as being a popular tourist attraction.Killing an elephant in the country is an offence that can carry the death penalty, according to the World Wildlife Fund. But increasing encounters between humans and elephants have proven deadly for both species.Nearly 400 elephants have died so far this year, local media reported. An official told local outlet Daily Mirror that many of these deaths were caused directly by humans, and included shootings, train accidents, and the use of \"jaw bombs\": an explosive bait used by farmers to protect their crops from wild animals.More than 100 people were killed in elephant attacks in the same period.",

    "body": "1 hour agoTom Bennett,LondonandBernd Debusmann Jr,White HouseReutersThe UK has named career diplomat Christian Turner as its new ambassador to the US, Downing Street has confirmed.The previous ambassador, Lord Peter Mandelson, was sacked by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer after evidence, including emails and photos, emerged showing his continued association with the paedophile Jeffery Epstein.Turner has spent nearly 30 years working across Whitehall and the Foreign Office.As the new ambassador in Washington, he will have to navigate relations with the Trump administration, which have been partly strained by disagreements over how to handle the war in Ukraine, as well as President Donald Trump's criticism of Europe.The White House said it looked \"forward to working with Ambassador Turner to further enhance the strong relationship between the United States ‍and United ‌Kingdom\", according to a statement sent to Reuters news agency.The Foreign Office said in a statement that King Charles had formally appointed Turner, and the UK would now seek official approval - or agrément - for his appointment from the US.Turner said he was \"honoured\" to be nominated for the position. \"At a pivotal time for the transatlantic relationship, I look forward to working with President Trump's administration, and leaders in Congress, business and society to strengthen that bond in the years ahead,\" he said. Turner will face a heavy load of diplomatic tasks when he takes up the role.Chiefly among them is working with the US on Trump's push to end the war in Ukraine, which European nations fear will undercut the long-term interests of the continent in favour of a quick resolution.Earlier this month, a US national security strategy document - signed by Trump - argued that Europe was facing \"civilisational erasure\" and questioned whether certain European countries could remain reliable allies.Turner will also have to work to secure a long-anticipated but delayed tech deal with the US, amid concerns from some White House and congressional officials who have been critical of the UK's online safety laws. Some have characterised those regulations as \"censorship\" and legal overreach that impacts US firms.AFP via Getty ImagesPeter Mandelson (right) announced US-UK trade agreement alongside Donald Trump in May Sir Keir's government has pushed for close ties with Trump, hosting him on a second state visit in September, during which Trump praised the \"unbreakable bond\" between the US and UK.But just days before Trump arrived, Sir Keir sacked Lord Mandelson after revelations over his friendship to Epstein. Lord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.The Foreign Office reportedly pushed hard for a diplomatically experienced figure to be appointed as the new ambassador. Turner's previous roles include political director at the Foreign Office, British High Commissioner to Pakistan, and Foreign Office Director for the Middle East and North Africa. He also previously worked in 10 Downing Street as private secretary to the prime minister.Before entering government, he worked in television documentaries.In a statement released by the Foreign Office, Sir Keir said: \"The United Kingdom and United States have a very special relationship, and Christian's extensive experience as an outstanding diplomat will support this uniquely close bond and ensure it continues to flourish.\"Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said Turner would bring \"exceptional diplomatic experience and deep understanding\" to the role. Ambassador to the US is seen as one of the UK's top diplomatic postings. More on this story",

The sampling of whale \"blow\" is a \"game-changer\" for the health and well-being of whales, said Prof Terry Dawson of King's College London.\"It allows us to monitor pathogens in live whales without stress or harm, providing critical insights into diseases in rapidly changing Arctic ecosystems,\" he said.The researchers used drones carrying sterile petri dishes to capture droplets from the exhaled breath of humpback, fin and sperm whales, combined with skin biopsies taken from boats.They confirmed for the first time that a potentially deadly whale virus, known as cetacean morbillivirus, is circulating above the Arctic Circle.The disease is highly contagious and spreads easily among dolphins, whales, and porpoises causing severe disease and mass deaths.It can jump between species and travel across oceans, posing a significant threat to marine mammals.The researchers hope this breakthrough will help spot deadly threats to ocean life early, before they start to spread.Nord UniversityThe researchers sampled humpback, sperm, and fin whales across the North-East Atlantic\"Going forward, the priority is to continue using these methods for long-term surveillance, so we can understand how multiple emerging stressors will shape whale health in the coming years,\" said Helena Costa of Nord University, Norway. The study, involving King's College London and The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in the UK, and Nord University in Norway is published in BMC Veterinary Research.",

    "body": "European Union leaders have struck a deal to give Ukraine a €90bn (£79bn; $105bn) loan after failing to agree on using frozen Russian assets.The agreement, which leaders said would meet Ukraine's military and economic needs for the next two years, came after more than a day of talks at a summit in Brussels. \"We committed, we delivered,\" EU chief Antonio Costa wrote on X as he announced the deal to provide a loan backed by the bloc's common budget. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had urged leaders to use €200 billion of frozen Russian assets but Belgium, where the vast bulk of the cash is held, demanded guarantees on sharing liability that proved too much for other countries.In another development, French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed it would be \"useful\" for Europe to re-engage with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"I believe that it's in our interest as Europeans and Ukrainians to find the right framework to re-engage this discussion,\" he said, adding that Europeans should find the means to do so \"in coming weeks\".EU ⁠leaders avoided \"chaos ‍and ‍division\" ​with ‌their decision to provide Ukraine with a loan through borrowing cash rather than ​use frozen Russian assets, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De ​Wever said early on Friday.\"We remained united,\" De ‌Wever added. Ukraine is months from running out of cash and Zelensky said without an injection by spring Ukraine would \"have to reduce production of drones\".The EU estimates Ukraine needs an extra €135 billion to stay afloat over the next two years, with the cash crunch set to start in April.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who had pushed for the asset plan, said the final decision on the loan \"sends a clear signal\" to Putin.Russia had warned EU leaders not to use its money, but Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said they had to \"rise to this occasion\".The agreement offers Kyiv a desperately needed lifeline amid a flurry of diplomacy as US President Donald Trump pushes for a quick deal to end Russia's war.US and Russian officials are due to meet in Miami this weekend for further talks on a peace plan, a White House official has told AFP news agency. It is thought Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev will talk to Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Miami.Meanwhile, Zelensky announced Ukrainian and US delegations would hold new talks on Friday and Saturday in the United States.He said he wanted Washington to give more details on the guarantees it could offer to protect Ukraine from another invasion.",

    "body": "The Australian government has announced a gun buyback scheme in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack - its deadliest mass shooting in decades.The scheme is the largest since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, which left 35 people dead and prompted Australia to introduce world-leading gun control measures.Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured on Sunday when two gunmen, believed to have been motivated by \"Islamic State ideology\", opened fire on a Jewish festival at the country's most iconic beach.On Friday, police also said there was no ongoing reason to detain a group of men who were arrested in Sydney over their \"extremist Islamic ideology\".Police allege Sunday's attack, which they have declared a terrorist incident, was committed by a father-son duo. Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.The day after the shooting, national cabinet - which includes representatives from the federal government and leaders from all states and territories - agreed to tighten gun controls.Speaking to media on Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there are now more than 4 million firearms in Australia - more than at the time of the Port Arthur massacre.\"We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney's suburbs... There's no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns. \"If you're going to reduce the number of guns, then a buyback scheme has to be a piece of that puzzle,\" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett added.The new scheme will purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms, and will be funded on a 50-50 basis with the states and territories. Hundreds of thousands of firearms will be collected and destroyed, the government estimates.National cabinet has also agreed to impose limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual, restrict open-ended firearms licensing and the types of guns that are legal and make Australian citizenship a condition of holding a firearm licence. Work on a national firearms register will be accelerated and firearm regulators will have better access to criminal intelligence.On Friday, New South Wales Police said they were preparing to release seven men with extremist ideology, but that they would continue to be monitored.Tactical officers swarmed on the group, who had travelled from Victoria and were known to police there, in dramatic scenes in the suburb of Liverpool on Thursday. Officers found a knife, but no guns or other weapons.NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference there is \"no confirmed link\" between the alleged terrorists and the detained group, but that Bondi Beach was one of several locations the latter was intending to visit.\"Whilst this specific threat posed by the males is unknown, I can say that the potential [for] a violent offence being committed was such that we were not prepared to tolerate the risk,\" Commissioner Lanyon said.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThe Minister for Women and Equalities, Bridget Phillipson, is blocking the publication of trans guidance that would require businesses and public bodies to protect women-only spaces, describing them as \"trans-exclusive\", according to the Daily Telegraph. The paper also focuses on Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's criticism of the government's plan to tackle misogyny in schools, saying it must look at immigration from cultures that \"don't respect women\". And the Prince and Princess of Wales' outdoor family Christmas photo with their three children takes the top picture spot under the caption \"Fresh heir\". A photo of actress Olivia Coleman at the launch of Labour's strategy to stop violence against women and girls is splashed across the Metro's front page. The government has revealed a raft of new measures aimed at cracking down on the \"national emergency\" and change men's behaviours towards women.The Independent follows with their lead on the government's vow to make women and girls \"safe at last\". The paper also focuses on a call from Under-Secretary of State for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls Jess Phillips for \"all of society to step up and end the epidemic of abuse and violence that shames or country\". Elsewhere, a smiling Rory McIlroy lifts the trophy for BBC Sports Personality of the Year.The i Paper is predicts a \"mortgage price war in spring\" after the Bank of England cut interest rates to 3.75%, the lowest since 2023. Mortgage brokers are hoping for a \"golden era of house buying\" early in the new year as the central bank expects inflation to fall quicker than expected, the paper says.The signs of cooling inflation also makes the Financial Times' lead story. Elsewhere, there are fears of financial reprisals by Russia among some EU states if a move to agree to a multi-billion euro loan in frozen Russian money to fund Ukraine's military and economic needs goes ahead. According to the paper, last year Western businesses held at least $127bn of assets in Russia.Staying with Russia, the Daily Express features comments by Badenoch, who says the Tories are the only party to have the \"competence\" to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats. The Conservative leader added that the UK could not afford complacency and must \"face down\" Russia, the paper reports.In news closer to home, nearly 10 million voters face having their local elections delayed until 2027 as part of Labour's plans to reorganise local government, the Times reports. The paper says the government has asked more than 60 districts and county councils if they want to suspend elections due to take place in May next year.\"Labour's running scared of voters\" is the Daily Mail's take. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has likened the move to the actions of a \"dictator\" the paper says.The Guardian turns its attention to the new photos from late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate released by US House Democrats. Among the new batch of images are what appear to be lines from the novel Lolita written on different parts of a woman's body, the paper says. As Christmas nears, around 1.8 million people will spend the day alone, says the Daily Mirror. The results from a poll have prompted pleas from ministers for people to \"pop in on a pal\" and look out for their lonely neighbours.The Sun reports that former Strictly Come Dancing contestant Thomas Skinner is suing the BBC over claims the broadcaster rigged voting to kick him off the show. A BBC spokesperson said: \"Strictly Come Dancing's public vote is robust and independently overseen and verified to ensure complete accuracy.\"Finally, the Daily Star pays tribute to darts ace Ally Pally's \"lucky wasp\", which was sadly swatted and killed after it landed on PDC World Championship winner David Munyua's face. \"Rest sting peace\" is the headline.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "1 hour agoPeter HoskinsBusiness reporterJapan's central bank has raised its main interest rate to the highest level in 30 years as the country faces a cost-of-living squeeze.In a widely expected decision, the Bank of Japan's policy board, led by governor Kazuo Ueda, increased its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point to \"around 0.75%\" on Friday.The move comes as new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is keen that inflation comes down but also needs the cost of government borrowing to be cheap.It marks both the first time the BOJ has hiked rates since January and the first rise since both Takaichi and Ueda took up their current roles.When a central bank raises interest rates it tends to have the effect of increasing the value of the country's currency.In Japan's case, it has the potential of easing inflation as the yen's low value versus other major currencies, like the US dollar and the euro, has pushed up the cost of imports, which in turn has helped to fuel inflation.At the same time, higher interest rates push up government borrowing costs because when rates go up governments, like anyone else, have to pay more to borrow money.Last year, Takaichi described the idea of a rate hike as \"stupid\" although she has not publicly criticised Ueda's policies since she took office in October.Still, Takaichi has made the fight against inflation a priority as rising costs have eroded support for her party, the LDP.On Friday, official figures showed Japan's inflation, excluding food and fuel, rose by 3% in November. That remains above the bank's target rate of 2%.But Shoki Omori, chief strategist at Mizuho in Tokyo, told the BBC that the interest rate rise will do little to ease inflation as it has already been priced in by currency markets and the yen remains relatively weak.Most economists expect the BOJ to raise its benchmark interest rate once more next year to hit 1%.It marks a major change in Japanese policy makers' approach to interest rates.\"What we're seeing is a historic shift after nearly three decades of long standing low rates in Japan,\" said Julia Lee from Pacific FTSE Russell, part of the London Stock Exchange Group.But Takaichi's stance on monetary policy may make it harder for the bank to hike again, said Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan economics at Oxford Economics.\"The BoJ will need time, probably around six months, to monitor the impact of the rate hike on the real economy before it makes its final move,\" he said.The BOJ’s latest rate rise comes as other major central banks around the world are moving in the opposite direction - lowering the cost of borrowing.On Thursday, the Bank of England cut its main interest rate to 3.75%, the lowest level since February 2023.Last week, the US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the third time this year, even as internal divisions create uncertainty about additional cuts in the coming months.The central bank said it was lowering the target for its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% - its lowest level in three years.",

Improvement works taking place over the Christmas period mean several routes will be closed or restricted.Information on what routes will be closed for repairs can be found on the Network Rail website.National Rail trains do not run on Christmas Day and only a small number will run on Boxing Day.Daniel Mann, Director of Industry Operations at the Rail Delivery Group, said: \"We encourage customers to reserve seats where possible, bring only luggage that is easy to carry and fits in designated storage areas, and allow extra time for their journeys.\"FlightsFriday is expected to be the busiest day of the festive season for airports, but the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said flying on Christmas Day was becoming more popular.It advised customers to know their rights in case their flight is cancelled or delayed.If this happens, airlines are required to support passengers. This can include:Providing food and drink during extended delaysCovering accommodation if passengers are delayed overnightOffering a refund or alternative travel if a flight is cancelledIf your flight is cancelled, and it is covered by UK law, your airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or being booked on to an alternative flight.You can check if your flight is covered under UK law here.The CAA also said that travellers can minimise their risk of delays by ensuring their cases are packed correctly.This includes leaving presents unwrapped as they may need to be inspected.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesMillions of people will be able to set their own contactless card payment limits or even have no limit at all, a regulator has confirmed.Banks and card providers will be given the power, from March, to set a maximum - or unlimited - single payment amount without the need to enter a four-digit PIN.But they are also being encouraged by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to allow cardholders to set their own individual limits, or switch off contactless entirely. Some banks already offer this function.The move comes despite the FCA's own survey showing little appetite among consumers and industry respondents for a change from the current £100 limit on contactless cards.The FCA said it did not expect card providers to make immediate changes to the current limit from March, but they had the flexibility to do so.When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at £10. The limit was raised gradually, to £15 in 2010, to £20 in 2012, then to £30 in 2015, before the Covid pandemic prompted a jump to £45 in 2020, then to £100 in October 2021.While contactless cards currently have a £100 payment limit, anyone using their smartphone to pay can spend any amount without the need for a PIN.In-built security features, such as thumbprints and face ID, provide greater protection.But concerns have been raised about cards becoming more attractive to thieves and fraudsters, when high-value payments can be made with a tap of a card.Various protections are already in place, such as a prompt to enter a PIN after a series of consecutive contactless transactions are made.Consumers would still get their money back if it was stolen by fraudsters, according to David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA.\"Contactless is people's favoured way to pay. We want to make sure our rules provide flexibility for the future, and choice for both firms and consumers,\" he said.Other countries, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand allow industry to set contactless card limits.Jana Mackintosh, managing director of payments and innovation at UK Finance, which represents banks, said: \"Any changes made in the future will be done carefully and ensure strong security and fraud controls remain in place.\"Temptation to spend?The FCA's own survey on changing the rules, released during consultation, showed that 78% of consumers who responded said they did not want any change to the current limits.Consumers and academics have suggested that the extra convenience of unlimited contactless payment limits could also lead to shoppers spending without thinking.This is said to be a particular issue with credit cards, when people are spending borrowed money and accumulating debt.Financial abuse charities have also warned that unlimited contactless spending could give abusers free access to drain a survivor's bank account with no checks or alerts.They also worry it could also hasten the shift towards a cashless society, despite notes and coins being a lifeline to many financial abuse survivors whose card transactions are monitored online by their abusers.One policy to help vulnerable customers access cash, as bank branches close, is the development of shared banking hubs.Cash Access UK, the organisation set up to protect access to cash across the UK, announced the official opening of its 200th banking hub in Billericay, Essex, on Friday.

    "body": "8 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinHouse Oversight CommitteeThe House Oversight Committee has released a batch of around 70 photos from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It's the third such release from a tranche of over 95,000 photos the committee has acquired from Epstein's estate. It includes images of quotes from the book Lolita written across a woman's body, and redacted images of women's foreign passports. It comes hours before the 19 December deadline for the Department of Justice to release all files related to its investigation into Epstein. \"These new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession,\" said ranking member of the committee, Robert Garcia.What's in the images releasedSome of the photos released on Thursday show Epstein speaking with professor and activist Noam Chomsky aboard a private plane; Bill Gates standing beside a woman whose face is redacted; Steve Bannon sitting at a desk across from Epstein, and former Alphabet president Sergey Brin at a dinner event. The BBC has attempted to contact each for comment.These are the latest wealthy, powerful men to be seen in Epstein estate photos released by the House Oversight Committee - previously released photos also show US President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, as well as film director Woody Allen, former US treasury secretary Larry Summers, attorney Alan Dershowitz, former prince Andrew Mountbatton-Windsor, and others. Appearing in the photos is not evidence of any wrongdoing, and many of the pictured men have said they were never involved in Epstein's illegal activity. House Oversight CommitteeIn a statement accompanying the photo release, Democrats on the US House Oversight Committee said the Epstein estate did not provide context or timings for the pictures. \"Photos were selected to provide the public with transparency into a representative sample of the photos received from the estate, and to provide insights into Epstein's network and his extremely disturbing activities,\" the statement says.The release also includes several photos of quotes from the Vladimir Nabokov novel Lolita written in black ink across different parts of a woman's body, like her chest, foot, hipbone, and back. Lolita tells the story of a young girl who was groomed by a middle-aged literature professor.One quote from the book written across a woman's chest reads, \"Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth\". House Oversight CommitteeThere are also a number of photos of female passports and identification documents from countries around the world, including Lithuania, Russia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine.  Most of the information on the documents, like names and birth dates, is redacted but the House Oversight Committee said in a press release that the passports belong to \"women whom Jeffrey Epstein and his conspirators were engaging\".Another photo shows Epstein sitting at a desk closely surrounded by three female figures whose faces have been redacted - one has her hand on Epstein's chest under his shirt, and another is crouching to look at a nearby laptop. Epstein appears to be helping the third put on a bracelet. House Oversight CommitteeAnother image released is a screenshot of text messages from an unknown person who says they have been sent \"some girls\" and are asking for \"$1000 per girl\". House Oversight CommitteePhoto release comes ahead of DOJ deadlineThe committee has thousands of images in its possession from the Epstein estate, which are \"both graphic and mundane\", its statement on Thursday explained. The House Oversight Committee first subpoenaed the estate of Epstein, who died in a New York prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on allegations of sex trafficking, in August. The photos and files the Epstein estate gave to the committee are separate from what is largely referred to as \"the Epstein files\". Those are documents within the justice department's possession related to its own investigation into Epstein. Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law last month, the DOJ has until 19 December to release its files. The extent of what's contained in the DOJ's files is unknown, and it's likely that much of the content will be heavily redacted, similar to House Oversight Committee materials. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoAndré Rhoden-PaulPA MediaThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) is investigating claims Russian hackers stole hundreds of sensitive military documents and published them on the dark web. The Mail on Sunday first reported the files on the dark web -  an area of internet that can only be accessed through particular software - hold details of eight RAF and Royal Navy bases as well as MoD staff names and emails.Maintenance and construction contractor Dodd Group confirmed it suffered a ransomware incident and it was taking the claims \"extremely seriously\". The MoD said in a statement it was \"actively investigating the claims that information relating to the MoD has been published on the dark web\". \"To safeguard sensitive operational information, we will not comment any further on the details,\" it added in a statement. The Mail on Sunday reported the documents hold information about a number of sensitive RAF and Navy bases, including RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, where the US Air Force's F-35 jets are based.A Dodd Group spokesperson said: \"We can confirm that the Dodd Group recently experienced a ransomware incident whereby an unauthorised third-party gained temporary access to part of our internal systems.\"We took immediate steps to contain the incident, swiftly secure our systems and engaged a specialist IT forensic firm to investigate what happened.\"We are taking these claims extremely seriously and are working hard to validate this.\"The hacks follow a series of high-profile data breaches at the MoD. In August it was revealed thousands of Afghans brought to safety in the UK had their personal data exposed after an MoD sub-contractor suffered a data breach.Last year the personal information of an unknown number of serving UK military personnel was accessed in a significant data breach.

    "body": "4 hours agoSeveral papers lead with the Metropolitan Police's investigation into media reports that Prince Andrew allegedly used his police protection to try to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre. It allegedly occurred just before the Mail published a photo of the pair's first meeting in February 2011, in what the Sun describes as an order to \"dig dirt\". Prince Andrew has not commented on the reports, but consistently denies all allegations against him. On Friday, he announced he would give up his royal titles, including the Duke of York.The Daily Mail leads with details on King Charles III's \"threat\" to strip Prince Andrew of his royal titles. The paper cites anonymous sources who say the prince tried to \"dig his heels in\", despite \"the growing tsunami of evidence\" about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It prompted the King to threaten \"further action\" unless his brother \"saw sense\", the paper reports.The Daily Mirror also leads on the claims that Andrew tried to \"dig up dirt\" on Giuffre, declaring it the \"scandal with no end\". The paper also contains details about the King's intervention, quoting a source who said: \"The scandal has engulfed the family for too long, forcing the King to banish him.\"Calls for Prince Andrew to lose his title lead the Metro, including \"by the family of Virginia Giuffre\". The paper's headline, \"And when he was down, he was down\", alludes to the nursery rhyme \"The Grand Old Duke of York\".The Times also leads with the Metropolitan Police investigation into Prince Andrew's \"bid for police to investigate his accuser\". The newspaper also reports that \"Russian spies and hard-left humanitarian groups are working with people smugglers to flood Europe with illegal migrants\", citing remarks from Bulgaria's interior minister. The i Paper leads with reports on the tensions in Gaza, saying the ceasefire is \"in peril\". It reports the \"fragile sense of calm\" was disrupted by a \"wave of air strikes\" by Israel's military. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \"claims it bombed \"terror targets\" in response to an alleged attack on Israeli soldiers in Rafah\", in southern Gaza, the paper says. The IDF and Hamas \"blame each other for breaching ceasefires\", according to the paper.\"Scramble to shore up ceasefire as Israel hits Gaza with deadly raids\", reads the headline on the front page of the Guardian. Two IDF soldiers were killed in a Hamas attack and dozens of Palestinians were killed in \"retaliatory strikes\", the paper reports. The heist at the Louvre in Paris also features on the front page. It reports on the French police's investigation into the brazen seven-minute theft at the museum, which closed on Sunday. The paper says one of the pieces of jewellery stolen was a necklace Napoleon had given to his wife.A \"fractious\" White House meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky leads the Financial Times. The paper reports the meeting between the two leaders \"descended many times into a \"shouting match\", citing \"people familiar with the matter\". The paper says Trump urged Zelensky to \"surrender the entire Donbas region\" to Russia.The Daily Telegraph also leads with the Trump-Zelensky White House meeting. It says Trump had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly before hosting Zelensky. It describes \"shouting and swearing\" during the Trump-Zelensky meeting, adding: \"Mr Trump threw aside Ukrainian maps of the battlefield.\"The Daily Express leads with an exclusive story, reporting the mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan \"read reports of young girls being raped in hotels by groups of men while publicly denying there were any grooming gangs in the capital\". It quotes whistleblower Maggie Oliver, who told the paper  \"the cases followed 'the same pattern' she had seen with Greater Manchester Police's cover-up of the Rochdale scandal\", where a group of seven men were found guilty of sexually exploiting two teenage girls over five years. \"The mayor and the Metropolitan Police have consistently claimed to have 'no reports' of Rochdale or Rotherham-style rape gangs in the capital\", the paper reports.The Daily Star leads with the British Film Institute (BFI) adding the \"lettuce livestream\" to its national archive, marking three years since Liz Truss resigned as prime minister. The livestream featured a \"plucky 60p Tesco iceberg\", which was \"livestreamed to see if it would outlast Truss's time in No 10 in 2022\". Related Internet Links",

    "body": "47 minutes agoJoe PikePolitics investigations correspondent andHarry SekulichBritish soldiers will be granted new powers to shoot down drones threatening military bases.The plans, to be unveiled by Defence Secretary John Healey in a speech on Monday, are intended to allow troops to take faster, more decisive action.Four British airbases used by US forces reported mystery drone sightings last year, while drones have disrupted airspace across Europe a number of times in recent months.The new powers will only apply to military sites, but could be extended to civilian locations such as airports.Healey is set to announce the introduction of a \"kinetic option\", first reported by the Daily Telegraph, that would enable British troops or Ministry of Defence (MoD) police to shoot drones posing a threat to a military site in the UK.Existing protocol mandates soldiers divert drones or disrupt their GPS signal using counter-drone equipment. Shooting down an unidentified drone is only allowed in extreme circumstances.RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall, in Suffolk, RAF Feltwell in Norfolk and RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire all reported drone incursions in November last year.About 60 RAF personnel were sent to assist the US Air Force in its investigation.Neither US nor UK officials have said who might have been behind the drone activity. The airbases have strategic significance for the US military. It recently deployed F-22A fighter jets to RAF Lakenheath, days after the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites in June.Recent drone sightings across the European Union prompted a leaders' summit in Denmark earlier this month.Several EU member states have backed plans for a multi-layered \"drone wall\" to quickly detect, track and destroy Russian drones.Twenty Russian drones crossed into Poland in September while Russian MiG-31 jets entered Estonian airspace later in the month. Russia has denied or downplayed the incursions.Other recent drones sightings have also forced numerous European airports to close, including across two consecutive days in Munich, Germany.Airports in Denmark and Norway also shut after unidentified drones were spotted near airport and military airspaces.Russia denied any involvement, while Danish authorities said there was no evidence Moscow was involved.

    "body": "George Santos is done with politics for now - instead, he wants to use his newfound freedom to make prisons more humane, he told The Washington Post. The disgraced Republican US Representative from New York was released from prison on Friday after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. \"There is nothing more that I want to do than to focus and dedicate my entire life to prison reform,\" Santos said in a Saturday interview with the Post. Santos, who was booted from Congress in 2023 after a damning ethics report, told the Post that his experience in federal prison was \"dehumanising\" and \"humbling\".Santos had admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported.He embellished much about his biography in the run-up to his election to Congress in 2022.In the 84 days he served in prison, Santos wrote a handful of columns published on The South Shore Press' website. He has described the prison system as \"broken\" with \"rotting facilities, and administrators who seem incapable or unwilling to correct it\". He said a gaping hole in the ceiling exposed \"thick black mold\" underneath, and that broken air conditioning forced prisoners to endure sweltering heat.  \"The building itself is hardly fit for long-term habitation: sheet metal walls, shoddy construction, the look and feel of a temporary warehouse rather than a permanent facility,\" Santos wrote.Santos told the Post that he spoke with Trump on Saturday and informed the president of his mission to get involved in prison reform and to \"help his administration achieve that in whichever way I can\".It's not clear how exactly Santos intends to work on prison reform, and his lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC.Santos told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday that he's not interested in running for office again just yet, at least for the next decade.\"I'm all politicked out,\" he told Bash. The Bureau of Prisons responded to a request for comment from BBC saying that it could not answer media inquiries due to the ongoing government shutdown. A contact for the prison Santos was held in, FCI Fairton in New Jersey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Santos' allegations of poor conditions and mistreatment. ",

    "body": "13 hours agoBorn Free/PA MediaThe penguins arrived in May 2011 from Edinburgh ZooAnimal welfare campaigners have called for the release of 15 penguins \"trapped in a basement without sunlight or fresh air\" in a demonstration held at the London Aquarium.Organised by Freedom For Animals with support from Born Free and The Express newspaper, between 250 and 300 people protested against the captivity of 15 gentoo penguins at the riverside attraction in Westminster.The aquarium, owned by Merlin Entertainments, opened its first penguin exhibit in May 2011, introducing 10 gentoo penguins from Edinburgh Zoo.A spokesperson for the Sea Life London Aquarium said the penguins' habitat was \"designed with help and advice from specialist vets\".'Idiotic'The penguins \"have now endured 14 years in a basement\" equipped with a pool of only six to seven feet (1.8-2.1m) deep, according to campaigners.Former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey dared the new Merlin Entertainments chief executive Fiona Eastwood to \"swap places with the penguins\".He said: \"In fact, if she's prepared to actually spend a month down there with those penguins, I will donate £1,000 of my money to a charity of her choosing.\"There is no reason that they should be benefiting at all from imprisoning 15 birds in the basement of an old council building.\"\"It's idiotic. It's a nonsense, and it's got to stop,\" Sharkey added.Born Free/PA MediaSea Life aquariums contain more than 30,000 sea creatures across the UKMerlin Entertainments is co-run by Blackstone Group, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Kirkbi, the investment arm of the Lego family.The British theme park giant owns a wide range of attractions across the UK, including Alton Towers, Legoland Windsor, Madame Tussauds, Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures.A spokesperson said the enclosure \"provides an excellent balance of water and land for the penguins which enables them to express their normal behaviours and there is space for them to ensure they have sufficient privacy\".Naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham CBE, who was also at the protest, rejected the venue's claims and called it \"a blight on the reputation of London's attractions\".\"I could get some specialist architects to build you and me a house in an asbestos factory - we wouldn't want to live in it, would we?\" Packham said.Freedom For Animals launched its Free The Fifteen campaign in January 2024, arguing that since gentoo penguins are not classified as an endangered species, there is no justification for breeding and keeping them in captivity.As of this year's stocktake, Sea Life aquariums counted more than 30,000 sea creatures across 11 centres in the UK.",

Food plays a central role in the celebrations.  Families prepare a variety of traditional Indian sweets which are shared with friends and neighbours. Festive meals often include rich curries, savoury snacks, and special breads. In the days leading up to the festival, people clean and decorate their homes, shop for new clothes, and buy traditional sweets to exchange as gifts with friends and family. Many also create traditional and colourful rangoli designs outside their doors to invite luck and positivity. On Diwali itself, families worship Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth.Diwali's appeal goes beyond religion, drawing people from different communities and faiths to join in the celebrations.

    "body": "World of cricket's farewell to umpire Dickie Bird13 hours agoGrace Wood & Adam LaverYorkshirePA MediaDickie Bird's funeral cortege passes the umpire's statue in BarnsleyCricketing stars from Yorkshire and beyond were among the mourners who gathered to say farewell to legendary umpire Dickie Bird at his funeral earlier.The Barnsley-born son of a miner was 92 when he died \"peacefully at home\" on 22 September, according to Yorkshire County Cricket Club.The service at St Mary's Church in Barnsley was attended by former England cricketers Sir Geoffrey Boycott and Michael Vaughan and was followed by a private family-only cremation and a wake at the town hall.Well-wishers gathered at the statue of Bird on Church Lane where the funeral procession paused for a moment of reflection.Anthony Devlin/PA WireDickie Bird died on 22 September aged 92The invited guests also included Yorkshire chair Colin Graves and former director of cricket Martyn Moxon, the sports commentator John Helm and the ex-sports minister Richard Caborn.Sir Geoffrey and Graves both gave eulogies and a poem by local poet Ian McMillan was read out.Sir Geoffrey made sure the colourful character of his friend of almost 70 years shined through.\"I first met Dickie Bird when I was 15, at the time I was playing cricket for Hemsworth Grammar School,\" Sir Geoffrey said to a packed church.\"He called me Gerald for years.\"He added: \"Surprisingly with all the nerves he had as a batsman, he became a great umpire because he could channel all that nervous energy into good decisions.\"Dickie was refreshingly different. Eccentric but fair. It would be hard to find anyone who didn't like him.\"PA MediaSir Geoffery Boycott paid tribute to his old friend Dickie BirdBird officiated in 66 Tests and 76 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals, between 1973 and 1996.He began as a player, batting for Yorkshire and Leicestershire before an injury cut short his career in 1964.Bird was awarded an MBE in 1986, an OBE in 2012 and the Freedom of Barnsley in 2000.In 2009 he was immortalised by a statue in Barnsley that depicted him raising his index finger to indicate a batsman was out.At Yorkshire's home ground, Headingley, he paid for a balcony outside the dressing room for the players to sit and watch the game. Both the balcony and a clock at the ground bear his name.ReutersDickie Bird retired as an umpire at the age of 65 after a career spanning 30 yearsFormer England and Yorkshire cricketer Ryan Sidebottom said Bird was so committed to Yorkshire cricket that he would be on the pitch even for county matches he wasn't umpiring.He said: \"He'd be out looking at the wicket and wandering around. But it looked like he'd just come in from a night out, like an 1980s John Travolta, because he had the full suit on with a large collar and tie and really fancy suits and flared trousers.\"We used to see him regularly with different suits, some naughty suits, some proper naughty suits.\"Bowler Sidebottom retired in 2017, after taking more than 1,000 career wickets, and he said Bird \"absolutely loved\" the sport.\"Great bloke and a lovely man who would do anything for Yorkshire cricket. He just loved Yorkshire, he was so passionate about the game and Yorkshire in general,\" he said.And it was love for Yorkshire, and its people, that chair of Yorkshire County Cricket Club Colin Graves remembered at his funeral.\"He had a reputation for not being the first at the bar, but he was a very generous man indeed,\" he said, adding that almost 1,000 children had been recipients of grants from him.Among the junior cricketers to have received financial awards from Dickie was Harry Brook - now an England international.Paul Barker/PA WireDickie Bird was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Leeds in 1997Speaking to the BBC when he turned 90 two years ago, Bird said his secret to a long life had been his love of sport and exercise.\"I run, I go out down to the local football ground here in the local park and I lap around the ground. I feel that's done me good.\"I'd like people, elderly people, if they could to just try and do a few exercises, move your arms, run on the spot, it occupies the brain. \"I'll keep my exercises up as long as I can.\"As a young man, he played for Barnsley Cricket Club alongside Boycott and the journalist and broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson.Dickie Bird shares secret to healthy life at 90Related stories",

Maccabi Tel Aviv has not yet commented, except to confirm the match was cancelled.The decision by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from the Aston Villa match on 6 November has sparked widespread criticism.The UK government has since said it is working to overturn the ban and exploring what additional resources might be required to ensure the fixture can be hosted safely.Villa told their matchday stewards that they did not have to work at the game, saying they understood that some \"may have concerns\".On Thursday, West Midlands Police said it supported the ban and classified the fixture as \"high risk\" based on intelligence and previous incidents.That included \"violent clashes and hate-crime offences\" between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans before a match in Amsterdam in November 2024, when more than 60 people were arrested.There have been protests at various sporting events over the war in Gaza, including when Israel played Norway and Italy in recent football World Cup qualifiers.",

    "body": "These confederate statues caused nationwide protests. Melted down, they're now art pieces4 hours agoRegan MorrisLos AngelesBBC / Regan MorrisA statue of Matthew Fontaine Maury, a Confederate officer, on display A massive monument of General Robert E Lee that once sparked riots in the Virginia city of Charlottesville is now a pile of melted-down bronze, artfully displayed in a Los Angeles museum.Next to the sculpture are barrels of toxic \"slag\" leftover from the melting process.Around the corner, there is a massive, graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson – the two most famous Confederate generals in the US Civil War, which the Confederacy lost in 1865 and ultimately led to the end of slavery in the United States.\"They fought for slavery,\" says curator Hamza Walker, who has been working for eight years to acquire and borrow the massive monuments amid lawsuits and the logistical challenges of moving tens of thousands of pounds of bronze and granite to Los Angeles.\"The idea of lionising those figures. What did they believe? They believed in white supremacy. Period.\"Coming at a time when President Donald Trump is ordering statues and paintings of Confederate generals to be reinstalled, the warring narratives of American history are at the heart of \"Monuments,\" which opens 23 October at The Brick and at the Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art.The 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments are displayed alongside pieces of contemporary art. The massive, graffitied statue of Lee and Jackson, for example, stands next to a giant replica sculpture of the \"General Lee\" car from the iconic TV show, The Dukes of Hazzard.BBC / Regan MorrisJalane Schmidt, an activist who campaigned for the statue of Lee to be removed from Charlottesville, stands in front of the sculpture the statue has becomePresident Trump has often spoken of General Lee's bravery and he and others have criticized the removal and toppling of Confederate monuments, saying it's revisionist history. White nationalists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, triggering deadly clashes, to keep the statue from being removed. In the aftermath, similar statues sparked clashes in cities across the US. \"Under this historical revision, our Nation's unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed,\" President Trump wrote in a March executive order calling for paintings and monuments to be reinstalled.But Mr Walker says putting Lee and Jackson on pedestals – even though they lost the war – is racist and promotes the Lost Cause ideology that argues the Civil War was a noble cause for states' rights and not about slavery.\"States rights to do what? The reason for the Civil War was slavery,\" he said, adding that it perpetuates the idea that the South was a \"noble victim\", and that slavery wasn't so terrible.\"If you could distance them from slavery, right, then you could portray them as heroes, even though they lost the war and were on the wrong side of history, fighting for something that was morally repugnant,\" he says.BBC Keith “Chuck” Tayman\"Unmanned Drone\" by artist Kara Walker is the centrepiece of the exhibit The centrepiece of the show is \"Unmanned Drone\" – a completely reconstructed sculpture of Stonewall Jackson by artist Kara Walker, who transformed the horse and its rider heading into battle into a headless, zombie-like creature.\"The southern vernacular would be a 'haint', which would be a ghostly form,\" Kara Walker, who is not related to Hamza Walker, told the BBC when asked how she describes the work. \"It's an attempt to rethink the legacies of Stonewall Jackson as a mythology, as mythological holder for white supremacy.\"Most of the monuments on display will be returned to the cities and towns they've been borrowed from when the show closes in May. But Kara Walker's sculpture will need to find a new home. And the bronze ingots from the melted down Lee sculpture will be transformed again into a new work of art.The statue was removed in 2021 and melted in 2023 after the Charlottesville City Council voted to donate the statue to the Jefferson School - African American Heritage Center.\"It's a toxic representation of history, this lost cause narrative, and we're purifying it,\" says Jalane Schmidt, an activist and professor who was there when the statue came down in Charlottesville, and when it was melted at a secret foundry. She came to see it in its new form in Los Angeles.Getty ImagesWhite nationalists marched on Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017Living in Charlottesville, she said, the statue was always in the background until a teenage girl in 2016 started a petition to rename Lee Park and remove the statue because she found it offensive that the city would celebrate someone who fought for slavery.The statue was the focal point for the Unite the Right rally in 2017, which turned deadly when a 21-year-old white nationalist plowed his car into counter protesters killing Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal and civil rights activist.Schmidt says the petition and the rally changed public opinion about the monuments in Charlottesville and elsewhere. \"Especially after Unite the Right, after we were attacked, well, clearly this was evidence that, you know, people are willing to die for symbols, but they're also willing to kill for them,\" she said. \"We had to remove them just for our own health.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoAna Faguy andKathryn ArmstrongPresident Donald Trump said the US will no longer offer subsidies to Colombia, one of the country's closest South American allies.The US president announced the decision in a Truth Social post on Sunday, labelling Colombia's President Gustavo Petro as \"an illegal drug leader\" who has \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia\".His comments come after Petro accused the US of committing \"murder\" when it carried out a military strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September.The move is the latest in a string of escalating tensions between the US and countries in Latin America, as the US military continues to strike ships in the Caribbean Sea it alleges carry drugs.Trump said because the US offers \"large scale payments and subsidies\" and Petro \"does nothing\" to stop the drug production, the US will no longer offer \"payment or subsidies\" to Colombia. According to a government website, the US provided over $740m (£551m) in aid to Colombia in 2023. It is unclear if all of that aid will stop, or when. In September, for the first time since 1996, the US declared that Colombia had failed to uphold its drug trafficking promises, and is ineligible for aid as defined in the Foreign Assistance Act. But the state department included a waiver that allowed Colombia to continue to receive aid. But following Petro's recent accusation of Americans committing \"murder\", Trump has escalated matters and says he will halt aid.Under Petro, cocaine production has reached a record-level and the country has failed to reach its coca eradication goals, the state department said in September. Petro has said the US violated his country's sovereignty killing a Colombian fisherman with its September attack. Posting on social media, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck. He added: \"We await explanations from the US government.\"\"Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing. The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.\"Alejandro Carranza was reportedly killed on 15 September when US forces allegedly fired on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean.Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".The escalation between Trump and Petro comes on the heels of another attack on a ship in the Caribbean sea. That attack, which happened on Thursday, is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.The Thursday attack, on a submarine, is the first time survivors have been reported, though the attack also killed two people.  Trump  said US intelligence confirmed the vessel was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The US president said two people who survived the submarine attack would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.They were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporter andGeorge WrightGetty ImagesVirginia Giuffre, seen here holding a picture of herself as a teenager, took her own life earlier this yearVirginia Giuffre says she feared she might \"die a sex slave\" at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and his circle, her posthumous memoir reveals. The BBC has obtained a full copy of Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of convicted sex offender Epstein ahead of its publication on Tuesday, almost six months after she took her own life.In the memoir, Ms Giuffre also says she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, including once with Epstein and approximately eight other young women.Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has always denied any wrongdoing.The memoir, which the BBC bought from a book store in central London days before its official release date, paints a picture of a web of rich and powerful people abusing young women.At the centre of the abuse was Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre says that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared them both.Much of the book makes for extremely harrowing reading, as Ms Giuffre details the sadistic abuse that Epstein put her through.She says Epstein subjected her to sadomasochistic sex which caused her \"so much pain that I prayed I would black out\".On Friday, Prince Andrew announced that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles and giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.He will no longer use his Duke of York title, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.In his statement, he said: \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"However the new book, written by Ms Giuffre and ghostwriter Amy Wallace, puts the prince under even more scrutiny.In the memoir, Ms Giuffre says she first met Prince Andrew in March 2001.She writes that Maxwell woke her up and told her it was going to be a \"special day\" and that \"just like Cinderella\" she was going to meet a \"handsome prince\".She says that when she met Prince Andrew later that day, Maxwell told him to guess her age.The prince, who was then 41, \"guessed correctly: seventeen\", Ms Giuffre said. \"My daughters are just a little younger than you,\" she recalls him saying.That night, she says she attended London's Tramp nightclub with Prince Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell, where she says the prince \"sweated profusely\".In a car on the way back to Maxwell's house afterwards, Ms Giuffre writes that Maxwell told her: \"When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.\"She wrote that back at the house they had sex.\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled - as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she says.\"The next morning, it was clear that Maxwell had conferred with her royal chum because she told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.'\"Ms Giuffre writes that she \"didn't feel so great\", adding: \"Soon, Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy' - a lot of money.\"Ms Giuffre says she had sex for a second time with the prince around a month later at Epstein's townhouse in New York.She says the third occasion was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\".She writes that she said in a sworn declaration in 2015 that she was \"around 18\".\"Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together,\" she says. \"The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English. \"Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.\"Virginia GiuffreVirginia Giuffre says she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasionsLater in the book, Ms Giuffre touches on her 2022 out-of-court settlement with Prince Andrew after she brought a civil case against him.\"I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,\" she writes.While Ms Giuffre's alleged interactions with Prince Andrew have been widely reported by the British press, the book's content is wider in scope - littered with sinister details of Epstein's sex trafficking.The girls were required to look \"childlike\", Ms Giuffre says, and her childhood eating disorder was \"only encouraged\" under Epstein's roof.\"In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people,\" she writes.\"I was habitually used and humiliated - and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied.\"I believed that I might die a sex slave.\"Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.On Sunday, the Metropolitan Police said it was \"actively\" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about Ms Giuffre through his police protection officer (PPO).According to the Mail on Sunday, the prince asked the officer to investigate Ms Giuffre just before the newspaper published a photo in February 2011 of her first meeting with the prince.A royal source told the BBC there are currently no plans for the removal of the prince title that Andrew was born with.\"The headlines are taking a lot of oxygen out of the royal room,\" they added, referring to press about Prince Andrew diverting attention away from King Charles's engagements.In 2019, the prince repeatedly told BBC Newsnight that he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\" and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"Buckingham Palace has not commented.Virginia Giuffre's brother calls on King to strip prince Andrew of 'prince' title",

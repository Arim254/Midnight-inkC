Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Is the snow and ice set to return again this January?Image caption, Snow in early January turned parts of the UK into a winter wonderlandByStav DanaosLead Weather PresenterIf you think we've said goodbye to bitter winter weather then think again. There's a battleground of air masses beginning to build across the UK and it's far from clear which will win out.At the start of January a spell of notably harsh winter weather brought Arctic winds southwards along with heavy snow, widespread ice and biting temperatures.A recent shift in the jet stream has allowed milder Atlantic air to be ushered in lifting temperatures to around the seasonal average. This sudden change introduced a different set of hazards, with frequent rainfall, strong winds and the rapid thaw of lying snow bringing about localised flooding in some areas.However, now we're entering a new phase with two competing weather influences and it's a waiting games to see which will dominate - more wind and rain, or more snow and ice.Image source, MarkieB / Weather watchersImage caption, Flooding from a combination of heavy rain on saturated ground and snow melt has led to disruption in placesWhen are we expecting a change to colder weather?As we push into the second half of the month there is a signal that temperatures could once again drop with an increased chance of snow for some.It's not that straightforward, however, as the UK is expected to sit right in the middle of two vying systems.On one hand an Atlantic low pressure system will repeatedly attempt to move in from the west, bringing relatively mild, moist air and unsettled conditions. At the same time, areas of higher pressure over eastern Europe and Scandinavia may intermittently push westwards, encouraging colder and more stable air to edge into eastern parts of the UK.Image source, BBC WeatherImage caption, The UK lies on the boundary of air masses for the foreseeable future, with colder air around high pressure towards the east of the country perhaps winning out later in the monthFor the next few days the Atlantic influence is likely to dominate. Many areas can therefore expect largely cloudy skies and changeable weather, with frequent showers or longer spells of rain at times.Temperatures during this phase are expected to be close to the seasonal average overall, reflecting the balance between mild-Atlantic air and occasional cooler interludes. Where skies clear overnight, especially in more sheltered or rural locations, there will be a continued risk of night frosts.As we head through next week the forecast confidence decreases but there is an increasing indication that colder conditions could begin to take hold.This would occur if high pressure to the east becomes more influential, allowing colder air to spread westwards across the UK.Should this transition develop, temperatures are likely to fall below average and the risk of wintry weather would increase. Any precipitation could potentially turn to snow — particularly over higher ground but possibly at lower levels too in some areas.However, the exact timing and extent of any colder spell remains uncertain at this stage. A colder than normal January?With the prospect of temperatures falling below average towards the end of the month, alongside an increasing likelihood of further snowfall, there is growing potential for a renewed cold spell. When this is considered together with the notable cold snap experienced at the start of the month, it raises the possibility that January as a whole could end up being colder than the long-term average.Such an outcome would be relatively unusual in the context of recent years. As the climate continues to warm, months that finish below average have become less frequent, particularly during winter, when milder Atlantic influences increasingly dominate. But does highlight how short-lived but significant cold spells can still occur and have a meaningful impact on monthly averages, even in a changing climate.",

    "body": "9 hours agoMaia DaviesBBC NewsWatch: What Machado and Trump have said about Nobel Peace Prize medal exchangeVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed she will lead the country \"when the right time comes\".\"There's a mission, and we are going to turn Venezuela into that land of grace, and I believe I will be elected when the right time comes as president of Venezuela, the first woman president,\" she told Fox News.Her comments come a day after she gave President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom.The US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on 3 January and removed him to New York to face various drugs and weapons charges. EPA/ShutterstockMachado gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday However, Trump has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, saying she did not have enough domestic support - despite her opposition movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections. He has instead been dealing with the country's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's vice-president and who on Friday held a two-hour meeting with the director of the CIA \"at President Trump's direction\" aimed at building trust and communication between the two countries, according to a US official.\"Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries,\" the US official said.Asked on Friday about his decision to work with Rodríguez over Machado, Trump told reporters his decision had been informed by the US experience in Iraq more than 20 years ago. Security and political structures were dismantled after the US invaded, setting the scene for insurgency and the eventual emergence of the Islamic State group.\"If you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired - every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired - and they ended up being ISIS... I remember that,\" he said.Speaking later at an event in Washington, Machado said she was confident there would be an \"orderly transition\" in her country.\"The result of a stable transition will be a proud Venezuela that will be the best ally the US has ever had in the Americas,\" she said.\"This has nothing to do with a tension between Delcy Rodríguez and myself, this is about a criminal structure - that is the regime - and the Venezuelan people,\" she added, describing herself as \"just one member of a movement of millions of Venezuelans\".Meanwhile, in Venezuela's capital Caracas, Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president.She said she was not afraid to face the US \"diplomatically, through political dialogue\".Rodríguez also said Venezuela needed to defend its \"dignity and honour\", and announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment in a step away from Maduro's policies.Trump called Rodríguez a \"terrific person\" on Wednesday after the pair spoke on the phone, a conversation the Venezuelan leader called \"productive and courteous\".The following day, the US president called Machado a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much\", describing her gift of the Nobel Peace Prize medal as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect\".Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal on Thursday",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCThe i Paper's headline dubs sacked former Conservative shadow minister Robert Jenrick \"spy Jenrick\" with a story suggesting he will take\"Tory secrets to Farage\". But his defection to Reform UK and the i's prediction of a \"plum job\" will kick-start a \"new power struggle\" in Reform, it writes.In an editorial for the Telegraph, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch writes \"Britain is not broken\". The \"rebuke\" following Jenrick's defection sets out \"the dividing lines between the Conservatives and Reform\" arguing the country's \"best days are ahead\". Polling by the paper after the 10 cancelled council elections suggests \"Labour would face wipeout\" if they went ahead.Given Badenoch's words in the Telegraph, it seems a bit of a handbrake turn to see her and Jenrick pictured either side of the Daily Express's headline \"We will fix broken Britain... but not together\". The paper promises an exclusive on its inside pages on what the pair \"have to say about their political split\". Defence Secretary John Healey's words \"Farage can't be trusted with Britain\" lead the Daily Mirror. His comments come after Farage said he wouldn't vote for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine.But the Times says Labour has its own internal problems, with its lead suggesting, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is \"under pressure to get rid of Streeting\", according to the Times. Three cabinet ministers have \"hit out after 'toxic' row\", privately accusing Health Secretary Wes Streeting of putting his ambitions for leadership ahead of the party.The Daily Mail leads with the employment tribunal ruling that a hospital \"violated the dignity\" of a group of female nurses who complained about a transgender woman using their changing room. The nurses have now urged ministers to \"protect all women\" and stop \"dragging their heels\" over national guidance on same-sex spaces.\"Back my Greenland plans or face tariffs\" headlines the Guardian after US president Donald Trump said he may impose the fees on countries that don't \"go along\" with his plan. The story is twinned with a trail for an inside feature on \"The rise of JD Vance\".The Daily Star leads with a picture of Trump holding up this year's Nobel peace prize, after Venezuelan winner Marina Machado gifted it to him. The paper dubs it an \"ig-nobel peace prize\" and writes \"it's not yours.. put it down\".The lead for the Financial Times is the EU's \"proposal to tear up membership rules\" as it \"eyes two-tier accession for Kyiv\". This model could fast-track Ukraine's entry into the bloc should a peace deal over Russia's invasion come into place, it writes. Also on the FT's front is home news with the headline \"NHS waiting lists shrink during young doctors' strike as consultants jump in\".Following the retirement of the West Midlands Police chief over his decision to ban Israeli fans from a match against Aston Villa, the Independent asks \"why didn't they fire him?\" Craig Guildford faced \"major criticism\" and \"lost the confidence of the home secretary\" after providing incorrect evidence to MPs on the report that led to  the ban.England footballer Marcus Rashford was \"duped\" into posing with the killer of Jimmy Mizen, the Sun writes. Now Jake Fahri's move to an open jail has been blocked and the paper says that was because of his \"lies to a probation panel\".Related Internet Links",

Her mother, Sarah Keeling, 45, and passer-by Mark Ratcliffe, 67, both died after trying to save her.The force said emergency services had attempted to retrieve the body, which was found among the rocks on the beach at Withernsea on Thursday at 08:30 GMT, but was unsuccessful due to tide times and other conditions.Specialist officers have been in contact with Grace Keeling's family and have asked people to \"refrain from speculation\" and \"respect their privacy\".Police said emergency services, including HM Coastguard, had cordoned off an area of Holmpton Road and remained at the scene.Det Supt Simon Vickers said: \"Officers and specialist teams have been working to explore every possible option in very complex circumstances to delicately recover the body.\"Due to tide times, conditions and the location, the recovery could not be immediately carried out and has therefore been paused until it is safe to resume.\"Darrin StevensA major search operation was launched on 2 January following reports of people in the waterA major operation was launched involving HM Coastguard, lifeboats and helicopters after calls to the emergency services at about 15:00 GMT on 2 January.Police have previously said that, from trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses, it was understood that Grace Keeling and a friend were on the steps near to the rocks when she was \"believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave\".Ratcliffe was pulled unconscious from the sea and died at the scene. Sarah Keeling's body was recovered later the same evening.In a tribute, Ratcliffe's family described him as a \"true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".Joanne Gee, a close friend of Sarah Keeling, said the 45-year-old \"left a mark with absolutely everyone she met\".Family HandoutMark Ratcliffe was described by his family as a \"selfless hero\"Humberside Police said no formal identification of the body had taken place but recognised the discovery had followed 13 days of \"extensive searches\" for Grace Keeling.Vickers added: \"I appreciate this update will understandably cause concern to members of the public.\"We have a dedicated team of specialists who are doing everything they can in their efforts to carry out the recovery as safely and as quickly as possible.\"Jasmine Lowe / BBCOne of many heartfelt tributes placed at the scene in WithernseaAn inquest into the deaths of Ratcliffe and Sarah Keeling was opened at Hull Coroners' Court on 12 January.The hearing was told that the results of a preliminary post mortem examination found Sarah Keeling died from drowning and head and neck injuries.She came from Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire and worked in sales.Ratcliffe, who was a retired warehouse worker and lived in Withernsea, died from drowning and chest injuries.

    "body": "9 hours agoMallory MoenchWatch: 'The Islamic Republic will fall', says exiled crown princeThe exiled son of the last Iranian shah (king) has called on the world to help protesters topple Iran's government, saying he is confident \"the Islamic Republic will fall - not if, but when\".Reza Pahlavi, a US-based opposition leader, asked the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guard leadership, which he said would \"facilitate our task and prevent more loss of life\".More than 2,600 protesters have been killed, according to a human rights group, in demonstrations that started over the economy on 28 December and turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei.The Iranian government has called the protests \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent figure in Iran's fragmented opposition and has previously urged Iranians to escalate their protests. But protesters have been met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.Speaking on Friday at a news conference in Washington, Pahlavi claimed that sections of Iran's security apparatus had refused to take part in the crackdown and that the Iranian authorities had brought in fighters from foreign militias to quell the protests.He urged the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and command and control infrastructure, calling for a \"surgical strike\". He also asked global powers to deliver economic pressure, expel Iranian diplomats, demand the release of all political prisoners, and deploy satellite internet Starlink and other secure communications to allow connectivity in Iran.\"The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully,\" he said.\"With or without the world's help, the regime will fall. It will fall sooner and more lives will be saved if the world turns its words into action.\"He declined to speak about reports that he had held discussions with senior US officials, but said: \"I believe that President Trump is a man of his word and, ultimately, he will stand with the Iranian people.\"Trump has previously warned Iran's government against killing protesters and told CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if it executed protesters.He later said he had been told \"the killing has stopped\" - but did not rule out military action against the country. Iran's parliament speaker had warned that if the US attacked, both Israel and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets. The US and UK have reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, with officials telling CBS News it was a \"precautionary measure\".Who is Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah?On Friday, Pahlavi also vowed to return to Iran and laid out a plan for creating a new constitution in the country.Asked about future leadership in Iran, he said: \"It's for the Iranian people to decide.\"He said he believes he can lead and has the Iranian people's support: \"I am trying to help them liberate themselves,\" he said.Pahlavi said he supported a governing programme based on the principles of Iran's territorial integrity, a separation of religion and state, individual liberties and the right of the Iranian people to decide on the form of democratic government they want.Pahlavi's father, the last shah of Iran, was overthrown in an Islamic revolution in 1979 and a devout Shia Muslim regime took over.The current wave of protests began after shopkeepers in Iran's capital Tehran went on strike over the rising cost of living and the depreciating value of the currency.They quickly spread across the country and turned against Iran's clerical establishment, particularly Khamenei. The slogans chanted by demonstrators have included \"Death to the dictator\" and \"Seyyed Ali [Khamenei] will be toppled this year\".According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,677 deaths have been confirmed and more than 1,600 more are under review.It reports that about 19,000 protesters have been arrested.The Iranian government has imposed an internet blackout on the country since 8 January, with authorities stepping up their crackdown on protests.The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.Residents in four cities - Tehran, Karaj, Isfahan and Sanandaj - told the BBC on Friday there were no protests taking place. Security forces were still present on the streets and in public squares, some said.",

    "body": "Germany has returned two small fragments of the Bayeux Tapestry stolen by a German scientist during the Nazi occupation of France in 1941.The pieces of unembroidered fabric were discovered by historians in state archives in Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany as they sifted through the collection of German textile specialist Karl Schlabow.The fragments were later identified as part of the Bayeux Tapestry - a 70m-long (230ft) embroidery that tells the story of the Norman conquest of England in 1066.The head of the archive, Rainer Hering, presented the mayor of Bayeux with the pieces of linen on Thursday, saying it was \"obvious\" they had to be returned to France.Schlabow, who died in 1984, is assumed to have stolen the fragments, each only a few centimetres long, when he was sent to Bayeux as part of a research team to study Germany's \"ancestral heritage\" - a racist and antisemitic project run by Adolf Hitler's Nazi SS.Although Schlabow died in 1984, historians from the Schleswig-Holstein archive carried out an inventory of his collection in 2023 and discovered \"a glass plate containing pieces of fabric\", Hering told reporters in northern France.Other documents were found alongside the collection and labelling on the glass plate made it possible to identify the fragments of fabric as those coming from the Bayeux Tapestry, he added.\"For our state archives service, it was obvious that these pieces of fabric taken by the Nazis 85 years earlier had to be returned to France,\" Hering told Ici Normandie.The fragments are thought to have been removed from the underside of the tapestry, which is made up of 58 scenes covering 20 years of history with 626 characters and 202 horses. It depicts William the Conqueror becoming the first Norman king of England by seizing the English throne from Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings.The tapestry is due to go on display at the British Museum in London in September, under a controversial deal agreed between the UK and France.More than 77,000 people have signed a petition against moving the 11th-Century tapestry, arguing it is too fragile to travel.UK artist David Hockney said this week that the idea of transporting it across the Channel was \"madness\". For the renowned British artist, \"some things are too precious to take a risk with\".However, the British Museum has vowed to protect the historic tapestry. The UK government is insuring it during its loan to the British Museum for £800m. Given its significance in British and French history, the tapestry was added to Unesco's \"Memory of the World\" register in 2007.",

    "body": "10 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorGetty ImagesAdverts will soon appear at the top of the AI tool ChatGPT for some users, the company OpenAI has announced.The trial will initially take place in the US, and will affect some ChatGPT users on the free service and a new subscription tier, called ChatGPT Go.This cheaper option will be available for all users worldwide, and will cost $8 a month, or the equivalent pricing in other currencies.OpenAI says during the trial, relevant ads will appear after a prompt - for example, asking ChatGPT for places to visit in Mexico could result in holiday ads appearing.In example screenshots shared by the firm, the ads look like banners.OpenAI says they will not influence ChatGPT's responses and the firm will not share data about conversations with advertisers.It said it had decided to explore ads \"so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits\".However there is also growing speculation that the AI sector has been over-valued by keen investors and hype, and has yet to actually demonstrate much in the way of profit.Some analysts predict this \"bubble\" is unsustainable and could soon burst.Henry Ajder, an expert in AI, Deepfakes and synthetic media, said OpenAI's decision to explore ad revenue was not a surprise.\"OpenAI is a company that's seen a huge amount of growth in terms of users in the last few years but it continues to burn investor money - it is not a profit making entity,\" he said.\"And so, for this company to start actually turning a profit, it has to find more revenue sources from somewhere other than just standard paying subscribers. And for many software businesses, advertising is a revenue source which is reliable.\"OpenAIAdverts will be trialled in the US for free users and users of the new tier, ChatGPT GoThe Financial Times reported that in 2025 OpenAI operated at a loss of around  $8bn (£5.98bn) in the first six months of the year, and that only 5% of ChatGPT's 800 million users are paid subscribers.In addition to the new Go subscription tier, it already has Plus and Pro tiers, which cost $20 and $200 respectively per month in the US.ChatGPT Go was first introduced in India in 2025 before being expanded out to other countries.OpenAI was originally set up as a non-profit organisation but has increasingly turned towards a more commercial operation.The internet economy has been largely funded by advertising for more than two decades.OpenAI isn't the only AI firm considering this business model, despite boss Sam Altman once saying he hated ads and describing them as \"a last resort\".In 2025, AI firm Perplexity appointed Taz Patel in the role of \"head of advertising and shopping\", but he left the company nine months later.Google denies reports that it had approached advertisers about bringing ads to its Gemini AI tool in 2026.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAlison Holt,Social affairs editorandJames MelleyAn employment tribunal has found a group of nurses had their dignity violated, after an NHS trust allowed a transgender colleague to use the women's changing room.This judgement - whilst only binding on those directly involved in the case - will be carefully analysed for its wider implications for the NHS and beyond, especially given it deals with the fault line between opposing views on sex and gender.At the heart of the case was the question of whether the nurses' rights were infringed by County Durham and Darlington NHS Trust when it allowed Rose Henderson, a biological male who identifies as a woman, to use the female changing rooms.The panel did not criticise Rose, and all the claims related directly to them were dismissed by the panel. Claims the trust had victimised the nurses were also dismissed.However, it concluded that although a transgender person has protections from discrimination and harassment, that \"does not translate into a positive 'right' on the part of a trans woman to use the female changing room (or for that matter of a trans man to use the male changing room)\".The tribunal rooted its findings in last year's Supreme Court ruling that in the 2010 Equality Act, a woman is defined by biological sex not gender identity.As the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land you would expect that, but it is not necessarily straightforward.In December 2024, a judgement in Scotland involving another NHS nurse, Sandie Peggie, who also complained about a trans woman colleague using the female changing rooms, came to a notably different conclusion.She was found to have faced harassment from the NHS trust for a limited period for how it handled her complaint, but claims of discrimination were dismissed. Sandie Peggie is appealing against the judgement.In contrast to the Darlington ruling, the Scottish tribunal appeared to work on the basis that that a trans person had the automatic right to use facilities aligned with their gender rather than biological sex. Immediately afterwards, legal experts questioned whether there is the case law to back this up.Although neither case would normally have impact beyond those involved, it is a sign of how the similarities and differences in these judgements will be picked over.Associate professor of law at University of Oxford, Michael Foran, thinks there will be more cases like this.\"Many organisations have been led to believe that there is a legal right to access single sex spaces based on self-identification,\" he says.\"Cases such as this show that this was a misreading which disregards the rights of women as set out in both equality law and the workplace health and safety law.\"Whilst the Darlington nurses have been describing their delight at the employment tribunal finding, the NHS trust is taking time before it comments.The gender critical campaign group, Sex Matters, says the Darlington judgement is \"clear and sensible\" - and that it should be a final warning to employers to \"return to sex-based policies and rules\"Translucent, a group which campaigns for trans rights, says employers have a duty to ensure everyone is accommodated and that \"while the Supreme Court ruling \"has made it harder\" for service providers, \"most people are inclusive, and cases like this are quite rare\".And these cases add to pressure on the government to publish new guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission on what this all means for businesses who are dealing with the day-to-day practicalities of operating toilets, changing rooms and other single sex spaces.",

    "body": "7 hours agoMaia DaviesReutersZelensky called on Ukraine's allies to provide rapid shipments of missilesPresident Zelensky has called Ukraine's air defence supplies \"insufficient\", having revealed several systems were \"without missiles\" until Friday morning.\"I can say this openly because today I have those missiles,\" the president said, adding that Ukraine had received a \"substantial package\" earlier in the day.His comments follow days of intense Russian bombardment of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving thousands of people without heating and electricity during a bitterly cold winter.Schools in Kyiv will shut until February, the capital's mayor has announced, as the city continues to face severe energy shortages amid temperatures which have dropped as low as -19C.Zelensky called on Ukraine's allies to provide \"rapid deliveries\" of available missiles, and said shipments did not mean \"that winter will end for us tomorrow\".\"And it doesn't mean that tomorrow the enemy will stop bombing us,\" he wrote on social media.Ukraine relies on its Western partners for several vital air defence systems, which Zelensky said required \"constant supplies of missiles\".\"Securing these packages takes enormous effort, blood, and human lives.\"He criticised countries that \"stockpiled\" such ammunition:  \"If we are at war, we really need it. And in some countries, there is no war.\"On Friday evening, he said Ukraine had \"intelligence information\" that Russia was preparing for large-scale strikes.\"Supplies are insufficient,\" he wrote on Telegram. \"We are trying to speed things up, and it is important that our partners hear us.\"Earlier this week, Kyiv declared a state of emergency in its energy sector and appointed former prime minister Denys Shmyhal as energy minister to tackle the situation.Ukrainian officials also accused Moscow of deliberately exploiting an extraordinarily cold winter.Shmyhal told Ukraine's parliament on Friday that Moscow was \"betting it can break us through energy terror\", and ordered state companies to increase their energy imports.Thousands of energy workers are racing to restore power across the country through repairing plants and substations bombarded by Russian strikes.Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said most of the capital had been left without heating and a \"huge shortage of electricity\" for the first time in the war.He told Reuters news agency that electricity levels had dropped to less than half of what was needed.Curfews in the city, introduced after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, have been eased to allow residents to access emergency hubs providing heating and electricity.Klitschko had suggested earlier this week that residents should leave Kyiv if possible, to help ease pressure on critical resources.Also on Friday, Zelensky said Ukrainian negotiators were on their way to the US for further talks on a potential ceasefire.Saturday's talks in Miami, Florida will focus on security guarantees and a post-war recovery package for Ukraine, the country's ambassador to the US Olga Stefanishyna said.Ukraine's delegation will include the head of Zelensky's office, Kyrylo Budanov, and the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defence council, Rustem Umerov.Zelensky said he hoped the proposals would be signed with the US during next week's World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland \"if everything is finalised and if there is agreement from the American side\".Separately, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had secured a localised ceasefire agreement between Ukraine and Russia to allow repairs to the last remaining back-up power line at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.The agency said work was expected to begin in the coming days at Europe's largest nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, after the line was damaged by \"military activity\" on 2 January.Rafael Mariano Grossi, IAEA's director general, said there had been several incidents this week \"in which military activity affected nuclear safety\", adding that a deterioration of Ukraine's power grid had \"direct implications\" on nuclear safety.Meanwhile, Russian attacks continued on Friday, including in the central Ukrainian city of Nikopol, where officials said two people had been killed by \"enemy artillery fire\". Another six were injured, the officials added.",

    "body": "Ant and Dec launch their first podcast - a smart move or late to the party?15 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterSimon Jones PRHanging Out with Ant & Dec will be hosted on the pair's new digital entertainment channelAnt and Dec are to host their first podcast, as part of a new digital entertainment channel set up by the TV presenters.The podcast, titled Hanging Out with Ant & Dec, will launch later this month and see the duo catch up about their lives and take questions and comments from listeners.It is part of the pair's new Belta Box brand, which will be on platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, and will also host classic clips from their TV careers as well as \"new digital formats\".\"We asked our audience if we did a podcast what would they like it be about, and they said 'we just want you guys to hang out',\" Declan Donnelly said in a statement.\"So that's what we're doing - Ant & I don't get to hang out as much as we used to, so it's perfect for us.\"The new digital channel will host content from across the Geordie duo's long TV careersThe pair recently signed a contract extension with ITV to continue presenting shows including I'm A Celebrity, Britain's Got Talent and Limitless Win.Their push for viewers on YouTube as well as TV will allow them to \"have their cake and eat it\", said Alex Hudson, journalist and co-host of tech podcast Crashed.\"Ant and Dec have just extended their ITV contract by another three years while they try to get this company up and running,\" he said. \"So they can take their rumoured £30m contract and, even if this new company doesn't work out, will still be some of the best paid presenters in the industry.\"Hanging Out with Ant & Dec is set to release its first episode on Thursday 22 January, with further episodes every fortnight and bonus episodes every Monday.While the pair are \"late to the party\" when it comes to podcasting, it comes at a time when the digital landscape is still rapidly expanding, Hudson said.\"The global market is estimated at around £25bn and is projected to reach nearly £100bn by the end of the decade.\"The British public already feels it has a relationship with them and this allows them to talk directly with audiences and develop a different business model. \"But it's hard without the backing of traditional broadcasters and traditional advertising models, so they might struggle after the initial buzz dies down.\"'Natural next step'Ant and Dec's podcast is described as having \"no script, no agenda, and no interruptions - it's the duo catching up, reminiscing, and seeing where the conversation takes them\".Viewers and listeners will have the power to shape the conversations each week, with the pair asking the audience to ask questions and share anecdotes.Both the podcast and Belta Box are produced by Ant & Dec's own company, Mitre Studios.The Belta Box channel went live on YouTube on Friday with initial clips from the duo's earlier TV series such as Byker Grove, SM:TV and Saturday Night Takeaway.Ant McPartlin said launching the channel felt like a \"natural next step\" after the pair had \"spent our whole careers celebrating great entertainment\".The pair's move to YouTube will be as beneficial to the video platform as it is to the Geordie TV duo, according to Hudson.YouTube already dominates much of the short-form, creator-led and viral video market, he noted.\"What YouTube doesn't dominate is the Netflix-style long-form TV viewing,\" he continued. \"When MrBeast wanted to produce more serious TV content, he chose Amazon Prime rather than sticking with just YouTube.\"YouTube wants to change that. Ant and Dec has to be part of that thinking.\"The Financial Times has reported the BBC is preparing to announce a landmark new content deal with YouTubeWhile the entertainment landscape has changed beyond recognition over the past two decades, major networks and on-screen talent are still figuring out how best to make money from streaming platforms.Earlier this week, data from industry ratings body Barb suggested YouTube had overtaken the BBC for the first time at the end of last year in terms of monthly audience reach.However, YouTube was only ahead on one metric, based on audiences who watch content on any platform for three minutes. The BBC remains ahead of YouTube for consumption of longer-form content.On Friday, the Financial Times reported the BBC is gearing up to announce a new landmark content deal with YouTube, which will reportedly see the corporation make programmes for the platform for the first time.The paper said the BBC would be able to generate more money from the move by showing advertising alongside the new programmes when shown outside the UK.The BBC and YouTube have not commented on the rumoured deal.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesThe Trump administration has named US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former UK prime minister Sir Tony Blair as two of the founding members of its \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner will also sit on the \"founding executive board\", the White House said in a statement on Friday.Trump will act as chairman of the board, which forms part of his 20-point plan to end the war between Israel and Hamas.It is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza and manage its reconstruction.Also on the founding executive board are Marc Rowan, the head of a private equity firm, World Bank chief Ajay Banga and a US national security adviser, Robert Gabriel.Each member would have a portfolio \"critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success\", the White House statement said.Trump had said on Thursday that the board had been formed, calling it the \"Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place\".Further members of the board would be named in the coming weeks, the White House said.Sir Tony was UK prime minister from 1997 to 2007 and took the UK into the Iraq War in 2003. After leaving office, he served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers (the US, EU, Russia and the UN).BBC/Monika GhoshFormer UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair is a founding member of Trump's \"Board of Peace\"It comes after the announcement of a separate 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), charged with managing the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza.Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control, will head that new committee.The statement also said that Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, would be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza working with the NCAG.Trump's plan says an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will also be deployed to Gaza to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces and the White House statement said that US Major General Jasper Jeffers would head this force to \"establish security, preserve peace, and establish a durable terror-free environment\".The White House said that a separate \"Gaza executive board\" was being formed that would help support governance and includes some of the same names as the founding executive board as well as further appointees.The US peace plan came into force in October and has since entered its second phase, but there remains a lack of clarity about the future of Gaza and the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there.Getty ImagesBulgarian politician Nickolay Mladenov will represent the board \"on-the-ground\" in Gaza, the White House saysUnder phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Earlier this week Witkoff said phase two would see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.\"The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations,\" he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"However the ceasefire is fragile, with both sides accusing each other of repeated violations.Almost 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, while the Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian groups during the same period.Humanitarian conditions in the territory remain dire, according to the UN, which has stressed the need for the unrestricted flow of critical supplies.The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

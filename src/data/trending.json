    "body": "13 hours agoNardine Saad,Los AngelesandClaire KeenanReutersBritney Spears has sold the rights to her music catalogue.Pop superstar Britney Spears has sold the rights to her entire music catalogue, the BBC has learned. Spears, 44, is said to have sold to independent music publisher Primary Wave on 30 December for around $200m (£146m).The singer - whose protracted conservatorship long dictated her personal and professional life - is known for the hits ...Baby One More Time, Oops!... I Did It Again, Toxic and Gimme More.Primary Wave did not immediately respond to the BBC's requests for comment. Representatives for Spears declined to comment.In January 2024, the singer said she would \"never return to the music industry\". Her last song was a duet released with Elton John in 2022. Primary Wave has also acquired rights to the estates of Notorious BIG, Prince and Whitney Houston. Details of the sale and the exact price of Spears' catalogue have not been made public. High-profile artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, and Shakira recently sold their catalogues too. Springsteen sold his back catalogue to Sony in 2021 for $500m, and Bieber reportedly signed a $200m deal with Hipgnosis Songs Capital in 2023.The publisher was founded 20 years ago by music executive Lawrence Mestel after purchasing 50% of Kurt Cobain's portion of the Nirvana catalogue. Spears is one of the best-selling female artists, with more than 150 million records sold worldwide. Her catalogue includes nine studio albums since her debut in 1999. The sale comes after a tumultuous few years for the singer, who in 2021 ended a 13-year-long conservatorship – a legal guardianship that saw her finances and personal life controlled by her father. The singer published her memoir in 2023 titled The Woman in Me, which detailed her struggles living under the conservatorship. Her ex-husband Kevin Federline released his own memoir, You Thought You Knew, at the end of 2025. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoEllie PriceNews correspondentBBCMore than 180 survivors of abuse by the former Harrods owner Mohammed Al Fayed are currently \"engaged\" in its compensation scheme, the company has said.The luxury retailer said it has already paid out compensation to more than 50 women.The scheme, which was opened last March, will close to new submissions on 31 March.In October, Harrods said it had set aside more than £60m in its plan to compensate  victims of alleged historical abuse.The compensation scheme will award each eligible claimant damages of £200,000, though victims who agree to be assessed by a consultant psychiatrist could receive up to £385,000 in compensation plus treatment costs. Survivors who are not assessed by a psychiatrist will receive lower payments.Applications submitted by 31 March will continue to be processed after that deadline.The department store also said it will continue offering counselling support after the deadline, including from its so-called Independent Survivor Advocate.Human rights campaigner Dame Jasvinder Sanghera was appointed by Harrods for the Advocate role in 2024, promising to meet as many survivors as possible and guide them through the retailer's compensation process.Justice for Harrods Survivors, which represents some victims, said only a \"truly independent\" process could address the needs of survivors.Multiple women have accused Al Fayed, who owned the luxury store between 1985 to 2010, of rape and sexual assault. The Met Police said that 146 people have come forward to report a crime in their investigation into Al Fayed.As well as its flagship store in Knightsbridge, London, the Harrods Group operates smaller stores at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as a small chain of beauty stores. KP Law, who represents more than 260 survivors, has been critical of the Redress Scheme citing concerns Harrods retain \"complete control\" of the scheme.Tom Fletcher, a specialist lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which is supporting some victims,  said it is pleased to have secured settlements for some of the firm's clients. He said: \"Whilst no amount of money will ever be enough, the amounts of compensation recovered under the scheme recognises the significance of the abuse our clients went through while also allowing them funds to access the specialist support they require to try and move forward with their lives the best they can.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsTrent ErnstThe shootings have sent shock waves through the small townPeople in the small Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge have reacted with shock and disbelief after nine people were killed and at least 25 wounded in a shooting at a local secondary school and home. Members of the remote community, 415 miles (667 km) northeast of the western city of Vancouver, spoke of their fear and uncertainty during the school lockdown, as no-one appeared to be aware of the magnitude of what was unfolding. They described how close the community of just 2500 people was, and how devastated it would be by what had happened.\"I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,\" town mayor Darryl Krakowka told Canadian broadcaster CBC.\"I don't call them residents. I call them family,\" he added. Chris Norbury, a town councillor, was as close as anyone in Tumbler Ridge to the shooting. His wife teaches at the secondary school, his daughter attends the nearby elementary school and he works at the visitor centre just a block away.Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newsday programme, he explained how scared and anxious he felt as he waited for news of his wife.He first realised something was wrong when his daughter's school called him to say they were in lockdown. He was able to contact his wife, who was also under lockdown, but by the time he found out  - from an emergency alert - that there was an active shooter, he was unable to contact her again.\"We just had to speculate and jump into social media to see what was going on - there was a lot of speculation... but being who I am I just wanted to stay calm as best I could and wait for the facts,\" Norbury said.That proved far from easy, though.\"It was terrifying, it's hard to put into words the dread and the fear that you feel knowing that a loved one is in danger,\" he said.Meanwhile he was able to see emergency vehicles, including helicopters, coming and going from the school and a nearby medical centre.'Disturbing' photosDarian Quist, a grade 12 student at the school, was in a classroom with a teacher and about 15 students when the lockdown alarm sounded, though he believes he was in a different part of the school from the shooting. He and his classmates stayed there until the police escorted them out.\"For a while I didn't think anything was going on, but once everything was circulating and we realised something was wrong we got tables and barricaded the doors, and I believe we sat in there for two or two-and-a-half hours,\" he told CBC.He said everyone was tense and nervous. People sent him \"disturbing\" photos, he said, with \"blood and things like that\".\"I think that's when it all set in,\" he said.His mother Shelley Quist was working at the local hospital at the time. She said they only found out about the shooter half an hour after the lockdown - though she was on the phone with her son the whole time.\"It's just one of those things when you just think it's never going to happen,\" she said, adding: \"Panic was setting in until I laid eyes on [Darian].\"Norbury said that it wasn't until after 17:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after the lockdown was first announced - that people started to be released from the school and he was able to find out that his wife was safe.Quist described the departure as \"organised chaos\". \"Professionalism definitely took hold,\" he said.But even then those involved did not know the full extent of what had happened until the casualty figures were revealed.\"A lot of people are shaken up right now, especially when we were told the true numbers,\" Darian Quist said.Though the names of the victims have not yet been released, it is clear the whole town has been deeply affected.Norbury said he believed he may have known some of the children involved.\"I was a children's librarian for 10 years, and knowing that these children that I likely knew, that I likely read to... these are our friends, our friends' children have been injured, lost their life, and we just have to think how to come together as a community and rely upon each other for support,\" he said.He added: \"Crime is incredibly low here, we've never had anything like this before. It's an incredible shock that anything like this could happen. We're such a tight-knit community, we're really like a family here.\"Norbury also reflected on the effect the shooting would have on the community in the future.\"How many people will be afraid to go to school? How many will this affect for the rest of their lives? And it absolutely will, that's my fear,\" he said. \"If I could talk to those people, I'd say, don't let this define you. Please get help when you need help. We are strong and we are resilient and we will get through this\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesOatly can no longer refer to its plant-based drinks as 'oat milk'Plant-based drink maker Oatly has lost a long-running legal battle over its use of the word \"milk\" in its marketing.The Swedish company tried to trademark the slogan \"post-milk generation\" in the UK in 2021 but Dairy UK, the representative body for British dairy farmers, objected.Following rulings in several courts, the UK Supreme Court on Wednesday said Oatly could neither trademark nor use the phrase \"post-milk generation\".The long-running dispute has centred on Dairy UK's argument that, under trademark law, the term \"milk\" can only be used to refer to products that come from an animal.The Supreme Court ruled the phrase \"post-milk generation\" could confuse people over whether Oatly's products are completely milk-free or merely have a low milk content.Oatly's general manager for the UK and Ireland, Bryan Carroll, said the case was \"a way to stifle competition and is not in the interests of the British public\".\"This decision creates unnecessary confusion and an uneven playing field for plant-based products that solely benefits Big Dairy.\"Because the relevant law only applies to food products, Oatly is still allowed to sell t-shirts bearing the slogan \"post-milk generation\" which it had made before the ensuing legal battle.In November 2021, Dairy UK appealed to the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) not to let the company trademark the phrase. The IPO rejected Oatly's application to trademark the phrase.The firm took the decision to the High Court, which ruled that the IPO was wrong to conclude that consumers would be confused by the phrase.But the Court of Appeal ruled in December 2024 that the term \"milk\" can only be used to describe animal products.Following the ruling, Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK said the body was \"delighted\". The ruling, she said, \"helps ensure that long-established dairy terms continue to carry clear meaning for consumers\".Last year, the EU parliament voted to ban the use of terms such as \"oat milk\" and \"veggie burger\" — but such a ban will not come into force until it is backed by the European Commission and all 27 member states.European farmers have argued such terms mislead consumers and threaten their industry.Environmentalists have said that the ban will harm sustainability efforts and is an overreach by the meat and dairy industries.Richard May, partner at law firm Osborne Clarke, said of the Supreme Court ruling: \"It confirms that, even post-Brexit, the UK will continue to take a strict approach to the use of protected dairy terms, closely aligned with the EU regime.\"The key principle is straightforward: if a product is not derived from animal milk, it cannot be marketed using reserved dairy designations such as 'milk' or 'cheese'.\"Companies like Oatly will now likely limit their use of terms like \"dairy-free\" to \"factual\" information, rather than branding and marketing, May said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJosh ElginWestminster Magistrates' CourtGetty ImagesCharles Brohiri continued to travel without a ticket after being banned from entering Thameslink stations as part of his bail conditions A \"brazen\" rail fare dodger has been fined more than £3,600 after failing to pay for a ticket on over a hundred journeys.Charles Brohiri, 29, travelled without buying a ticket on 112 Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) journeys over a period of nearly two years. He was ordered to pay the unpaid fares and handed a three‑month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, at Westminster Magistrates' Court.Brohiri, originally from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, but who has been homeless for three years, pleaded guilty to 76 charges of failing to pay for a rail ticket, and was convicted in his absence in August 2024 of a further 36 charges.District Judge Nina Tempia said Brohiri had behaved as though he were \"invincible,\" and showed a sense of \"self-entitlement\" in believing he could evade the rules. The court heard he had continued to travel without a ticket despite being banned last April from entering Thameslink stations as part of his bail conditions.Prosecutor Lyndon Harris told the court there had also been a further 16 alleged offences since his last appearance in court on 15 January, including the day before his sentencing.Judge Tempia, who took the additional alleged offences into consideration, said his \"deliberate and repeated\" behaviour would ordinarily have justified a prison sentence, but she believed probation services could help him address underlying issues.Eleanor Curzon, for the defence, told the court Brohiri \"expressed remorse and regret\" for having continued to travel on the railway, \"particularly the period when he has been appearing before you judge\".When asked why Brohiri had continued offending, Curzon said it was \"a pattern he had gotten himself into\".PA MediaCharles Brohiri arriving at Westminster Magistrates' Court for a previous hearingThe court heard he briefly attended university and had worked as a waiter before becoming homeless and moving to London.Curzon said that Brohiri had been sleeping rough on trains, in hospitals and in libraries.She told the court he had tried to seek help from charities but struggled to engage because of a \"combination of a lack of support, a negative mental health space and not knowing how to go about maintaining support from services\".She added that Brohiri had never acted aggressively when challenged and said his decision to become sober three years ago \"demonstrated his capacity to change\".\"He reiterated to me this morning that if he is given the opportunity to work with probation they can assist him in securing accommodation and employment,\" Curzon continued.\"It is really these two factors which will put an end to Mr Brohiri's offending.\"Brohiri was ordered to pay back £3,629 in unpaid rail fares but he was not ordered to pay prosecution costs which the court heard amounted to £15,120. He was also ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work, 12 months' prohibited activity requirement - which means he must not travel on any GTR trains - and to complete rehabilitation activity requirement.\"Be under no illusion if you commit any other offences and you do not comply with the requirement on this order you will be back in court,\" the judge warned him.A spokesperson for Govia Thameslink Railway said fare evasion increased costs for passengers and \"diverted public funding away from improving services for passengers\".\"That is unfair both on taxpayers and on the vast majority of passengers who pay for their journeys.\"The operator said stepped‑up enforcement in known trouble spots, along with improved reporting tools for staff, has reduced ticketless travel on its network to its lowest level since 2022.More on this story",

    "body": "1 hour agoJaroslav LukivAFP via Getty ImagesStrict handgun laws are already in place across CanadaA deadly mass shooting at a school in British Columbia is likely to increase scrutiny of whether Canada's gun laws should be toughened to prevent further attacks. Nine people were killed and another 25 injured in the attack at Tumbler Ridge on Tuesday, in a remote part of the country that's about 415 miles (667km) north of Vancouver. The suspect was also found dead with a self-inflicted injury, authorities said.Currently, gun ownership in the Canadian provinces is largely federally regulated by the government in Ottawa, and there are stricter laws in place than in most US states.Mass shootings in Canada are rare, especially if compared with its southern neighbour.Still, gun-related killings as a percentage of all homicides are significantly higher in Canada than in England and Wales, or Australia.Tumbler Ridge mass shooting live updatesCurrent gun laws in CanadaUnder Canada's Firearms Act, guns must be kept locked and unloaded. Anyone wishing to buy a firearm is also subject to extensive background checks and needs to have a licence.Across the country, more than 2.2 million people - or 7.7% of Canada's adult population - had firearm licences, according to government statistics from 2021.An estimated 10 million firearms were in circulation in the country that year.According to a Canadian website on gun ownership, which obtained statistics from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or RCMP, there were 355,678 gun licences in British Columbia as of 2023, or about 6,240 gun licenses per 100,000 people. But the website cautioned that many people own guns without a licence, which is illegal.A national freeze on the sale and transfer of handguns has also been in place since 2022. In January, the government began a national gun buy-back programme. A federal pilot programme in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, which aimed to collect 200 firearms, had only collected 26.Mass shootings in Canada over the yearsThe latest mass shooting follows a string of others over the past decade.In the wake of the attacks, most military-grade assault-style weapons were banned in the country.In 2014, a gunman shot dead eight people, including two children, in Edmonton,  Alberta, in western Canada.One of the deadliest shootings in the country took place decades earlier - in 1989. Fourteen women were killed by a gunman in an anti-feminist attack at l'École Polytechnique university in Montreal.",

    "body": "25 minutes agoJoshua Nevett,Political reporterandNick Eardley,Political correspondentBBCLabour peer Harriet Harman was among those at the meeting with the prime ministerSenior female Labour parliamentarians have urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to appoint a woman to a new powerful role at the top of government.The prime minister faced calls to name a woman as his first secretary of state - currently a vacant post - during a meeting of female Labour MPs and peers in Parliament.Two women in the room said Sir Keir had agreed to consider the proposal, as well as making tackling misogyny one of his government's missions.Sir Keir attended the packed meeting after Prime Minister's Questions, where Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of running a \"boys' club\" in Downing Street.The prime minister's position was teetering a few days ago and the meeting was another attempt to shore up support among his MPs.He has faced calls to resign over his decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US, despite knowing about the peer's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Sir Keir's judgement is also being questioned over the peerage given to former communications chief Lord Doyle, who lost the Labour whip over his links with a convicted sex offender.Both issues came up at PMQs and Sir Keir had to confront them again during the meeting with the Women's Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) on Wednesday.The BBC has been told Sir Keir reiterated his apology for the appointment of Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US.It is understood Sir Keir said he looked forward to working with the Women's PLP on tackling misogyny and doing more to achieve cultural change.A source in the room said it had been a positive meeting and the prime minister had understood the need to end a \"boys' club\" mentality in No 10.The senior Labour figure described the prime minister as being in \"listening mode\" and described him as a \"feminist ally\" who did not want to \"mansplain\".\"He said he wanted a culture change across government,\" the source said.Labour MP Natalie Fleet, who attended the meeting, said the suggestion of appointing a female first secretary of state was put to him by former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and he had promised to \"take it away\".The first secretary of state is a role which, historically, has had similar standing and functions to that of deputy prime minister, a post currently held by David Lammy.Previous holders of the post of first secretary of state include Dominic Raab, Damian Green and Lord Mandelson, during former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government.Barbara Castle was the first woman to be appointed first secretary of state, when Harold Wilson was prime minister in the 1960s.Fleet said it would be \"incredible\" if a woman was given that role in Sir Keir's government.The Labour MP for Bolsover said that during the meeting, the prime minister committed to meeting victims of sexual violence.\"There are horrendous things that happened to girls and nobody cares and nobody listens,\" Fleet told reporters outside the meeting room.She said Sir Keir was \"the best bet that we've got\".\"He cares and he is going to deliver,\" Fleet said. \"And it's my job to hold him to account. So this feels like a real opportunity out of the worst possible situation.\"Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who was also at the meeting, said the prime minister has \"the opportunity to prove he has understood the seriousness of the situation\".She was one of the first MPs to call for the prime minister to stand down,  saying his position was untenable.At PMQs, Sir Keir defended his former chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, who resigned at the weekend over his role in pushing for Lord Mandelson to be appointed as ambassador.He said: \"I've accepted responsibility and apologised for the mistakes that I've made.\"The Conservative leader said the prime minister \"likes to claim he cares about violence against women and girls\".Badenoch said: \"The truth is he only cares about the victims when he's trying to save his own skin.\"But Sir Keir defended his government's record on protecting women and girls against violence.A source close to the prime minister rejected suggestions of a \"boys' club\" in Downing Street, saying there were a number of \"highly qualified and capable women that work in Number 10\" including cabinet ministers and special advisers \"across the whole government who are often forgotten in all of this\".",

    "body": "Dad unlawfully killed daughter in Texas shooting, coroner rules4 hours agoFacebookLucy Harrison was killed at the home of her father in Prosper, Texas, prompting a manslaughter investigationTom MullenNorth WestA British woman who was shot dead by her father while visiting his home in Texas was unlawfully killed, a coroner has ruled.Lucy Harrison, from Warrington in Cheshire, was shot in the chest on 10 January 2025 in Prosper, near Dallas. Police in the town investigated the 23-year-old's death as possible manslaughter but no criminal case was brought against Kris Harrison after a grand jury in Collin County declined to indict him. Family members were in tears during the hearing at Cheshire Coroner's Court as Coroner Jacqueline Devonish announced that she found Lucy Harrison died due to unlawful killing on the grounds of gross negligence manslaughter.The coroner said: \"To shoot her through the chest whilst she was standing would have required him to have been pointing the gun at his daughter, without checking for bullets, and pulling the trigger. \"I find these actions to be reckless.\"'Deep shock'Speaking after the hearing, Lucy Harrison's mother Jane Coates said: \"Today's outcome has finally given Lucy her voice back after what has been an unrelenting year of deep shock, grief and fight - fight with quiet focus and steely determination to allow Lucy to speak her truth with the only voice she has now.\"While we recognise an unlawful killing outcome has been decided in a coroner's court and not a criminal court, we welcome the coroner's conclusion and thank her for exploring all the evidence fairly and as fully as she could and fearlessly for Lucy.\"The inquest heard the father, described by the coroner as a functioning alcoholic, claimed the gun had gone off accidentally.Lucy Harrison's boyfriend Sam Littler, who had travelled with her to the US, had earlier told the hearing she had become upset after she and her father argued about Donald Trump, who was due to be inaugurated as president later that month.ReutersDonald Trump was inaugurated for his second presidential term 10 days after Lucy Harrison's deathLittler said about half an hour before they were expected to leave for the airport Kris Harrison took his daughter by the hand and led her from the kitchen to his ground floor bedroom, where he kept a Glock semi-automatic handgun in his bedside cabinet.The father did not attend the two-day hearing but in a statement said he had bought the weapon to give his family a \"sense of security\" and, as it was for home defence, Texas laws meant he did not need a licence.He claimed he had a conversation about guns with his daughter and she asked to see the gun, having never discussed his gun ownership with him before.But the inquest heard evidence from others that Lucy Harrison, a fashion buyer for the Boohoo clothes retailer, knew her father had a weapon in the home and disagreed with it.In the statement, Kris Harrison, who admitted drinking wine earlier in the day, said: \"As I lifted the gun to show her I suddenly heard a loud bang. I did not understand what had happened. Lucy immediately fell.\"He told police who attended the scene: \"We got it out to have a look and just as I picked it up it just went off.\"The inquest heard a grand jury in the US had determined there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone in connection with Lucy Harrison's death.More on this story",

    "body": "1 hour agoIan YoungsCulture reporterPAWarning: This story contains information some readers may find distressing.Former Strictly Come Dancing professional Robin Windsor slipped \"deeper and deeper into endless depression\" after leaving the show, actress Lisa Riley, a former dance partner, has told his inquest.Windsor, who died at the age of 44 in February 2024, was among the BBC One show's professional competitors from 2010 to 2013.He also appeared in the 2014 and 2015 Christmas specials but could not perform in the 2014 main series because of a back injury and was dropped for the 2015 series.\"It was from this moment, on to the time of his death, he kept slipping deeper and deeper into endless depression. His glow had gone,\" said Riley in a written witness statement that was read to West London Coroner's Court on Wednesday.Money and relationship problems played big parts in his \"darker days\", Riley said.The Emmerdale star recalled how the pair shared \"many, many happy times to begin with and together we did have so much fun\".They were teamed up for the 2012 series, and reprised their partnership in the 2014 Christmas special.\"To say we hit it off was an understatement. We were literally joined at the hip,\" she said.The actress added that she and Windsor built up an \"incredible trust\" and remained friends.\"He literally told me everything,\" she said. \"I trusted him and he trusted me.\"Lisa Riley and Robin Windsor danced together in the 2012 series and the 2014 Christmas specialRiley said Windsor told her of times of \"never feeling good enough\" and \"imposter syndrome\", and that he was insecure about his body and took steroids which, combined with alcohol, would put him in a bad place.One of Windsor's ex-boyfriends, singer and X Factor star Marcus Collins, said in his written statement that the dancer \"deteriorated\" in 2014.\"The day he was informed he was no longer required for Strictly really broke his spirit,\" Collins said, adding that Windsor had subsequently \"struggled to balance his mental health and finances\".From 2016 to 2024, he noted, \"his mental health was pretty compromised and relationships with friends and partners came and went\".Actor Terry Gleed, who appeared alongside Windsor in pantomime in 2023, told the court he felt his co-star was \"obsessed\" with Strictly and would often watch clips of the show.\"He was looking at his phone continuously, and I could feel he really wanted to be there... he missed it dearly,\" Gleed told jurors.Choreographer Scott Coldwell, who worked with Windsor on a live show called Here Come The Boys, said the dancer told him several times that he was \"desperate\" to go back on Strictly.Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden, who was partnered with Windsor on Strictly in 2013, said he \"always did his best to present a bright and sunny face\".\"He always appeared positive and constructive,\" she said, \"but during my time dancing with him he experienced relationship difficulties, breaking off an engagement and feeling alone. I saw him tearful and distracted at times.\"But, Meaden added, other than his back pain, she \"was unaware during our time dancing together of any greater issue\".Windsor, from Ipswich, also partnered Patsy Kensit and Anita Dobson in the main show, and Sara Cox and Alison Hammond in Christmas specials.Earlier this week, the coroner's court heard that Windsor had left a note saying his problems started when he lost his job on Strictly, and referenced struggles with loneliness and relationships, among the triggers for his troubles.Former Strictly executive producer Louise Rainbow told the inquest that three dancers, including Windsor, were dropped ahead of the 2015 series because bosses wanted to refresh up the line-up, according to the Sun.She said he was \"very disappointed\" and \"understandably upset\" when she broke the news, but that his reaction \"wasn't that different\" to the other dancers, and that she has no record of his mental state being brought up in a meeting with him and his agent, the paper reported.She described him as \"a joy to work with\" and a \"lovely man\".The inquest into his death will continue this week.The BBC has been asked for comment.If you are suffering distress or despair and need support, a list of organisations that can help is available at bbc.co.uk/actionline.",

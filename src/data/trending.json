    "body": "The 2025 Formula 1 season is heading for a hectic climax with three races on successive weekends to decide the winner of the drivers' championship. Lando Norris has a commanding 24-point lead over McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri heading into the Las Vegas Grand Prix, which takes place under the lights on the Strip at 04:00 GMT on Sunday. That is followed by grands prix in Qatar, from 28-30 November, and then Abu Dhabi, from 5-7 December.  Before the race in Vegas, BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.Are Ferrari chair John Elkann's comments that Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc need to concentrate \"on driving and talk less\" after their poor results this season unfair? - JordanJohn Elkann certainly caused a stir with his remarks the day after the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.It's not clear what exactly provoked them, as Ferrari did not say.But given they came less than 24 hours after Hamilton had said that his run of results in his first season at Ferrari were \"a nightmare, and I have been living it for a while\", it would not be unreasonable to suppose the seven-time champion might have been in Elkann's mind.As far as Hamilton goes, this is typical of the sort of emotional remark he makes when he has had a disappointing race.Remember when he said after Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying that he was \"just useless\" and \"drove terribly\" and Ferrari \"probably need to change driver\"?He didn't mean that then, not really. And Brazil should be seen in that context. After all, Hamilton went on to say: \"I believe there is something extraordinary up ahead in my life and in my destiny. I truly still believe in this team and what we can achieve together.\"Which is, one might think, exactly the sort of message Elkann would want to hear.The issue many people had with Elkann's comments was that their accuracy was questionable.He singled out the mechanics for praise for \"basically winning the championship with their performance and everything that has been done on the pit stops\", on the basis they are leading the rankings for average pit-stop time., external Fair enough, but then he said: \"If we look at our engineers, there's no doubt that the car has improved.\"Well, perhaps it has. But not relative to the opposition. Ferrari were 0.372 seconds off the pace on average in qualifying in the first half of the season, and so far in the second they are 0.472secs off.As for the drivers, yes, Hamilton has been through the mill this year, but his performances have improved over the season, even if Brazil was a difficult race for him.But Leclerc has been outstanding. And while he has pointed out regularly that the car is not quick enough, no-one would disagree with that, not even Elkann.Ferrari are in F1 to win. Nothing less is good enough. That's just a fact. And Leclerc has been steadfastly loyal to the team.Ferrari are briefing that Elkann's remarks should be seen as a spur for the team to do better. But it's hard to see how Leclerc and Hamilton would take especially kindly to them, however well meaning they were.The grid seems to be as close in performance as I have ever seen. Has F1 succeeded in creating a situation where each driver's performance over a weekend is a bigger differentiator than in the past, and does the upcoming regulation change threaten this balance? - MattIt stands to reason that if the cars are closer in performance, then the driver would make more of a difference.Whether that is more a factor now than at any other time is a difficult question to answer because there are a lot of aspects of F1 now that work in some ways to reduce the difference between drivers.Telemetry, for example, allows drivers who are not as naturally able to find the limit a chance to catch up over a weekend.You could see this, for example, at Alpine when Fernando Alonso partnered Esteban Ocon.At the start of a weekend, Alonso would typically be considerably quicker than Ocon, who would inch closer with each session until he was competitive in qualifying and sometimes able to beat him.Something else to factor in is that many would argue that the depth of talent at the top of F1 right now is as good as it has ever been, if not better.In Hamilton, Max Verstappen and Alonso, there are three drivers who would be on anyone's list of all-time greats.In addition, Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri, George Russell and Leclerc are all exceptional, without question.That's at least seven world-class drivers in F1 at the same time.Any major regulation change inevitably increases both the gaps between teams, and the risk that one team will steal a march on the rest of the field, as happened in 2022 with Red Bull and 2014 with Mercedes.It would be no surprise if this happened again in 2026. At the same time, there are a lot of very high calibre teams in F1 now, so it should not take too long for the grid to close up again.As the season nears the end, the rookies are increasingly showing their talent. Is there an argument to allow more testing in current cars for new drivers than the current regulations offer? Oliver Bearman, Kimi Antonelli and Isack Hadjar really look settled and in a good place. - ChrisWell, you could argue that there is no need to change the testing regulations as Antonelli, Bearman and Hadjar have all proved their talent without the need for it!There is no appetite in F1 to increase testing allowances. Testing is expensive.Having said that, there is an acceptance that rookie drivers could do with more opportunities to experience F1.That's why the rules were changed this year to force teams to run rookies in two sessions per car - a total of four for the season.And it's why teams have started running young drivers in cars from previous years - so called testing of previous cars (TPC) and testing of historic cars (THC).Antonelli, for example, did an extensive TPC programme last year, and this is becoming increasingly common as a way of preparing rookies for F1 debuts.Are Aston Martin the team to watch next season with Adrian Newey in charge of the design of next year's car? - IanThe truth is no-one knows what the competitive order will be next year, and no-one will know until the first race of the season.Newey has a strong record when it comes to regulation changes. He aced the ones in 1998 with McLaren, 2009 with Red Bull (once the controversial advantage of Brawn's double diffuser had been neutralised), and in 2022 with Red Bull again.In 1998, he had officially joined McLaren only in September of the previous year. With Aston Martin, he has had six more months than that, albeit F1 is a lot more complex now.Of course, the whole of F1 is waiting with interest to see how Newey gets on with Aston Martin.  On the engine side, Honda, which will become sole factory partner to Aston Martin, clearly knows what it's doing.Aston Martin's lead driver is pretty handy, as well.But success in F1 tends to come from stability. And stable is the last thing Aston Martin have been in recent years.There have been a dizzying number staff changes at senior levels, and they are continuing to this day.A new leadership structure has to bed down. Andy Cowell has only been chief executive officer for a little over a year, and Newey did not join until March this year. Enrico Cardile was signed from Ferrari in July 2024, but took on his role as chief technical officer only in August.In many ways, in those circumstances, it would be a miracle if Aston Martin were competitive next year. But, well, Newey…",

    "body": "15 minutes agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterInvestigations have been opened into eight companies, including ticket resellers and driving schools, by the UK's competition regulator as part of a review of online pricing practices. The cases are the first launched by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) under new consumer protection powers.The companies being investigated are StubHub, Viagogo, AA Driving School, BSM Driving School, Gold's Gym, Wayfair, Appliances Direct and Marks Electrical. The CMA is also writing to 100 businesses across 14 sectors to outline its concern about their use of additional fees and sales tactics.CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said: \"At a time when household budgets are under constant pressure and we're all hunting for the best deal possible, it's crucial that people are able to shop online with confidence, knowing that the price they see is the price they'll pay, and any sales are genuine.\"The announcement comes after a major review which has been ongoing since April, looking at more than 400 businesses across the economy, to review whether rules on price transparency are being met.Under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act introduced last year, the CMA has powers to tackle anti-competitive behaviour.It can now decide if consumer laws have been broken - rather than having to go through the courts.It can order businesses to pay compensation to affected customers, and fine companies up to 10% of global turnover.The CMA has said it is looking into practices including pressure selling, drip pricing, and misleading countdown clocks as part of its investigations.Drip pricing happens when shoppers are shown an initial price for an item or service on a website, only to find additional fees are revealed later in the checkout process.The 100 companies the CMA has contacted operate in a range of sectors, including holidays (including package travel), homeware retailers, rail travel, parking and airport parking, bus and coach travel, luggage storage providers, cinemas, live event tickets, food and drink delivery companies, letter and parcel delivery, gyms and fitness, fashion, and online vouchers.The CMA outlined the reasons for its investigation into the eight firms: StubHub and Viagogo are being investigated for \"mandatory additional charges\" applied when consumers buy tickets AA Driving School and BSM Driving School are being investigated over their presentation of mandatory fees on these sites - and if the fees are displayed at the start of the purchasing process Gold's Gym is under investigation for how it displays a one-off joining fee for its annual membership - and concerns about it introducing \"it part way through the sign-up process and not including it in advertised membership costs\", the CMA saidWayfair is being investigated over whether time-limited sales ended when it said they would. Marks Electrical is being investigated over whether customers are automatically opted-in to additional services, and Appliances Direct is being investigated for both of these practices ",

    "body": "Dan Wootton denies High Court claim that he catfished 'former colleague'8 hours agoLizo MzimbaEntertainment correspondentGetty ImagesDan Wootton denies the allegations made against himBroadcaster and journalist Dan Wootton has responded to a court claim against him, denying that he catfished a man who says he was a former colleague.Earlier this year, the man filed a case claiming that in 2009 he was tricked by Wootton into sending him explicit photographs of himself as well as an explicit video.He says Wootton did this by sending him sexualised messages, pretending to be a woman called Maria Joseph.In documents filed at the High Court, Wootton denies ever communicating \"via any medium\" with the man, who has been granted anonymity by the court.Wootton also denies that he \"ever has been in possession\" of any \"explicit photographs or video\" portraying the man.Explicit photos and videoThe anonymous claimant has previously told the court that in 2009 Wootton communicated with him via email, SMS and Facebook. The man says that at the time he believed he was communicating with a woman called Maria Joseph, and did not know that he was, in fact, communicating with Wootton, according to the claim.The man says that the messages soon became \"sexualised and flirtatious\", and that Wootton sent him photographs of a female which, he claims, Wootton falsely pretended were of the woman the claimant thought he had been communicating with.He says that some of the photographs showed the female partially or fully naked.The man also said Wootton sent him a video of a man and a woman having sex, again pretending that the female in the video was the woman whom the anonymous claimant thought he was communicating with.Wootton denies the claimsIn documents filed recently at the High Court, Wootton said it was denied that he \"communicated with the claimant via any medium - including email, SMS or Facebook; and denied that he sent the claimant any images or videos\".The anonymous man also previously said in his claim that believing that he was communicating with a woman, he responded to the messages in a flirtatious and sexualised manner.He said Wootton (pretending to be Maria Joseph) encouraged him to send explicit photographs of himself. The man added that \"in the induced belief that he was communicating with Maria Joseph, an unknown female who was interested in a sexual relationship\", and who had already sent explicit images of herself, he was \"persuaded to and did send\" explicit photographs of himself as well as an explicit video.Wootton says in court documents it is denied that he \"was or ever has been in possession of any flirtatious or sexualised messages from the claimant, or explicit photographs or video portraying the claimant\".He also said in the documents that the anonymous claimant did not believe that the recipient of his messages was called Maria Joseph. Wootton added that the claimant stated to Maria Joseph: \"Maria (if that is really your name)... we are in a catch 22. i can't play without finding this out. won't tell them as i'm not gonna advertise the fact i have apparently started to chatting to hot strangers on the internet. or tell me your real name then? [sic]\".Pain, injury and humiliationThe anonymous claimant is suing Wootton, saying that he has suffered pain, injury, humiliation and hurt to his feelings. And that he has sustained loss and damage because of Wootton's actions.He says that he has suffered from major depressive order and use of alcohol.Wootton has said that he does not accept that the anonymous claimant has suffered \"any injury as a result of any communication of messages, images, and/or videos between him and 'Maria Joseph'.\"He has denied that he and the man were former colleagues, and said the man's claim should not be allowed, because any case should have been brought years before.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNada Tawfik,North America correspondent, and Dearbail JordanThe UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza.Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute. The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained.  Adopting it was an \"important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire\", a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands. The Palestinian armed group wrote on Telegram after the resolution passed that the plan \"imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject\".\"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,\" it added.Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the council that the ISF would be \"tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians\".The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid.Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force.Trump called the Security Council vote \"historic\" and said it was a way of \"acknowledging and endorsing\" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair the board. \"This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for.Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text.The UN secretary general's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to \"translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground\" and lead to \"a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution\". The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution.The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented \"urgently and immediately\".Russia and China did not exercise the vetoes they possess, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it.Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution.The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a \"fragile, fragile first step\".Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas that had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "12 minutes agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesReselling tickets to live events for a profit is set to be banned by the government.Ministers are expected to announce the plan in a bid to tackle touts and resale sites which offer tickets at several times' face value.Restricting ticket touts was one of the Labour government's election pledges, as fans complained of massively inflated prices for resale tickets for music and sporting events.The decision comes a week after dozens of artists including Sam Fender, Dua Lipa and Coldplay urged Sir Keir Starmer to protect fans from exploitation.The move, which could be announced on Wednesday, comes after the open letter by some of the biggest names in music.The music stars urged the prime minister to stop the \"extortionate and pernicious\" websites that exploit fans.Other signatories included consumer watchdog Which? the Football Supporters' Association and groups representing the music and theatre industries, venues, and ticket retailers.According to analysis by the Competition and Markets Authority, tickets currently sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%.Investigations by Trading Standards have previously uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost.Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said it was \"great news for music and sports fans\", adding the plan would \"rein in professional touts and put tickets back in the hands of real fans\".She urged the government to \"show that the price cap is a priority by including the necessary legislation in the King's Speech\".Ticketmaster's parent company Live Nation Entertainment said it already limits resale in the UK to face value prices and described the reported plan as \"another major step forward for fans\".Resale sites like Viagogo and Stubhub have previously claimed that a price cap could push customers towards unregulated sites and social media, putting them at increased risk of fraud.'Pay through the nose'Tom Kiehl, chief executive of UK Music, a collective body that represents the interests of the industry, said that a cap on secondary ticket prices was now needed in order to protect fans from \"exorbitant\" prices.\"The music industry itself is worth £8 billion to the economy, and relies on that strong relationship between music fans and and the artist,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday.\"And what you have at the moment is the resale market, which isn't working.\"Housing secretary Steve Reed told BBC Breakfast touts making profits at the expense of fans was \"such an important issue\" as it was \"hugely damaging to individuals having to pay through the nose for tickets\".He stressed the government is \"committed to outlawing it\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterThe UK tax office took a \"cavalier\" approach to child benefit checks when it decided to strip payments from thousands of claimants after wrongly assuming they had permanently relocated out of the UK, a group of MPs have said.Payments stopped when HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) ceased cross-checking travel records with claimants' tax data to prove they were in the UK. Treasury Select Committee chair Dame Meg Hillier said it had made a \"costly error\" by dropping key assessments.HMRC boss John-Paul Marks apologised and said several changes had been made to improve the process including reinstating employment checks.Writing to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Marks said by the end of October,  about 15% or more than 3,600 of the 23,794 claimants who were flagged as potentially ineligible due to their travel history, were confirmed to still qualify for child benefit.In September, HMRC began a crackdown on child benefit fraud which it believes could save £350m over the next five years.Child benefit is paid to 6.9m families but runs out after eight weeks living outside the UK. Many people affected complained HMRC had stopped their money after they went on holiday for just a short time. In some cases benefits were stopped because the tax office had evidence of a claimant leaving the UK, but not returning.The HMRC's pilot programme used Home Office data on passengers departing the UK, as well as other tax payments such as PAYE to identify whether a claimant had arrived back in the UK.Mr Marks said the additional cross-checks against UK tax and payroll data were dropped after the pilot was extended, in order to \"streamline the process\".Dame Meg said: \"HMRC is absolutely right to look at innovative ways to fight fraud and error in our system.\"I'm afraid, though, that it appears they have been cavalier with people's finances, making the arbitrary decision to remove necessary checks and causing a mess they are now forced to clean up.\"Mr Marks said he apologised to thousands of claimants who stopped receiving funds because of this \"streamlining\".The HMRC chief executive also outlined plans to give claimants at least one month to provide proof they are eligible for the benefit if travel data suggests they are no longer in the UK, and payments will not be paused at the start of an investigation.Welcoming the apology, Dame Meg warned MPs would question HMRC in the new year about \"the lessons they have learned from this mistake\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoNardine Saadin Los AngelesUS film superstar Tom Cruise has received his first-ever Oscar statuette.Cruise, 63, accepted an honorary Oscar at the annual Governors Awards in Hollywood alongside singer-philanthropist Dolly Parton, choreographer Debbie Allen and production designer Wynn Thomas.\"Making films is not what I do, it is who I am,\" the four-fold Oscar nominee said on Sunday, accompanying his long-awaited Academy Awards honour with an acceptance speech about his love of cinema.The Top Gun and Mission: Impossible actor paid tribute to filmmakers in front of and behind the lens, those he has worked with during his 45-year career, as well as the power of the movies.Upon taking the stage, Cruise received a minutes-long standing ovation and raucous round of applause from film luminaries in the audience, including Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jerry Bruckheimer.Filmmaker Alejandro G Iñárritu, who is directing an upcoming Cruise film, presented the actor with the Governors Award. \"The cinema, it takes me around the world,\" Cruise said in his speech. \"It helps me to appreciate and respect differences. It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. \"And no matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, we dream together. And that is the power of this art form. \"And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.\"Cruise made his film debut in 1981 and was previously nominated for best actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire. He was also nominated as best supporting actor in the film Magnolia and for producing Top Gun: Maverick.The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences selected Cruise for his \"incredible commitment to our filmmaking community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community\", the organisation said.The Risky Business actor told the ceremony that cinema made the world much larger than the one that he knew as a child. \"It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.\"The actor, who famously performs his own stunts, has also been a fervent advocate for cinema as the streaming industry and social media compete for viewers' time and attention.\"I want you to know that I will always do everything I can to help this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful - hopefully without too many more broken bones.\"Notably, earlier this year Cruise was reportedly set to be recognised by US President Donald Trump when he announced his picks for this year's Kennedy Center honours but the actor declined due to scheduling conflicts.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGetty ImagesPrincess Elizabeth was the first of many royal children to enjoy playing in Y Bwthyn BachOnce described as the \"most glamorous Wendy house ever\", Y Bwthyn Bach became a memorable childhood feature for generations of the Royal Family.The miniature two-storey thatched cottage was gifted to a young Princess Elizabeth in 1932 by the people of Wales.It was installed in the grounds of her family's then home, Royal Lodge in Windsor, and has remained there ever since, most recently in the care of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has lived in the mansion since 2004.But with the late Queen's third child stripped of his titles and evicted from the royal residence, what does the future hold for the cottage - and could it even be returned to Wales?Getty ImagesKing George VI and Queen Elizabeth with Princesses Margaret and The Queen Mother at Y Bwthyn Bach in 1936Y Bwthyn Bach – Welsh for The Little Cottage – was built in Cardiff and presented to Princess Elizabeth's parents, the then Duke and Duchess of York, for their daughter's sixth birthday.Designed by architect Edmund Willmott, the cottage was built by Welsh craftsmen from materials left over from the construction of Llandough Hospital in Vale of Glamorgan, which opened in 1933.It was a carefully planned miniature version of a real-life house, with four 5ft-high rooms – two upstairs and two downstairs.It even included its own working telephone, electric cooker, fridge and running water in the kitchen, luxuries even for real homes in the 1930s.\"It's called a cottage but it was more like a replica of a very comfortable house,\" said historian Dr Elin Jones.Museum WalesThe cottage was assembled in Wales before being transported in its entirety to Royal Lodge in Windsor\"It's an enchanting place and I remember seeing pictures of it when I was a child, and seeing, at the time, Prince Charles and Princess Anne playing in what looked like a fantastic Wendy House,\" said Dr Jones.At the time of the gift, Elizabeth's parents were the Duke and Duchess of York, before her father ascended to the throne as George VI, following his brother Edward VIII's abdication.Custody of the cottage later passed to Andrew when he was Duke of York and he reportedly paid for its upkeep, while his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie were among the next generation of royals to enjoy it.Princess Beatrice oversaw a refurbishment of the cottage and later described it as the \"most glamorous Wendy house ever\" in a BBC documentary celebrating Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee.\"Granny and her sister [Princess Margaret] played here growing up,\" she said at the time. \"We have been lucky enough to play here, and cousins and second cousins.\"Princess Beatrice showed Andrew Marr around Y Bwthyn Bach for a BBC seriesBut with the removal of Andrew's titles, the future of the cottage is unclear.Buckingham Palace confirmed to the BBC that ownership of Y Bwthyn Bach currently sits with King Charles III.\"Both the Royal Family and the governments of England and Wales have other things to think about, which are rather more pressing and important than a child's plaything,\" said Dr Jones.\"But it could be argued that the best place for this little cottage… might be for it to come back to Wales and go to St Fagans as part of the history of our country.\"The house is an interesting expression of the loyalty felt by Welsh people towards the Royal family for centuries.\"But those ties are \"weakening, loosening, because of devolution and the current changes in society\", the historian said.Museum WalesA replica of Y Bwthyn Bach has been kept by the Museum WalesDr Jones added: \"I think Y Bwthyn Bach is a fossil, really. It's historically interesting, you could argue that it is a part of Welsh history which might be better placed in a museum in Wales, like so many other relics of our past.\"Royal enthusiast Anne Daley, from Cardiff, hopes the cottage will continue to be used by younger members of the family rather than risk falling into disuse.\"It's just another cottage that's now empty – how many other are empty on that estate now?\" she said.\"What about the Prince of Wales and Catherine? I wonder if their children would play in it.

    "body": "Don't blindly trust what AI tells you, says Google's Sundar Pichai3 hours agoFaisal Islam,Economics editor and Rachel Clun,Business reporterGetty ImagesPeople should not \"blindly trust\" everything AI tools tell them, the boss of Google's parent company Alphabet has told the BBC.In an exclusive interview, chief executive Sundar Pichai said that AI models are \"prone to errors\" and urged people to use them alongside other tools.Mr Pichai said it highlighted the importance of having a rich information ecosystem, rather than solely relying on AI technology.\"This is why people also use Google search, and we have other products that are more grounded in providing accurate information.\"While AI tools were helpful \"if you want to creatively write something\", Mr Pichai said people \"have to learn to use these tools for what they're good at, and not blindly trust everything they say\".He told the BBC: \"We take pride in the amount of work we put in to give us as accurate information as possible, but the current state-of-the-art AI technology is prone to some errors.\"'A new phase'The tech world has been awaiting the latest launch of Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, which is starting to win back market share from ChatGPT.From May this year, Google began introducing a new \"AI Mode\" into its search, integrating its Gemini chatbot which is aimed at giving users the experience of talking to an expert.At the time, Mr Pichai said the integration of Gemini with search signalled a \"new phase of the AI platform shift\". The move is also part of the tech giant's bid to remain competitive against AI services such as ChatGPT, which have threatened Google's online search dominance.His comments back up BBC research from earlier this year, which found that AI chatbots inaccurately summarised news stories.OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini and Perplexity AI were all given content from the BBC website and asked questions about it, and the research found the AI answers contained \"significant inaccuracies\".In his interview with the BBC, Mr Pichai said there was some tension between how fast technology was being developed and how mitigations are built in to prevent potential harmful effects.For Alphabet, Mr Pichai said managing that tension means being \" bold and responsible at the same time\".\"So we are moving fast through this moment. I think our consumers are demanding it,\" he said.The tech giant has also increased its investment in AI security in proportion with its investment in AI, Mr Pichai added.\"For example, we are open-sourcing technology which will allow you to detect whether an image is generated by AI,\" he said.Asked about recently uncovered years-old comments from tech billionaire Elon Musk to OpenAI's founders around fears the now Google-owned DeepMind could create an AI \"dictatorship\", Mr Pichai said \"no one company should own a technology as powerful as AI\".But he added there were many companies in the AI ecosystem today.\"If there was only one company which was building AI technology and everyone else had to use it, I would be concerned about that too, but we are so far from that scenario right now,\" he said.",

    "body": "9 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterWatch: Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood says UK must restore \"order and control\" over bordersHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood has defended sweeping changes to the UK's asylum system, telling MPs the current situation is \"out of control and unfair\". Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: \"If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.\"Under the plans, refugee status will become temporary, guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers will end and new capped \"safe and legal routes\" into the UK will be created.Some Labour MPs expressed concerns, with Nadia Whittome calling the plans \"dystopian\" and \"shameful\", but the Conservatives gave the measures a cautious welcome. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the proposals were \"positive baby steps\". However, she warned that unless the UK left the European Convention on Human Rights, Mahmood's efforts would be \"doomed to fail\".Badenoch urged the home secretary to work with the Conservatives, saying she may find their votes would \"come in handy\" if Labour backbenchers did not support the changes.Over the past year, the government has been forced to backtrack on some of its policies - including cuts to welfare and the winter fuel payment - after objections from its own MPs. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson welcomed the introduction of new safe and legal routes - but accused the home secretary of \"stoking division by using immoderate language\". Mahmood hit back angrily, telling the MP: \"I wish I had the privilege of walking around this country and not seeing the division that the issue of migration and the asylum system is creating across this country.\"She said she regularly faced racist abuse - using a racial slur she said is used against her - as well as being told to \"go back home\". So far, around 20 Labour MPs have criticised the plans. Whittome, the MP for Nottingham East, accused the government of \"ripping up the rights and protections of people who've endured imaginable trauma\".Folkestone and Hythe MP, and immigration lawyer, Tony Vaughan said making refugee status temporary would create a \"situation of perpetual limbo and alienation\".Richard Burgon said the measures were \"morally wrong\" and would \"push away Labour voters\".\"Why not recognise that now rather than in another few months and have to make a U-turn,\" the MP for Leeds East said.Other Labour MPs expressed support for Mahmood. Chris Murray told BBC Radio 5 Live the system had to be fair \"otherwise it'll collapse, and there's nothing progressive about letting that happen\".MP for Blackley and Middleton South, Graham Stringer, said the home secretary was \"going down the right track\".He said she would reach a \"compromise\" with Labour MPs but added: \"It might all be for naught if we don't get out of the European Convention on Human Rights.\"Speaking to the BBC later, Mahmood said changing the system was a \"moral mission\" for her.\"If we don't win this argument… we will lose public support for having an asylum system at all and therefore we'll lose something brilliant about this country.\"I'm not willing to put public support for having an asylum system at risk.\"She acknowledged that some Labour MPs had concerns but insisted \"the vast majority of my colleagues agree with me\". Home secretary says she been called racial slursSo far this year 111,800 people have claimed asylum in the UK - 39% arrived in a small boat, while 37% arrived by legal means before claiming asylum. The government says its plans are aimed at reducing the number of people coming to the UK and increasing removals of people who do not have a legal right to be in the country. The Home Office published the changes in a 30-page document and a few hours later Mahmood presented them to the House of Commons. Under the proposals, people granted refugee status will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, with their status reviewed every 30 months - half the current time period.People could be returned to their home country, when it is deemed safe to do so. The amount of time refugees will have to be in the UK before being allowed to apply for permanent residence will be quadrupled from five years to 20. Families with children who have been refused asylum will be offered incentives to leave but could be forcibly removed if they refuse to go voluntarily.Asylum seekers with income or assets would have to contribute to the cost of their stay in the UK. Mahmood told MPs this would \"end the absurdity where an asylum seeker receiving £800 a month from his family and an Audi was receiving free housing at the taxpayer's expense and the courts judged we could do nothing about it\". Home Office sources have pushed back against suggestions asylum seekers could have items of sentimental value, such as wedding rings, confiscated to pay for their accommodation.In order to make it easier to remove failed asylum seekers, the government intends to change the way the European Convention of Human Rights and Modern Slavery Act is applied.Mahmood also threatened to stop granting visas to people from three African countries - Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia - unless those governments improved co-operation on deportations. Setting out her plans for capped safe and legal routes, Mahmood said voluntary and community organisations would be given \"greater involvement\" in receiving and supporting new arrivals. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage praised Mahmood's \"strong language\" and suggested she was auditioning to join his party. However, he said he had \"serious doubts\" her plans would survive objections from Labour backbenchers or the European Court of Human Rights. Zack Polanski, the Green Party leader of England and Wales, told BBC Newsnight: \"Every single Labour MP needs to look to their conscience. \"This is extreme, this is inhumane and this is a government of cowards. \"They went for pensioners, they went for the disabled and now they are going for people fleeing war and conflict.\"Enver Solomon of the Refugee Council charity said tightening the system would not deter people \"fleeing for their lives\". He said people were not coming to the UK because of the asylum rules but because they spoke English or had familial ties or community connections in the country.\"We have those communities because of our historical links and our past history as a big colonial nation,\" he added.",

    "body": "14 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporter PA MediaHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood has unveiled what has been billed as the biggest changes to tackle illegal migration \"in modern times\".The package, modelled on the stricter approach brought in by Denmark's centre-left government, makes refugee status temporary, narrows the appeal process and threatens visa bans on countries that block returns.Here's what we know:Refugee status to become temporaryPeople granted asylum in the UK will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, with their status reviewed every 30 months.This means people could be returned to their home country if it is judged \"safe\".The scheme mirrors the approach in Denmark, where refugees get two-year permits and must reapply when they expire.The government says it has already started supporting people to return to Syria voluntarily, following the toppling of the Assad regime.It will now start exploring forced returns to Syria and other countries where people have not routinely been removed to in recent years.Refugees will also need to be resident in the UK for 20 years before they can apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain -  up from the current five years.Meanwhile, the government will create a new \"work and study\" visa route, and encourage refugees to find employment or begin education in order to switch onto this route and earn settlement more quickly.Only those on this work and study route will be able to sponsor family members to join them in the UK.Human rights law overhaulThe home secretary also plans to end the process of allowing multiple appeals in asylum cases and replacing it with a single, consolidated appeal where all grounds must be raised at once. A new independent appeals body will be created, staffed by trained adjudicators and supported by early legal advice.To do this, the government will introduce a law to change how the right to family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is applied in migration court cases.Only those with immediate relatives, like children or parents, will be able to remain in the UK in future.A greater weight will be given to the public interest in removing foreign offenders and people who entered illegally. The government will also narrow the application of Article 3 of the ECHR, which bans inhuman or degrading treatment.Ministers say the current interpretation of the law allows multiple appeals against refusals for asylum - including serious criminals having their deportation blocked because their healthcare needs cannot be met.The Modern Slavery Act will be tightened to curb last‑minute trafficking claims used to halt removals by requiring asylum seekers to disclose all relevant information early. Any information disclosed later will be treated as less credible.Ending housing and financial supportMahmood will revoke the legal duty to provide asylum seekers with support, ending guaranteed housing and weekly pay.Support would still be available for \"those who are destitute\" but will be withheld from those with permission to work who do not, and from people who break the law or defy removal directions. Those who \"have deliberately made themselves destitute\" will also be denied support.Under plans, asylum seekers with assets will be required to contribute to the cost of their accommodation. This echoes Denmark's approach where asylum seekers must use savings to pay for their accommodation and authorities can seize assets at the border.UK Home Office sources have ruled out confiscating sentimental items like wedding rings, but Home Office Minister Alex Norris has suggested that cars and e-bikes could be targeted.The government has previously pledged to end the use of hotels to hold asylum seekers by 2029, which official figures show cost the government £5.77m per day last year.The government is also consulting on plans to end the current system where families whose asylum claims have been refused continue receiving housing and financial support until their youngest child turns 18. Ministers say the current system creates a \"perverse incentive\" to remain in the UK without status. Instead, families will be offered financial assistance to return voluntarily, but if they refuse, enforced removal will follow.New safe and legal routesAlongside tightening access to refugee status, the UK would create new legal routes to the UK, with an annual cap on numbers.Under the changes, volunteers and community groups will be able to sponsor individual refugees, echoing the \"Homes for Ukraine\" scheme where Britons hosted Ukrainians fleeing war.The government will also expand the work of the Displaced Talent Mobility pilot, set up in 2021, to encourage businesses to sponsor at-risk people from around the world to come to the UK to help fill skills gaps.The home secretary will set an annual cap on arrivals via these routes, based on local capacity. But those arriving on the legal routes will be on a streamlined ten-year route to settlement.Visa bansVisa penalties will be applied to countries who fail to co-operate with the returns policies, including an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they takes back its citizens who are in the UK illegally.The UK has already identified three African countries it plans to penalise if their governments do not improve co-operation on removals.The governments of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo will have a month to start co-operating before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed, the Home Office said on Monday. Increased use of technologyThe government is also planning to roll out new technologies to strengthen enforcement.Trials of AI-driven technology to verify the age of asylum seekers, particularly those claiming to be children, will be rolled out more widely.Alongside this, the government plans to introduce a digital ID by the end of Parliament. This will allow more accurate right-to-work checks by employers and make it harder for illegal workers to use fraudulent documents, the government argues.",

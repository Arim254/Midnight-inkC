    "body": "5 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and media editorShumeet Banerji is not a household name. In the three years, 10 months and 14 days that he spent on the BBC board, Banerji kept his thoughts on BBC matters firmly out of the public domain.Now he is making headlines. His resignation is the latest blow to the corporation, and it looks timed to add to the pressure.Banerji's role on the board was due to end on 31 December anyway but he has instead resigned early, three days before other board members are due to face a committee of MPs - and nearly two weeks after the BBC lost its director general and its CEO of news.The resignation, fairly or not, looks like a direct criticism of the BBC's chair Samir Shah.Banerji, according to an insider, was known to be angry that Shah was - in his view - weak in not challenging a number of other board members and their assertion about systemic bias at BBC News.In this characterisation, the four political appointees to the board - Shah is the fifth - have banded together around the view that the BBC too often suffers from liberal groupthink, and the chair has been unable, or unwilling, to steer his board to a place of real consensus.In the end, after all the drama of the past few weeks - the leaked memo, the resignations, the apology over the Panorama edit and the threat of a defamation suit by Donald Trump - it boils down to one simple question. Is BBC News institutionally biased?Deborah Turness and Tim Davie reject that. So does Shah. While acknowledging mistakes have been made, he told me \"the BBC News DNA and culture is to be impartial, to provide the best news we can and the most trustworthy news we can\".BBC News remains the most trusted source of news in the UK.But if some members of the board believe that the BBC does suffer from systemic bias, and others do not, where does this end?A senior TV executive told me Shah inherited \"a house divided but this board is melting down, it's very sad\". They added: \"It's a leadership issue.\"When I interviewed him after the resignations of Davie and Turness, Shah told me the board had \"a diversity of views, as there are in the public, as there are in the country itself… I want robust conversations, I want discussion\".But Banerji has now claimed he was not consulted over the events that led to those departures. If true, it will feed into the narrative advanced in some quarters that what has happened has been a coup by some members of the board. Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called on the government to remove Sir Robbie Gibb, an ex-BBC executive and former Downing Street director of communications to Theresa May, from the board.Shah told me the notion of a coup was \"fanciful\". He added that \"it's unfair and it's disrespectful to the members of the board to say that because they feel strongly about something, that somehow it's to do with their history\".But Sir Craig Oliver, former editor of the BBC's Six o'clock and Ten o'clock News, who was later director of communications at Number 10 under David Cameron, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"the stakes were already high for Samir Shah and they just got even higher\".He added that \"all eyes are going to be on Samir Shah on Monday\". \"The questions I think he's going to really have to answer are, is it true that months ago you chaired a BBC meeting where the Panorama issue was on the table and you decided to take no action? And if so why - particularly after what you've now said - did you not take action then?\"And I think that the next question that he's really going to have face is, when Michael Prescott's report was leaked to the Telegraph, why did you preside over such a long time of the BBC not coming out, particularly when the executive wanted to get out and cauterize the issue as cleanly as possible?\"In the last few days, prior to Banerji's resignation, I spoke to insiders at the BBC as well as people outside, who told me that Shah will remain as chair, whatever his perceived shortcomings. As one person put it to me, \"you can't have the DG, the CEO of News and the chair all resign\".Does Banerji's resignation shift the dial on his ability to continue in the role? It certainly makes Shah's appearance along with fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson in front of the Culture Media and Sport Committee on Monday even more critical.MPs on that committee voiced their reservations about whether he was qualified for the job when he was appointed as chair last year. He will need to demonstrate to those MPs, the industry, BBC audiences and staff at the corporation who will be watching, that he has the capabilities and support needed to steer the BBC through these turbulent times.",

    "body": "Ukraine's allies from Europe, Canada and Japan have voiced concerns over a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, saying it \"will require additional work\".In a statement, they said the plan had elements \"essential for a just and lasting peace\", but cited concerns over border changes and limitations on Ukraine's forces. Security officials from the UK, France, Germany, the US and Ukraine will now meet in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday for further talks.President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier warned Ukraine faced \"one of the most difficult moments in our history\" over pressure from the US to accept the plan - leaked details of which are seen as favourable to Moscow.US President Donald Trump has given Ukraine until 27 November to accept the 28-point plan, while Russia's President Vladimir Putin said it could be the \"basis\" for a settlement.Saturday's joint statement at the G20 summit in South Africa was signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two top EU officials were also among the signatories.The statement said: \"We believe therefore that the draft is a basis which will require additional work. We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force.\"We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\"It added: \"The implementation of elements relating to the European Union and relating to Nato would need the consent of EU and Nato members respectively\".The widely leaked US peace plan proposes Ukrainian troops withdraw from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.The US draft would also limit Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand further.The plan also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.On Friday, Trump said Zelensky would \"have to like\" the US proposals, adding otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader addressed the nation with a stark warning that the country \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\". \"Today is one of the most difficult moments in our history,\" Zelensky added, pledging to work \"constructively\" with the Americans on the plan.On Saturday, Zelensky announced his head of office Andriy Yermak would lead Ukraine's negotiating team for future talks on a peace deal, including any that may involve Russia.\"Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine's national interests and exactly what must be done to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion, another strike against Ukraine,\" the president said in a video statement posted on social media.Kyiv is critically dependent on deliveries of US-made advanced weaponry, including air defence systems to repel deadly Russian air assaults, as well as intelligence provided by Washington.Putin on Friday confirmed Moscow had received the US plan - but said it had not been discussed with the Kremlin in detail. He added Moscow was willing to \"show flexibility\" - but was also prepared to fight on.Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In recent months, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in Ukraine's south-eastern region - despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "5 days agoNardine Saadin Los AngelesUS film superstar Tom Cruise has received his first ever Oscar statuette.Cruise, 63, accepted an honorary Oscar at the annual Governors Awards in Hollywood alongside singer-philanthropist Dolly Parton, choreographer Debbie Allen and production designer Wynn Thomas.\"Making films is not what I do, it is who I am,\" the four-fold Oscar nominee said on Sunday, accompanying his long-awaited Academy Awards honour with an acceptance speech about his love of cinema.The Top Gun and Mission: Impossible actor paid tribute to film-makers in front of and behind the lens, those he has worked with during his 45-year career, as well as the power of the movies.Upon taking the stage, Cruise received a minutes-long standing ovation and raucous round of applause from film luminaries in the audience, including Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jerry Bruckheimer.Film-maker Alejandro G Iñárritu, who is directing an upcoming Cruise film, presented the actor with the Governors Award. \"The cinema, it takes me around the world,\" Cruise said in his speech. \"It helps me to appreciate and respect differences. It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. \"And no matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, we dream together. And that is the power of this art form. \"And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.\"Cruise made his film debut in 1981 and was previously nominated for best actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire. He was also nominated as best supporting actor in the film Magnolia and for producing Top Gun: Maverick.The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences selected Cruise for his \"incredible commitment to our film-making community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community\", the organisation said.The Risky Business actor told the ceremony that cinema made the world much larger than the one that he knew as a child. \"It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.\"The actor, who famously performs his own stunts, has also been a fervent advocate for cinema as the streaming industry and social media compete for viewers' time and attention.\"I want you to know that I will always do everything I can to help this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful - hopefully without too many more broken bones.\"Notably, earlier this year Cruise was reportedly set to be recognised by US President Donald Trump when he announced his picks for this year's Kennedy Center honours but the actor declined due to scheduling conflicts.",

    "body": "14 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentAlex Lake / @twoshortdays\"We are Radiohead. Pleased to meet you,\" said Thom Yorke in one of his few addresses to the audience\"Whenever you're ready,\" says Thom Yorke, adopting the tone of a schoolteacher waiting for an unruly class to settle down, as Radiohead get ready to play their encore at London's O2 Arena.It's a rare flash of humour from the frontman, whose onstage utterings are mostly limited to mumbled \"thank yous\". But it's also an acknowledgment of how long fans have been waiting for this show.It is now 10 years since Radiohead last released new material, and 99 months since their last UK gig.Anticipation for their return has been building ever since they announced a limited run of concerts in September. Setlists from early shows in Spain and Italy have generated news stories (\"Radiohead play Nice Dream for the first time since 2009\"), as fans pore over the song choices. According to one source, they've rehearsed 65 different numbers.At the O2, the band sift through their entire discography - from the arena rock anthems of 1994's The Bends to the celestial ballads of A Moon Shaped Pool, via the layered electronics of Kid A, currently celebrating its 25th anniversary.There are some signs that Radiohead are a bit rusty. A few timing and tuning issues crop up, which could easily be the result of a first night in a new venue, but which feel odd for a band of such technical proficiency.But when it comes together, it's a rapturous, spell-binding sight.Band members switched instruments several times within songsThey begin with the spacey, hypnotic Planet Telex, and follow it up with a crunchy version of  2+2=5, written in 2003 as a reaction to George W Bush's \"War on Terror\", and taking on new urgency in a world where political norms have seemingly been turned upside down.By the third song, Sit Down, Stand Up, they're flexing their musical muscles, with an extended outro of percussive lunacy, aided by US session musician Chris Vatalaro.His addition to the line-up is a giveaway. Radiohead's secret sauce has always been their rhythm section - who manage to locate sinewy, danceable grooves even when presented with their bandmate's most challenging material.The prowling bassline of National Anthem and the slamming drum loops of Idioteque, in particular, give the audience ample opportunity to jump up and down.That said, it's amusing to watch bassist Colin Greenwood try (and fail) to get the crowd clapping in time to the glitchy and unconventional rhythms of 15 Step. Instead, most of them simply bob their heads up and down in unified appreciation of the music. At times, it looks like a convention of nodding dogs.Cushioned between the more experimental songs, however, were the real crowd-pleasers: An elegiac version of Lucky, a beautifully twisted No Surprises and a genuinely sublime version of Weird Fishes/Arpeggi.I have a theory, however, that the band's notorious dislike of \"the old stuff\" is an elaborate ruse. They've never really stopped playing songs from The Bends and OK Computer - but the suggestion they won't makes it all the more exciting when they break into something anthemic like Fake Plastic Trees.That song opened Friday night's encore, which dwelt largely on their 90s material, including Let Down - a deep cut that's had a new lease of life on TikTok - and the epic Paranoid Android.Alex Lake / @twoshortdaysThe tour continues until 12 DecemberIntroducing a muscular version of Just, Yorke explains that it was written \"on a freezing cold farm in 1994\", in a period where they thought they'd only be remembered for one song: Their 1992 breakout Creep.We all know the story ended differently, but the reunion does find Radiohead in a strange position. This tour comes with no new material, and the last seven years have been so fertile with side projects, most notably Thom Yorke and guitarist Jonny Greenwood's three albums as The Smile, that it seemed Radiohead's members might have permanently moved on.Several factors got in the way - grief, parenthood, mental health and rumours of intra-band tension over Israel.As recently as August, Yorke said a reunion was \"not on the cards from where I'm sitting\".All of which makes the decision to play in the round, packed like sardines in a crushed tin can, all the more significant.The group are symbolically returning to the rehearsal room, playing off each other as much as they are playing to the audience.Yorke glides across the stage, doing that dance he does, moving from acoustic guitar to electric piano and back again. During Idioteque, guitarist Ed O'Brien catches him mid-transit, and they holler the lyrics directly to one another. At the start of Jigsaw Falling Into Place, Yorke and Greenwood face each other and play duelling guitars.It suggests the tour has been an act of healing, even if the band have been assigned separate dressing rooms for the first time in their career.Whether that leads to anything more is still up for debate. \"We haven't thought past the tour,\" Yorke recently told the Times. \"I'm just stunned we got this far.\"The delighted fans who queued for the Tube home singing Karma Police will be hoping everything is in its right place for a fully-fledged comeback.Full setlistPlanet Telex2 + 2 = 5Sit Down, Stand UpLuckyBloom15 StepThe GloamingKid ANo SurprisesVideotapeWeird Fishes/ArpeggiIdiotequeEverything in Its Right PlaceThe National AnthemDaydreamingJigsaw Falling Into PlaceBodysnatchersThere ThereEncore:Fake Plastic TreesLet DownParanoid AndroidYou and Whose Army?A Wolf at the DoorJustKarma Police",

    "body": "5 hours agoPhilippa Roxby,Health reporter and Alison Holt,Social affairs editorGetty ImagesDetails of a new UK clinical trial to assess the risks and benefits of puberty-blocking drugs in children who question their gender have been announced.It follows the banning of the drugs for gender treatment last year after a major review raised concerns about the lack of clinical evidence over their safety for under-18s.Researchers from King's College London say the trial will involve around 220 children under the age of 16 who are going through puberty, and will examine the impact of the drugs on their physical, social and emotional wellbeing.Some clinicians and campaigners question whether the trial is ethical.Prof Emily Simonoff, study leader and professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London (KCL), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that young people and their parents attending services for gender distress \"tell us that they don't know what to do - they look at the information that's out there and they don't know what's best for them\".But she said the study was not expecting a \"one size fits all finding\".\"We are looking very much at the balance between, possibly, benefits for mental health and quality of life, and any possible risks or harms.\" She added this would include monitoring people's physical health, and would also be the first ever study looking at the impact on brain development. Puberty blockers, also known as puberty suppressing hormones (PSH), are drugs used to delay or prevent puberty happening.They were used to treat some young people with gender incongruence - when someone's gender identity doesn't match the sex they were registered at birth - or with gender dysphoria, when it causes significant distress.As a result of the uncertainty over the safety of the drugs, highlighted by the Cass review into gender care, led by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass, doctors can now only offer the treatment to under-18s as part of a research study.Last year, the government brought in a UK-wide indefinite ban on the drugs being prescribed privately or by the NHS to children and young people questioning their gender identity.The new clinical trial, called Pathway, will involve children who are currently accessing gender services and have a diagnosis of gender incongruence.They will all have reached puberty, but will be younger than 16 - and will have to meet strict criteria, undergo intensive medical and psychological screening before they are allowed to start taking puberty blockers.A team of specialist NHS doctors must have a full picture of the young person's wellbeing before deciding if they think they are suitable for the treatment.The young person will also have to show they have a good enough understanding of the potential impact of taking puberty blockers to give their consent, and their parent or legal guardian will need to agree. They will be provided with ongoing psychological support.To explore the impact of the drugs, the researchers plan to start one group on the treatment straight away and another group 12 months later. The children in these groups will be chosen randomly.The KCL researchers said there would be no minimum age for taking the drugs, but puberty normally starts around the age of 11 for girls and 12 for boys.The trial will look at issues such as bone density, brain development and mental health and wellbeing over time.The research team said the trial had been given ethical approval and was expected to start in January, with five to six children recruited every month. The first results should be available in around four years.Alongside this, a larger observational study involving 3,000 children will research different types of support and how effective they are.The puberty blockers trial has already proved controversial, with campaigners threatening legal action.Keira Bell, who took the Tavistock gender clinic to court in 2020 after she was given puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones as a teenager, said the trial should be halted immediately. If it is not, she says she and another campaigner will start judicial review proceedings at the High Court.She said it was \"disgusting\" that children were being put on the drugs when they had already been banned because they were \"unsafe\".In her case, the High Court ruled that under-16s were \"unlikely to be able to give informed consent\" to puberty blockers, but this was later overturned by the Court of Appeal which ruled that doctors can judge whether young people can give consent to the treatment.Some clinicians from the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender, which campaigns for rigorous science and improved treatment options for gender-questioning people, have also questioned whether the trial can be carried out ethically. Study lead Prof Simonoff said: \"We know there are ongoing societal discussions about gender transition, but this research is focused solely on informing and improving healthcare by better understanding how to support the physical and mental health of young people with gender incongruence.\"Dr Hilary Cass said she was \"really pleased\" Prof Simonoff and the KCL team were undertaking the trial.She said: \"My review uncovered a very weak evidence base for benefits from the use of puberty blockers for children and young people with gender dysphoria. In fact, some children had more negative than positive effects.\"However, given that there are clinicians, children and families who believe passionately in the beneficial effects, a trial was the only way forward to make sense of this.\"She added: \"Although a lot of media attention has focused on the trial, they have a much broader research programme. Following the outcomes for young people who do not elect for a medical pathway will be just as important as following those who do.\"A spokesperson for charity Stonewall, which campaigns for the rights of LGBTQ+ people, said all young people should have access to the very best medical care, guided by evidence.\"We urge the government and policymakers to invest in delivering excellent healthcare for trans young people and to make sure the voices of trans young people and their families are at its core.\"",

    "body": "3 days agoHannah KarpelBBC NewsBBC\"It feels like I am constantly setting myself up for failure or disappointment,\" says AswanPerfectionism has a great reputation. It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.For many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.But what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.Even in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".It's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on the BBC Sounds podcast Complex with Kimberley Wilson, she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".That fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.Perfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".Breaking the cycleWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.Still, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.It starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.Was the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.Over the years, Dayna says she has learned to quiet her harsh inner criticFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\", it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna. \"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"At times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.Looking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"Not all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.But it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.Working through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,in Washington, and Anthony Zurcher,North America correspondent, in WashingtonKey moments from Trump and Greene's public falloutMarjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will resign from office, an unexpected turn for the high-profile Republican.One of Donald Trump's Maga superstars and staunchest defenders, the Georgia congresswoman's relentless calls for releasing files related to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and recent criticism of some of his policies led to a bitter public feud.After the US president labelled her a \"traitor\", she said in a video announcing her departure: \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"Trump, who had threatened to support a Republican challenger to unseat Greene, called her resignation \"great news for the country\" in an interview with ABC News.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he later wrote on Truth Social. \"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country!\"Greene said in her video statement, posted on social media, that she would leave the US Congress on 5 January 2026.She said that she did \"not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms\". She had been one of the loudest demanding the release of documents related to Epstein, an issue that once united Trump and his base but has since become divisive.Trump had spent months arguing that the issue was a distraction concocted by his political detractors to divert attention from his administration's achievements.\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said in her resignation letter.Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene announces resignation in video messageOver the last few months, she has gone on a number of high-profile news shows and was critical of Trump and fellow Republicans. She took issue with the president not doing enough to bring down living costs for voters and criticised his policy of introducing tariffs on imports. But above all, she criticised his administration for not releasing documents related to Epstein.Trump responded last week in a series of social media posts, calling Greene a \"traitor\" and \"wacky\". He said she should be unseated and vowed to back a challenger for her place in Congress.Days after their feud boiled over, with a growing number of Republicans calling for their release, Trump reversed course and said he would support their publication. He signed a bill this week that forces the US Justice Department to release the documents within 30 days. Greene was elected to Congress in 2020 amid a backdrop of headlines over her support and promotion of QAnon conspiracies, including claiming school shootings and the 9/11 terror attacks were staged. She has since apologised and sought to distance herself from those comments.In the video announcing her resignation, Greene ticked off a list of political achievements. She noted in her resignation letter that the comments from Trump were \"hurtful\". AFP via Getty ImagesGreene and Trump on the campaign trail in 2024While she announced her departure from the House of Representatives, US media reports have indicated Greene has shown an interest in running for state office - either as Georgia governor or for a Senate seat. The president has commented publicly about those ambitions, writing on Truth Social during their public feud that he had previously told her that she shouldn't run for either of those offices due to poor public polling. Greene has since said she did not plan to run for either of those offices. Before their public falling out, Trump and Greene had been close allies in championing the \"America First\" agenda. She joined him on the campaign trail and was one of the Republicans most vocal about Trump's false claims that he'd won the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden. Her departure will further close the gap in the Republican-led House of Representatives, where the party only holds a handful of seats more than Democrats. Control of the chamber will be up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections next November. ",

    "body": "13 hours agoPhil McCannNorth WestJulia Quenzler/BBCPeter Sullivan sobbed when the court said it was quashing his convictionFor someone who's lost nearly 40 years of his life because of a crime he didn't commit, Peter Sullivan strikes a remarkably optimistic tone.When I met him last month, for what was his first interview since being released from prison in May, he was upbeat and looking forward to getting to Anfield to watch Liverpool play for the first time since he was taken into custody in 1986.That was the year of the sexual attack murder of Diane Sindall in his home town of Birkenhead - an incident he said he only knew about because someone turned to him in a pub at the time and said, \"apparently there's been a murder\".When he was convicted the following year at Liverpool Crown Court - he was condemned to a lifetime in some of Britain's toughest category A prisons where he would be hounded by his tabloid nicknames \"The Beast of Birkenhead\", \"The Mersey Ripper\" and \"The Wolfman\".Before our interview, he was full of stories about how since his release he has had to adjust to a completely different world. When he was taken into custody, Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street, no one had heard of the internet and Europe was still divided by the Iron Curtain.More on this storyHe described watching the fall of the Berlin Wall from a communal television in prison.Mr Sullivan told me how trips to the shops now show how \"everything's changed\" - from trying to work out how self-checkouts work to realising that \"instead of having a cheque book, you've got it on your phone\".His incarceration means he has been oblivious to the way so many aspects of everyday life have changed - almost like someone who has been asleep since the 1980s.\"After spending so long in prison and finding out there's no DHSS [Department of Health and Social Security, now the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)] where you can pick up your money - you're thinking, 'Wow, what's going on here?'\"He now has a smartphone, after finding out doctor's appointments need to be booked on something he now knows is called an 'app'.He first became familiar with them when he was sitting on a bus shortly after his release and saw people twiddling with smartphones. He only realised they were phones when he saw someone put one to their ear.Mr Sullivan's 14,000 days in custody have also led to an inevitable sense of institutionalisation.Phil McCann spoke to Peter Sullivan anonymously in an interview last monthHe recalled how after his release, one morning in his flat he walked back to his bedroom and sat down on his bed, because he was subconsciously waiting for a prison officer to come and lock him back into his cell. \"You've got to be at your door at a certain time, otherwise the officers will go off at you\", he said.\"I was just sitting there thinking, 'What am I doing?'\"But Mr Sullivan's optimism is tempered by a longing for answers about how he ended up being charged with an infamous murder that he didn't commit, and a confusion about why he still has not had an apology.\"I've lost everything\", he said.\"I lost all my freedom, I lost my mother since I've been in prison, I've lost my father. \"It hurts because I wasn't there for them\", he said.\"I can't carry on with my life if I can't get an answer off them.\"\"That's all I want, an apology [and to understand] the reason why they've done this to me\", he said.Peter Sullivan was convicted of beating Diane Sindall to death in a \"frenzied attack\"Merseyside Police said \"there would be little benefit to be gained for a review of this matter today\" because of \"the changes to investigative techniques and developments in the law over the last 40 years\".The force did refer some of Mr Sullivan's allegations to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), who will now look at his claims that officers beat him up and threatened to link him to other crimes if he failed to confess to Diane Sindall's murder.When asked if it would apologise, the force did not directly answer, but as part of a lengthy statement it said: \"The force regrets that there has been a grave miscarriage of justice in this case\".Mr Sullivan told me about his modest ambition - an ambition that he said he had lost hope of being able to realise at some points over his nearly four decades behind bars.\"All I want to do now is get on with my own life and carry on as I was before, and live my time out now\".Diane Sindall, 21, was due to be married when she was murdered His future may be made easier by government compensation, paid to victims of miscarriages of justice. This scheme is capped at £1.3m, a cap which it is thought his eventual payout will get very close to.But the process is not automatic, and it is lengthy. Andrew Malkinson, whose conviction for a rape he did not commit was quashed in 2023, was only awarded an interim compensation payout earlier this year.Guilty prisoners who admit to their crimes and are released on parole get a place to live and some help with living expenses. Mr Sullivan, as an innocent man, is not eligible for that help.And so he is living a modest life, with his modest ambitions - although many believe he is a millionaire in waiting.His lawyer, Sarah Myatt, said \"there's not a figure that you could say that would be enough for losing 38 years of your life\".",

    "body": "5 days agoHelen BushbyCulture reporter'She's still the funniest person in the world,' Pauline's son told BBC Breakfast\"She's still funny, she's talking, she's happy.\"Birds of a Feather actress Pauline Quirke was diagnosed with dementia in 2021. Her family, who are unsure what stage she is at, have spoken of the \"disbelief\" they felt at the time. Despite being \"very private\", they told BBC Breakfast they decided to speak out to raise awareness and funds for the condition. \"My mum has always been a charitable person. It's what she would want me to do,\" said her son, Charlie Quirke.Best known for playing Sharon Theodopolopodous in long-running sitcom Birds of a Feather, 66-year-old Quirke was also nominated for a Bafta in 1997 for playing a convicted murderer in BBC drama The Sculptress.In 2022, she was made an MBE for services to the entertainment industry, young people, and charities.But earlier this year her husband, Steve Sheen, who she married in 1996, had to announce her retirement.This ended both her 50-year acting career, along with her role as head of Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts, which has about 250 academies, and more than 15,000 young students across the UK.Charlie Quirke and Steve Sheen said Quirke still tells them she loves themSteve said they first got an inkling something might be wrong with Quirke in November 2020, after she received a script.\"She started reading it and she phoned me on that day and said, the words are not going in. That's where it started,\" he said.Their reaction after the diagnosis was \"disbelief, really\". \"We looked at each other and went, 'Can't be, it's long Covid. Got the flu'.\"Charlie added he was \"quite surprised that this was possible in a woman in her 60s, and it can happen to people in their 50s, people in their 40s, so it's something you have to deal with and learn about\".Dementia is described as \"young onset\" when symptoms develop before the age of 65. It most often develops in people between the ages of 45 and 65 but can affect people of any age.Asked what stage Quirke is at in her dementia journey, Steve said: \"We don't know. She's still funny. She's talking. She's happy.\"\"Is it four years, eight years, 10 years, 12 years, 20, who knows?\" Charlie added: \"And that's the problem, no one tells you. \"My mum knows exactly who we are. Every time she sees all of us, she smiles, laughs, says 'I love you', says 'hello'.\"They spoke about why they were sharing their experience, and what they had learned so far. \"Unfortunately we are not in the state where we can do much about it,\" Steve said. \"Just take every day and try and take the best moment out of that day you can.\"It's a long journey. If we can just help a little bit by using Pauline as the catalyst to make more people aware, then we should, to use her to boost awareness and raise funds for dementia research.\" (L-R) Pauline Quirke as Sharon Theodopolopodous, Lesley Joseph as Dorien Green and Linda Robson as Tracey Stubbs in Birds of a FeatherSteve said the impact of the condition hit them slowly. \"It's so gradual that for the first year, two years, you're thinking, ah, she's alright. \"Now, we're three or four years in, it's a little bit different. This is why awareness is important. We didn't know how long it lasts or how long you have with it, or how bad it is or how quick it is.\"Charlie added that it \"progresses and changes every day, but so do we - we change and progress, and so we're forever learning\".The NHS website states dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) \"associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning\". Quirke was nominated for a Bafta for playing murderer Olive Martin in BBC series The SculptressNext month, Charlie is doing a fundraising walk for Alzheimer's Research UK, going 140 kilometres to places that shaped his mother's life, including homes she has lived in, theatres and TV studios she has worked at. It will also include the Buckinghamshire headquarters of her children's drama academy. \"This is my mum's legacy,\" he said. \"This is going to be one of the stops on my trek, because she wanted to nurture the next generation of young actors.\"Steve paid tribute to his wife, saying: \"What you see is what you get. Loving. Brilliant. She's an iconic actress because her talent is immense.\"Charlie added: \"She is an incredible, strong, courageous woman that's been through a lot and she keeps going. \"She's a fighter and it's incredible to see, yeah, very proud of her.\"If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this story, support and advice is available via the BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "Move over fillers - here's why people are having facial injections made from fish sperm16 hours agoRuth CleggHealth and Wellbeing reporterBBCIn my many years as a journalist, I never thought I would be asking someone how it feels to have trout sperm injected into their face.And yet, here I am.Abby is lying on a large, black padded chair at a small aesthetics clinic in south Manchester. She winces as a small cannula is delicately inserted into her cheek.\"Ouch. Ouch,\" she exclaims.I should make it clear that 29-year-old Abby is not actually receiving a pure dose of trout sperm. The lower part of her face is being injected with tiny fragments of DNA, known as polynucleotides, which have been extracted from either trout or salmon sperm.Why? Well, interestingly, our DNA is pretty similar to that of a fish.So the hope is Abby's body will not only welcome these tiny strands of fish DNA, her skin cells will be spurred into action, producing more collagen and elastin, two proteins which are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of our skin.For Abby, the aim is to freshen her skin, keep it healthy, and hopefully, treat the acne she's lived with for many years by reducing scarring and redness.\"I just want to target those problem areas,\" she explains.Abby is having injections in her lower face to help rejuvenate her skin and tackle “problem areas”Polynucleotides are being touted as the next big skincare \"miracle\" and are rapidly gaining popularity after a number of celebrities have spoken candidly about their \"salmon sperm facials\".Earlier this year, Charli XCX told her nine million Instagram followers that she felt \"fillers are kind of over now\", and explained she had moved onto polynucleotides, which are \"kinda like deep vitamins\".Kim and Khloe Kardashian are also reportedly avid fans. And when asked about her skincare routine on a recent episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Jennifer Aniston responded: \"Don't I have beautiful salmon skin?\"EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockCharli XCX says she uses polynucleotides which are \"kinda like\" injectable vitamins for the skinSo, despite their fishy beginnings, are polynucleotides transforming skincare?\"We are having a Benjamin Button moment,\" Suzanne Mansfield, who works for aesthetics company Dermafocus, tells me.That's a reference to the 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, where Brad Pitt plays a man who ages backwards. By the time he's in his later years, he has the skin of a baby's bottom.While such an effect is highly unlikely and would probably be a tad disconcerting, Ms Mansfield says polynucleotides are forging the way when it comes to regenerative skincare.A small but growing body of research and clinical trials suggest that injecting polynucleotides can rejuvenate skin, not only making it healthier but potentially reducing fine lines, wrinkles and scars.\"All we are doing, by using it in the aesthetics industry,\" she says, \"is enhancing something the body already does. That's why these are so special.\"But they also come with a pretty hefty price tag.A single session of polynucleotide injections can cost anywhere from £200 to £500 - and it's recommended you have three of these over several weeks. After that clinics tend to advise you need to top up every six to nine months to maintain the look.Back at the clinic, Abby's treatment is almost finished.\"Just one area left,\" Helena Dunk, the aesthetic nurse practitioner who owns the clinic, Skin HD, reassures her.She says polynucleotides have massively increased in popularity over the past 18 months.\"Half my clients really notice a huge difference - their skin feels more hydrated, healthier, younger - while the other half don't see such a big change. But their skin does tend to feel tighter and fresher.\"Abby has already had the area under her eyes injected as part of a three-course treatment at the clinic - and she's really pleased with the results.She received lots of tiny injections of polynucleotides, which was a \"pretty painful procedure\", but says it's helped reduce the dark circles under her eyes.Charlotte BickleyCharlotte says she has been left with black rings under her eyes after being injected with polynucleotides before her wedding While a growing number of studies consider it a safe and effective treatment, it is still relatively new and some experts warn the hype may be outpacing the science.Consultant dermatologist Dr John Pagliaro, based in Brisbane, Australia, says that while we know that nucleotides play an important role in our bodies - they are the building blocks of our DNA for a start - he questions whether \"injecting salmon DNA, cut into little pieces\" into our faces is going to work as well as our own nucleotides.\"We do not have good, strong data,\" he says. \"As a medical specialist, I would want to see at least a few more years of big, credible studies showing safety and efficacy before I started using them in my practice. We're just not there yet.\"Charlotte Bickley describes her foray into the world of polynucleotides as \"salmon-gate\".  The 31-year-old from New York had the treatment last year as part of her \"wedding glow up\", shortly before she was due to get married.But Charlotte ended up with a skin infection, inflammation and darker rings under her eyes than before she had the treatment.\"I got the complete opposite of what I wanted,\" she says. \"I trusted that doctor, but he's left me scarred.\"Charlotte believes she was injected too deeply under her eyes, causing a negative reaction. There can be side effects - such as redness, swelling and bruising but these tend to be temporary.In some cases, people can have an allergic reaction, or, if polynucleotides are not injected properly, there are longer term risks, such as skin pigmentation and infections.Polynucleotides are widely used across the UK. They are registered as medical devices with the Medicines Health and Regulatory Authority (MHRA) but they are not regulated like medicines. They have not been approved by the UK’s equivalent in the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\"I just keep thinking, 'Why did I go through with it?'\" Charlotte says. \"When something goes wrong on my face I hyperfixate on it.\"She's paid thousands in medical bills to try to rectify the situation, but 10 months on, there's still some scarring below her eyes.\"I would never have salmon DNA injected into my face again,\" Charlotte says, \"ever.\"Ashton Collins, director of Save Face, an organisation which campaigns for better regulation of the cosmetic industry and who runs a government-approved register of clinics in the UK, says polynucleotides are generally considered a safe treatment when administered by a medically-trained professional and the brand of polynucleotides used is from a reputable company.\"But, we are now seeing products coming onto the market that haven't been tested properly, that's the worry,\" she says.Dr Sophie Shotter, president of the British College of Aesthetic Medicine, agrees.\"Due to the lack of regulation, anyone can use products that have not been robustly tested. It is a real issue.\"In her opinion, are polynucleotides effective though?\"I have them on my shelf, in my toolbox. I definitely offer them to clients, who want a natural look and want to potentially invest long-term,\" Dr Shotter says.\"Polynucleotides as a treatment is not the panacea. There are plenty of other treatments out there that can do similar, and have more data behind them.\"There is no one treatment that will work for everyone, she adds.\"We all respond differently to different things, and that is not always predictable.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "Our babies were taken after 'biased' parenting test - now we're fighting to get them back14 hours agoSofia Bettiza,BBC Global Health Reporter and Woody Morris,BBC World Service, DenmarkBBCKeira says she sobbed uncontrollably when her baby was taken away from herWhen Keira's daughter was born last November, she was given two hours with her before the baby was taken into care.\"Right when she came out, I started counting the minutes,\" Keira, 39, recalls. \"I kept looking at the clock to see how long we had.\"When the moment came for Zammi to be taken from her arms, Keira says she sobbed uncontrollably, whispering \"sorry\" to her baby.\"It felt like a part of my soul died.\"Now Keira is one of many Greenlandic families living on the Danish mainland who are fighting to get their children returned to them after they were removed by social services.In such cases, babies and children were taken away after parental competency tests - known in Denmark as FKUs - were used to help assess whether they were fit to be parents.In May this year the Danish government banned the use of these tests on Greenlandic families after decades of criticism, although they continue to be used on other families in Denmark.The assessments, which usually take months to complete, are used in complex welfare cases where authorities believe children are at risk of neglect or harm.Keira says she was \"counting the minutes\" from the moment Zammi was born, knowing she only had two hours with her daughterThey include interviews with parents and children, a range of cognitive tasks, such as recalling a sequence of numbers backwards, general knowledge quizzes, and personality and emotional testing.Defenders of the tests say they offer a more objective method of assessment than the potentially anecdotal and subjective evidence of social workers and other experts.But critics say they cannot meaningfully predict whether someone will make a good parent.Opponents have also long argued that they are designed around Danish cultural norms and point out they are administered in Danish, rather than Kalaallisut, the mother tongue of most Greenlanders.This can lead to misunderstandings, they say.Greenlanders are Danish citizens, enabling them to live and work on the mainland.Thousands live in Denmark, drawn by its employment opportunities, education and healthcare, among other reasons.Greenlandic parents in Denmark are 5.6 times more likely to have children taken into care than Danish parents, according to the Danish Centre for Social Research, a government-funded research institute.In May, the government said it hoped in due course to review around 300 cases – including ones involving FKU tests – in which Greenlandic children were forcibly removed from their families.But as of October, the BBC found that just 10 cases where parenting tests were used had been reviewed by the government - and no Greenlandic children had been returned as a result.Keira's assessment in 2024, carried out when she was pregnant, concluded that she did not have \"sufficient parental competencies to care for the newborn independently\".Keira says the questions she was asked included: \"Who is Mother Teresa?\" and \"How long does it take for the sun's rays to reach the Earth?\"Keira still keeps a cot beside her bed and another in the living room of her apartment, along with baby clothes and nappiesPsychologists who defend the tests argue questions like these are intended to assess parents' general knowledge and their understanding of concepts they might encounter in society.Keira adds that \"they made me play with a doll and criticised me for not making enough eye contact\".She alleges that when she asked why she was being tested in this way the psychologist told her: \"To see if you are civilised enough, if you can act like a human being.\"The local authority in Keira's case said it could not comment on individual families, adding that decisions to place a child in care were made when there was serious concern about the \"child's health, development, and well-being\".In 2014, Keira's other two children - who were then aged nine years and eight months - were placed into care after an FKU test at the time concluded her parenting skills were not developing fast enough to meet their needs.Her eldest, Zoe, who is now 21, moved back home when she was 18 and currently lives in her own apartment and sees her mum regularly.Keira hopes she will soon be reunited with her baby Zammi permanently.The Danish government has said its review will look at whether mistakes were made in the administering of FKU tests on Greenlandic people.In the meantime, Keira is allowed to see Zammi, who is in foster care, once a week for an hour.Each time she visits, she takes flowers and sometimes Greenlandic food, such as chicken heart soup.\"Just so a little part of her culture can be with her,\" she says.'I felt the most horrific heartbreak'Ulrik and Johanne hope the Danish government will reconsider reviewing cases like theirs where a child has been adoptedBut not all Greenlandic parents who had children taken into care after completing FKUs will have their cases reviewed.Johanne and Ulrik's son was adopted in 2020 and the Danish government has said it will not review cases where children have been adopted.Johanne, 43, was tested in 2019 during pregnancy.Like Zammi, her son was meant to have been taken away immediately after birth.But because he was born prematurely on Boxing Day and social workers were on holiday, she and her husband Ulrik got to keep him for 17 days.\"It was the happiest time of my life as a father,\" says Ulrik, 57.\"Being with my son, holding him, changing his nappy, making sure that Johanne pumps her milk before going to bed in the evening.\"Then one day, two social workers and two police officers arrived at Johanne and Ulrik's home to take their son away.The couple say they pleaded with them not to take him.Johanne asked if she could breastfeed him one last time.\"As I was dressing my son to hand him over to his foster parents who were on their way, I felt the most horrific heartbreak,\" Ulrik says.Johanne had been tested after two children from another relationship, who were five and six, were taken into care after FKU testing in 2010. Her 2019 assessment describes her as \"narcissistic\" and as having \"mental retardation\" - a categorisation based on designations developed by the WHO which were in use at the time.She rejects both of these descriptions of her.Getty ImagesA protester carries a placard that reads: \"Our children are watching!! Prejudices are contagious,\" during a demonstration in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, earlier this yearIn theory, there is no pass or fail mark for an FKU and they are one factor among others taken into consideration by local authorities who decide whether to place a child into care.But psychologist Isak Nellemann, who used to administer the tests, says in practice they \"are very important, about the most important thing, because when the tests are bad, in about 90% [of cases] they will lose their children\".Nelleman argues the tests lack scientific validity and were developed to study personality traits rather than predict parenting ability.However, Turi Frederiksen, a senior psychologist whose team currently administers the tests, defends them, saying that while they are not perfect, \"they are valuable, extensive psychological tools\".She also says she does not believe they are biased against Greenlanders.When Johanne was asked in 2019 what she saw during a Rorschach test - a psychological test where people are asked what they see when looking at ink-blot images - she said she saw a woman gutting a seal, a familiar sight in Greenland's hunting culture.Johanne alleges that on hearing this answer the psychologist called her a \"barbarian\".The local council involved in the couple's 2019 assessment did not address Johanne's claim directly.They said her assessment \"indicated significant concern regarding the parents' overall parenting abilities\" as well as \"concerns about the parents' general lifestyle and functional level in daily life\".Social worker Tordis Jacobsen said the decision to place a child into care in Denmark was never taken lightly'I never got to see his first steps'After Johanne and Ulrik's son was taken into care, they were allowed to see him during brief, weekly visits until he was adopted in 2020.They have never seen him since.\"I never got to see his first steps, his first word, his first tooth, his first school day,\" Johanne says.However, a few days after his birth they christened him, creating an official record that includes their names and address.\"We needed to create a paper trail so he could find his way back to us,\" Johanne says.Their lawyer Jeanette Gjørret hopes to take their case before the European Court of Human Rights.But Denmark's social affairs minister Sophie Hæstorp Andersen tells the BBC the government will not reopen cases of adoption because each of these children is now settled with a \"loving and caring family\".Asked about the progress of the review, she says \"it sounds slow, but we are getting started\".She also says decisions to remove and adopt children are part of a \"very thorough process where we look into the family's ability to take care of their child not only for a year or two, but for a long period of time\".That is echoed by Tordis Jacobsen, a social worker team leader in Aalborg Kommune in northern Denmark, who says removing a child in Denmark is never taken lightly.She says safeguarding concerns are often first flagged by schools or hospitals, and points out that in cases where a child is permanently adopted the decision to approve this is made by a judge.Pilinguaq's daughter, six, was returned to her several months ago, more than four years after being placed into care Pilinguaq is a rare case of a Greenlandic mother who has been reunited with her child.She and her daughter, who was placed into care aged one, were reunited a few months ago. Her daughter is now six.Pilinguaq, 39, says she received the unexpected news in a phone call from social services.\"I started crying and laughing at the same time. I couldn't believe it. I kept thinking, 'Oh my God, she's coming home.'\"Pilinguaq's three children were all placed into care in 2021. The other two were aged six and nine at the time.She says she agreed for her local authority to place her children in temporary care while she found a new home suitable for her children.Pilinguaq says she believed her children would soon be returned to her, but instead she had to undergo a parenting assessment.This concluded she had a pattern of entering \"dysfunctional relationships\" and was unfit to parent.'They can take her in one hour'A few months after her six-year-old daughter came home, Pilinguaq was told by her local authority that her other two older children will be returning to her in December.The decision to return the children into Pilinguaq's care was made by the local authority rather than being recommended by the government review. The local authority declined to comment on her case.Spending more than four years apart has made it difficult for Pilinguaq to rebuild her relationship with her daughter.\"If I go to the bathroom and close the door, she will have a panic attack and say 'Mum, I couldn't find you,'\" Pilinguaq says.She also says she is terrified of losing her daughter again.\"They can take her in one hour. They can do it again.\"Keira has been making her daughter Zammi a wooden sleigh for her first birthdayKeira is now preparing for Zammi's first birthday in her absence.She's building a traditional Greenlandic sleigh by hand from wood, with a polar bear drawn on the front.Earlier this month, she was told that her daughter won't be coming home - for now at least - but she hasn't given up hope.Keira still has a cot next to her bed and another in the living room, with framed photos of Zammi on the walls, along with baby clothes and nappies.\"I will not stop fighting for my children. \"If I don't finish this fight, it will be my children's fight in the future.\"This is part of the Global Women series from the BBC World Service, sharing untold and important stories from around the globe",

    "body": "It is said The Camfield, the pub just outside Perth Stadium, is the largest in the southern hemisphere.Plenty of room to drown English sorrows. Supporters can numb their pain, at least until they wake up on Sunday morning and find a ticket for the third day of the first Ashes Test is now nothing more than an expensive bookmark.They have witnessed England's worst Test defeat in Australia for years and the first two-day Ashes Test since 1921.There have been some doozies. Bowled out for 68 by Scott Boland four years ago. Terrorised by Mitchell Johnson in 2013-14. Spun out by Shane Warne after declaring on 551-6 in Adelaide in 2006.This hits different. England had a golden opportunity to pounce in Perth, win their first Test in this country for 14 years and their first away Ashes opener since 1986.Instead, the shiny new Perth Stadium has turned out to be just the same as the Waca - dripping in English disappointment. Only one win in 15 visits to this city in 55 years.Just after 1pm local time, England were 105 runs ahead with nine second-innings wickets in hand. Australia had been bowled out for 132 in their first innings. The pitch had made batters an endangered species.Four and a half hours later, England had lost by eight wickets. And that included 20 minutes for tea. Deckchairs show more resistance to folding.When England emerged for what turned out to be the final session of the match, they were still favourites. A target of 205 seemed stiff for Australia. Only 28.5 overs later, it was all done. England had been Trav-balled.An England attack that was rampant only 24 hours earlier was dismantled by one of the great Ashes innings from Travis Head. From shock and awe to shocking and awful.England are not a bad cricket team. They are a good cricket team that can occasionally be a thrilling cricket team. They are also a stubborn, maddening and slow-learning cricket team.Many of the worst, most painful defeats since Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum took charge have been self-inflicted.In Wellington in 2023, England made New Zealand follow on, and lost. In the Ashes of the same year, England declared on day one at Edgbaston, then had the benefit of Nathan Lyon limping off Lord's. They lost both.The following year, away to India in Rajkot: 224-2 in reply to 445, with Ravichandran Ashwin out of the match to attend a family emergency. England lost. In July of this year, England needed 73 more to pull off a record chase against India at The Oval with Harry Brook and Joe Root at the crease making hundreds. England lost.It is great the Bazballers have form for backs-to-the-wall run chases, but it's just as good to win from a position of dominance. Stokes often says he does not like the word \"ruthless\". Perhaps it is because his team are not.The most galling part of this defeat is what it could have done to Australia.The West Australian newspaper harangued England through Perth airport, called them crybabys, arrogant and cocky. It only took one ropey first-day performance from Australia for the West Australian to turn on them.Lyon was limping again. There were whispers Australia had picked the wrong team. Knives were out for Usman Khawaja and his dodgy back. Now Khawaja is a national hero for allowing Head to open the batting.Stand-in captain Steve Smith might have been asked why he had rehearsed a monologue about Monty Panesar's appearance on Mastermind. Instead he sat at the post-match news conference as a winning skipper, literally slapping Head on the back. It had echoes of eight years ago in Brisbane, when Smith and Cameron Bancroft laughed through the Jonny Bairstow headbutt incident.Now Australia go to the second Test in Brisbane, played in a day-night format they hardly ever lose. The hosts have the luxury of not rushing Pat Cummins' return.Mitchell Starc, 10 wickets in Perth, has wizarding skills with the pink ball Harry Potter would be proud of.Where do England go from here? They have been beaten so swiftly in Perth they have time to fly home, have a week off, then fly back to Brisbane for a round of golf and the second Test.Australia bowled out England twice in 67.3 overs in Perth. Not since 1904 have England survived so few deliveries in losing a Test.Listening to Stokes and McCullum, it appears one place the bulk of the Ashes squad will not be going is Canberra for a two-day pink-ball match between England Lions and the Prime Minister's XI next weekend. England will rest in Brisbane instead.The opportunity to tune up under lights will be largely passed in the name of unity and morale. England have only one training session under lights in Brisbane.It would not be a surprise if England field the same XI in the second Test. The batters will be backed and the five-pronged pace attack looked on to something in the first innings in Perth.Where England might turn if the batting continues to fail is a tricky question. Zak Crawley has been backed with Australia in mind, yet lasted only 11 balls across two innings here for the fourth Ashes pair by an England opener.Crawley's position is curious. His standing is boosted by the strength of his combination with Ben Duckett, though the Kent man's returns are diminishing. His average as a Test opener - 30.22 - is the worst of any player with as many as Crawley's 96 innings at the top of the order.It's not a close contest, either. Crawley is more than two runs behind West Indies' Kraigg Brathwaite.If England decided on a change - highly unlikely - their options are limited. There is not another specialist opener in the squad. Jacob Bethell and Will Jacks have joined the Lions game against a Cricket Australia XI at Lilac Hill and will bat on Sunday. It would be interesting if either peels off a hundred.McCullum has said his team will stick to their \"blueprint\". That is fine. Having conviction in a method is a sign of strong leadership and it would be odd to rip up three years of work and start again.On Thursday - it feels like a lifetime ago - McCullum also said this Ashes series will \"define\" this England team.The Bazballers are the sort of team capable of bouncing back from the pounding in Perth with a blitz of Brisbane.If they don't, they will be 2-0 down and on the way to being defined as the same as all the other England teams hammered in Australia in the past 14 years.",

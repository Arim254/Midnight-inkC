    "body": "Is this AI's worst prediction yet?Chris Sutton's guest this week, actor Éanna Hardwicke, plays Roy Keane in Saipan - a new film about the former Manchester United captain's infamous fallout with Republic of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy before the 2002 World Cup. It is in cinemas from Friday.Naturally, we asked AI who would play Sutton if a film were ever made about him.The best fit, apparently, is Hollywood heartthrob Tom Hardy - who is four inches shorter than BBC Sport football expert Sutton but is AI's top choice for the role because he is \"known for portraying tough, brooding characters with emotional depth\".\"That just shows how way off the mark AI is,\" said Sutton.\"But I'm happy with Tom Hardy, even though he is not tall enough. Most people would probably say I am more like Laurel and Hardy though.\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.Hardwicke, who supports Aston Villa, is his guest for week 23.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, Aidan MonaghanImage caption, Steve Coogan (left) as Mick McCarthy and Éanna Hardwicke as Roy Keane. We watch their relationship unravel in SaipanThe disagreement between McCarthy and Keane caused huge controversy in Irish society over who was to blame, and despite the best efforts of former Taoiseach (Irish PM) Bertie Ahern, the duo could not resolve their differences before the tournament started, leading Keane to miss the World Cup.\"I always think it was more subtle and grey than sometimes it gets portrayed,\" Hardwicke told BBC Sport.\"Sometimes it gets simplified as the clash between the person who wanted to win at all costs - Roy - and the person who had more of a 'we're happy to be here' approach - Mick.\"I think it is way more complex than that. Roy's commitment to excellence and absolute rigour is inspiring - he is such a symbol of the way the professionalism in football changed in the 1990s and 2000s, moving away from the pub culture that had existed.\"But Mick had a fantastic playing career too, as probably the most successful Ireland captain, and then was maybe behind Jack Charlton as the second-most successful Ireland manager.\"So, he knew how to win and he knew how to get the best out of a team. That is a really important thing to distinguish because they both wanted to win - they just had different ways of going about it.\"In a way, there is a Greek tragedy element to the situation because they are both on these different tracks, which both lead to one place. So it was always bound to end up where it did.\"I came out of the screening in Cork [where he and Keane were both born] and it was so satisfying to hear very different reactions, all very close to the skin. Some people were saying they were completely with Roy in this moment, while others were totally on Mick's side.\"It makes this more than just a sports story. We all maybe identify with one of them more than the other, depending on who you are as a person.\"Chris Sutton and Éanna Hardwicke were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.Image source, SaipanImage caption, Hardwicke studied hours of footage of interviews and action to prepare for playing Keane. \"The easiest part of your job, if you like that kind of work, is taking in the voice and the physicality,\" he explained. \"But more important is sort of creating and embodying the unseen parts of his life and trying to get under that skin. Obviously that can only ever be your interpretation.\"Premier League predictionsSaturday, 24 JanuaryLondon Stadium, 12:30 GMTSunderland's 3-0 win over West Ham on the opening weekend really set the tone for both teams' seasons, but it doesn't really help me much here.The Hammers' win at Tottenham last week was extraordinary given their form going into that game, but their home record is still extremely poor.Sunderland, meanwhile, are not the same force on the road as they are at the Stadium of Light, and they have not won away since the end of October.Still, it has been such a strange season, with everyone beating everyone, that form, history, tables and stats are not really much help with these predictions anyway.In the past few weeks, I have thought too much about AI and gone down the stat route to try to beat it at its own game, but that's not how I won the predictions title in previous seasons. I need to go with my gut instinct more, and that's what I'm doing here.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Hardwicke's prediction: I'm an Aston Villa fan but I've got a bit of affinity with Sunderland. 1-2AI's prediction: 2-1Turf Moor, 15:00I am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live with Ian Dennis and it is another tricky one to call.Tottenham boss Thomas Frank really needed Tuesday's win over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League but he is still under pressure, and this is not an easy game for Spurs either.When Liverpool went 1-0 up against Burnley last week and were creating loads of chances, I thought I was on for an exact score - I'd gone for a 2-0 Reds win.I couldn't believe it when Burnley equalised but that result sums them up, because they are still scrapping for survival at the bottom of the table, and fighting hard in every game.It is unlikely they are going to stay up from here, but it is not impossible. They probably need another five or six wins from their last 16 games - and they have had only three so far from their first 22.Their home games are going to be crucial to get them to safety, so this almost feels must-win for Scott Parker's side, even at this stage.The Clarets have been competitive against everyone so far, including at Anfield last week, but I still don't see them getting the result they need.This is going be a very tight game and it smells of a 1-1 to me, but we have already had 17 goalless draws in the Premier League this season, so I am going on trend and picking another one here.That should guarantee we see a few goals now. I have got Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario in my fantasy team, so I am asking for trouble really.Sutton's prediction: 0-0Hardwicke's prediction: Burnley have still got something to fight for so I am going to back them to get something here. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-2Craven Cottage, 15:00These two sides are next to each other in the table in 11th and 12th, and drew 1-1 at the start of the season, so you know this is going to be close.Fulham will have Alex Iwobi, Samuel Chukwueze and Calvin Bassey back from the Africa Cup of Nations, and I am not reading too much into their last-gasp defeat at Leeds last week anyhow.Brighton will create chances - they always do - and I am expecting them to score, but Fulham won this game 3-1 last season with Iwobi scoring twice and I am going for them again this time.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Hardwicke's prediction: Fulham are doing really well. 2-0AI's prediction: 1-1Etihad Stadium, 15:00Erling Haaland has not scored in open play in any of Manchester City's past eight games - only finding the net with a penalty against Brighton.But his poor form is not City's only problem. They froze in the Arctic Circle on Tuesday - I was at that game for 5 Live and Bodo/Glimt thoroughly deserved their win.It was a terrible result for City because now they are out of the top eight in the Champions League and, with a squad ravaged by injury, they are facing the prospect of two extra games in the play-offs.Still, new signing Marc Guehi can play in this game to bring some stability to their backline and Antoine Semenyo will be back to add some spark to their attack too.And, while Wolves have been rejuvenated recently and are four games unbeaten in the league, I feel like there will be some anger in City's performance after such a disappointing week.Sutton's prediction: 3-1Hardwicke's prediction: Haaland will have a good day out! 4-0AI's prediction: 3-0Vitality Stadium, 17:30Liverpool played really well against Marseille on Wednesday but I have a feeling they will find this game a lot more difficult.Mind you, Bournemouth are a nightmare to predict this season so, whatever I say here, the opposite is likely to happen. I have changed my mind a few times about this one - I started with a 1-1 draw, then went 2-1 to Bournemouth... but then I saw Liverpool have won on their past three visits here and a repeat result is what I have talked myself into in the end.It should be a great game, though, whatever the outcome. The Cherries are brilliantly strange, and I always think they have a goal in them - they will score here and have a real go at Liverpool, but I don't think they will quite get over the line.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Hardwicke's prediction: What happened with Mohamed Salah and Arne Slot before Christmas showed that players still fall out with their managers now, just like Roy did! Salah is back in the fold now - but however you deal with it, there is no way of knowing, as a manager, if you will get it right. 2-2AI's prediction: 1-3Sunday, 25 JanuaryGtech Community Stadium, 14:00It's the teams beginning with B that I am struggling most with this season - I don't seem able to predict what Brentford, Brighton or Bournemouth will do. I am not confident about getting Brentford right this time either.On paper, this seems pretty straightforward because they are so strong at home and Igor Thiago is in brilliant form, but I can see Nottingham Forest making it difficult for them because of the way they play.From what I've seen of Brentford this season, their gameplan is to keep it tight and look to counter quickly but Forest will do exactly the same.With Sean Dyche's side being so deep, they won't leave any space behind and they will also be looking to score on the break.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Hardwicke's prediction: Brentford are flying at the moment. 2-0AI's prediction: 1-1Selhurst Park, 14:00The wheels seem to be coming off in a big way at Palace. Marc Guehi has joined Manchester City, Oliver Glasner has hit out at the club's owners after announcing he will leave and now Jean-Philippe Mateta wants away.It feels as if Glasner does not want to be there and although he seems to have been forgiven for his outburst about the club's hierarchy after defeat at Sunderland last weekend, I just don't think he is going to be around much longer.Things are far from rosy for Chelsea at the moment either, and I feel a bit sorry for their manager Liam Rosenior. He is getting a kicking in certain places for some of his techniques and because he has come from Strasbourg, and I think that is unfair.He's an innovative young manager who has done well for himself, and is hungry and ambitious.If he was a young continental coach, we would be saying this guy is marvellous. Let's give him a chance.I don't see everything going smoothly for Rosenior this season, but Chelsea got over the line in the Champions League in midweek and I think they will do the same at Selhurst Park. I just don't know where Palace go from here, and it is really sad. Maybe the end will come quickly for Glasner, but he cannot continue to show his frustration publicly every week or two, because that is not going to move the club forward.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Hardwicke's prediction: I can see some goals here. 3-2AI's prediction: 0-2St James' Park, 14:00Aston Villa's home defeat by Everton last week showed again how difficult it is to make predictions this season.Villa had won their past 11 home games before then, and had been pretty dominant against Everton in the league in recent seasons too. I was extremely confident they would win to keep the pressure on Arsenal... and I was wrong!Now? Well, Unai Emery's side have a long trip to Turkey in the Europa League before this game and they have a few injuries to contend with too. John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara will be badly missed and I am slightly concerned about their options up front now Donyell Malen has left.That's why I'm backing Newcastle here. They are so strong in midfield but they are especially good at home - I always fancy them to win at St James' Park.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Hardwicke on why he supports Villa: It was completely by chance. My brothers were at their first football match in the early 1990s, and it was Oxford United against Villa - they were with a relative who was an Oxford fan. Villa were a big team then with lots of Irish players like Steve Staunton and Paul McGrath, so they went 'OK, we are Villa!' And I copied them. We have no connection with Birmingham at all, but I am very happy to have inherited that - although one of my brothers is now a Liverpool fan, and the other one doesn't care.Hardwicke's prediction: Villa are probably one of the most in-form teams in the world over the past couple of months. I am just the biggest fan of Unai Emery - he is an amazing coach and he typifies all that is great about the game. We hardly spent anything in the summer and a lot of fans were grumbling - I was one of them - but what we are doing just goes to show what Emery has built, and with a crop of young players. This will be a tough game for us, but we will win. 2-3AI's prediction: 2-2Emirates Stadium, 16:30Manchester United were brilliant under Michael Carrick in the Manchester derby. They totally deserved their win.Carrick has talked about finding some consistency to back up that performance and result but, even if they play well again here, it's a huge ask for them to go to the Emirates and get something.Arsenal dropped points against Nottingham Forest last time out in the Premier League but it still turned out to be a good weekend for them.I don't see Mikel Arteta's side slipping up this time. It will be fascinating to see if the 'Carrick effect' can last but even when Arsenal make changes I always think they will get the job done.Carrick had a plan for playing against City and it worked. He might have an idea about stopping Arsenal in open play too, but then United will still have their set-pieces to deal with.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Hardwicke's prediction: Roy would have been at front and centre of anything that happened in this game in the past! That clip of him and Patrick Vieira in the tunnel [in 2005] is amazing. If he was playing for United, he wouldn't be happy with my prediction, either! 2-1AI's prediction: 3-1Monday, 26 JanuaryHill Dickinson Stadium, 20:00I'm definitely adding Everton to my list of teams who are impossible to predict. They've had some brilliant results this season, and some really disappointing ones too.They will be without the injured Jack Grealish here but they were depleted against Villa last time out and they were brilliant in that game.Thierno Barry took his goal ever so well for their winner. I know it was close in but it was still a lovely finish. When you watch Barry closely, he is frustrating sometimes but he is a real nuisance and he is so good in the air. I was impressed by Harrison Armstrong and Merlin Rohl as well, and having Iliman Ndiaye back after winning the Afcon with Senegal will lift Everton too.Leeds beat Everton 1-0 at Elland Road with a late penalty at the start of the season, and this game will be just as tight.I was going to go for an Everton win by the same scoreline but then I thought about Dominic Calvert-Lewin coming back to his old club. He is bound to score, isn't he?Sutton's prediction: 1-1Hardwicke's prediction: 3-1AI's prediction: 2-1How did Sutton do last week?Chris got four correct results from the 10 Premier League matches in week 22 with no exact scores, for a total of 40 points.He beat AI, which managed only two correct results with no exact scores for a tally of 20 points, but not his guest, WWE superstar Drew McIntyre.Drew also managed four correct scores but that included one exact score, meaning he ended up on 70 points.The weekly win, however, went to the BBC readers. They managed three correct scores but had two exact results, giving them 90 points.",

    "body": "The search continues for missing people after a landslide hit a popular campsite in Mount Maunganui, on New Zealand's North Island.Six people remain unaccounted for, and police are seeking information on another three. Two teenagers are among the missing, with the youngest aged 15 years old, police said.Another landslide at the nearby Welcome Bay killed a grandmother and her grandchild, public service broadcaster Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported. One of them was a Chinese national, police told reporters on Friday.The landslides come after heavy rain pummelled parts of the North Island for days.Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who visited the disaster site on Friday, said it was \"inspiring\" to see the support pouring through the community, with neighbours and \"friends of friends of friends\" helping to clear debris in flood-hit areas.He said despite the tragedy he was \"incredibly impressed\" by the professionalism in the wake of the disaster.Key challenges remains, Luxon said, pointing to road access to isolated communities, continued risks of slips and flooding.Thunderstorms and strong winds are expected this weekend in Gisborne, where floods have cut off communities, and Tauranga, where the landslides happened, according to New Zealand's meteorological service.Much of the focus remained on the search and rescue mission, Luxon said.Besides the six people who are unaccounted for, police are appealing to the public for any information about another three people who might have been at the site.They are believed to be international tourists who may have already departed from the area, police district commander Tim Anderson said on Friday. \"We don't believe they're here, but we still got to do that inquiry.\"Rescuers have not seen any signs of life under the rubble today, Anderson said. But he added that they were still \"working 24/7\" and \"leaving no stone unturned\".Footage from the campsite on Mount Maunganui shows rescuers and sniffer dogs combing through crushed caravans and flattened tents.A tourist told broadcaster TVNZ that he had jumped out of the pool as he saw the huge landslide coming down. The sacred Māori site is a popular tourist attraction, though it has seen several landslides in recent years.At nearby Welcome Bay, police recovered two bodies in a house on Thursday after it was hit by a landslide. Another person at the scene was seriously injured, police said.\"We are sad to learn that two people are confirmed to have lost their lives, including a Chinese citizen, and a number of people remain unaccounted for\" at Mount Maunganui, said Wang Xiaolong, China's ambassador to New Zealand, on X.\"Our hearts are with the impacted families at this difficult moment.\"Elsewhere on North Island, the search has resumed for a missing man who had been swept away into Mahurangi River, north of Auckland, on Wednesday.His wife told RNZ that their family was still holding out hope for the 47-year-old, who had been a fisherman in Kiribati before moving to New Zealand in 2003. He knew how to swim and dive, and had seen big waves, she said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoThe Guardian focuses on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky's speech to European leaders at Davos - saying he took \"aim\" and accused them of being in \"Greenland mode\" waiting for Donald Trump's cue on Ukraine and other international crises. Zelensky also used his \"fiery\" speech to demand greater pressure on Russia as envoy Steve Witkoff arrives in Moscow for ongoing peace talks, the paper notes.\"Zelensky turns on Europe\" says the Independent, highlighting more criticism from the Ukrainian president, saying Europe \"loves to discuss the future but avoids taking action\" against Russia.In more developments at the World Economic Forum, the Financial Times pictures Donald Trump front and centre during the unveiling of his Board of Peace in Davos. The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.In UK news, the Time leads with news that former Labour minister Andrew Gwynne is standing down as an MP, paving the way for Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to a possible run in a by-election to return to the Commons. The paper says the  Sir Keir Starmer's allies will try to block Burnham's return and him potentially mounting a leadership challenge to the prime minister.The i Paper dubs the move \"Operation Stop Burnham\", quoting an ally of the PM who says the Labour party doesn't need \"an Andy Burnham circus\".\"Does Andy Burnham have the bottle?\" asks the Daily Mail. The paper also describes the Labour party \"descending into civil war\" over the news.In other election news, the Daily Telegraph reports that some \"4.5 million people are to be denied a vote\" after more councils in England were given permission to delay local elections in May.The Metro features images of multiple skyscrapers from Donald Trump's \"glitzy Middle East tourist vision\" for a rebuilt Gaza. The pictures are part of the US president's plan to turn the coast of Gaza, which has been devastated by 27 months of bombardment by Israel following the 7 October attacks, into a tourist destination by 2029. \"Gaza or gaga?\" the paper asks.The Daily Star stays with the Beckham family feud, showing Brooklyn Peltz Beckham and his wife Nicola taking a walk in their first public outing since addressing the row. The paper describes the couple as presenting a \"united front\".\"Glad we did it\" is the Sun's headline, reporting that Brooklyn is \"very happy\" at the reaction to his statement on the strained relationship with his parents.\"No regrets\" echoes the Daily Mirror with the same image of the couple at the top of its front page. But for its main story the Mirror describes Donald Trump's comment that Nato troops stayed off the frontlines during the war in Afghanistan as \"shameful\" and an \"insult\" to the more than 400 British troops who died.  Finally, the Daily Express along with campaigners are urging ministers to ensure mental health is a key part of the government's National Cancer Plan. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Just nowJemma CrewBusiness reporterDemand for online jewellery helped boost retail sales in December, despite a difficult festive period overall for retailers, figures show.Sales were up 0.4% from the previous month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, citing online jewellers reporting an increased demand for precious metals such as gold and silver.Internet shopping performed well, while there was a small rise for supermarkets and sales of automotive fuel. But sales for non-food retailers, such as department, clothing and household stores, were down 0.9%.The monthly rise - larger than expected - comes after sales fell unexpectedly in November, even though it included Black Friday sales. Retail sales had fallen by 0.1% in November, which followed a 0.8% drop in October. Monthly growth rates can be volatile, and ONS said sales volumes fell by 0.3% in the final three months of last year when compared to the previous quarter, with supermarkets and online stores both seeing a fall.But across 2025 as a whole, retail sales were up 1.3%, with stronger performances for both food and non-food stores, and non-store retailers (mainly online sellers but also street stalls and markets).This represents the second consecutive annual rise, but sales still remain below 2019 pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. ONS senior statistician Hannah Finselbach said: \"The last three months of the year saw a slight drop in retail sales following a strong third quarter, with supermarkets and online stores both down.\"However, sales were up in December, with internet retailing doing well. Within this, online jewellers had a strong month and told us there was higher demand for gold and silver.\"The rising cost of living has squeezed shoppers' purses, and businesses have complained of higher costs following changes announced in the past two Budgets.Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at Wealth Club, said the figures showed there was \"no festive cheer on the high street\" as Christmas shoppers increasingly turned online. \"Among online retailers, jewellers enjoyed a particularly golden Christmas. In uncertain times shoppers seem to be being drawn to dual purpose jewels that not only tick the Christmas present box, but provide a convenient long-term store of value as well.\"Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year. In recent days they reached record highs as investors reacted to the threat by US President Donald Trump to impose fresh tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland.Alice Cowley, managing director in Accenture's retail practice, said the \"modest\" monthly rise in UK retail sales would bring some relief after a \"difficult autumn\".\"But while food, discounts and holiday preparations pushed up sales, it wasn't enough to drive significant growth,\" she continued.\"With Christmas being a crucial time for the sector, those wishing for a bumper trading period were left disappointed.\"Neil Bellamy, consumer insights director at GfK, which analyses consumer confidence, said: \"We remain a long way from consumers feeling that better days are around the corner.\"GfK's latest consumer confidence index edged up by one point in January to minus 16, and it is now 10 years since the index showed a positive number.",

    "body": "The US has officially withdrawn from the World Health Organization (WHO), leaving the UN agency without one of its biggest donors.US President Donald Trump signed an executive order signalling the withdrawal a year ago, having criticised the organisation for being too \"China-centric\" during the Covid pandemic.The US Department of Health and Human Services said it took the decision due to the WHO's alleged \"mishandling\" of the pandemic, an inability to reform and political influence from member states.The WHO has rejected these claims and its director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the withdrawal was as a loss for the US and the world.The organisation pointed to its global efforts to combat polio, HIV aids, maternal mortality, and its international treaty on tobacco control.In the wake of the pandemic, WHO member states worked to create an international pandemic treaty designed to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemics, including sharing vaccines and drugs more fairly.The treaty was finally agreed in April last year by all WHO member states, apart from the US.Washington has traditionally been one of the biggest donors to the WHO, but has not paid its fees for 2024 and 2025, which has already caused huge job losses at the organisation.Although WHO lawyers suggest the US is obliged to pay the arrears - estimated at $260m (£193m) - Washington said it saw no reason to do so.It said that all US government funding to the WHO has been terminated, US personnel and contractors have been recalled from the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland and its offices worldwide, and hundreds of US engagements with WHO have been suspended or discontinued.\"The WHO tarnished and trashed everything that America has done for it,\" a joint statement from US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy and Secretary of State Marco Rubio read.The pair said the organisation had \"abandoned its core mission and acted repeatedly against the interests of the United States\", including failing to return the American flag based at its Geneva headquarters.\"Going forward, U.S. engagement with the WHO will be limited strictly to effectuate our withdrawal and to safeguard the health and safety of the American people,\" they added.The US department said it would have bilateral relations with other countries to ensure disease surveillance and pathogen sharing, but were unable to provide information about which specific countries they had such links with so far.In response to a question about global efforts to combat polio or HIV, officials said the US would partner with \"NGOs and faith based groups\" to continue that work, but could not give details of any partnerships yet established.Asked whether the US would continue to participate in information sharing for and development of the annual global flu vaccine, officials were not sure.After Trump signed the withdrawal order at the start of his second term, the WHO wrote that it hoped the US would reconsider, and said the \"WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats\".Its reconsideration would have been for the \"benefit of the health and well-being of millions of people around the globe\", it concluded.",

    "body": "10 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorGetty ImagesA marble sits at the top of a very long, elaborate and twisting run right now.If - and it's a big if - it trundles all the way to the bottom, Andy Burnham might become prime minister.But hang on a minute, let's not get ahead of ourselves.That marble might not even set off down the run, or might fly off spectacularly halfway down.The twists, turns and obstacles standing between the Greater Manchester mayor and a return to Westminster as an MP – a prerequisite for him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the Labour leadership – are substantial.Firstly, Burnham has to decide if he wants to go for it. On the upside for him, this is a contest close to home, in Greater Manchester. It is also a contest triggered by the departure of an MP on medical grounds. It would be hard for his critics to suggest Andrew Gwynne stepping down is part of an elaborate political plot.But, if Burnham does say he wants to run, he has to ask the Labour Party's National Executive Committee for permission.This body, the party's rule book sets out, must give its \"express permission\" before directly-elected mayors can seek nomination as Labour candidates for elections to the Westminster Parliament. So the party could turn around and say no – on the grounds that a mayoral election would be expensive and potentially politically tricky. Plus, frankly, there are those within Labour who would rather he didn't come back to Westminster, such has been, as they see it, the gratuitous nature of his manoeuvring for the top job. But it is also true that plenty within the Labour movement think he could be something of a saviour for a party and a government that are really struggling.If Burnham is rejected - the marble flying off the run - what does he do next? He has a big enough stage, megaphone and profile to do the prime minister real damage, should he choose to do so.And what happens if he does stand? The by-election would attract vast attention.Andrew Gwynne won the Gorton and Denton seat comfortably at the last general election, but Labour's popularity has nosedived since.'No means a certainty'Reform UK and the Green Party finished second and third respectively, and many suspect they could both be much more competitive this time.Reform's leader Nigel Farage was quick to relish what lies ahead.\"This by-election is by no means a certainty for Labour, the left-wing Greens will split their vote, and we will be the challenger. We will give it our all,\" he said.It is far from certain, even in this scenario where Andy Burnham is the Labour candidate, that he makes it back to Westminster.But it is also true this might be his one chance to return to Westminster, in a seat in his patch, with a vulnerable prime minister and plenty of chat among Labour MPs about who might replace him.So finally, let's imagine he is Labour's candidate and he wins. It is entirely possible he would do so just as Labour did badly in elections in Scotland and Wales, and the local elections in many parts of England in May.And so he would arrive on those green benches in the Commons at just the point many Labour folk anticipate the prime minister reaches his stickiest moment yet. Is this the point he is a challenger for the Labour leadership, alongside others?As I say, this marble run is long and twisting. But it could become the political spectator sport of the spring. ",

    "body": "1 hour agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandTabby WilsonSocial media platforms do not want Australia's landmark social media ban to be successful in case it incentivises other countries to follow suit, the nation's internet regulator has told the BBC.\"These companies have come to this regime, if you will, kicking and screaming - very very reluctantly,\" eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.Australia began forcing social media firms to block users aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms in December, a policy being closely watched by other world governments.The UK is considering similar legislation; this week, the House of Lords voted to support a ban for under-16s via an amendment to the government's schools bill.Australia's ban was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.Companies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online, but don't think a blanket ban is the answer, with some experts raising similar concerns.In an update earlier this month, the Australian government said 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children had already been shut down, declaring the policy a huge success.Inman Grant told the BBC children had proved to be an \"incredibly lucrative\" market for social media platforms, noting the addictive properties of platforms that were initially designed for adults.\"They're building a pipeline for the future, and they do not want this to be the first domino,\" she said, adding that they do not have a \"huge incentive\" to \"perfectly\" comply with the ban.\"We've always had to play a bit of a dance with the tech companies, clearly they don't like to be regulated.\"With the legislation coming into effect just over a month ago, Inman Grant said researchers were still carefully monitoring the resulting shifts in behaviour among young people.One criticism had been that under-16s would simply migrate to other platforms following the ban, but Inman Grant said the data indicated otherwise. While there was an initial spike in downloads of other social media applications, she claims there has been no sustained uptick in their usage.Another concern had been that children would circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.Under the law, firms face fines of up to A$49.5m ($33m, £24.5m) if they fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep children off their platforms, and Inman Grant said a second series of concerns notices is about to be sent to companies, naming the platform Snapchat as a key focus.\"[The policy] is certainly exceeding our expectations, but we are playing the long game here,\" she said, adding that regulators will always have to take a dynamic approach to the safety of young people online.Australia is not the first country to experiment with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, it is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.Ten platforms are currently included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch. It currently does not include dating websites, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord, or AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.Social media platforms have regularly pushed back on the legislation, with Meta arguing that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.Though Reddit has complied with the ban, it has also launched a challenge in Australia's highest court, where it will argue that the policy has serious implications for privacy and political rights.Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats.\"We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she told parliament in November.",

    "body": "Warning: This report contains discriminatory, homophobic language that some may find distressing.The BBC has apologised to a former radio presenter after an internal investigation found a failure to act in response to homophobic abuse.Jack Murley alleged he was called homophobic names, including \"fairy boy\", by other staff members and told to sound \"less gay\" on air by a manager.The 37-year-old was dismissed from BBC Radio Cornwall in 2024 for breaching the organisation's editorial and social media guidelines after posting online about proposed changes to BBC Local. An employment tribunal found it was \"reasonable\" and not a result of discrimination over his sexuality.In a subsequent letter to Murley, the BBC's chief operating officer across Nations, Jason Horton, apologised on behalf of the organisation for \"the behaviours and comments\" he was subject to.\"We have worked hard to change the culture for the better across management and the wider team,\" Horton said in the letter, adding that work had been done to address the recommendations made.Horton acknowledged the BBC accepted all the findings but did not believe there were grounds for a financial payout to Murley.Murley said he was \"grateful\" to his former colleagues who had provided witness evidence.\"At a time when I was producing an award-winning LGBTQ+ show for the BBC, I was being subjected to the kind of homophobic and bigoted behaviours from BBC staff members that would have been unacceptable decades ago – let alone in a modern workplace,\" he said.He added: \"I am glad that the BBC has finally admitted that people in positions of power created and sustained an environment in which my abuse was explicitly and implicitly tolerated by those who should have been expected to stop it.\"A BBC spokesperson said: \"While we don't comment on individual cases, we take any reports of our workplace values not being upheld extremely seriously.\"If we receive information or allegations to suggest this is not the case we have robust processes in place to investigate. The BBC is an inclusive organisation and discrimination of any kind is not tolerated.\"A leaked report by the corporation's whistleblowing team, detailed that internal investigators examined 12 allegations of abuse and lack of action by management - finding there to be a \"case to answer\" in eight of these.The 38-page report contains witness statements from Murley, as well as his colleagues and bosses at the station.It notes that many of those who gave evidence did so anonymously for fear of retaliation.Two of the claims relate to a particular colleague who on one occasion found his car blocked by Murley's car in the office car park.He allegedly said something to the effect of \"fairy boy, you need to move your car\".Murley reported that this staff member's behaviour was widely known, but felt there was an onus on him to \"laugh it off\".He provided witness evidence for the two incidents involving this staff member and the report found there was a case to answer.Murley reported that another staff member told a joke in front of colleagues, which included the homophobic slur \"poof\". The report found there was a case to answer for.In a separate incident with a different colleague, Murley reported being in the staff kitchen talking about being able to donate blood after a change in the law - something he was previously unable to do as a gay man.Murley claimed the staff member entered the kitchen and said: \"I can understand why you were banned (from giving blood). Statistically, your lot are a lot more likely to die of Aids, that's just a numerical fact.\"The report found that this incident was witnessed by two people, and there was a case to answer for it.Jack Murley also said he was receiving homophobic abuse in emails, texts, and phone calls from listeners - including one incident in which he received an envelope with Bible verses and homophobic remarks.After approaching a senior manager, Murley claims he was shocked by the response - in which the manager said it was not his job to deal with the abuse, and the only solution he could offer was for Murley to be \"less gay\" on air.For this claim, the report found that Murley had provided direct evidence. Five witnesses gave indirect circumstantial evidence that supported Murley's claim he was not taken seriously.",

    "body": "World number one Aryna Sabalenka said she was \"emotionally all over the place\" as she squeezed past Anastasia Potapova to reach the Australian Open fourth round.The Belarusian, a heavy favourite for a title she has already won twice, was cruising at a set and 4-0 up.However, the 27-year-old was left feeling \"disconnected from my body\" as 55th-ranked Potapova fought back, with Sabalenka forced to fend off four set points before clinching a 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (9-7) victory.Afterwards, a reflective Sabalenka admitted it was a match she would have gone on to lose earlier in her career.Sabalenka lost two Grand Slam finals last year, first to Madison Keys in Melbourne before committing 70 unforced errors in the French Open showpiece against Coco Gauff.By her own admission, she can \"lose control\" of her emotions when the biggest prizes in tennis are on the line, and she previously worked with a psychologist to improve that aspect of her game.She has reached at least the semi-finals at 13 of the past 16 Grand Slam tournaments she has contested, winning four majors across the past three seasons and establishing herself as the dominant player in the women's game.\"Aryna five years ago would be focusing too much on the way she feels and completely lose these matches,\" Sabalenka said.\"I learned that it doesn't really matter how you feel, it's all about your mentality, your mental strength to be there, try your best, return the ball ugly with terrible technique and your body being completely disconnected.\"When you see that things are not working, the only tactic you have is to fight.\"Sabalenka, who needed two hours and two minutes to beat Austria's Potapova, displayed her new-found resilience by extending her record streak in Grand Slam tie-breaks.She has won each of the past 19 tie-breaks she has contested at the majors - the longest run by a woman in the Open era, and matched only by Novak Djokovic (2005-07) in active singles players.Sabalenka will continue her bid for a third title in four years in Melbourne with a fourth-round match against Canadian 19-year-old Victoria Mboko.\"I'm super happy with my mentality today. I think it was the only thing that really helped me get the win,\" Sabalenka said.\"It was one of those days you have to fight to try and get the ball back.\"Emotionally I was all over the place. I was trying to figure out how to connect my body. \"It seemed like everything was working separately; my brain was somewhere else, my arms were going one direction. Magically, I was able to get this win.\"",

    "body": "Some former state employees across the country have been left with no income this month after the company managing civil service pensions failed to pay them.The Civil Service Pension Scheme, which manages the pensions of 1.7 million public sector workers in the UK, has been unable to provide lump sums or regular payments to many people since Capita took over administration of the scheme in December.Capita said it had been left with a much bigger backlog of cases than originally agreed and apologised to those affected.One retiree, Steve Duell, said that he will have to borrow to pay his bills if he does not receive his pension by the end of the month.The 65-year-old from Hull retired on 1 January after 40 years at the Land Registry. He should have received a lump sum shortly afterwards but has received no information at all about his retirement package.Steve has made numerous attempts to contact the administrators, including spending nearly 15 hours on the phone on hold, he told the BBC.\"We've got no money, and we've got lots of financial commitments.\"We need to pay off car loans and make mortgage payments. We arranged to get building work done on the  house, on the basis of expecting a lump sum at start of January,\" he told the BBC.The outsourcing services firm, Capita, took over the contract in December after a lead-in time of two years. It administers pensions for public sector institutions including HMRC, the MOD, the Welsh government, the Scottish government, Transport Scotland, the Crown Prosecution Service, Defra and the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office. Paul McKenna, from Liverpool, spent most of his working life working with the Inland Revenue and HMRC.Now aged 59, he planned to retire early on health grounds, after having a heart bypass operation. He gave the required five months' notice to start his pension, before finishing work on 30 November.He had hoped to use his lump sum to pay off his mortgage, then live off his pension payments, but is still waiting.\"The worry has been affecting my sleep, it's bad for my angina. \"I'm supposed to be getting married in September, but this has left me with lots of uncertainty,\" he said.When he telephoned he waited for an hour on hold before being given the message:  'The building is on fire and we've had to evacuate'.\"He said that happened twice, before getting through, only to be told his case was with the \"resolutions team\".Capita has previously faced criticism over their management of teachers' pensions in England and Wales, and has lost that contract to rival Tata.Until the end of November 2025, the Civil Service Pension Scheme was administered by a company called MyCSP. The contract was taken over by Capita on 1 December, in a seven-year deal worth £239m.Capita launched a new online portal, for customers to access projections of their expected pensions and lump sum payments. But the portal launch was plagued with problems.In a statement to the BBC Capita said that when they took over they had expected a backlog of 37,000 cases, but the actual number of outstanding cases was 86,000.  Capita says it now has over 500 people working on the project, double that of the previous provider.\"Our teams are working tirelessly to clear the backlog we inherited and resolve member queries as quickly as possible. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused to our members,\" Capita said in a statement.Parliament's Public Accounts Committee warned in October that Capita would not be ready for the planned takeover.Committee chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP, said at the time: \"It is deeply frustrating for this committee to be scrutinising an issue that ought to be as seamlessly run as civil service pensions. \"Scheme members who have dedicated their careers to public service ought to be secure in the knowledge that it is under sound administration.\"Responsibility for managing the administrator contract rests with the Cabinet Office. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said it remained \"committed to working with Capita to ensure the scheme's success and [to] safeguard the interests of all members.\"We are aware of the issues some members have faced and we have instructed Capita to fix them urgently,\" the spokesperson added.\"We have been assured that Capita is rolling out targeted fixes to better meet the demands of members and employers.\"Fran Heathcote, general secretary of the PCS union, which represents civil servants said: \"This fiasco is extremely distressing for those who have worked and paid into their pension all their working lives.\"We believe that this work should be run by the civil service, under ministerial control, so that it can be properly resourced and pensions paid on time.\"",

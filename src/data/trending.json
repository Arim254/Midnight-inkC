    "body": "<div><p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has told the BBC she was \"disappointed\" pro-Palestinian protests went ahead on Thursday in the wake of the terror attack that killed two men outside a synagogue in Manchester.</p><p>The home secretary also called for demonstrators to \"step back\" from plans to hold marches in coming days.</p><p>\"I do think that carrying on in this way does feel un-British, it feels wrong,\" she said of protests planned for this week.</p><p>Demonstrators in central London protesting the Israeli navy halting a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza clashed with police officers outside of Downing Street on Thursday evening.</p></div><div><p>Large crowds carrying Palestinian flags and placards could be seen on Whitehall into the evening.</p><p>The Metropolitan Police said 40 people had been arrested. Six of those detained were arrested for assaults on police officers.</p><p>\"It is important to draw a line between what is happening in the Middle East and what is happening at home,\" Mahmood told BBC Breakfast on Friday.</p><p>\"I would say to people who are planning to go on a protest is to just take a step back for a minute, and imagine if you had lost a loved one to a terror attack in this country,\" she said.</p><p>There were \"strong\" powers to protect the freedom to protest, she said, but they could be overridden on the advice of the police.</p><p>\"I can take my lead from the police, if they were to tell me there was an inability to respond and to police the protests, then there are powers that are available,\" she explained.</p><p>The UK's Chief Rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme that many members of the Jewish community wondered why marches in support of Palestine Action had been allowed to take place.</p><p>\"Some of them contain outright antisemitism, outright support for Hamas. Not every single person, however there is so much of this, which certainly is dangerous to many within our society.</p><p>\"You cannot separate the words on our streets, the actions of people in this way, and what inevitably results, which was yesterday's terrorist attack.\"</p><p>He also called on the government \"yet again\", to \"get a grip on these demonstrations, they are dangerous\".</p><p>\"You cannot separate the words on our streets, the actions of people in this way,\" he said, adding that \"what inevitably results\" is a terror attack. </p></div>"

    "body": "<div><p>Convicted rap mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has written a letter to the judge overseeing his criminal trial, asking for leniency during his sentencing on Friday and blaming his past behaviour on drug addiction.</p><p>In the four-page letter, he apologises \"for all of the hurt and pain that I have caused\" and says that he has been reformed after spending 13 months in a Brooklyn jail. </p><p>The letter on Thursday comes hours ahead of his sentencing hearing at 10:00 ET (15:00GMT) on Friday.</p><p>In July, he was found guilty of two prostitution charges and now faces up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 11 years, but Combs' lawyers are asking that he be released later this month.</p></div><div><p>In his letter to Judge Arun Subramanian, Combs apologises for assaulting his ex-girlfriend, singer Cassie Ventura, writing: \"I literally lost my mind\". </p><p>\"I'm sorry for that and always will be,\" he continues. \"My domestic violence will always be heavy burden that will have to forever carry.\"</p><p>He also apologies to an anonymous woman who testified during the trial under the name \"Jane\" and says he became \"lost in the drugs and the excess\". </p><p>\"I lost my way,\" he wrote. \"My downfall was rooted in my selfishness. I have been humbled and broken to my core.\"</p></div><div><p>Combs' accusers have also written to the judge, describing how he wielded his power and influence to ruin their lives, and their fears that he would seek revenge if freed. </p><p>\"I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up,\" wrote Ms Ventura.</p><p>She added that she believes he deserves a long sentence, writing: \"He has no interest in changing or becoming better. He will always be the same cruel, power-hungry, manipulative man that he is.\" </p><p>In his letter, Combs describes teaching a class to fellow inmates on \"what I did to become a successful business man\", describing himself as a changed person who is now sober for the first time in 25 years. </p><p>\"The old me died in jail and new version of me was reborn,\" he writes. </p><p>Combs goes on to ask the judge for mercy, \"not only for my sake, but for the sake of my children\". He asked the judge to consider his seven kids, and his 84-year-old mother who recently had brain surgery. </p><p>He notes that the judge might be tempted to make an example out of him and instead asks that he be made an example of \"what a person can do if afforded a second chance\". </p><p>Combs is also expected to speak in court on Friday before the judge issues his sentence. Four of his lawyers are also slated to speak, and his defence team also plans to show a 15-minute video. It's unclear what the video may include.</p><p>In July, a jury acquitted him of the most severe charges: racketeering and sex trafficking - which could have resulted in him spending the rest of his life behind bars. He was found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.</p><p>Prosecutors say he is \"unrepentant\" and argued the rapper should spend a minimum of 11 years in prison. </p><p>\"The defendant tries to recast decades of abuse as simply the function of mutually toxic relationships,\" prosecutors wrote in a 29 September filing. \"But there is nothing mutual about a relationship where one person holds all the power and the other ends up bloodied and bruised.\"</p></div>"

As well as surgical errors, she was found to have had poor insight into her own levels of competence, partly through being inexperienced, and that she had failed to seek help from more senior colleagues.</p><p>At the time of the complaints, the cardiac unit at the Freeman was in disarray. A Royal College of Surgeons report in 2021 found a problematic working culture, while internal hospital reports criticised poor governance procedures, a reluctance from senior staff to take responsibility and an inadequate multi-disciplinary team (MDT) process - in which clinicians should come together prior to surgery to discuss the best options for patients.</p><p>Responding to the BBC, the hospital acknowledged the problems with the unit's culture, saying it tried to protect patients at all times.</p><p>It said it was \"currently considering\" the next stage of Ms Booth's phased return, \"in line with appropriate standards, review recommendations and external advice\". It did not respond to the BBC's questions as to whether it was safe for patients for Ms Booth to return to the cardiac unit, given the strong opposition from some of her colleagues.</p><p>In a statement, the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust said it acts \"in the best interests of patients\" and seeks \"to maintain and protect patient safety at all times, taking account of concerns shared by clinical colleagues\".</p></div></article>"

They are allowed to have an opinion on it. I heard their opinion,\" said a downcast Postecoglou, who was also jeered as he walked down the tunnel at full-time.</p><p>\"Nothing surprises me in football. It's the climate we're in. It seems that's the way things are going. It's nothing I can control.\"</p><p>It was just over four months ago when Postecoglou was lifting this competition's trophy with Spurs, but he was dismissed 16 days later, paying the price for a dire domestic campaign. Now he is struggling to get results right at another club.</p><p>The first European game at the City Ground for 29 years ended in crushing disappointment, and the finger of blame was pointed at Postecoglou before the final whistle had blown.</p><p>Rubbing it in, fans then sang in praise of Postecoglou's predecessor Nuno Espirito Santo, who is now with West Ham.</p><p>Nuno guided Forest to seventh place in the Premier League last season before being sacked as his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis broke down.</p><p>Defeat to Midtjylland came after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cx2jpplkn88t\">Saturday's 1-0 home loss to Sunderland</a> in the Premier League.</p><p>These results have changed the mood at Forest, with supporters also turning to question Marinakis.</p><p>\"My responsibility is to make sure we get some wins for this football club and progress it,\" said Postecoglou.</p><p>\"I would prefer if people were optimistic in their outlook of what I'm doing. I can only change that by winning games of football.</p><p>\"Irrespective, that's not going to change the way I'm taking things on. I really believe in the process of what we're doing and I don't think we're far away from being the  team that can eradicate the situation we're in at the moment and get the results.\"</p><p>Forest spent around £180m in the summer, looking to build on last season's success, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2en2xnpvlno\">Nuno was sacked last month</a> after his relationship with Marinakis worsened.</p><p>Postecoglou replaced him on 9 September, but Forest have failed to sustain last season's momentum and struggled against their visitors from the Danish Superliga.</p><p>The Australian head coach believes his team remain close to a breakthrough. </p><p>\"Yes I do, nothing I saw tonight changes any of that,\" Postecoglou said. \"I get the mood around the place isn't going to be great, and I understand people's attitude at the moment, particularly towards me, but it's not unfamiliar territory for me.</p><p>\"I believe we are on the right track and when we get through this period of uncertainty we are in, we will be on a good path.\"</p><p>Chris Wood's stoppage-time penalty could not save Forest who earlier conceded first-half goals from Ousmane Diao and Mads Bech, either side of Dan Ndoye's equaliser.</p><p>Forest drew 2-2 at Real Betis last week and go to Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday before the international break.</p><p>Postecoglou said: \"It's a really poor outcome from us. It was an important night for many reasons and [a] similar tale, us letting ourselves down in key moments and having a mountain to climb.</p><p>\"If you allow the opportunity to score every time they get near your goal, it's going to be hard to win games of football.\"</p></div><div><p>We know that Marinakis is not afraid to make swift changes if he feels things are not working.</p><p>At Olympiacos he sacked ex-Huddersfield manager Carlos Corberan after just 48 days as head coach, while Nuno's departure came weeks after he signed a new three-year deal.</p><p>Now the spotlight falls on Postecoglou.</p><p>\"I feel he will get extra time because he was appointed by the owner,\" former Forest and West Ham striker Michail Antonio said on TNT Sports.</p><p>\"He will give him extra time to get his philosophy going, because right now it feels he is struggling to get his tactics across to the players.\"</p><p>Former Forest and Leicester boss Martin O'Neill added: \"Wins are the name of the game - it is as simple as that.</p><p>\"The crowd were already against him in many aspects, but we are six games in, you'd hardly know the name of the tea lady after that amount of time.\"</p><p>On the boos, O'Neill added: \"You have to deal with all the noise around you. You can't allow it to dictate everything, but you can't avoid it.\"</p></div>"

There is a good balance to their team because they carry a threat and can dig in too.</p><p>Apart from a heavy defeat at Arsenal, they have been competitive in every game so far and their good start would have been even better but for late goals against Fulham and Bournemouth. </p><p>Even so, they have got more points than I expected at this stage and Daniel Farke deserves a lot of credit. </p><p>I think there were question marks over whether he could manage at this level because of his Premier League record with Norwich but, as I've said before, he never really had the squad there to be able to compete.</p><p>Tottenham have had a difficult week, having to fight back to rescue draws against Wolves and Bodo/Glimt, and this is going to be another tricky game for them.</p><p>I can actually see it ending in another draw for Spurs. At least they played in the Arctic Circle on Tuesday night rather than Wednesday but a lunchtime kick-off on Saturday is still far from ideal, and this Champions League campaign is going to stretch their squad.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-1</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> I asked in my Leeds WhatsApp group about how much can I say we will win by before I sound like a lunatic, and they were all like '6-0' but that is not going to happen! I want to say 4-1 but it will be a lot closer than that too.</p><p>I do think we will win, though, because Spurs don't look that coherent as a team yet. Also, Elland Road is a fortress and the home crowd will just about get us over the line. 2-1</p><p><b>Rod's favourite Leeds players: </b>Gary Speed was a real hero of mine.

Gary McAllister and Gordon Strachan were fantastic too, and a certain Frenchman who was also part of our title-winning team that I can't really talk about now. </p><p>Speed was the one, though, right up until Alan Smith came through - but then he ended up going to the wrong place as well!</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 1-2</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p>Emirates Stadium, 15:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>West Ham have won on their past two visits to Emirates Stadium but I don't look at Arsenal at the moment and see a team that is going to drop points.</p><p>The Hammers grew into the game against Everton in Nuno Espirito Santo's first match in charge but I am expecting the Gunners to be too strong for them.</p><p>Arsenal are a powerhouse at the moment and their squad depth is frightening. Defensively they are outstanding - they have conceded only three goals in six league games, the fewest in the Premier League - and this should be comfortable for them.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 3-0</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> I was trying to be kind to West Ham here, but they have not looked brilliant so far.

The other one was against Burnley in week two, where I went for a draw... and they suffered their only defeat of the season.</p><p>I am going to do the dirty on them this week, and I am going to predict they will win - which obviously means they won't - so apologies to all Sunderland supporters, because they must be absolutely furious with me for doing this.</p><p>I am not just backing them for the sake of it, clearly. They are extremely well organised and everything about them has been impressive.</p><p>Manchester United, on the other hand, are still a mess.</p><p>You can blame Ruben Amorim for that as much as you like but when your centre-half is running out and taking a chance on an offside on a long ball, like Harry Maguire did for Brentford's first goal last week, then that is just terrible defending.</p><p>That's where I feel for Amorim. Altay Bayindir should also have done better with Brentford's second goal and the goalkeeping situation is perplexing too - they have brought Senne Lammens in, but where is he?</p><p>It is just all muddled thinking at United and Amorim is starting to look like a guy who wants to be put out of his misery.</p><p>They are just not improving under him, although he might actually get a result here off the back of me saying Sunderland will win.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 0-1</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> I am going to sound a bit mean here but you wouldn't expect anything less from a Leeds fan, would you!? I want United to do OK until we play them (in January) because I don't want them to get rid of Amorim. Sunderland miffed me a little bit over the summer because they seemed to sign everyone we went for, but they have looked what I'd call 'solid-plus' so far and I feel like they will cause United some problems. 1-1</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 1-0</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p>Stamford Bridge, 17:30 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>Chelsea's back-to-back league defeats by Manchester United and Brighton have been a classic case of them shooting themselves in the foot.</p><p>If they had kept 11 men on the pitch in both matches it would have had a huge impact.</p><p>So, that's their first aim here and if it's 11 v 11 then Chelsea can hurt Liverpool, even without Cole Palmer, because the Reds are at sixes and sevens at the back.</p><p>I am tempted to go with a draw but this is a big game and I want to be brave and pick a winner. </p><p>AI will probably go for a draw [Sutton does not know anyone else's predictions when he makes his] to try to bore its way to its first win of the season.</p><p>I am going to stick my neck out and back my old team to make it a hat-trick of defeats for Arne Slot.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 2-1</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> Liverpool did not look like themselves against Palace but I think they will come flying out of the gate here and bounce back.

They play Feyenoord in the Europa League on Thursday and their squad is gong to be stretched.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more I quite fancy Burnley for a draw here. </p><p>To lose 5-1 last week was harsh on them, and they had frustrated Manchester City for a long time, the same as they did when they were beaten by Liverpool, and that is likely to be their gameplan here too.</p><p>My heart says Villa will win because of my time there - I almost reached double figures in appearances - but my head says Burnley... and, this time, I am going to listen.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-1</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> Off the back of beating Fulham, Villa might get that bounce at home and just edge this. I can't see it being a big score, anyway. 1-0</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 1-0</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p>Hill Dickinson Stadium, 14:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>This should be a good game, and a real test of whether Everton's new ground is actually the 'fortress' my 606 co-host Roman Kemp describes it as.</p><p>Everton are still unbeaten there but they've drawn two out of three games so far and the handbrake is still on, isn't it? Maybe's Roman's definition of a fortress is just different to most other people's.</p><p>There will be no gung-ho tactics here, either, because this is going to be a really tight affair between two very clever managers. But after watching Palace last week I have to back them really.</p><p>Oliver Glasner's side were quite direct against Liverpool and it will be a good battle if they do the same here.</p><p>I enjoy watching Everton and, in particular, Jack Grealish, but I worry about their firepower up front. </p><p>If they had a goalscorer I would probably say they would get something, but instead I am going with Palace to keep a clean sheet and to take home the points.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 0-1</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> Palace are flying at the moment, but Everton are well organised and much improved from last season.

I should probably get an award for being so bold with my predictions, even when I'm wrong.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-2</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> Wolves looked pretty poor against us. When we played them, everyone was downbeat in the Leeds chat groups when we were losing - then suddenly we scored three goals and everything was rosy! 1-2</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 0-1</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p>Gtech Community Stadium, 16:30 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>City were up against counter-attacking Monaco on Wednesday, and Brentford will be playing in exactly the same way.</p><p>I was at the Monaco game for 5 Live and I am not fully convinced by City, despite their current six-game unbeaten run.</p><p>On the up side for Pep Guardiola's side, Phil Foden was excellent again and Erling Haaland's finishing was ridiculously good - his header for City's second goal was like watching me in the 1990s, and he looks unstoppable.</p><p>Foden looked sharp as anything, especially in the first half. Seeing him back in form is good for England boss Thomas Tuchel as well as for Guardiola, as opposed to last season when he was inconsistent and couldn't find his level.</p><p>I still think City have got issues in a number of positions, however. In the centre of midfield Nico Gonzalez has been disappointing since he came in, and the whole of their right flank is a massive problem.</p><p>Bernardo Silva had such little effect on the game, and behind him there is a lack of trust in the right-back area as well.</p><p>Brentford will try to hit them on the break and there is a chance they could sucker City, but Foden and Haaland should be the difference between the two sides.</p><p>It will be close, but I don't see the Bees beating another Manchester team after their win over United last week.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-2</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> It feels like City have started to look like their old selves, with a couple of wobbles here and there. 1-2</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 0-2</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"How-did-Sutton-do-last-week\"><span>How did Sutton do last week?</span></h2><p></p><div><p>The outcome of week six was not decided until the final game, between Everton and West Ham on Monday.</p><p>One of Sutton's guests, Kidwild, was spot on with his 1-1 prediction, which denied AI its first outright victory.</p><p>Chris and the BBC readers both got two correct results with one exact score from the 10 games, giving you and him <b>50 points.</b></p><p>AI got three correct results, with one exact score, for a total of <b>60 points.</b></p><p>There were two guests, rappers Kidwild and Blanco - Kidwild got four correct results with one exact score for 70 points, while Blanco got two correct results with one exact score for 50 points - meaning they ended up with an average of <b>60 points </b>too.</p><p>\"I don't count shared wins,\" said Sutton. \"It's a draw.\"</p></div><div><div><h2>Weekly wins, ties and total points after week six</h2><div><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Wins</th><th>Ties</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chris</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>420</td></tr><tr><td>Guests</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>380</td></tr><tr><td>You</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>460</td></tr><tr><td>AI</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>380</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><span><span><p>Source: BBC</p><svg height=\"15\" width=\"45\"></svg></span></span></p></div><p><img alt=\"Weekly wins, ties and total points after week six. .  .\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/920/idt2/idt2/c1caf287-79ec-427f-bff6-9fe18ca080e9/image/460\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/920/idt2/idt2/c1caf287-79ec-427f-bff6-9fe18ca080e9/image/460 920w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1280/idt2/idt2/c1caf287-79ec-427f-bff6-9fe18ca080e9/image/640 1280w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1632/idt2/idt2/c1caf287-79ec-427f-bff6-9fe18ca080e9/image/816 1632w\" /></p></div><div><div><h2>Guest leaderboard 2025-26</h2><div><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>James Skelly</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>James Walsh</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>You *</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Chris Sutton * & Kidwild</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>AI *</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>Tommy Longhurst</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Blanco, Orlando Bloom,</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Theo Ellis & Tom Grennan</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Katherine Parlour</td><td>10</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><span>* Average after six weeks</span><span><span><p>Source: BBC</p><svg height=\"15\" width=\"45\"></svg></span></span></p></div><p><img alt=\"Guest leaderboard 2025-26. .  * Average after six weeks.\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/920/idt2/idt2/3ecfee8b-0b1f-4fa1-9cf0-302c69245be9/image/460\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/920/idt2/idt2/3ecfee8b-0b1f-4fa1-9cf0-302c69245be9/image/460 920w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1280/idt2/idt2/3ecfee8b-0b1f-4fa1-9cf0-302c69245be9/image/640 1280w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1632/idt2/idt2/3ecfee8b-0b1f-4fa1-9cf0-302c69245be9/image/816 1632w\" /></p></div><section><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p></section></article>"

She had been told conventional treatment would give her a high chance of survival, but rejected chemotherapy in favour of alternative methods, like juices and coffee enemas.</p><p>Paloma's twin brother Gabriel has long pointed the finger at their mother Kate. He strongly believes that Kate's beliefs were behind Paloma's decision to reject chemotherapy.</p><p>On Thursday, coroner Catherine Wood said Paloma was \"highly influenced\" by her mother's beliefs - as well as others including a family friend and her dad. They all advocated the alternative treatment she used.</p><p>\"The influence that was brought to bear on Paloma... did contribute more than minimally to her death,\" the coroner said.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/63fa/live/cd414fb0-9ec9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/63fa/live/cd414fb0-9ec9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/63fa/live/cd414fb0-9ec9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/63fa/live/cd414fb0-9ec9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/63fa/live/cd414fb0-9ec9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/63fa/live/cd414fb0-9ec9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/63fa/live/cd414fb0-9ec9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/63fa/live/cd414fb0-9ec9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Kate Shemirani addresses protesters through a megaphone \n\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Paloma's mother Kate Shemirani, a former nurse, lost her licence to practise in 2021</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Kate Shemirani, a former nurse with 80,000 followers on X, lost her licence to practise in 2021 - a Nursing and Midwifery Council committee found she had spread Covid-19 misinformation that \"put the public at a significant risk of harm\".</p><p>Gabriel says that his childhood was engulfed by outlandish misinformation about 9/11 being \"an inside job\" and the Royal Family being shape-shifting lizards. Above all, he claims he and Paloma were subject to false health information.</p><p>When he last spoke to his mother on the phone, Gabriel says he vowed to, \"hold [her] accountable\". </p><p>For her part, Kate Shemirani has remained firm that the decision to reject chemotherapy was entirely Paloma's own and she has promoted a range of unproven theories holding the NHS and medics responsible for her death. Paloma's father Faramarz Shemirani expressed similar views at the Coroner's court.</p><p>Both during the inquest and when I contacted her about my original investigation, Kate repeatedly rejected any accusations that her beliefs or behaviour played a part in Paloma's choices and her ultimately losing her life.

This is already the case in Wales and Scotland.</p><p>\"Sadly there are too many cases where practitioners cannot reach individuals because somebody else is getting in the way,\" he says.</p><p>But Iain Mansfield, director of research at Policy Exchange, urges caution. </p><p>\"I think this term 'misinformation' could be used to tilt that balance in quite a dangerous direction away from parents in favour of [the] state, which even if we trust it now to act well, it might not act well in future.\"</p><p>\"It really comes back to who defines misinformation,\" he continues. \"Who are you giving that power to? Do you want to give the power to a government?

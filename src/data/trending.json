Doctors need to know they will have jobs. And they need to know they will be paid what they're worth.\"</p><p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting, however, has been adamant that he will not negotiate on pay and, instead, his team have kept the talks centred on working conditions, exam fees, rotas and career progression.</p><p>It comes after resident doctors were awarded a 22% pay rise over the last two years, with another 5.4% increase this year.</p><p>The BMA says pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.</p><p>Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said: \"Training bottlenecks are a very real issue for resident doctors, which is why the government is already working on a range of measures to tackle them.\"</p><p>Alongside the additional 1,000 training places, he said steps were also being taken to prioritise UK graduates for posts.</p><p>\"The result is that current first-year doctors will emerge from their foundation training into a very different professional landscape from that which exists today,\" he added.</p></div>",

Epstein died in prison in 2019.</p></div><div><p>Family members of Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre told the BBC they were grateful for the court's denial and committed to ensuring she served her full sentence. </p><p>The justice department did not immediately comment.</p><p>She was recently interviewed by federal agents in the US about what she knew as part of an inquiry into the sex-trafficking scheme and whether others could have been involved. </p><p>She was found guilty in 2021 of facilitating Epstein's abuse. Prosecutors said she recruited and groomed the girls, some as young as 14, between 1994 and 2004, before they were abused by Epstein, a New York financier.</p><p>Maxwell's lawyers appealed against the verdict, arguing she should never have been tried or convicted for her role in the scheme.</p><p>Speculation has been rife that Trump could pardon Maxwell. The White House has previously said \"no leniency is being given or discussed\" <b> </b>- a sentiment it reiterated on Monday. </p><p>\"It's not something I've heard discussed,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, but said that as a general rule, \"we don't comment on clemency requests\".</p></div><div><p>The files surrounding Epstein's case, including grand jury testimony, have become a political flashpoint amid demands they be released. </p><p>Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security prison facility in Texas after her interview with justice department officials in July. In those interviews, she denied seeing any inappropriate conduct by Trump during his interactions with Epstein.</p><p>The facility, FPC Bryant, is located about 100 miles (160km) from the Texas capital of Austin.</p><p>The family members of Giuffre, Sky and Amanda Roberts and Danny and Lanette Wilson, said in a written statement that they \"remain hopeful that the DOJ will realize that she belongs in a maximum security prison, not the country club one she is currently in\".</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><div><p>6 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Anthony Zurcher</span><span>North America correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The US Supreme Court begins its new term on Monday with a docket already full of potentially significant cases that could define the scope of Donald Trump's presidential authority - and the prospect of more to come.</p><p>In the eight months that Trump has been back in the White House, he has tested the limits of executive power, unilaterally implementing new policies, slashing federal budgets and workforce, and attempting to bring previously independent agencies and institutions more directly under his control.</p><p>The latest brewing legal battle comes from the president's attempts to take control of state National Guard units and deploy them in cities where he claims there is public unrest and rampant crime - over the objection of local and state officials.</p><p>In Oregon, a federal judge has issued orders blocking Trump's deployment of troops to Portland. An appeals court is set to review the move in the coming days.</p><p>\"This is a nation of constitutional law, not martial law,\" Judge Karin Immergut, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, wrote in her Saturday opinion. </p><p>\"Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power - to the detriment of this nation.\"</p></div><div><p>Once the appellate court has its say, the Supreme Court could step in via its so-called \"shadow docket\", issuing a ruling that could curtail Trump's ability to use the military on US soil - or give him a free hand, at least temporarily.</p><p>Such reviews have become a more routine occurrence recently, as a majority of the Supreme Court justices, in response to emergency petitions from the Trump administration, has largely allowed the president's actions to move forward while legal challenges play out.</p><p>\"A tug of war between the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts is going to be a driving force in the coming term,\" Samuel Bray, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said at a briefing last month.</p><p>The court's reliance on this shadow docket has been criticised by left-leaning legal scholars and politicians as an improper use of the court's authority. Its orders have typically been short, offering limited legal reasoning and leaving lower-level judges with minimal guidance.</p><p>\"All Americans should be alarmed by the Supreme Court's growing reliance on its shadow docket to resolve controversial and high-profile cases without any transparency - no substantive explanations, oral arguments, or reasoning,\" Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said earlier this year.</p><p>\"This further pushes the Court's deliberations and decisions out of view of public scrutiny and shields it from accountability.\"</p><p>In the coming months, however, the court is set tackle questions of presidential power – and other high-profile controversies - head on, hearing oral arguments and issuing full decisions on their merits.</p><p>\"It's not going to be able to get away with one-page orders that don't explain the reasoning,\" said Maya Sen, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School who specialises in the Supreme Court and US politics. \"If they're going to grant more power to the executive its going to have to explain why.\"</p><p>The court is already scheduled to consider whether federal laws prohibit the president from removing members of agencies designed by Congress to be independent from presidential influence infringe on executive authority.</p><p>The justices will also hear arguments in an expedited review of Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from her position as a governor on the influential Federal Reserve Board – a case that could dramatically increase the president's power over American economic policy.</p><p>The US – and global economy – is also front and centre as Supreme Court justices will have a chance to decide whether many of Trump's unilaterally imposed tariffs on foreign imports have adequate legal authority or should be voided.</p><p>The justices may also review Trump's attempts to unilaterally cut federal spending and fire lower-level government employees, as well as his aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p><p>While the court has not yet agreed to consider Trump's attempt to terminate automatic citizenship for those born on US soil, it could do so in the coming months.</p><p>\"The scope of executive power will be front and centre this term,\" said Professor Jennifer Nou of the University of Chicago Law School, in an email to the BBC.</p><p>\"The cases coming before the court will test the Trump administration's highest political and economic priorities, whether tariffs or birthright citizenship.</p><p>\"One question will be whether the justices will apply principles (eg the major questions doctrine) that it used to strike down signature Biden initiatives in a politically even-handed way.\"</p><p>The court used its newly fashioned \"major questions doctrine\" to stymie Biden's efforts at student loan forgiveness and environmental regulations, holding that Congress did not give him explicit authorisation to do so.</p><p>Presidential power is the central focus of this year's Supreme Court term but cases involving several hot-button political and cultural controversies are also scheduled in the coming months.</p><p>The court will review whether a Colorado ban on conversion therapy – a controversial practice that attempts to use counselling to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity – violates constitutional free speech protections.</p><p>Also on the docket are two cases involving state bans on transgender athletes in interscholastic sport competition.</p><p>A Republican congressman in Illinois is challenging a state law that allows mailed ballots to be counted up to two weeks after election day.</p><p>A group of Louisiana conservatives have asked the court to strike down a provision of a voting rights law that requires states to draw congressional districts that guarantee Black voter representation equal to their population level.</p><p>And the Republican Party is targeting a decades-old law that prevents political candidates and parties from coordinating their campaign spending.</p><p>Over the past few years, this conservative-dominated Supreme Court has demonstrated a willingness to issue landmark new rulings that have dramatically shifted America's legal landscape.</p><p>On topics like abortion rights, federal regulatory authority and the consideration of race in college admissions, the court has reversed decades of existing precedent.</p><p>Those decisions have contributed to a public view of the Supreme Court that has become increasingly polarised along partisan lines.</p><p>In a recent Pew Foundation poll, opinions of the nation's highest legal body were split nearly evenly, with Republicans supportive and Democrats highly critical.</p><p>By the time the court issues its final decisions in this term, expected by the end of June next year, the 6-3 conservative majority on the court may have broken new ground, and once again fundamentally reshaped American law.</p><p><i>With additional reporting from Kayla Epstein.</i></p></div>",

It is thought 48 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.</p><p>Trump said over the weekend the hostages could be released \"very soon\", while Netanyahu said they could be freed before the end of the Jewish holiday Sukkot - or October 13th.</p><p>Hamas has agreed to the hostage \"exchange formula\" detailed in Trump's plan, providing certain \"field conditions\" are met.</p><p>But the hostages are the group's only bargaining chip - and it's unclear whether it would be willing to release them before other elements of the deal are finalised.</p><p>Trust between the two sides is virtually non-existent. Only last month, Israel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zepgp5neo\">attempted to assassinate Hamas's negotiating team</a> with an air strike on Doha - angering not only Hamas but also Donald Trump and Qatar, a key mediator.</p><p>Members of that same negotiating team - headed by Khalil al-Hayya, whose son was killed in the strike - will now be meeting just a stone's throw from Israel's delegation in Egypt.</p></div><p></p><h2>Hamas disarmament</h2><p></p><div><p>Israel's stated goal throughout the war has been the destruction of Hamas. Netanyahu has repeatedly stated he will not stop until the group is finished. </p><p>A key point in Trump's plan requires the group to disarm. But Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established.</p><p>In its response, Hamas made no mention of disarmament - fuelling speculation that it has not changed its position.</p><p>Over the weekend, Netanyahu vowed: \"Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarised – either the easy way or the hard way\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Future governance of Gaza</h2><p></p><div><p>The plan states that Hamas will have no future role in Gaza, which will be governed by a temporary transitional body of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a \"Board of Peace\" headed and chaired by Donald Trump and involving former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p>Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p><p>Though Netanyahu agreed to all of Trump's 20-point plan, he appeared to push back on involvement of the PA even as he stood on the podium next to the president last week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jq63edv21o\">insisting it would play no role</a> in governing the territory.</p><p>This is one of many points in the plan that will be objectionable to ultranationalist hardliners within Netanyahu's governing coalition - many of whom want to retain control of Gaza and reconstruct Jewish settlements there.</p><p>In Hamas's response, it indicated that it expects to have some future role in Gaza as part of \"a unified Palestinian movement\". Though the wording is vague, this will likely be unacceptable to both Trump and the Israelis.</p></div><p></p><h2>Israeli withdrawal</h2><p></p><div><p>The extent of Israel's military withdrawal is a fourth point of contention.</p><p>The plan states that Israel's military will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes\" that must be agreed by all parties.</p><p>A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c5ykwny8dp9o\">map distributed by the White House</a> showed three proposed stages of Israeli troop withdrawal. The first stage leaves about 55% of Gaza under Israeli control, the second 40%, and the final 15%.</p><p>That final stage would be a \"security perimeter\" that would \"remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat\".</p><p>The wording here is vague and gives no clear timeline for full Israeli withdrawal - something Hamas are likely to want clarity on.</p><p>Additionally, the map shared by the White House doesn't match up with the Israeli military's own maps showing militarised areas, and Gaza's borders are incorrectly drawn in places.</p></div><div><p><span> More on this story</span></p></div></article>",

to the Israel-Gaza war. \nIt appears this is the closest both sides have come to a deal since the war began two years ago. But Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan - which Israel has agreed to and Hamas has partly agreed to - is really just a framework, only a few pages long. So will the talks survive the detail? Adam talks to Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent, about how the next few days could play out?\nAnd, yet another French prime minister has resigned, less than a month after being appointed to the role. Sébastien Lecornu, a former armed forces minister, was France's fifth prime minister in under two years.  What does President Macron do now? Adam speaks to co-host of the Global Story Tristan Redman and Marion Solletty Politico’s editor-at-large in France. \nYou can listen the Oslo Accords Old Newscast here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0lx690c\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.

For Democrats, it's about Trump - not just healthcare</h2><p></p><div><p>The Democratic base has been demanding for months that their party more forcefully fights the Trump administration. Well, now the party leadership has a chance to show they have listened. </p><p>In March, Senate leader Chuck Schumer was fiercely criticised for helping pass a Republican spending bill to avert a shutdown. This time he's digging in.</p><p>This is a chance for Democrats to show they can take back some control from an administration that has moved aggressively on its agenda. </p><p>Refusing to back the Republican spending plan this time comes with political risk that the wider public will grow frustrated as the dispute drags on and consequences begin to mount.</p><p>The main Democratic demand is to renew expiring health insurance subsidies which they say will hit American families. Republicans say they will discuss the subsidies when the government reopens. </p><p>But a secondary demand from Democrats is very much focused on Trump and his use of executive powers to rescind or withhold money approved by Congress, which he has done with foreign aid and other programmes. </p></div><p></p><h2>2. For Republicans, it's an opportunity</h2><p></p><div><p>Trump and one of his key officials, Russell Vought, have made little secret of the fact that they smell a chance to make more of the cutbacks to the federal workforce that have featured in the Republican's second presidency so far. </p><p>Trump himself said last week that the shutdown had afforded him an \"unprecedented opportunity\", and that he would look to cut \"Democrat agencies\".</p><p>The White House said it would be left with the \"unenviable task\" of mass lay-offs to keep essential government services operating if the shutdown continued. They say they need to save taxpayers' money being spent on waste and fraud. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this was just \"fiscal sanity\".</p><p>The scope of the potential lay-offs remains unclear, but the White House has been in discussions with the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, which is headed by Vought.</p><p>Vought has already announced the suspension of federal funding for Democratic-run parts of the country, including New York City and Chicago.</p></div><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx27523n0lo\">Congress remains deadlocked on shutdown ahead of Monday vote</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo\">Why US government has shut down and what happens now</a></li></ul></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a3a7/live/7746ac00-a2a1-11f0-94eb-2d0a64a6f1c0.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a3a7/live/7746ac00-a2a1-11f0-94eb-2d0a64a6f1c0.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a3a7/live/7746ac00-a2a1-11f0-94eb-2d0a64a6f1c0.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a3a7/live/7746ac00-a2a1-11f0-94eb-2d0a64a6f1c0.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a3a7/live/7746ac00-a2a1-11f0-94eb-2d0a64a6f1c0.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a3a7/live/7746ac00-a2a1-11f0-94eb-2d0a64a6f1c0.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a3a7/live/7746ac00-a2a1-11f0-94eb-2d0a64a6f1c0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a3a7/live/7746ac00-a2a1-11f0-94eb-2d0a64a6f1c0.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images A woman wearing a dress with a black sleeveless top and a knee-length stripped black, white and bright pink skirt looks at a sign in front of the National Gallery of Art saying it is \"closed due to federal government shutdown\"\" /><span>Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></p></div></figure><p></p><h2>3. There's little trust on either side</h2><p></p><div><p>While previous shutdowns have been characterised by late-night talks between the two parties in an effort to get government services running again, there appears to be little of the same spirit of collaboration this time.</p><p>Instead, there is rancour. The bad blood continued over the weekend, with Republicans and Democrats blaming each other for causing the impasse. </p><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, accused Democrats of not being serious about negotiating, and holding out over a deal \"to get political cover\".</p><p>Meanwhile, Schumer levelled the same accusation at the other side, saying that a Republican promise to discuss healthcare subsidies once the government reopens can not be taken seriously. </p><p>Trump himself has inflamed the situation by posting a controversial AI-generated image of Schumer and the top Democrat in the House, Hakeem Jeffries, in which Jeffries is depicted with a large Mexican-style sombrero and a moustache.</p><p>Jeffries and other Democrats called this racist, which was denied by Vice-President JD Vance.</p></div><p></p><h2>4. The US economy is fragile</h2><p></p><div><p>Analysts expect about 40% of the federal workforce - more than 800,000 people - to be put on unpaid leave as a result of the shutdown.</p><p>That will depress spending - and also have wider ramifications, as environmental permitting, patent approvals, payments to contractors and other kinds of government activity tied to business comes to a halt.</p><p>A shutdown also injects new uncertainty into an economy already being roiled by changes ranging from tariffs, earlier cuts to government spending, immigration raids and artificial intelligence.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c059ydyqe19o\">Trump's Grim Reaper - from Project 2025 to shutdown enforcer</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/travel/article/20251003-how-the-government-shutdown-can-impact-travel\">How the US government shutdown can impact travel</a></li></ul><p>Analysts estimate that it could shave as much as 0.2 percentage points off US economic growth for each week it lasts.</p><p>But the economy typically recoups most of that lost activity after a shutdown ends, as it would after disruption caused by a natural disaster.</p><p>That could be one reason why the stock market has appeared largely unfazed by the current stand-off.</p><p>On the other hand, analysts say that if Trump carries out his threat of mass firings, the damage could be more long-lasting.</p></div></article>",

Hundreds of local villagers and rescue workers have been deployed to clear out snow blocking access to the area, which sits at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). </p><p>Rescuers have guided 350 people to safety in the small township of Qudang. Authorities are in contact with all the hikers who are still trapped.</p></div><div><p>Nature photographer Dong Shuchang was among hundreds of tourists who flocked to the area during China's Golden Week holiday. </p><p>He was looking forward to capturing the Himalayan marvel from the Tibetan slopes, when the snowstorm hit just hours after his trek started on Saturday.</p><p>\"The lightning and thunderstorms would not stop. The snowfall was so heavy I could hardly sleep,\" Mr Dong explained.</p><p>His group had reached an altitude of 4,600m before they decided to turn back.  </p><p>\"Our windbreakers and raincoats were no match for the snow. We were all drenched,\" he said, adding that several people in his group of 20 showed signs of hypothermia.</p><p>The 27-year-old had been to the Himalayas more than a dozen times, but said he has \"never experienced weather like this\". </p><p>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet.</p><p>\"Everyone was moving slowly. The route was very slippery. I kept falling because of the ice.\"</p><p>His group spent last night in a hotel room in Qudang, where they relied on a generator for electricity. </p><p>When they left the hotel this morning, the snowstorm had finally subsided.</p><p>\"We're just so relieved to get help and support,\" he said.</p><p>Chen Geshuang, who was part of Mr Dong's hiking group, said the snow was about a metre deep when the group started their retreat on Sunday.</p><p>\"All of us are experienced hikers,\" Ms Chen said. \"But this blizzard was still extremely difficult to deal with. I was so lucky to get out.\"</p><p>\"This year's snow was exceptional,\" the 29-year-old outdoor enthusiast said.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images The peaks of Mount Everest covered in snow with a cloudy sky in the background\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The showstorm hit during Golden Week, a peak season for local tourism in China</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Another woman told the BBC that her husband who had been stuck in the snowstorm was slowly descending from the mountains, but thick snow cover has made his retreat extremely difficult. </p><p>\"Even for rescuers, it's not easy, they need to clear snow to make a path,\" said the woman, who declined to be named.</p><p>\"I hope my husband's team reaches [the rescue team] safely.\"</p><p>Her husband had told her that he barely slept in his tent because he was afraid of being buried in the snow, the woman said.</p><p>Another hiker, Eric Wen, told Reuters that three people in his group suffered from hypothermia even though they were adequately dressed.</p><p>They hardly slept because it was snowing too hard and his group had to clear the snow every 10 minutes. </p><p>\"Otherwise our tents would have collapsed.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp\" alt=\"Dong Shuchang A hiker dressed in a winter coat and carrying a navy backpack trudges through thick snow cover\" /><span>Dong Shuchang</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>China is in the middle of its week-long National Day holiday known as Golden Week, a peak season for local tourism.</p><p>October usually provides clear skies and friendly temperatures, making it one of the favoured months to hike in the Mount Everest area. </p><p>Many hikers have made their way to the Karma Valley hiking trail, a lesser-known but scenic route to the base of Everest - which also offers a view of the world's highest peak.</p><p>Although many people attempt to climb the summit every year, it is considered an incredibly dangerous hike. </p><p>In recent years it has been plagued with concerns of overcrowding, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5539lj1pqo\">environmental concerns</a> and a series of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-65680598\">fatal climbing attempts.</a></p><p>The region is facing extreme weather at the moment. </p><p>Neighbouring Nepal has been battered by torrential rains and floods that has killed at least 47 people, blocked roads, and washed away bridges.</p><p>On the other side of China, Typhoon Matmo has made landfall on the country's eastern coast, forcing about 150,000 people to evacuate from their homes. </p></div></article>",

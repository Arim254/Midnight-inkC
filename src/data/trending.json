    "body": "Murder and MI5: How an extraordinary battle erupted over what the state keeps secret12 hours agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent BBCPaul Thompson was shot dead while being driven home in a taxi through Belfast in April 1994. He was murdered in a sectarian attack by loyalist paramilitaries who had set out to kill Catholics.The taxi driver was a friend who was collecting a fare at another address in the Springfield Park area in the west of the city. But no one at the address had rung the taxi firm. The call is suspected to have been a deliberate decoy by the killers who wanted to lure a taxi as prey. Paul was not specifically targeted. They could not have known he would ask for a lift or be in the area.One resident described hearing a heavy burst of gunfire after 23:00, running to the car and finding Paul.Members of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for the killing. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the group repeatedly murdered Catholic civilians like Paul.Family Handout/PA WireMembers of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for killing Paul, who was nicknamed TopperOn the morning of the day that Paul was killed, locals had told police about a hole in a barrier – known as the 'Peace Line' – which separated the largely Catholic Springfield Park area from a largely Protestant neighbouring area. The residents were concerned the breach could give loyalist paramilitaries access to launch an attack.The hole was not fixed. After the murder, those responsible escaped through it.An inquest into Paul's death was opened in 1995 but never concluded. No-one has ever been held to account. There has never been a full investigation.Left by themselves to fight for answers, his mother Margaret and brother Eugene, both now dead, came to suspect collusion between British security forces and informants – meaning state agents - in the group responsible.In 2024, a coroner decided to release to the family a summary of secret information held by the police. This was said by the coroner to be of central relevance to the case and the police supported the move. But the British government and MI5 argued this would prejudice national security and mounted a legal challenge.PA MediaPaul Thompson was killed by the UDA, which used the cover name of the Ulster Freedom FightersThe case, which centred on who had the power to decide to release the information, reached the Supreme Court last summer, with Paul Thompson's brother, Eugene, tuning in to hearings from a hospice, as he neared death from cancer.The case is widely viewed as a major test of the state's policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) information involving national security.Who decides what is secret?The NCND policy is a position adopted by the government and security services when responding to questions about sensitive matters. It means there will be no confirmation, no denial, and no acknowledgement that the information requested is true, false, or even exists.Eugene Thompson's barrister, Monye Anyadike-Danes KC, said the family had concluded the murder happened because the authorities were colluding with the \"very group that actually perpetrated the killing\". She said Eugene was \"trying to find out why his younger brother was murdered\" and felt a \"deep responsibility\".PA MediaEugene Thompson, who has since died, spent years trying to find out the truth about his brother's deathEugene, she added, believed the public should be able to trust that those who kill will be held accountable, especially when they are agents of the state. She asked the judges not to let the NCND policy be used to \"conceal the involvement of state parties in the killing of an ordinary citizen\".Just before Christmas, the court ruled that the government's assessment of damage to national security \"should have been accepted by the coroner\" unless it was plainly irrational or there was no supporting evidence.The justices found the coroner had failed to understand it was \"solely\" for the government to make submissions on national security, not the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Jon Boutcher, who had argued for the release of the summary of police files.PA WireJon Boutcher argued for the release of the summary of police filesPaul Thompson's case is part of a battle over the truth and whether it can be told. The battle concerns official secrets, often connected to state agents, and it pits bereaved families and senior police officers against the government and the security service, MI5.It raises a profound question: can the state, especially when it is implicated in killing, be trusted as the arbiter of what should remain secret?The spycatcher who was himself a spyOther cases in the coming months will force these issues further into the spotlight – and they come at a time when MI5's integrity is under significant scrutiny.Yet the Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case creates a precedent that says the government and MI5 can withhold information from bereaved families, for national security reasons, even when the police want it to be disclosed.Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, described it as a \"grim day for truth\" and part of a pattern of \"national security being used as a shield to cover up and conceal the state's role in very serious crimes such as murder and other serious human rights violations.\"The government, by contrast, welcomed the court's \"unanimous judgment\".\"This is a highly complex case with wide-ranging implications,\" it said. \"The government will therefore take time to fully consider all aspects of this judgment.\"The Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case has created a precedentDuring the Troubles, the state made widespread use of informants, otherwise known as agents, who were tasked with carrying out actions and often paid. Agents existed in the IRA and in loyalist paramilitary groups. They were run by the police, the army, and MI5.The former Met Police chief Lord Stevens, who led UK government-commissioned investigations into collusion in Northern Ireland between the 1980s and 2000s, once said that of 210 people arrested during his enquiries, only three were not state agents.Collusion occurred in a number of ways, he said, ranging from the state withholding intelligence and evidence from investigators, to state agents being involved in murder. In some cases agents told the authorities in advance about planned attacks but nothing was done to stop them.One of the most notorious agents was codenamed Stakeknife. It has been publicly known for more than 20 years that Stakeknife was a man called Freddie Scappaticci. He died under MI5 protection in 2023 having never been charged with any of the many murders and other crimes to which he is linked.Pacemaker Press/ PAFreddie Scappaticci, or Stakeknife, died under MI5 protection in 2023Scappaticci was a senior figure in the IRA's internal security unit, which was tasked by IRA leaders with identifying and killing British agents in the organisation. But, with the spycatcher himself a spy, the result was one British agent killing other agents, or people accused of being agents, and the state repeatedly not intervening to save them.Intelligence agencies and historic wrongdoingA long-running police investigation into Stakeknife, Operation Kenova, was forbidden from officially naming Scappaticci in its final report, published in December, despite the fact that his identity was widely known.The head of the Kenova team, Sir Iain Livingstone, pleaded with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn for the right to name Scappaticci in his report, but Benn said he would decide after the Supreme Court ruling in the Paul Thompson case, which came later in December.That ruling has, in effect, strengthened Benn's power to stop him being named. If permission is granted, a revised version of the Kenova report can be published.Jon Boutcher, who was Livingstone's predecessor leading the Kenova investigation, has described the situation preventing Scappaticci being named as a \"pantomime\". It leads to the truth being \"suppressed,\" he argues, with \"profound and severe adverse impacts on victims and families, legitimate public discussion and debate, media freedom, open justice and public confidence in state agencies and the criminal justice system\".PA WireThe integrity of MI5, which is currently led by Sir Ken McCallum, is under scrutinyBoutcher, the PSNI chief constable, is involved in a significant and extraordinary stand-off with the government and MI5 over NCND.He has called for reform of the policy, a principle he fully supports but believes is being wrongly applied and has become a dogma that can be used to conceal wrongdoing.He has recommended the policy is reviewed to ensure it is applied proportionately and only where genuinely necessary for the protection of life or national security. The government has not yet responded to the call for a review of the policy.Boutcher has directly asked whether NCND's continued application on Stakeknife amounts to it being used as a tool for covering up things that should never have happened.\"I question whether this decision protects agents, or rather does it actually protect the government and intelligence agencies from accountability for historical wrongdoing.\"More from InDepthIn the Paul Thompson case he argued that he, as chief constable, rather than the government, had the right to allow the coroner to release a summary of police files. The high court and court of appeal backed his position before it was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.During the hearings, government barrister Sir James Eadie KC said Boutcher was being \"thoroughly disingenuous\" and that \"politics is being played with national security\". He argued the government is best placed to make assessments on national security, as only it has access to the full range of necessary advice. The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5.The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material.For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is \"unprecedented\" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s.\"If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool,\" he says.Trust, state secrecy and the publicBoutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed?He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case.Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day.In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife.But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife. Scappaticci was engaged in a pretence to help shore up his reputation: publicly fighting a legal case, while hoping – and expecting – he would lose.VCG via Getty ImagesMany families of those killed or injured in the Troubles are still fighting through the courtsHowever, the government feared Scappaticci would win because a judge would assume he was not Stakeknife and force ministers to be honest.Jon Boutcher has now confirmed an extraordinary fact: the judge who heard the case did so after being secretly briefed on the real identity of Stakeknife.That judge, the then Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord Carswell, ultimately allowed the government to maintain NCND, creating the legal precedent on the policy.\"The full facts about this and the government's explanation will never be known while it is able to hide behind the shield of NCND,\" Boutcher has said.There is a second extraordinary fact: the government barrister who did the secret briefing was Philip Sales, who as Lord Sales was one of the Supreme Court justices in the Paul Thompson case. This fact was uncovered by the journalist John Ware.This is an issue because it is Lord Sales' ruling in the Thompson case which has a central bearing over whether Scappaticci can be named and more details revealed about what went on, including Lord Sales' own role.I asked the Supreme Court whether, given Lord Sales' role in the Scappaticci matter, if it was appropriate for him to have heard the Thompson case.In a statement, the court said: \"Great care is taken in the selection of the panels which will hear a case at the UK Supreme Court.\"A Justice will not deal with a case where it is considered there is a conflict of interest and individual Justices are careful to ensure that they have none.\"The cases of Seamus Dillon and Sean BrownTwo further cases that touch on the potential release of information about the role of the state during the Troubles are also before the Supreme Court.Troubles-related inquests were shut down in 2024 with the passing of the Legacy Act, which created a new body called the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to examine relevant cases, including those being investigated by police.The families of four men who were either killed or injured during the Troubles won a further legal victory, when the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled the government has too much veto power over the disclosure of material by the ICRIR.Lady Chief Justice Siobhan Keegan said that the provision in the Act giving the Northern Ireland secretary \"the final say\" on disclosure of sensitive national security information by the ICRIR would risk undermining public confidence in the body.The UK government's appeal will be ruled on by the Supreme Court in the coming months. The lead respondent in the case is Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was killed in 1997.PA WireMartina Dillon's husband Seamus was killed in 1997 by the paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)The paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) claimed responsibility. A coroner had opened an inquest on the basis there was evidence of collusion by state authorities, but the inquest was halted by the Legacy Act. No-one has ever been held accountable.The government has also registered an appeal in another key case.Sean Brown was also murdered in 1997 by members of the LVF. The 61-year-old father-of-six was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports club in County Londonderry. There were investigative failures by police and no-one has been brought to justice.PA MediaSean Brown, a father of six, was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports clubDecades later, a coroner issued a summary of secret material stating that \"a number of the individuals linked through intelligence to the murder were agents of the state.\" Sean's family want a public inquiry, and have won judgments over the past two years at the High Court and Court of Appeal. The government, which was found to have acted unlawfully by refusing a public inquiry, has registered an appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the issue has constitutional significance regarding who should order inquiries.'The state viewed itself as above the law'At its heart, this vast battle over secrecy centres on two core claims by the state: that only the government and MI5 can ultimately be fully trusted on national security, and that their decisions on what information to release are solely about protecting the public.But these claims have been undermined by MI5's actions and omissions in several recent cases, all during the leadership of MI5's current director general, Sir Ken McCallum.A public inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which killed 22 people, concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held about the suicide bomber who carried out the attack. The inquiry chairman only uncovered what MI5 had done through his own persistent investigations during secret evidence sessions.The government has been resisting calls by families bereaved by the Manchester Arena attack for MI5 officers to be fully included in planned new legislation - known as the Hillsborough Law - that's designed to stop cover-ups and enforce truth-telling by public officials.Getty ImagesA public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of key intelligence it heldAnother ongoing case is an example of how MI5's evidence cannot always be taken at face value: MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about having maintained its NCND secrecy policy in relation to an abusive neo-Nazi agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete. But MI5 had in fact told me the man was an agent when attempting to prevent me from investigating him. After MI5 apologised, we then showed that inquiries into what happened by MI5 and the government were deficient and unreliable, with further falsehoods provided to the court. This prompted the most senior judge in England and Wales to dismiss MI5's explanations and led the prime minister to order a new investigation, which will report this year.In the Stakeknife investigation, MI5 disclosed key documents years after enquiries began, aer Scappaticci had died and charging decisions had been made, and at a point when the Legacy Act banned police from investigating further. The new material revealed MI5 had greater and earlier knowledge of Stakeknife than detectives had previously been told, including that MI5 had been involved in tasking him. The lead detective said it was a \"significant failure on the part of MI5\". A review commissioned by MI5 found no deliberate wrongdoing.Cover-ups and failures to disclose information have a long history in Northern Ireland. Lord Stevens, recalling his investigations, has said: \"I was misled deliberately, I was criminally obstructed from doing my job by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and military, whilst MI5 failed to disclose information.\"Judge Pomerance, who was senior counsel on another major investigation, concluded bluntly: \"The state viewed itself as above the law\".The battle of bereaved familiesLast July, days before Eugene Thompson died, Jon Boutcher delivered a letter of apology on behalf of PSNI. He apologised for the police's failure to take action that may have prevented Paul Thompson's murder, and for failures in the investigation, including not properly pursuing suspects.Mark Thompson from Relatives for Justice (no relation of Paul and Eugene Thompson) says the apology was \"important\" but that Eugene was by this stage \"very ill\".Thompson familyJust before he died, Eugene Thompson (right) received an apology for police failings over the murder of his brother Paul (left). Their mother Margaret is also picturedMark had watched the Supreme Court hearings with Eugene on a laptop in his hospice and describes the experience as \"tough\". Eugene was \"praying and hoping that before he died the judgment could be made\", Mark says.Bereaved families caught up in these cases have had to battle for decades, trying to fill voids left by the lack of proper investigations by the state.\"You became an investigator, tracking down witnesses. You became an expert in the law in that field. And you fought your own case tooth and nail.\"Eugene Thompson became an \"accidental lawyer and expert in his own case\", he says, as he campaigned for answers about why his brother Paul was murdered.\"I think if we take anything from the legacy of him, it's the example of never giving up.\"Top image credit: PA MediaEmail: security.investigations@bbc.co.ukSignal: @investigation.56Click here to learn how to use SecureDrop, an anonymous whistleblowing tool that works only in the Tor browser and follow the advice to stay secure.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Australian authorities have issued heatwave warnings for most of the country as millions mark the national holiday, Australia Day.Temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday, reaching the \"high forties\" Celsius in the southern states of Victoria and South Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology said.On Sunday, South Australia recorded temperatures as high as 48.5C, the bureau reported. Fire danger warnings are in place across the country.Some Australia Day events on Monday were cancelled out of safety concerns.In Adelaide, a parade and light show were cancelled because of the extreme heat forecast.\"While this is deeply disappointing for the community, performers and partners, community safety and wellbeing must come first,\" organisers said.Australia Day - 26 January - is the anniversary of the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet, which began the era of colonisation.But to many people, especially Indigenous Australians, the occasion is a reminder of their cultural destruction under European settlers - referring to the occasion as \"Invasion Day\". Across the country on Monday, huge crowds gathered for rallies in support of Indigenous Australians.Aside from Victoria and South Australia, heatwave warnings have also been issued in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.Many of these warnings will remain in place until Wednesday.\"We haven't seen heatwave conditions like this in Victoria for almost 20 years,\" Tim Wiebusch, Victoria's emergency management commissioner, told ABC.\"It was 2009 ahead of the bushfires where we saw those prevailing conditions and so we are indicating to all Victorians that this is a very serious set of weather conditions.\"On Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology warned of \"extreme fire dangers\" across parts of South Australia and much of south-western Victoria \"due to very hot and dry weather combined with moderate to gusty winds\".Firefighters in Victoria are working to combat several fires across the state, which have prompted evacuations and threatened properties.The heat has also affected the Australian Open at Melbourne Park. Tennis player Jannik Sinner was seen suffering from cramps on the court on Saturday, before play was temporarily suspended in the rising heat. Nearly 80,000 fans were warned to take care under the scorching sun. Meanwhile, parts of Western Australia were pummelled by Tropical Cyclone Luana over the weekend. The storm damaged homes and a popular beach resort before weakening as it moved inland. The meteorological bureau has advised people to find places to keep cool, like their homes, libraries, community centres or shopping centres. It also told people to close their windows and draw the curtains to keep heat out of their homes.",

It will be directed by Olivier Award winner Rob Hastie, who staged shows like Operation Mincemeat and Standing at the Sky's Edge, and is deputy artistic director of London's National Theatre.The announcement follows Friday's conclusion of series four of the murder mystery reality TV show, which is presented by Claudia Winkleman.It places secret saboteurs among a group of faithful contestants in a grand castle in Scotland, all fighting it out to win a cash prize.The final of the celebrity edition of the show was the UK's most-watched TV event of 2025, with about 15 million people tuning in to see traitorous comic Alan Carr become king of the castle.Caro Newling, co-founder of Neal Street Productions, said they had \"curated a team of brilliant faithful theatre-makers\", led by Hastie and Finnemore, \"to bring a bold, structural twist to the format that only the live medium can provide\".Stage adaptations of small screen hits have ranged from Stranger Things: The First Shadow, which has been running in the West End for more than two years, to The Great British Bake Off Musical, which ran in the capital for three months.More from the BBC",

    "body": "Repeatedly heading a football \"likely\" contributed to the brain disease which was a factor in the death of former Scotland and Manchester United footballer Gordon McQueen, an inquest has found.McQueen, who was diagnosed with vascular dementia, died in 2023 aged 70.An inquest into his death held in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, concluded with a narrative verdict on Monday, with senior coroner John Heath telling the court: \"I have found that Mr McQueen suffered repetitive head impacts during his career.\"I am satisfied that on the balance of probability that repeatedly heading footballs contributed to his developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\"The combination of CTE and vascular dementia led to pneumonia. I find the cause of death pneumonia, vascular dementia and CTE.\"It is likely that repetitive head impacts, sustained by heading the ball while playing football, contributed to the CTE.\"McQueen played 30 times for Scotland and made almost 350 appearances for St Mirren, Leeds and United as a central defender between 1970 and 1985, before managing Airdrie and coaching at St Mirren and Middlesbrough.Professor Willie Stewart, a consultant neuropathologist at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow who examined McQueen's brain after his death, described to BBC Sport how a membrane in the brain appeared torn and that CTE was present in various locations in McQueen's brain.\"CTE contributed to his death significantly,\" said Prof Stewart, adding that the only available causal evidence was exposure to repeated impacts - heading a football.Prof Stewart said symptoms of CTE were cognitive decline and neuro-behaviour change, and that they \"can't be explained by another condition - it must be progressive\".He said symptoms were \"typical in professional football and rugby players who have long careers\".\"Goalkeepers, who don't typically head the ball, have a risk equivalent to general population, whereas in outfield positions, particularly defenders, the risk is higher,\" he added.",

    "body": "57 minutes agoLaura CressTechnology reporterThe European Commission has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's X over concerns its AI tool Grok was used to create sexualised images of real people.It follows a similar announcement in January from the UK watchdog Ofcom.Regina Doherty, a member of the European parliament representing Ireland, said the Commission would assess whether \"manipulated sexually explicit images\" have been shown to users in the EU.A previous statement from X's Safety account said the social media platform had stopped Grok from digitally altering pictures of people to remove their clothing in \"jurisdictions where such content is illegal\".But campaigners and victims said the ability to generate sexually explicit pictures using the tool should have \"never happened\" in the first place, and Ofcom said its investigation would remain ongoing.The EU regulator said it may \"impose interim measures\" if X refuses to implement meaningful adjustments. It said it had also extended its ongoing investigation launched in December 2023 over risks associated with X's recommender systems - the algorithm that recommends specific posts to users.Before the Commission's announcement, Elon Musk posted a picture on X on Monday appearing to make light of the new restrictions in place around Grok. The X owner has previously criticised those scrutinising the app's image-editing function - particularly the UK government - calling it \"any excuse for censorship\".On Sunday, the Grok account on X claimed more than 5.5 billion images were generated by the tool in just 30 days.In a statement to Reuters, Doherty said there were \"serious questions\" over if platforms such as X were meeting legal obligations \"to assess risks properly and to prevent illegal and harmful content from spreading\".\"The European Union has clear rules to protect people online,\" she said.\"Those rules must mean something in practice, especially when powerful technologies are deployed at scale.\"No company operating in the EU is above the law.\"A spokesperson from Coimisiún na Meán, Ireland's media regulator, said it welcomed the news.\"There is no place in our society for non-consensual intimate imagery abuse or child sexual abuse material,\" they said.The move comes a month after the EU fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges, saying they \"deceive users\" because the firm is not \"meaningfully verifying\" who is behind the account.In response, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accused the EU regulator of attacking and censoring US firms.\"The European Commission's fine isn't just an attack on X, it's an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments,\" he said.His remarks were reposted by Musk, who added \"absolutely\".",

    "body": "19 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorThe other day I compared the saga of Andy Burnham, his ambitions and the forthcoming by-election in Greater Manchester to a long and twisting marble run.If, and it was a big if, the marble trundled all the way to the bottom, it was possible to imagine Burnham as prime minister, before this year was out.But, as I said then, it was also possible the marble would fly off the run spectacularly – which is precisely what has now happened.In an exercise of brute power, which is simultaneously an illustration of how they perceive their own weakness, No 10 has scuppered Burnham's attempted run from Manchester to Westminster and perhaps on to Downing Street.Yes, this was a decision taken by a committee of the Labour Party, but allies of Sir Keir Starmer are making it perfectly clear he joined the remote meeting on Sunday morning and he cast a vote to block Andy Burnham.The relationship between the two men has long been fascinating to observe.Burnham's first act in politics was very much as a creature of Westminster: an adviser, an MP for 16 years, a cabinet minister. He has run for the Labour leadership twice before. Here he is talking to me more than a decade ago about his ambition to be prime minister. He later reinvented himself - by defining himself against Westminster as the Mayor of Greater Manchester.But his ambitions beyond the north west of England have long been transparent - and long provoked a roll of the eyes or a raised eyebrow from Sir Keir.Burnham's interventions last autumn, around the time of Labour's annual conference, deeply irritated many within the party. He gave an interview to The New Statesman, which carried the less than cryptic headline \"Andy Burnham's plan for Britain.\"Shortly after came an interview in The Telegraph, headlined \"Andy Burnham: MPs want me to challenge Starmer\".Burnham's team would point out, rightly, that politicians don't write the headlines but the wider point stands – his desires were very, very clear.Just the other day, he set out in The Guardian how he believed his approach to his mayoralty in Greater Manchester could be applied nationally.Of course, aspiring to lead the country is noble, but it shouldn't be surprising that the current occupier of that role might have a rather sniffy view of such manoeuvring, particularly when Starmer can argue that it is he who won Labour's colossal majority not Burnham, whatever people might think of how governing has gone for Labour since.No 10 has calculated that it would rather weather a short-term storm – the gales of reaction for and against this decision currently gusting across social media – than authorise a circus lasting weeks, then months, with Burnham as a by-election candidate and one question dominating: what's your plan if you become prime minister?\"I'm afraid no-one is convinced that Andy is coming in to be a team player and the last thing we should do is allow this kind of psychodrama,\" one senior party figure tells me, adding: \"We can't allow insecurity and destabilisation to indulge one man's personal ambition.\"Others are livid, arguing it is absurd and counterproductive to spike the prospects of someone they see as one of the party's brightest lights.\"You should not block democracy. Keir is running scared and it's a very bad look,\" one senior Labour MP said.All this means that in the space of just a few months, those loyal to the prime minister have briefed heavily against Health Secretary Wes Streeting, whose ambitions they view with nervousness too - and have now blocked Andy Burnham from returning to Westminster.They argue that the electorate is sick of political soap opera and they want to get on with governing – against a tricky international and domestic backdrop.Their critics, within the Labour Party and beyond, say both are acts of a weak prime minister seeking to cripple capable rivals who might, they argue, do a considerably better job than him in No 10.This will likely be far from the last act this year in the drama of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership, and how much of a future it has.",

    "body": "Israel says it has agreed to reopen the Gaza Strip's key border crossing with Egypt only after an operation to retrieve the body of the last remaining Israeli hostage in the territory is complete.The Rafah crossing has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. It was meant to have reopened during the first stage of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which began in October.However, the Israeli government has made that conditional on Hamas making every effort to return the body of the last hostage, police officer Master Sgt Ran Gvili.On Sunday, Israel's military said it had begun a new search for his remains in northern Gaza.Although in its latest announcement Israel appears to offer a timeframe for the reopening of the crossing, it is not known how long the search for Gvili will take.Israeli media quoted military officials as saying the operation was taking place at a cemetery in Gaza City and that it could last several days.On Thursday, the head of the new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza said the Rafah crossing would open \"in both directions\" this week.It comes as US and other mediators continue to press both sides to take the next steps to advance President Donald Trump's peace plan.On Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced that Israel had \"agreed to a limited reopening of the Rafah crossing for pedestrian passage only, subject to a full Israeli inspection mechanism\".The Israeli military was \"currently conducting a focused operation to exhaust all of the intelligence that has been gathered in the effort to locate and return\" the remains of Ran Gvili, a statement said.\"Upon completion of this operation, and in accordance with what has been agreed upon with the US, Israel will open the Rafah crossing,\" it added.Israel's Haaretz newspaper cited a source as saying there would be a \"full Israeli monitoring mechanism\" at the crossing, which would include oversight of entry and exit lists. Israel also planned to establish an additional screening point for all people entering Gaza located in an area around the Yellow Line, which demarcates the territory still controlled by Israeli forces under the ceasefire deal, the source added.Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military said troops had \"begun a targeted operation in the area of the Yellow Line in the northern Gaza Strip\" to retrieve Gvili's body.Israeli military officials told local media that the operation was acting on intelligence collected over a long period of time, which indicated that Gvili's remains might have been buried in the Shejaiya and Daraj Tuffah areas of Gaza City, east of the Yellow Line.Specialised units were on the ground, including rabbis, search teams and dental experts equipped with mobile X-ray machines, they added.Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on Sunday that it had \"provided mediators with all the details and information in our possession regarding the location\" of Gvili's body. Israeli forces were \"searching one of the sites,\" it added.Gvili's family meanwhile reiterated their strong opposition to the reopening of the Rafah crossing before his body had been returned to Israel for burial. \"First and foremost, Ran must be brought home,\" they said.The 24-year-old was killed in Kibbutz Alumim during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 and his body was taken back to Gaza as a hostage.At the start of December, the Israeli government said the Rafah crossing would open \"in the coming days\" to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza.However, a dispute emerged with Egypt, which said the crossing would only be opened if movement was allowed in both directions, enabling the return of tens of thousands of Palestinians who fled Gaza during the war.On Saturday, US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner led a delegation which met Israel's prime minister for discussions focused on the implementation of phase two of the Gaza peace plan. Witkoff said the meeting was \"constructive and positive\".Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed to the ceasefire, an exchange of all living and dead Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and a surge in deliveries of humanitarian aid.Phase two should see a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza take over running public services, as well as the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of the territory, including disarmament of Hamas and other groups.The war was triggered by the 7 October 2023 attack, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,650 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "2 hours agoImogen JamesandIan AikmanPolice in England and Wales will be given targets to respond to emergencies within 15 minutes in urban areas, and 20 minutes in rural areas, as part of a major overhaul to be outlined later.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will also pledge to get officers to spend more time on the streets, cutting \"red tape\" and \"unnecessary admin\" she says prevents them leaving their stations.Mahmood said it was a response to an epidemic of \"everyday crime\", such as shoplifting and phone theft, which she said was going \"unpunished\".Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said it was \"hard to take Labour's promises seriously when they have stripped more than 1,300 officers from the front line in our communities\".The number of full time police officers fell by 1,303 in the year to March 2025, according to Home Office figures.Mahmood said the new targets were needed because people were reporting crimes and then \"waiting hours or even days for a response\".John Hayward-Cripps, chief executive of Neighbourhood Watch, said the response targets would be a \"welcome step forward\" towards the \"basic expectation that police will respond when you report a crime\". Most forces already have emergency response targets, but the Home Office said there was currently no way of holding them accountable if they do not meet that standard.Failure to reach the new targets would see the home secretary sending in experts from high performing forces to help improve response times.Chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council Gavin Stephens said that forces would not \"obsess\" about a target if they could not get to a call safely.He told Times Radio that policing needed to change in response to a \"whole range of threats\", including cyber-crime.The targets are part of the government's plans for major changes to policing in England and Wales. Many of the changes have already been announced by the government in the run-up to Monday's announcements. These include: A new National Police Service to free up local forces in tackling everyday crime. The new service will take over responsibility for counter-terror, fraud and organised crime investigationsPlans for every police officer in England and Wales to hold a licence to be able to continue working. They will have to prove they have the right skills in issues such as tackling violence against women and girls or face being removed from their jobThe number of police forces will also be reduced, cutting them from the current 43. No official figure has been given for what will remain, but police chiefs have been calling for the creation of 12 \"mega forces\".Mahmood will also say she wants to change how staffing levels are funded amid concern the current 'officer maintenance grant' encourages some forces to employ uniformed officers in administrative roles such as IT or human resources.Police Superintendents' Association President Nick Smart welcomed moves to modernise the police, but said the workforce had not been consulted on the new proposals.\"We represent experts in policing - the most senior operational leaders in our service - and it is essential our views are taken into account alongside those of chief constables and external advisers,\" he said.Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson said the government \"must deliver\" on its promises and \"get more officers back onto our streets\".",

    "body": "Image source, BBC Weather Watchers/MattFaceyByHelen WillettsLead Weather Presenter, BBC WeatherUpdated 19 minutes agoSevere weather warnings for wind and rain have been issued ahead of the expected arrival of Storm Chandra.Chandra has been named by the UK Met Office and is due to hit the UK on Tuesday.  It is the third major storm to hit the UK this month after Goretti and Ingrid, which caused significant damage and disruption. Chandra will be accompanied by multiple hazards, widely heavy and persistent rain, and gales or even severe gales in exposed areas.Severe weather warnings issuedImage caption, An amber warning for rain comes into force on MondayThe Met Office has issued an amber wind warning for Northern Ireland to accompany Storm Chandra, external.The warning is in place for eastern parts of Northern Ireland, from 05:00 on Tuesday until 21:00.Winds will escalate with coastal gales, even severe gales and damaging gusts of up to 75mph (120km/h). These sort of wind speeds will lead to large coastal waves which are likely to overtop the sea walls and promenades.Image caption, An amber wind warning comes into force in the early hours of TuesdayIt has also issued an amber warning for heavy rain from 17:00 Monday until 09:00 Tuesday for south-west England. 30-50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60-80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor.These areas have already had a large amount of rain, so there is a risk of flooding as more rain falls on ground that is currently saturated.Further warnings issuedImage caption, Storm Chandra is an area of low pressure approaching the UKYellow warnings - the least severe level of warning - are more numerous:Northern Ireland, valid from 12:00 Monday until 18:00, for persistent rain and flood risk with 10 to 20mm widely, up to 40mm over the hills.South-west England, Wales and parts of central southern England valid from 13:00 Monday until 10:00 Tuesday, for 20 to 30mm widely, but as much as 80mm over Dartmoor, Exmoor and Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons).London and south-east England, valid from midnight Tuesday until midday and mentions 15 to 25mm of rain widely, with twice as much over higher ground such as the Chilterns.Northern Ireland, valid Tuesday 00:00 until 23:59, for damaging winds, gusts in exposed parts up to 70mph (113km/h) accompanied by another 20 to 30mm of rain widely, 50 to 70mm over the hills.South-west England and West Wales, valid 05:00 Tuesday until 16:00 for very strong winds.Hilly areas of central and northern England, southern Scotland, valid Tuesday from midnight until 17:00 for heavy rain, 20 to 30mm widely and more in a few spots.  This rain will turn to snow over the hills, up to 5cm on hills around 300 metres and more on higher routes. Drifting is likely with the brisk winds. South-west Scotland, Lothian Borders and Strathclyde, valid Tuesday 05:00 until 23:59 for strong winds causing disruption.Parts of Scotland valid Tuesday from 06:00 until 23:59 for heavy rain and hill snow, rainfall amounts of 20 to 35 mm widely and more in some places. 2 to 5cm of snow for hills around 300 metres and 10 to 20cm above 500 metres. The brisk southeast winds will also blow the snow around reducing visibility.Much of this wet weather comes on after some very wet weather in recent days and weeks and so there is a high chance we will see significant impacts, such as:Air, sea and rail delays or cancellationsSpray and flooding on roadsInterruption or damage to power suppliesFlooding of some homes and businessA few communities might be cut off by flooded roadsTrees could be damaged or blown down, especially where vulnerable following recent stormy weatherLandslides are also possible in prone locationsIs flooding likely?Image caption, Chandra is expected to bring more rain to end a very wet JanuaryStorm Chandra is hitting hot on the heels of Goretti and Ingrid, bringing more soaking rains with little time between for the water to flow away and the rivers fully recover. This continuing rain really heightens the flood risk.  The wind will also be a threat, as strong winds from Goretti and Ingrid have already battered parts of the UK this month, notably in south-west England.  As a result, many structures may have been weakened, trees may have been left vulnerable as well as power lines.Why has the storm been named Chandra?Image source, BBC / Getty imagesImage caption, Wind is the main factor for naming a storm, but sometimes rain or snow are taken in to account as part of the processIn the UK, the Met Office work with Ireland's Met Éireann or the Netherlands' KNMI in naming a storm when they are forecast to cause \"medium\" or \"high\" impacts.The list of storm names is announced on 1 September each year and runs in alphabetical order.The season started with Amy in October, followed by Bram in early December 2025.Next names on our list will be Dave, Eddie and Fionnuala.",

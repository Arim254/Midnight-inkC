On the agenda was a full-throated defence of the administration’s record, hailing a \"turnaround for the ages,” whilst playing down the Supreme Court's ruling against his signature tariff policy (with the judges themselves in the crowd).\nDespite the speech lasting nearly two hours,  there was little to suggest a change of course from Trump’s favourite taking points. He focused on the economy, immigration, the Democrats…. And the US men’s olympic hockey team.\nBut with growing voter dissatisfaction souring the polls, will Trump’s sales pitch be enough to counter sliding approval ratings and convince voters to stick with him for November's midterm election?\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

Lawyers for the peer say he intends to co-operate with police to \"clear his name\". Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.",

The World Cup stadium code of conduct states ticket holders are only permitted to bring certain types of bags into stadiums.Sporrans initially failed to meet the strict security criteria but, following talks between world football's governing body Fifa and the SFA, it has now been agreed fans will be able to wear them.PA MediaScotland fans in full national dress march to a match during Euro 2024 in GermanyScotland are set to face Haiti and Morocco in Boston and Brazil in Miami after qualifying for the finals with a thrilling 4-2 Hampden victory over Denmark in November.The 2026 edition will feature 48 teams and be played from 11 June to 19 July in 16 cities across the US, Canada and Mexico.Under current rules at the two stadiums, the only large bags allowed into the grounds must be made from clear plastic and not exceed 12in x 12in x 6in (30cm x 30cm x 15cm). Any small bags that are not see-through must measure no more than 4.5in x 6.5in (11cm x 16.5cm) – almost half the size of many sporrans.Without the agreement Scotland fans would have had to leave their sporrans in lockers outside or discard them altogether. A SFA spokesperson said: \"FIFA have confirmed that sporrans will be permitted into the stadiums following the standard search and inspection procedures and will continue to work together with the Scottish FA to educate their matchday staff as they prepare to welcome fans to Boston and Miami.\"The ticketing and membership team at the Scottish FA are in continued dialogue with the tournament hosts to ensure that the Scotland fans will be welcomed to venues in the way they have been across the world.\"SNSThe national team wore kilts and sporrans during the 1998 World CupThe agreement comes after it was revealed that the Scotland squad will be kitted out in tailored suits for their World Cup return.But last month the SFA confirmed a Glasgow-based tailor will make \"sharp, made-to-measure suits\" for the players and backroom staff.",

    "body": "Emperor Penguins moult to survive, but scientists fear it may now be killing them3 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporterGetty ImagesEmperor Penguins are likely more at risk from climate change than any other air-breathing Antarctic animal Scientists have discovered that an annual event when Emperor penguins completely shed and regrow their feathers is putting the birds in peril as Antarctica is transformed by a warming world.Each year the birds must stay on platforms of floating ice for long enough to replace weather-beaten feathers with new, waterproof coats.But in 2022-24 Antarctic sea ice shrank significantly, largely down to climate change, depriving the birds of safe places to moult.Now scientists who track the animals using satellite pictures can no longer find most of the birds. They fear that thousands of penguins may have frozen in Antarctica's icy waters.\"This was really an \"oh my God\" moment,\" says the scientist behind the findings, Dr Peter Fretwell at British Antarctic Survey, who has worked on Emperor penguins for 20 years.\"You could see this was something game-changing for Emperor penguins. Suddenly you're thinking, well, have we got time to save them?\" he says. The research, published in the scientific journal Communications Earth & Environment, provides evidence about the impacts of the collapse in Antarctic summer sea ice in 2022-24 which the BBC reported on here.It is focussed on West Antarctica, home to 30-40% of the global population of Emperor penguins. The animals are amongst the most threatened in the world. They migrate thousands of kilometres to find stable sea ice during Antarctic summer to wait out what is called a \"catastrophic moult\" every year. Peter FretwellOn vast white sea ice, the blobs of brown are feathers left behind by penguins as they moultLittle else was known about the 30-40 day moult, until Fretwell spotted large brown smudges in satellite pictures from 2019-2025. They turned out to be mounds of feathers, left in an area called Marie Byrd Land.The penguins' feathers are \"the most complicated and best insulating of any animal\", he says. Over time they are damaged, so the penguins shed them annually.\"It's incredibly energy-intensive and the birds use up to 50% of their body mass,\" he says.Peter FretwellScientists identified extensive mounds of brown feathers in satellite picturesIt is \"probably the most dangerous time for adult Emperor penguins because they haven't got their waterproof suits on,\" he says. If they go into water, they are likely to die.In 2019, 2020 and 2021 the sea ice was relatively stable and significant feather mounds were visible. But in 2022 summer sea ice in much of Antarctica dramatically shrank, falling from an average of 2.8m sq km to a record low of 1.79m sq km in 2023.That trend continued until 2025, when there was a modest recovery in the sea ice in West Antarctica.Getty ImagesResearchers fear that most Emperor Penguins colonies could be wiped out by 2100But when Fretwell looked at the satellite pictures, he saw few signs of the birds. \"There should have been lots of penguins there, but actually we could only see 25 groups,\" he said. Groups vary in size from 10s to up to 1,000 birds.\"Again this year the sea ice hasn't been too bad, but I can only see a handful of penguins really,\" he says.He fears most have could died. Some may have travelled to another location in East Antarctica to moult, but this would have disrupted breeding, also leading to population losses.Longer term, the bird's best chance for survival is to adapt to moult on shallow ice shelves. Fretwell has seen some groups begin to do this, although it may come with a cost to the penguins' breeding and feeding patterns.Peter FretwellHe says the findings are a reminder that while the effects of global warming can be slow at times, there are moments of dramatic change.\"It wasn't just a few colonies that were lost and it wasn't a slow process,\" he says.\"It is the only piece of science I've ever done that's really emotionally got me,\" he says.Next he will compare his findings with an imminent population count of Emperor penguins in the Ross sea region where the birds migrate to and from. That will give more data about the possible numbers of deaths.He says the results could change predicted extinction dates for Emperor penguins.\"Now I'm asking, is that coming forwards towards us? Is it the end of the century?\" he asked.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterBBCActress Suranne Jones said she \"knew the time was right\" to return to her role as Gemma FosterActress Suranne Jones has said she \"can't wait to start filming\" the third and final series of Doctor Foster.The BBC has confirmed the popular drama will return for five new episodes, nine years after the second series aired.Jones will reprise her role as Gemma Foster, who is still a GP and living in the same house, and is on the brink of a fresh start as she prepares to get married.But as the wedding day draws closer, shadows from her past begin to re-emerge, threatening both her happiness and her reputation, the BBC said.Jones said: \"When I got the call to ask if I wanted to return as Gemma Foster, I knew the time was right.\"We needed space from the first two series, and we needed Tom - Gemma and Simon's runaway son - to return as an adult with questions.\"For me, this time around, it's about accountability and questioning - can we ever truly sever ties with our past and the damage or traumas that haunt us, so we can fully move forward? Gemma and Simon have so much to unpick!\"'One last dinner party'Bertie Carvel will return to play Simon, while Tom Taylor will appear as Tom in the BBC drama.The first series of Doctor Foster saw Gemma, a doctor in the fictional town of Parminster, discover her husband Simon was having an affair.It aired in 2015, and was followed by a second series in 2017, with nearly 10 million people watching the finale.Both series won National Television Awards and Jones won a best actress at the Bafta TV Awards in 2016.Filming on the third series is due to begin in Hertfordshire later this spring, the BBC said, with Mike Bartlett returning as writer, creator and executive producer.Bartlett said: \"I always hoped that we'd get to tell the final part of Gemma's story, which is about a woman seeking justice in an unfair world.\"He said there would be \"secrets, betrayals, vengeance and perhaps one last dinner party\", referring to a famous scene from series two.A broadcast date for the final series will be announced in due course.",

While it can appear dramatic, this is a relatively common and entirely natural seasonal event in the UK, according to the Met Office. Episodes of Saharan dust transport occur several times a year, most often in late winter and spring, when southerly winds draw warm air northwards from north Africa towards the UK.Look out for some particularly intense colours at dawn and dusk later on Wednesday, as well as during Thursday and Friday.",

    "body": "7 hours agoAna FaguyWashington Spanberger delivers Democratic response to Trump addressAbigail Spanberger, the first female governor in Virginia's history, attacked President Donald Trump's economic and immigration policies during Democrats' response to the State of the Union address.She questioned whether the president was working to make life more affordable and safer for Americans, while criticising Trump's immigration crackdown in US cities and tariffs on imports.The rebuttal - first delivered in 1966 by a rising star in the opposing party - came just moments after Trump finished his remarks on Capitol Hill. Spanberger, 46, was elected as Virginia's governor in November after serving in Congress and working as a CIA officer.\"Tonight the president did what he always does,\" she said of Trump's remarks. \"He lied, he scapegoated, and he distracted, and he offered no real solutions to our nation's pressing challenges, so many of which he is actively making worse.\"She began her speech laying out three questions she wanted Americans to ask themselves: is the president working to make life more affordable, is the president working to keep America safe at home and abroad, and is the president working for you. Spanberger said the answer to all three of those questions is no. She attacked the Trump administration's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Democratic-led cities, and applauded resistance to the efforts in Minneapolis. \"Our president has sent poorly trained federal agents into our cities where they have arrested and detained American citizens and people who aspire to be Americans,\" she said. \"And they have done it without a warrant.\"Reuters\"They have killed American citizens in our streets. And they have done it all with their faces masked from accountability.\"Federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti and Renee Good - both US citizens - last month during immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis. The Trump administration replaced the top official and withdrew agents from the city following an outcry after the deaths. Spanberger also criticised the rising costs of housing and healthcare, and described Trump's tariff policy as \"reckless\". She claimed his policies have cost American families $1,700 (£1,260) each. Even though the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration's tariff policy, Spanberger said \"the damage to the American people has already been done\". She said Republicans in Congress, by failing to oppose the president, are costing Americans.\"They're making your life harder,\" the governor said. \"They're making your life more expensive.\"The selection of Spanberger to deliver the Democratic rebuttal to Trump represented little political risk for Democrats. She was elected a few months ago and cannot run for re-election, since Virginia has a one-term limit.In her rebuttal speech, she suggested Democrats could be in a good position to win seats in Congress in November's midterm elections, noting that she ousted a Republican incumbent in 2018 to win a seat in US Congress and helped Democrats secure a majority.\"In my case, I was the first Democrat elected in 50 years, swinging our district 17 points,\" Spanberger said.She said her fellow Democrats running in November would be \"working to lower costs -  we are working to keep our communities and our country safe, and we are working for you\".In the November election, Spanberger won 57.6% of the vote in one of the first major US races after Trump was re-elected.",

    "body": "Tourette's campaigner says BBC 'should have worked harder' to stop his slur being aired1 hour agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterGetty ImagesJohn Davidson said his Tourette's meant he was \"shouting literally the last thing in the world I believe\"Tourette's campaigner John Davidson has said the BBC should have \"worked harder to prevent anything that I said\" at the Bafta Film Awards being broadcast, and questioned why he was seated near a microphone.Davidson, whose condition involves involuntary tics, shouted a racist slur while black actors Michael B Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage at Sunday's ceremony.Davidson told Variety: \"I remember there was a microphone just in front of me, and with hindsight I have to question whether this was wise, so close to where I was seated, knowing I would tic.\"The BBC reiterated that the offensive language \"arose from involuntary verbal tics associated with Tourette syndrome\", adding: \"We apologise that this was not edited out prior to broadcast and it has been removed from BBC iPlayer.\"In contrast, the one shouted when Lindo and Jordan were on stage \"was aired in error and we would never have knowingly allowed this to be broadcast\", she said.Davidson, from Galashiels in Scotland, said he shouted about 10 different offensive words during Sunday's ceremony as a result of his tics, but the media coverage has given the impression the N-word was the only one.Variety reported that he has contacted Warner Bros in order to apologise directly to Jordan, Lindo and Sinners production designer Hannah Beachler, who also spoke about hearing racial slurs.\"We're very sorry for this mistake,\" the company said of the computer-generated alert. \"We've removed the offensive notification and are working to prevent this from happening again.\"How the Bafta racial slur controversy unfoldedDavidson told Variety that the studio behind the film I Swear, which tells the story of his struggles with Tourette's, held discussions with Bafta before the ceremony about the possibility of his ticking.\"StudioCanal were working closely with Bafta, and Bafta had made us all aware that any swearing would be edited out of the broadcast,\" he said.\"I have made four documentaries with the BBC in the past, and feel that they should have been aware of what to expect from Tourette's and worked harder to prevent anything that I said - which, after all, was some 40 rows back from the stage - from being included in the broadcast.\"'Comprehensive review'Awards ceremonies often have microphones placed at various spots around the auditorium, to pick up ambient crowd noise as well as applause and cheering.In a statement on Monday, Bafta said it acknowledged the \"harm this has caused, address what happened and apologise to all\".In a letter to its members on Tuesday, the organisation said it wanted to \"assure all our members that a comprehensive review is under way\".After shouting the slur, Davidson said he chose to leave the auditorium \"so as not to cause any more upset\", adding that Bafta found him a private room with a monitor to watch the rest of the ceremony.Davidson said he \"had as much right to attend as anyone\", as the subject and executive producer of I Swear, which was nominated for five awards.\"I also knew that as voting members, most people in the audience would have seen I Swear and would be well prepared, well educated and well informed about my condition,\" he said.Davidson said he was \"aware of how physically and mentally difficult it would be for me to attend\", adding: \"I can't begin to explain how upset and distraught I have been as the impact from Sunday sinks in.\"'The opposite of what I believe'In his interview with Variety, Davidson also said: \"I want to be really clear that the intent behind them [the tics] is zero. What you're hearing is a symptom - not my character, not my thought, not my belief.\"He said he felt a \"wave of shame an embarrassment\" after shouting the racial slur.\"Tourette's can feel spiteful and searches out the most upsetting tic for me personally and for those around me,\" he explained. \"What you hear me shouting is literally the last thing in the world I believe; it is the opposite of what I believe. \"The most offensive word that I ticked at the ceremony, for example, is a word I would never use and would completely condemn if I did not have Tourette's.\"Getty ImagesUS reality TV star Baylen Dupree, who has Tourette's syndrome, explained it \"doesn't pull from hatred\"Several figures in the Tourette's community have also sought to explain the condition.Writing on Instagram, Baylen Dupree, star of US reality series Baylen Out Loud, explained: \"Tourette's doesn't pull from hatred – it often pulls from anxiety, from fear, from the very thing you're most scared of saying.\"The brain misfires on what feels charged or taboo. It doesn't excuse the hurt a word carries. Words matter. History matters. Pain matters. But so does neurological reality.\"BBC News understands the producers editing the ceremony for its delayed BBC broadcast were doing so from a TV truck and simply did not hear the slur shouted when Lindo and Jordan were on stage.\"John needed a BBC person next to him at all times to support him, but also to relay and be aware of anything that he said,\" Byrne reflected.\"So there needed to be, in the written plan, a means by which the people in the truck would be aware of what happened in the room.\"'Deeply traumatising'Former BBC News executive and Conservative communications chief Sir Craig Oliver said the TV truck defence was \"kind of entering into the dog-ate-my-homework territory\".\"It's increasingly obvious that we live in a time where there are going to be controversial things at live events, and there is going to be potential reputational damage to the BBC,\" he said. \"So does it have that grip, does it have that process in place? And increasingly it seems like the answer is no.\"Meanwhile, BBC Radio 1 DJ Oré Olukoga has expressed his disappointment with how the situation has been handled by the corporation.\"I understand all the nuances at play and would never want to minimise someone's plight, but as a Black man who works for the BBC, I am deeply, deeply disappointed in how it's been handled,\" he said.",

Trump also made claims about illegal immigration as well as ending a series of wars around the world.BBC Verify has looked into them.'Their policies created the high prices. Our policies are rapidly ending them'Prices are still rising but the rate of inflation has slowed since Trump took office at the start of last year.Prices rose significantly during Biden's first two years in office, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which contributed to inflation across the globe.Trump reeled off a list of grocery items including beef, claiming the price of it \"which was very high, is starting to come down significantly\".He also highlighted egg prices which have fallen by 34% over the past 12 months.Overall grocery prices increased 2.1% in the 12 months to January 2026.And some Trump policies have been blamed for adding to inflation - economists at Harvard University have estimated that Trump's tariffs (import taxes) in 2025 lifted the overall US rate of consumer price inflation (relative to where it would otherwise have been) by around 0.92 percentage points in January.'Gasoline… is now below $2.30 a gallon in most states and in some places $1.99 a gallon'The only state we could find anywhere near $2.30 a gallon - on the website - is Oklahoma with an average price of $2.37 a gallon. That is the state with the lowest average price listed by the AAA.During Trump's speech, the website GasBuddy said drivers could buy gasoline at below $2 per gallon - at four stations (out of an estimated 150,000) in the US.'More Americans are working today than at any time in the history of our country'That claim is correct but there is additional context.The percentage of people 16 or older employed in the US was 59.8% in January this year, slightly down from 60.1% in January 2025 when Biden left office.And the unemployment rate is actually slightly up under Trump - from 4.1% in December 2024 (Biden's last full month in office) to 4.3% in January 2026.'In 12 months I secured commitments for more than $18 trillion pouring in from all over the globe'There is no publicly available evidence to support a figure this big.A White House website tracks \"new investment in U.S. manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure\" since Trump returned to the White House.Its latest total - updated overnight - is $9.7tn (£7.2tn), still a big figure but much less than the president claims.Greg Auclair, a statistician at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told BBC Verify that there has been an uptick in foreign investment in the US over the past year.But he cautioned that the White House tracker \"includes pledges that may not materialise\". He cited the EU trade deal, as an example, which has been put on ice because of Trump's latest tariff threats.'Cheating is rampant in our elections'Trump returned to this familiar claim as he appealed to lawmakers to pass stricter voter ID requirements to \"stop illegal aliens from voting\".However, there is no evidence of \"rampant\" voter fraud in US elections. It does happen but the data suggests it is rare.BBC Verify looked into claims of illegal immigrants voting in the build-up to the 2024 US election and, again, studies have suggested cases are rare.For example, the Brennan Center for Justice - a liberal-leaning think tank - looked at 12 states in the 2016 election. It found that of 23.5 million votes counted, only 30 suspected incidents of non-citizens voting were referred for further investigation.'In the past nine months, zero illegal aliens have been admitted into the United States'If he was referring to migrants released from custody - once they've crossed into the US - then this is correct.Border Patrol has still been recording several thousand illegal crossings each month under Trump, with the latest figures showing 6,070 apprehensions at the southwest border in January 2026.But that's still a significant drop from the same period two years ago under former president Joe Biden, when 124,215 apprehensions were recorded in January 2024.'In my first ten months, I ended eight wars'The White House lists the \"wars\" as ones between: Israel and Hamas, Pakistan and India, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Thailand and Cambodia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Egypt and Ethiopia and Serbia and Kosovo.Although, Trump can claim credit for brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, it is not correct to say he has ended eight wars.A number of these \"wars\" had lasted just days, although were the result of long-standing tensions.How many wars has President Trump really ended?But in one case, the \"war\" between Egypt and Ethiopia was a dispute over the building of a dam and there was no actual fighting to end.There has also been fighting between Rwanda and the DRC, after the two sides signed a peace agreement in Washington.India also played down the US role in ending its brief conflict with Pakistan.",

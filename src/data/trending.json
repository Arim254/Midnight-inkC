    "body": "11 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesL-R: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sarah Ferguson and Ehud BarakThe list of some of the world's most rich and powerful people with ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has lengthened, after the US government released millions of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier.There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing. Many people who have featured in previous releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Here is a list of some of the people mentioned in the latest release. Elon MuskThe documents include email correspondence between Epstein and tech billionaire Elon Musk over travel plans Epstein appeared to be arranging, although Musk has said he has never visited Epstein's private island. In November 2012, Musk wrote in one email: \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In another, from December the same year, he wrote:  \"I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose\", adding that a \"peaceful island experience\" is the opposite of what he's wanting.Response: Musk responded in an X post in January, acknowledging that the emails might be used to \"smear my name\", but said he was more concerned about the prosecution of \"those who committed serious crimes with Epstein\". Bill GatesTwo emails from 18 July 2013 are written as though drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they are genuine or were ever sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates \"to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls\".In an interview with NPR, his ex-wife Melinda said the release of the documents brought up memories of their marital struggles.\"I'm able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, my God, how did that happen to those girls?\" she said.\"At least for me, I've been able to move on in life, and I hope there's some justice for those now-women.\"Response: A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: \"These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.\"Donald TrumpThe US president is mentioned hundreds of times in the newly released files, including a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line. Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence.The list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures.Response: Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorPhotographs appearing to show Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground have also been included in the latest Epstein files release.In two of the images, the former prince is seen touching the person, who is unidentified and fully clothed, on her stomach. Another image shows him staring directly at the camera.No context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken.Response: BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.US Department of JusticeAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoingRichard BransonRichard Branson's name appears hundreds of times in the files. In one 2013 exchange, Epstein thanks Branson for his recent hospitality and public relations advice, to which Branson replies that it was \"really nice\" seeing him, adding: \"Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!\"Virgin Group has clarified that \"harem\" referred to three adult members of Epstein's team. Response: In a statement to the BBC, Virgin Group said Branson's contact with Epstein was \"only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event\".The statement added: \"When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations.\"As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again. Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever – Richard believes that Epstein's actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims.\"Sarah Ferguson Sarah Ferguson, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife, who is invariably known as Fergie, appears to also be mentioned in multiple emails, including when Epstein was still under house arrest.An email from an account believed to belong to Epstein says: \"I think Fergie can now say, I am not a pedo.\"In another email exchange from April 2009 there is a request to meet Epstein for a \"quick cup of tea\", that includes the lines: \"My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you.\" Response: The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response.Lord MandelsonEpstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released in the files suggest, including to his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva. The Metropolitan Police has launched a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.In 2009, one year after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor, da Silva sent an email requesting \"anything you can help me with\". Epstein replied: \"I will wire your loan amount immediately\".A separate email exchange appears to show Epstein arranging a place for Mandelson to stay at one of his New York apartments, with Epstein writing, \"thrilled to host and sad I'm not there\".Response: Lord Mandelson has said he will step down from the House of Lords. On Sunday, Mandelson reiterated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\" and for continuing his association following Epstein's conviction. He has told the BBC he \"was never culpable or complicit in (Epstein's) crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death\". He has not responded to the allegations of leaking documents, but BBC understands that he maintains he did not act criminally and did not act for personal gain. He argues that he sought Epstein's expertise in the national interest during the 2008 global financial crisis.Steve Bannon The files also contain thousands of messages that appear to be sent between the late convicted sex offender and one of Trump's former top advisers, Steve Bannon.Most messages were sent in 2018 and 2019 after Bannon left his role in the first Trump White House, as he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death.One text exchange shows Bannon apparently strategising with Epstein on how to change the narrative around his past crimes, suggesting \"first we need to push back on the lies\" and \"rebuild your image as philanthropist\". Response: Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.Miroslav LajčákAn October 2018 text exchange between Miroslav Lajčák - who was serving as Slovakia's foreign minister at the time - and Epstein appeared to show the two messaging about girls and diplomacy. After Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: \"Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl.\"\"Who wouldn't,\" Epstein texts back. \"You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters.\"Response: Following the latest release of Epstein-related documents, Lajčák resigned from his current post as Slovakia's national security advisor. He is not accused of any wrongdoing.Watch: 'Do you think you're the devil himself?' Epstein questioned in newly released interviewHoward LutnickBillionaire businessman and US Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick planned a visit to Jeffrey Epstein's island Little Saint James with his family, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files' release.In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant on what appeared to be the eve of the visit: \"We are looking forward to visiting you\", and, \"We would love to join you for lunch\". Response: The Commerce Department said in a statement to the BBC that \"Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing\".Larry SummersLarry Summers, US President Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary and former Harvard University president, is also in the new documents, including references to meetings and dinners between Summers and Epstein.In emails from 2017, Summers and Epstein joked about Trump and criticised him during his first term. \"Your world does not understand how dumb he really is,\" Epstein said of Trump in one email to Summers.Response: After Summers was mentioned amid a batch of Epstein files released in November, he said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\" and resigned from multiple posts, including his role on the advisory board of OpenAI. Steve TischSteve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, is shown in the release of Epstein-related documents inquiring about a woman he met at Epstein's house.In one email exchange, Tisch asked whether the woman was a professional or a \"civilian\".In other exchanges, Epstein tells Tisch he had a \"present\" for him and described a woman he would introduce Tisch to as \"tahitian speaks mostly french, exotic\".Response: In a statement to CNN, Tisch said he and Epstein \"had a brief association\", adding that he \"did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island\".Brett RatnerThe director of the new documentary on First Lady Melania Trump also appeared in a photo embracing a young woman in the files.Brett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured.Response: There is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner's representative for comment.US Department of JusticeBrett Ratner is seen on the right here alongside Jeffrey Epstein and two women Peter AttiaThe anti-aging influencer and CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, exchanged hundreds of emails with Epstein, including crass comments, the latest documents release shows. In the emails, he wrote that his friendship with Epstein was something he could share publicly and included a discussion of the 2018 Miami Herald story that identified some of Epstein's victims.He also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex, emails show.Response: On 2 February, Attia made a statement on X rejecting that he was \"involved in any criminal activity\", adding that \" I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties\".Casey WassermanThe chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games sent flirty emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of Epstein.Casey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, show him saying: \"I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein.Response: Wasserman said in a statement: \"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light.\" Sergey BrinSergey Brin, co-founder of Google and one of the world's richest men, visited Epstein's private island and made plans to dine at Epstein's home in New York City, according to the documents released on Friday.He also corresponded with Ghislaine Maxwell, who wrote to Brin in April 2003: \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed\", and, \"Look forward to seeing you\". Response: The BBC has reached out to Google for comment. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing in the emails.Ehud BarakFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is mentioned in the newly released Epstein-related documents, showing they corresponded on multiple occasions after Epstein was convicted for sex crimes in Florida in 2008.One exchange shows plans for Barak to stay at Epstein's New York City residence in 2017. Response: Barak has acknowledged his regular interactions with Epstein but said he never observed or participated in any inappropriate behaviour or parties. Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky, the famed linguist, appeared in both releases of the Epstein files, and the latest tranche of documents suggests Chomsky advised Epstein on media coverage of sex trafficking allegations against him. In emails from February 2019, the disgraced financier asked Chomsky if he should \"defend myself\" or \"try to ignore\".A response that appears to be from Chomsky laments \"the horrible way\" Epstein was treated and the \"hysteria that has developed about abuse of women\".\"It's painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,\" the email said.Response: The appearance of Chomsky's name in the files does not imply wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Chomsky's wife Valeria, who is his spokesperson, for comment.Brad KarpBrad Karp, the chairman of prestigious law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down from his role after the latest files showed dozens of apparent email exchanges between him and Epstein. One correspondence reportedly is said to show Karp discussing Epstein's pre-existing plea deal on sex trafficking charges.In an email sent in March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, a sender named Brad Karp said: \"The draft motion is in great shape.\" Bloomberg reported that this discussion related to Epstein's efforts to protect the 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors, in which he avoided federal charges, which could have seen him face life in prison. There is nothing in the emails to prove that they were in fact linked  to the plea deal.Response: Announcing his resignation in a company statement on Wednesday, Karp said: \"Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.\" The statement did not mention the Epstein files, and Karp has not commented since. The BBC has contacted Paul Weiss for further comment.Bill ClintonIn the justice department's first release of Epstein documents in December, several images showed former US President Bill Clinton, including a picture of him swimming in a pool, and another with him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was first arrested.Response:  A spokesman for Clinton, Angel Ureña, said on social media in December that photos released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) were decades old. \"They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be,\" he said.\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first,\" he said.In a post on social media, Clinton said that he had told Congress everything he knows. \"I have called for the full release of the Epstein files. I have provided a sworn statement of what I know,\" he said. \"And just this week, I've agreed to appear in person before the committee.\"Deepak ChopraThe files appear to reveal communication between Epstein and the self-help author Deepak Chopra years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from minors.In a February 2017 email, Chopra seemingly asks Epstein to come to Israel with him and an unnamed group.\"Come to Israel with us,\" Chopra says. \"Relax and have fun with interesting people. [if] you want use a fake name . Bring your girls. It will be fun to have you . Love\"In another apparent exchange a month later, the pair talk about God and cells of the human body before Chopra says: \"Cells are human constructs. No such thing ! Universe is human construct No such thing. Cute girls are aware when they make noise.\"Later in the discussion, Chopra adds: \"God is a construct. Cute girls are real.\"Epstein also asks the alternative medicine advocate: \"Did you find me a cute Israeli?\"Response: Since these emails emerged, Chopra has posted a statement online saying he was \"deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims in this case\" and denied his involvement in \"any criminal or exploitative conduct.\"\"Any contact I had was limited and unrelated to abusive activity. Some past email exchanges have surfaced that reflect poor judgment in tone. I regret that and understand how they read today, given what was publicly known at the time. My focus remains on supporting accountability, prevention, and efforts that protect and support survivors.\"The BBC has asked Chopra if in his dealings with Epstein, he was aware of any wrongdoing.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJoe PikePolitics investigations correspondentUK ParliamentJosh Simons said he had asked the firm to look into a \"suspected illegal hack\" which was unrelated to any UK journalistA government minister employed a PR and lobbying firm to investigate journalists' sources before he entered Parliament.Cabinet office minister Josh Simons was chief executive of the pro-Starmer think-tank Labour Together and in 2023 commissioned APCO Worldwide to try and identify how reporters had uncovered information about the group's funding.In a contract for the work seen by the BBC, APCO Worldwide confirmed it would \"investigate the sourcing, funding and origins of a Sunday Times article about Labour Together\" as well as upcoming works by two political authors.The allegations, first reported by investigative website Democracy for Sale, centre on how Labour Together responded to media reports about the think tank's failure to declare more than £700,000 in donations between 2017 and 2020.Labour Together was fined £14,250 by the Electoral Commission in September 2021 over late reporting of donations.Josh Simons said it was \"nonsense\" to claim he wanted to investigate journalists and he had asked APCO Worldwide to \"look into a suspected illegal hack, which had nothing to do with UK journalists at Sunday Times, Guardian or any other brilliant UK newspaper\".\"APCO's investigation never fully got to the bottom of this,\" he wrote on X. \"Those who know me know I think the work of journalists is vital to our democracy.\"Labour Together and ACPO Worldwide have not responded to requests for comment. A government source said: \"We are looking into the claims\".The think tank is alleged to have hired journalist-turned-lobbyist Tom Harper from APCO Worldwide to investigate reporting by The Sunday Times and other outlets to identify their sources. Harper has not responded to a request for comment.In the leaked contract, APCO Worldwide said it intended to \"establish who and what are behind the coordinated attacks on Labour Together\".The firm said it would use open source, human intelligence and digital forensics work and its approach should \"provide a body of evidence that could be packaged up for use in the media in order to create narratives that would proactively undermine any future attacks on Labour Together\".Before Simons led Labour Together, it was run by Morgan McSweeney who is now Keir Starmer's chief of staff.The BBC has reached out to Morgan McSweeney for comment. A source close to McSweeney pointed out he was not running Labour Together at the time APCO's investigation was commissioned.",

He was an extremely loved son, brother, uncle, boyfriend and friend,\" the family added.The force said it was called to Oxford Street, close to the junction with Bonners Lane, just after 17:00 GMT on Tuesday, and several nearby roads were subsequently closed.Prof Katie Normington, vice-chancellor of DMU, said she was \"devastated\" over Oladipo's death, adding direct support was being offered to students, staff and his family.Related internet links",

Zeferelli [sic] home converted into beautiful suites and privacy with accompanying rooms for your 'guests',\" he writes in a message sent from his Blackberry, the document suggests.US Department of JusticeWhile the sender of the email is redacted in the published file, the black redaction box does not completely cover his email address in one reference on the chain.The correspondence is just one exchange between Lord Mandelson and Epstein revealed in the US Department of Justice releases that sheds new light on the friendship between the men.In other published emails from 2009, Lord Mandelson asks how they should celebrate Epstein's release from prison, to which the disgraced financier responds: \"With grace and modesty (those are the names of two strippers)\".A spokesperson for the peer said: \"Lord Mandelson regrets, and will regret until to his dying day, that he believed Epstein's lies about his criminality.\"Lord Mandelson did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019.\"He is profoundly sorry that powerless and vulnerable women and girls were not given the protection they deserved.\"Epstein died in a New York prison cell in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "15 hours agoNardine SaadReutersActor Timothy Busfield appeared in court for a detention hearing in January and a judge ordered his release pending trialEmmy-winning actor Timothy Busfield has been indicted in the US state of New Mexico on four counts of criminal sexual contact of a child, prosecutors say. The charges against him stem from allegations brought by child actors he worked with on the New Mexico set of the Fox series The Cleaning Lady, which he directed and produced. The grand-jury indictment unsealed on Friday carries state charges that supersede the previous charges announced by the county prosecutor last month. The West Wing and Field of Dreams actor, 68, who has denied the allegations, surrendered to state authorities last month when a warrant was issued for his arrest. A judge later ordered his release pending trial. Busfield had originally been taken into custody in Albuquerque on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse.\"As with all criminal proceedings, Mr Busfield is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law. This case will proceed through the judicial process and is expected to move forward to trial,\" said Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman upon announcing the indictment.He emphasised that protecting children remains a top priority for his office. The indictment, reviewed by the BBC, says that on or between 19 October 2022 and 10 September 2023, Busfield \"touched or applied force to the intimate parts\" of one of the unnamed boys when he was under the age of 13.The felony charges carry a penalty of six years in prison per charge, the court document states.Watch: Melissa Gilbert gets emotional after husband Timothy Busfield's releaseBusfield's civil attorney Stanton \"Larry\" Stein said in a statement to the BBC that the indictment was not unexpected, though it is \"deeply concerning\" that the district attorney is choosing to proceed on a case that he says is \"fundamentally unsound and cannot be proven at trial\". Stein pointed to last month's detention hearing, which he said \"exposed fatal weaknesses in the State's evidence - gaps that no amount of charging decisions can cure\".\"This prosecution appears driven by something other than the facts or the law. Mr Busfield will fight these charges at every stage and looks forward to testing the State's case in open court - where evidence matters - not behind closed doors,\" he added.Judge David A Murphy in January authorised Busfield's release on the actor's own recognisance and without bail, with the requirement to appear at all future court dates.The Thirtysomething actor's defence team submitted more than 70 letters from people vouching for his character and said that he underwent and passed a polygraph test pertaining to the allegations against him.At the January hearing in the Albuquerque courtroom, Busfield's criminal defence lawyer Amber Fayerberg argued against the idea that Busfield was \"exploiting his power\" because he no longer had any.\"He is persona non grata, and that's not because he did anything wrong ... that's because of the world we live in,\" she said.She noted that the actor had been \"cancelled\" by the state, dropped from his talent agency and had been edited out of a recent rom-com that was just about to be released.The defence lawyer said there was overwhelming evidence that the allegations were \"manufactured\".In a warrant for Busfield's arrest, prosecutors had said the parents of boys alleged that he groomed and sexually abused the youngsters while working on set for The Cleaning Lady.Authorities claimed the boys referred to Busfield as \"Uncle Tim\" and alleged that he \"would tickle them on the stomach and legs\". Both boys told authorities they were touched inappropriately for years, his arrest affidavit states.One of the boys alleged that Busfield touched his private areas, according to court documents. The boy told authorities that the alleged inappropriate touching started when he was seven years old and he was scared to speak out because he \"feared\" that Busfield would \"get mad at him\".Busfield's lawyers have said the actor was being accused as an act of revenge after the children had been terminated from the series, which angered their mother.",

    "body": "15 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorVisionhaus/Getty ImagesThe crown princess said that the messages exchanged with Epstein did not represented who she wanted to be (file pic)Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit has given a \"profound apology\" to Norwegians for her friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after it emerged they had exchanged messages for three years.\"I also apologise for the situation in which I have placed the Royal House, especially the King and Queen,\" she said in a palace statement after days of mounting pressure to address the issue.Harald V and Queen Sonja, who are both 88, have not commented on the revelations. The King met Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre on Friday, alongside Crown Prince Haakon, who told reporters later that his wife wanted to speak: \"But right now she can't, and I also tell her she is not allowed to.\"Hundreds of emails from 2011-14 involving Epstein and the crown princess came to light in the cache of files published by the US justice department a week ago. Some of the exchanges apparently involve plans to meet in person, and reveal she spent four days at Epstein's Palm Beach house in Florida while he was not there.The warm nature of the correspondence has come as a shock to Norwegians, and she appears to have been aware he had already served a jail term in 2008: \"Googled u after last email,\" she wrote in October 2011. \"Agree didn't look too good.\"Although an initial statement was released last Saturday, in which the crown princess expressed regret and admitted \"poor judgement\", the palace had been pressed to provide further details of how well she knew Epstein.In a statement on Friday, the palace said the crown princess was deeply saddened that she had failed to realise early enough what kind of person he was. She wanted to provide a more detailed explanation but was in a \"very difficult situation\" and needed time to \"gather herself\".\"It is important for me to say I am sorry to all those I have disappointed. Some of the content in the messages between Epstein and me does not represent the person I want to be.\"Mette-Marit already had a four-year-old boy, Marius Borg Høiby, from an earlier brief relationship when she married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon in 2001.Her first child Marius Borg Høiby is now 29 and at the centre of a high-profile seven-week trial which began this week. He faces 38 charges, including four counts of rape which he denies.Although neither part of the royal family nor a public figure, he has grown up within his step-father Crown Prince Haakon's family, alongside half-sister Princess Ingrid Alexander and half-brother Prince Sverre Magnus.Rune Hellestad/Getty ImagesFile pic showing Crown Prince Haakon (R) and the crown princess with his step-son (L) and Princess Ingrid Alexandra (C-L) His mother has not commented on the trial but Crown Prince Haakon told reporters in Oslo there was a lot going on in his family and the most important thing in the past few days \"has been to take care of the flock\".\"We support Marius in the situation he is in. We look after the other children as well... They also need to be cared for, and I have to make sure to take care of the crown princess,\" he said.Mette-Marit is also extremely unwell with pulmonary fibrosis and her doctors are preparing to put her on a list for a lung transplant.Giving evidence in court on Wednesday, her son initially struggled to compose himself, holding back tears as he complained of being \"hassled\" by the press since he was three years old.If found guilty by the three judges at Oslo district court, he could face a jail term of at least 10 years. Two days before the trial began, he was arrested for a fourth time on Sunday, on suspicion of assault, wielding a knife and violating a restraining order. His half-sister Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 22, was also critical of the press in a post to almost 800 followers on a private Instagram account this week.In lengthy comments seen by public broadcaster NRK, Aftenposten and VG website, the princess, who is second in line to the Norwegian throne after her father, said it was important \"not to make claims you have no basis for\".While stressing she was not referring to anything in particular - \"not Marius, not mum or dad or Magnus. It's about personal attacks, it can apply to anyone, but I chose to post this here because I'm going crazy. Enough is enough\".When approached by the BBC, the palace said it did not wish to comment on the matter.",

    "body": "1 hour agoGetty ImagesJeane Freeman was an MSP from 2016 to 2021Former Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman, who was a key figure in the response to the Covid pandemic, has died at the age of 72.Her partner said she died in hospital less than four weeks after being diagnosed with cancer.A former nurse, justice campaigner and civil servant, Freeman entered politics as a special advisor to Labour First Minister Jack McConnell before joining the SNP and standing for the Scottish Parliament.She became an MSP in 2016 and was appointed health secretary two years later, before standing down at the 2021 election.She was a regular presence at the daily media briefings held by the Scottish government during the Covid pandemic.Freeman was born and raised in Ayr and had a long career in the health and social justice sectors before working in politics. For 12 years she ran the social enterprise Apex Scotland, working with employers and former prisoners. She was awarded an OBE in 1996 for her work rehabilitating offenders.Freeman chaired the board of the Golden Jubilee Foundation and was a member of the Parole Board for Scotland and the Judicial Appointments Board.She was MSP for the Ayrshire seat of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley from 2016 to 2021 and served as health secretary between 2018 and 2021.During that time she ordered a public inquiry into the design, construction, commissioning and maintenance of Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and a new children's hospital in Edinburgh.After leaving Holyrood in 2021 she gave evidence at the UK Covid Inquiry and the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry.'Courage and care'Her partner, Susan Stewart, said: \"Jeane was given an unexpected diagnosis of incurable cancer on 13 January and we only had 25 days thereafter. Days which she faced with enormous courage, care for others and love for me.\"I wish to thank all the staff in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital whose professional skill, care and sensitivity were exceptional. We were both very grateful and also for the outpouring of love and concern from so many, across politics and beyond. Be kind to each other, that is what changes the world.\"Jeane and I were partners for over 25 years and I admired and supported her professional and public life. I am immensely proud of her, not least her latter  volunteering at the Beatson Centre taking round the tea trolley, a job she loved.\"But it is the private Jeane – my soul mate and companion – who I will be forever grateful to have had in my lifeFirst Minister John Swinney wrote on X: \"I am heart sore this morning at the death of Jeane Freeman, a wonderful Cabinet colleague.\"Jeane gave selfless service to Scotland especially as health secretary during Covid. In designing Scotland's social security system, she put dignity and respect at its heart.\"Jeane brought deep values of fairness and justice to all that she did. She made a huge contribution to our cause and our team. I express my deepest sympathies to Susan and her loved ones.\"'Heartbroken' - SturgeonFormer First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also paid tribute to Freeman, who she described as one of her \"best and closest\" friends. \"Words can't even begin to convey how heartbroken I feel that Jeane Freeman has gone,\" she said.\"As health secretary during Covid, she helped steer Scotland through the toughest of times. \"As well as bearing her own heavy responsibilities during that time, she helped me bear mine. I'm not sure I could have got through it without her by side.\"She added that she had last seen Freeman on Friday and during her visits to hospital had been\" overwhelmed to witness Jeane's courage\".'Formidable... ferociously clever' Former first minister and Labour peer Lord McConnell, who worked closely with Freeman during the early years of devolution, described her as one of his \"oldest friends\", adding that Scottish public life was \"poorer without her\". \"From her time as a student leader when we first met to becoming health secretary during a global pandemic she never flinched in the service of those she represented,\" he said. \"Jeane was one of the most formidable public figures of her generation. She was ferociously clever, fired by a strong sense of justice and an enduring commitment to public service.\"He added: \"Whatever role she was in, whether as head of Apex, a government adviser or in the cabinet, she gave everything, She was renowned for her strong opinions and work ethic, but she was never more happy than when she was with her soulmate Susan.\"Jeane Freeman made a political shift in the devolution years from Labour to the SNP via the campaign for independence.I was slightly taken aback to witness the moment she revealed her political journey.It was on a TV show I presented one Sunday. She appeared on set as a commentator - probably during the SNP's first term in office.Having been a key adviser to the previous Labour administration she might have been expected to take a pro-UK position.Instead, she signalled frustration with the powers of the Scottish Parliament and her potential support for independence.With hindsight, she was probably bringing to the surface a stronger undercurrent in the politics of that time.In government, she worked hard and with purpose. Her role in shaping the devolved benefits system is under appreciated.I always found her open and candid and I know that she showed care for others.When I last saw her, we reflected on the Covid lockdown. Freeman recalled a drive through the empty streets of Edinburgh in March 2020 and how she said to herself \"God, I hope we've got this right\".",

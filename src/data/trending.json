    "body": "Man who cryogenically froze ex-wife sparks debate by dating new partner2 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterSouthern China WeeklyA Chinese man who cryogenically froze his dead wife has sparked an online moral debate after Chinese media revealed he had been dating a new girlfriend as his former partner lay preserved in liquid nitrogen.As a sign of his devotion, Gui Junmin decided to freeze his wife Zhan Wenlian's body after she died from lung cancer in 2017, aged 49, making her China's first cryogenically preserved person.But after a November interview revealed he had been dating a different partner since 2020, Chinese social media has been torn on Mr Junmin's predicament.Whilst some asked why the 57-year-old didn't just \"let go\" another commenter remarked he appeared to be \"most devoted to himself\".After Zhan Wenlian was given months to live by doctors, Gui Junmin decided to use cryonics - which is scientifically unproven - to preserve her body once she died.Following her death, he signed a 30-year agreement to preserve his wife's frozen body with the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute.Since then, Zhan's body has been stored in a 2,000-litre container at the institute in a vat of -190C liquid nitrogen.A 'utilitarian' relationshipChinese newspaper Southern Weekly revealed that although Mr Junmin lived alone for two years after the procedure, in 2020 he began dating again, despite his wife remaining in cryopreservation.He told the newspaper that a severe gout attack which left him unable to move for two days began to change his mind about the benefits of living alone.Soon after, he started seeing his current partner Wang Chunxia, although Mr Junmin suggested to the paper the love was only \"utilitarian\" and that she hadn't \"entered\" his heart.Reacting to the news, some commentators on the Chinese social media site Weibo showed sympathy with Mr Junmin's plight, highlighting how long it had been since his wife was put in the cryogenic chamber.Some believed it was time for him to move on from his frozen former spouse, adding he should, \"let the departed...rest in peace\".But others suggested the he had acted selfishly to only \"satisfy his emotional needs\", with one post questioning \"Would Zhan agree to this? Is it fair to Wang?\".What is cryonics?Cryonics is where the whole body is cooled down to sub-zero temperatures, infused with cryoprotectants - which is similar to antifreeze - to prevent ice crystal formation, then preserved in liquid nitrogen.The hope is that the body can one day be revived when future technology makes this possible.The practice is currently used at a smaller scale in day-to-day medicine, where living cells such as blood cells, sperm and embryos are frozen at ultra-low temperatures to be stored.It's estimated that over 500 people have been cryogenically preserved worldwide, the majority of them in the US.No one has ever been successfully revived following cryopreservation, and scientists believe that preserving and reawakening the complete human body is still a remote possibility.",

    "body": "29 minutes agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterA number of high-profile websites, including X and ChatGPT, went down for many on Tuesday, due to problems affecting major internet infrastructure firm, Cloudflare.Thousands of users began reporting issues with the sites, as well as other services, to outage monitoring site Downdetector shortly after 11:30 GMT.Cloudflare said th \"significant outage\" occurred after a configuration file designed to handle threat traffic did not work as intended and \"triggered a crash\" in its software handling traffic for its wider services.\"We apologise to our customers and the Internet in general for letting you down today,\" it said in a statement.\"Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable,\" the company added.It said while the issue had been resolved, some services might still encounter errors as they came back online.A wide range of apps and websites were impacted by the outage.Users reported encountering delays or technical issues when trying to access services such as Grindr, Zoom and Canva.Meanwhile social media platform X (formerly Twitter) was displaying a message on its homepage for some users which said there was a problem with its internal server due to an \"error\" originating with Cloudflare.ChatGPT's site was also displaying an error message telling some users: \"please unblock challenges cloudflare.com to proceed.\"Cloudflare is a huge provider of internet security across the world, carrying out services such as checking visitor connections to sites are coming from humans rather than bots.It says 20% of all websites worldwide use its services in some form.The range of sites affected was demonstrated by the fact Downdetector itself - a site many flock to when sites stop loading or appear to have issues - also displayed an error message as many tried to access it on Tuesday.Alp Toker, director of NetBlocks, which monitors the connectivity of web services, said the outage \"points to a catastrophic disruption to Cloudflare's infrastructure\".\"What's striking is how much of the internet has had to hide behind Cloudflare infrastructure to avoid denial of service attacks in recent years,\" he told the BBC - highlighting how the company aims to protect sites against malicious attempts to overwhelm them with traffic requests.He said that however, as a result of this - and the convenience of its services - it had also become \"one of the internet's largest single points of failure.\"Cloudflare has stressed the problem was the result of a technical problem.\"To be clear, there is no evidence that this was the result of an attack or caused by malicious activity,\" it said in its statement.The company's share price was trading around 3% lower shortly after 15:00 GMT.Issues affecting Cloudflare's services come after an outage impacting Amazon Web Services last month saw more than 1,000 sites and apps knocked offline.Another major web services provider, Microsoft Azure, was also affected shortly afterwards.\"The outages we have witnessed these last few months have once again highlighted the reliance on these fragile networks,\" said Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET.\"Companies are often forced to heavily rely on the likes of Cloudflare, Microsoft, and Amazon for hosting their websites and services, as there aren't many other options.\"",

    "body": "26 minutes agoAdam Easton,Warsaw correspondent and Jaroslav LukivTwo Ukrainian citizens who long worked for Russian intelligence have been identified as the suspects behind two acts of sabotage on Poland's rail network, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.One suspect had already been convicted in absentia of acts of sabotage in Ukraine, Tusk told parliament.On Monday, he visited the scene of an explosion near Mika, south-east of Warsaw, which damaged the railway line leading to the Ukrainian border at the weekend, and called it an \"unprecedented act of sabotage\".Another incident down the line near Pulawy on Monday forced a packed train to stop suddenly and damage was found to overhead cables.The Kremlin brushed off suggestions of Russian involvement.Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: \"It would have been really strange, if Russia hadn't been blamed first.\"\"Russia is accused of all acts of hybrid and direct war... in Poland,\" he told Russia's state-run media, adding: \"Russophobia is certainly rampant there.\"Polish authorities had initially said there was a very high chance that the two acts of sabotage on the Warsaw-Lublin railway line had been ordered by a \"foreign service\". Then a spokesman for Poland's special services minister said on Tuesday that \"everything points to them being Russian special services\".\"The goal was to cause a rail catastrophe,\" Tusk told MPs.The Polish prime minister said he would not disclose the names of the two suspects as this could complicate the operation, though he told parliament that one was living in Belarus and the other was a resident of eastern Ukraine.Both suspects had crossed into Poland from Belarus during the autumn and had now returned there via the border crossing at Terespol in the far south-west of Belarus, close to the Ukrainian border, he added.Tusk said that a military-grade C4 explosive device had been detonated on 15 November at about 21:00 (20:00 GMT) near the village of Mika.The explosion, which happened as a freight train was passing, caused minor damage to a wagon floor. It was captured on CCTV.Tusk said the train driver had not even noticed the incident.A previous attempt to derail a train by placing a steel clamp on the rail had failed, he added.The second act of sabotage, on 17 November, involved a train carrying 475 passengers having to suddenly brake because of damaged railway infrastructure, said Tusk.The prime minister also said he would issue an order later on Tuesday to raise the alert level on certain railway lines.He said since the start of last year 55 people had been detained on suspicion of assisting, preparing, or committing acts of sabotage and that 23 of them had been remanded in custody.Russia's motivation, Tusk went on, was to sow panic and stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Polish society, which is home to more than one million Ukrainian war refugees.\"I want to emphasise that what the Russian authorities care about is not only the direct effect of this type of action, but also the social and political consequences of the fact that this action is taking place,\" he said.\"This of course means disorganisation, chaos, panic, speculation and uncertainty.\"Poland is both a Nato and EU member state, and its railway network has become vital for moving supplies of aid into Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.In September, Tusk said three Russian drones had been shot down by Polish and other Nato aircraft in Poland's airspace during overnight attacks on Ukraine.He said at the time that authorities had recorded 19 drone incursions, with some flying deep enough to temporarily close four airports, including Warsaw's main hub Chopin.Russia's defence ministry responded by saying there had been \"no plans\" to target facilities on Polish soil.",

    "body": "What now for Queen's playhouse after Andrew evicted from Royal Lodge?10 hours agoIolo CheungBBC WalesWelsh playhouse amuses generations of royalsOnce described as the \"most glamorous Wendy house ever\", Y Bwthyn Bach became a memorable childhood feature for generations of the Royal Family.The miniature two-storey thatched cottage was gifted to a young Princess Elizabeth in 1932 by the people of Wales.It was installed in the grounds of her family's then home, Royal Lodge in Windsor, and has remained there ever since, most recently in the care of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who has lived in the mansion since 2004.But with the late Queen's third child stripped of his titles and evicted from the royal residence, what does the future hold for the cottage - and could it even be returned to Wales?Getty ImagesA young Princess Elizabeth outside Y Bwthyn Bach in June 1933Y Bwthyn Bach – Welsh for The Little Cottage – was built in Cardiff and presented to Princess Elizabeth's parents, the then Duke and Duchess of York, for their daughter's sixth birthday.Designed by architect Edmund Willmott, the cottage was built by Welsh craftsmen from materials left over from the construction of Llandough Hospital in Vale of Glamorgan, which opened in 1933.It was a carefully planned miniature version of a real-life house, with four 5ft-high rooms – two upstairs and two downstairs.It even included its own working telephone, electric cooker, fridge and running water in the kitchen, luxuries even for real homes in the 1930s.\"It's called a cottage but it was more like a replica of a very comfortable house,\" said historian Dr Elin Jones.Museum WalesThe cottage was assembled in Wales before being transported in its entirety to Royal Lodge in Windsor\"It's an enchanting place and I remember seeing pictures of it when I was a child, and seeing, at the time, Prince Charles and Princess Anne playing in what looked like a fantastic Wendy House,\" said Dr Jones.At the time of the gift, Elizabeth's parents were the Duke and Duchess of York, before her father ascended to the throne as George VI, following his brother Edward VIII's abdication.Custody of the cottage later passed to Andrew when he was Duke of York and he reportedly paid for its upkeep, while his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie were among the next generation of royals to enjoy it.Princess Beatrice oversaw a refurbishment of the cottage and later described it as the \"most glamorous Wendy house ever\" in a BBC documentary celebrating Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee.\"Granny and her sister [Princess Margaret] played here growing up,\" she said at the time. \"We have been lucky enough to play here, and cousins and second cousins.\"Princess Beatrice showed Andrew Marr around Y Bwthyn Bach for a BBC seriesBut with the removal of Andrew's titles, the future of the cottage is unclear.Buckingham Palace confirmed to the BBC that ownership of Y Bwthyn Bach currently sits with King Charles III.\"Both the Royal Family and the governments of England and Wales have other things to think about, which are rather more pressing and important than a child's plaything,\" said Dr Jones.\"But it could be argued that the best place for this little cottage… might be for it to come back to Wales and go to St Fagans as part of the history of our country.\"The house is an interesting expression of the loyalty felt by Welsh people towards the Royal family for centuries.\"But those ties are \"weakening, loosening, because of devolution and the current changes in society\", the historian said.Getty ImagesKing George VI and Queen Elizabeth with Princesses Margaret and The Queen Mother at Y Bwthyn Bach in 1936Dr Jones added: \"I think Y Bwthyn Bach is a fossil, really. It's historically interesting, you could argue that it is a part of Welsh history which might be better placed in a museum in Wales, like so many other relics of our past.\"Royal enthusiast Anne Daley, from Cardiff, hopes the cottage will continue to be used by younger members of the family rather than risk falling into disuse.\"It's just another cottage that's now empty – how many other are empty on that estate now?\" she said.\"What about the Prince of Wales and Catherine? I wonder if their children would play in it. It's only going to be forgotten about, dilapidated, unless Prince William lets his kids play there.\"If that were not the case, she too would like to see it return to Wales.\"It was a gift so it belongs to them,\" she said. \"I'm not sure really if you can ask for a gift back.\"But, historically, I'd love to see it, the public have never seen the inside.\"I would suggest bring it back to St Fagans museum and we can all have a look at it, even if you need to demolish it brick by brick and put it back together.\"More top stories",

    "body": "'I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance16 hours agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countries\"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Getty ImagesJi-Young Yoo (left) and May Hong (right) are also voice actors in the filmThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, targeting those who are in the country illegally, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.Cho says that when she was younger, people didn't know what it meant to be Korean in the USAs an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\"Starting conversations, building connections and challenging misinformation through features, investigations, interviews and extraordinary stories",

    "body": "8 hours agoJenny Kumah and Malcolm Prior,BBC News rural affairs teamTom MasonThe South West Wildcat Project hopes to bring back 50 European wildcats across the mid-Devon countrysideWildcats – one of the UK's most critically endangered mammals – could make a return from extinction in England, conservationists say.The South West Wildcat Project hopes to bring back 50 European wildcats, from 2028, after a study found a colony could \"flourish\" in the mid-Devon countryside.Reintroduction plans follow a breeding scheme to boost numbers in Scotland but there are concerns that the carnivores could pose a threat to poultry, gamebirds and native bird species, as well as a risk of cross-breeding with domestic cats.The Countryside Alliance said that if that risk was not dealt with, ambitions to sustain a genetically pure wildcat population would be \"doomed to failure\".Malcolm Prior/BBCWildcats – historically also known as 'woodcats' – were once widespread in Great BritainThe South West Wildlife Project – a partnership led by Devon Wildlife Trust - said independent research by the University of Exeter showed that about 80% of people asked were positive about wildcat reintroduction.But Oliver Edwards, a beef and sheep farmer on Exmoor, told the BBC he was concerned that reintroducing a predatory species would have \"a detrimental effect on the animals and bird life that live here already\".\"They say wildcats live on voles. Well, voles are feeding my barn owls so if you reduce the vole population you are having an effect on the barn owls,\" he explained.He added that there needed to be wider consultation with farmers and landowners about the best areas to reintroduce the wildcats.European wildcats – historically also known as woodcats – were once widespread in Great Britain until human persecution and the loss of woodland and rough grass habitats saw them disappear from England and Wales.Today, the UK's only remaining wildcat population lives in the Highlands of Scotland but, despite being given protected status in 1988, they are now classed as critically endangered and at risk of UK extinction, with as few as 115 remaining in the wild.Malcolm Prior/BBCCath Jeffs, from Devon Wildlife Trust, said measures taken to stop other predators from targeting farmed birds would work for wildcats.Cath Jeffs, the South West Wildcat Project lead for Devon Wildlife Trust, said the team would continue to work closely with locals to deal with any concerns or issues raised over the phased reintroduction and that specific locations had yet to be decided.She pointed out that most measures taken to stop predators like foxes from targeting poultry or gamebirds would work for wildcats.She added that it was unlikely there would be a population explosion as wildcats live in low density numbers over wider areas and they would be closely monitored and managed. \"We are absolutely committed to making this happen, but in the right way and at the right time,\" she added.The south west of England has been identified as a prime site for reintroduction because of the woodland cover it offers across mid-Devon, connected by other habitats that suit wildcats.But some critics have suggested the area is more populated than parts of the Highlands where they have been reintroduced before.They said that could lead to the wildcats breeding with feral domestic cats, with such interbreeding – also known as hybridisation - undermining the whole idea of bringing back the species.Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said that the organisation was not opposed to \"properly planned and managed reintroduction\".But he said there were concerns about the ability to sustain a \"genetically pure\" population of wildcat because of the threat of hybridisation.\"Reintroducing wildcats in the south-west without addressing this issue would seem to be doomed to failure,\" he said.A spokeswoman for the Devon Wildlife Trust said they would tackle the threat of hybridisation by working with local welfare organisations to support a neutering programme for feral and domestic cats in areas where wildcats were introduced.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesLawmakers are facing mounting calls to push for the full release of the documentsUS President Donald Trump has urged Republicans in Congress to vote to release more files relating to Jeffrey Epstein - a sudden reversal in his position after having previously opposed efforts to make the documents public.Trump had been facing a potential revolt after a growing number of Republicans signalled they would vote in favour of releasing the files despite his opposition.While the measure is likely to pass in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, it is far from certain that it would pass in the Republican-controlled Senate. And even if it does pass in the Senate, it remains unclear when the files could be released and whether they would satisfy ardent campaigners.On Tuesday, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on a measure that would compel the justice department to make publicly available \"in a searchable and downloadable format\" all files pertaining to Epstein within 30 days.Procedural votes and debates are expected to begin at 10:00EST (15:00GMT) and continue for many hours. Several victims of Epstein are also expected to spend the day on Capitol Hill, to advocate for the bill's passage and to hold news conferences with reporters. The releases could, in theory, also include files pertaining to imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as people - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents. The vote will come just two days after Trump wrote on Truth Social to encourage Republicans to vote for the measure. In the post, he argued that \"we have nothing to hide\".The measure is likely to pass. Even before Trump's post, some House Republicans had made clear they were willing to break ranks with the president and House Speaker Mike Johnson to vote in favour. Should it pass, it still faces an uncertain future in the Senate, which is under no obligation to even pick up the measure.It remains unclear whether Senate Majority Leader John Thune will do so - but the Republican is under enormous pressure from both sides of the US political spectrum. He had previously suggested that while he was \"not hearing\" much desire from fellow Republicans to push for the release of the documents, a successful House vote could change that. \"I just hope John Thune will do the right thing,\" Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie told ABC News over the weekend. Another Republican, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, only told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the Senate will \"take a look\" at the bill if it passes the House. \"We'll see what it says,\" Barrasso said. \"We all want accountability and transparency. But to me, this it not about the truth. It's not about justice.\" \"This is about an attempt by the Democrats to make President Trump a lame-duck president,\" he added. \"And I'm not going to aid and abet them in their efforts to do that.\" Only after the Senate passes the bill would it head to President Trump, who has said he would sign it into law.Speking to reporters on Monday night, he said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\". \"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he claimed. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"Trump went on to argue the Epstein scandal was a \"hoax\" distracting from \"the greatness of what the Republican Party had accomplished over the last period of time\". There are obstacles to the files being released even if Trump signs the bill.  The text of the document that will go before the House, for example, notes that the attorney general could withhold or redact portions of records that contain personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\".\"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC.\"There may also be some issues about law enforcement techniques that the justice department might not want to be out there in the public domain,\" he added. Watch: How much do Americans care about the Epstein story?The proposed House bill also notes that the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\". That could potentially lead to delays, given that President Trump said in his post that he would be calling for an investigation into Epstein's alleged links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton and Larry Summers \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\".\"That's a potential hurdle,\" Prof Entin said. \"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\" Doing so, he added, \"might create some prejudicial publicity about targets of the investigation\" that could ultimately lead to intense litigation if any indictments are brought. For those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage. \"I believe the country deserves transparency in these files,\" Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican now in a public row with Trump over the files, told CNN on Sunday. \"I have no idea what's in the files. I can't even guess,\" Greene added. \"But that is the question everyone is asking is - why fight this so hard?\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoFaisal Islam,economics editor and Rachel Clun,business reporterAlphabet boss Sundar Pichai has warned of some \"irrationality\" in the current AI boomEvery company would be affected if the AI bubble were to burst, the head of Google's parent firm Alphabet has told the BBC.Speaking exclusively to BBC News, Sundar Pichai said while the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) investment had been an \"extraordinary moment\", there was some \"irrationality\" in the current AI boom.It comes amid fears in Silicon Valley and beyond of a bubble as the value of AI tech companies has soared in recent months and companies spend big on the burgeoning industry.Asked whether Google would be immune to the impact of the AI bubble bursting, Mr Pichai said the tech giant could weather that potential storm, but also issued a warning.\"I think no company is going to be immune, including us,\" he said.In a wide-ranging exclusive interview at Google's California headquarters, he also addressed energy needs, slowing down climate targets, UK investment, the accuracy of his AI models, and the effect of the AI revolution on jobs.The interview comes as scrutiny on the state of the AI market has never been more intense.Alphabet shares have doubled in value in seven months to $3.5tn (£2.7tn) as markets have grown more confident in the search giant's ability to fend off the threat from ChatGPT owner OpenAI.A particular focus is Alphabet's development of specialised superchips for AI that compete with Nvidia, run by Jensen Huang, which recently reached a world first $5tn valuation.As valuations rise, some analysts have expressed scepticism about a complicated web of $1.4tn of deals being done around OpenAI, which is expected to have revenues this year of less than one thousandth of the planned investment.It has raised fears stock markets are heading for a repeat of the dotcom boom and bust of the late 1990s. This saw the values of early internet companies surge amid a wave of optimism for what was then a new technology, before the bubble burst in early 2000 and many share prices collapsed.This led to some companies going bust, resulting in job losses. A drop in share prices can also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds.In comments echoing those made by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in 1996, warning of \"irrational exuberance\" in the market well ahead of the dotcom crash, Mr Pichai said the industry can \"overshoot\" in investment cycles like this.\"We can look back at the internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the internet was profound,\" he said.\"I expect AI to be the same. So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"His comments follow a warning from Jamie Dimon, the boss of US bank JP Morgan, who told the BBC last month that investment in AI would pay off, but some of the money poured into the industry would \"probably be lost\".But Mr Pichai said Google's unique model of owning its own \"full stack\" of technologies - from chips to YouTube data, to models and frontier science - meant it was in a better position to ride out any AI market turbulence.The tech giant is also expanding its footprint in the UK. In September, Alphabet announced it was investing in UK artificial intelligence, committing £5bn to infrastructure and research over the next two years.Mr Pichai said Alphabet will develop \"state of the art\" research work in the UK including at its key AI unit DeepMind, based in London.For the first time, he said Google would \"over time\" take a step that is being pushed for in government to \"train our models\" in the UK - a move that cabinet ministers believe would cement the UK as the number three AI \"superpower\" after the US and China.\"We are committed to investing in the UK in a pretty significant way,\" Mr Pichai said.However, he also warned about the \"immense\" energy needs of AI, which made up 1.5% of the world's electricity consumption last year, according to the International Energy Agency.Mr Pichai said action was needed, including in the UK, to develop new sources of energy and scale up energy infrastructure.\"You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy, and I think that will have consequences,\" he said.He also acknowledged that the intensive energy needs of its expanding AI venture meant there was slippage on the company's climate targets, but insisted Alphabet still had a target of achieving net zero by 2030 by investing in new energy technologies.\"The rate at which we were hoping to make progress will be impacted,\" he said.AI will also affect work as we know it, Mr Pichai said, calling it \"the most profound technology\" humankind had worked on.\"We will have to work through societal disruptions,\" he said, adding that it would also \"create new opportunities\".\"It will evolve and transition certain jobs, and people will need to adapt,\" he said. Those who do adapt to AI \"will do better\".\"It doesn't matter whether you want to be a teacher [or] a doctor. All those professions will be around, but the people who will do well in each of those professions are people who learn how to use these tools.\"",

    "body": "53 minutes agoKaty ScottBBC ScotlandBBC Weather Watchers/StargazerKingussie in the Highlands saw heavy snowfall on TuesdayThe Met Office has warned that yellow weather warnings for snow and ice could impact travel in Scotland and northern England later.Scattered showers of rain, sleet and snow are expected, with a snow alert in place for most of mainland Scotland north of Perth until 18:00.A yellow warning for ice covers most of the central belt, southern Scotland and northern England from 16:00 on Tuesday until 11:00 on Wednesday.Later, an alert for snow and ice comes into force for all of northern Scotland including Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, from 18:00 on Tuesday until 21:00 on Thursday.BBC Weather Watchers/FreddySnow ploughs have cleared the A9 in the Highlands after wintry conditions took holdThe Met Office said that 0.8in to 2in (2-5cm) of snow is possible at lower levels and as much as 4in (10cm) on higher ground.A snow and ice alert is in place for Northern Ireland overnight, as well as an ice warning for Wales and much of the Midlands in England.Also in England, a warning for snow and ice covers some eastern coastal areas and western coastal areas on Wednesday and Thursday.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has also issued amber and yellow cold health alerts for northern England and the Midlands which are valid until Saturday.It will turn less cold by the end of the week, with temperatures rising slightly to return to average at the weekend.Met OfficeThe warnings cover much of the country across four daysBear Scotland, which maintains Scotland's trunk roads, has reported \"snowy conditions\" across a number of routes in the north-west of Scotland, with snow ploughs out clearing the A82 and A9.Some Calmac ferry services have been affected by the weather conditions, with some cancellations and delays across routes on the west coast and Western Isles.ScotRail urged people to take care while travelling and to check the status of their entire journey before heading out.Gritters have been out overnight pre-treating and patrolling roads across the country. Stagecoach said customers would be updated about any changes on its app or social media channels.The Met Office advised that there was a chance of power cuts as well as road closures.'Conditions turning colder'A yellow warning means the weather is likely to have some impact for some people, but others will be able to carry on as normal.People are advised to keep an eye on the latest forecast to work out how much they might be impacted, especially if the weather gets worse.The coldest night since March was recorded on Saturday when temperatures dropped to -7C in Tulloch Bridge in the Highlands.Kirsty McCabe, from the Royal Meteorological Society, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme people would notice the \"sudden switch\" to cold weather.\"November so far has been well above average, it's felt very mild,\" she said. \"This is the first proper cold snap of the season. It's really feeling quite wintery. Also, because we've got the snow and ice warnings out.\"Yes most of the snow will be above higher ground, across parts of northern Scotland but this evening could be quite a wintry mix coming down, even into the central belt to lower levels. So we could see a few flakes of snow this evening.\"BBC Weather Watchers/Kaiser_MuldoonOxton in the Scottish Borders saw icy conditions on Tuesday morning For those travelling to Hampden to see Scotland play Denmark in the World Cup qualifier, Ms McCabe said it could be a bit sleety in places and \"maybe the odd rumble of thunder\".She said that although the snow was not likely to settle at lower levels it could be enough to cause disruption.\"It could make the roads more skiddy in places and could affect travel and the trains,\" she said. She added that the cold snap would last until the end of the week and by Friday morning temperatures could go down to -10C in some areas.However, she said temperatures would return to average through the weekend.Last November, a bus toppled onto its side in icy conditions in AberdeenshirePolice Scotland said drivers should ensure their cars are roadworthy before heading out.Last week, Scottish transport operators outlined their winter resilience plans.This included stocking up on 497,000 tonnes of salt - more than was used for the entirety of last winter - and preparing 240 gritters to undertake salt spreading and snow ploughing patrols of the trunk road network. So far, November has been considerably milder than previous years.Typical overnight temperatures at this time of year range from 2C in Scotland to 5C in the south of England, but they rarely fell into single figures during the first week of November this year.Temperatures below -10C were recorded in some parts of northern Scotland last November, including Braemar in Aberdeenshire which reached a low of -11.2C.Temperatures to dropThis week's weather will give us an early taste of winter, writes BBC Scotland Weather's Christopher Blanchett.  The forecast is for 1-2in (2-5cm) of snow on ground above 500ft (150m) across inland areas north of the central belt. On higher ground and higher road routes, the snow will be heavier, with a greater potential for some disruption. Some disruption is likely with ice, sleet and snow causing problems for travel during Tuesday morning, before easing into the afternoon.BBC Weather Watchers/C BeeCold spells are expected over the next week, with the potential for snow similar to this scene near Mintlaw in Aberdeenshire last NovemberThere's a little pocket of less cold air within the system, which means for much of the central belt and south, snow is likely to be on higher ground. But as the temperature drops on Tuesday night, snow may come to lower levels again for a time.Bitter north winds will surge across the country on Wednesday and Thursday, with frequent snow showers at sea-level across the north of Scotland and down some eastern and western coasts.Thursday night could see the coldest spots of the country dip to a bitter -10C.",

Children, families will perish,\" says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\"It's actually so frustrating that we've now lost so many crucial weeks since the adoption of the Trump peace plan, which said humanitarian aid would flow and the Palestinians would not needlessly continue to suffer.\"With a majority of the population displaced by two-years of a devastating war, most Gazans now live in tents - many of them makeshift.  They have been clearing up after widespread flooding due to a winter storm that began on Friday. There are fears that diseases could spread as rainwater has mixed with sewage water.\"My children are already sick and look at what happened to our tent,\" said Fatima Hamdona, crying in the rain over the weekend, as she showed a BBC freelance journalist the ankle-deep puddle inside her temporary home in Gaza City.\"We don't have food - the flour got all wet.  We're people who've been destroyed.  Where do we go? There's no shelter for us to go to now.\"Fatima Hamdona (pictured) says her family's food perished in the rainThe story was the same in the southern city of Khan Younis.\"Our clothes, mattresses and blankets were flooded,\" said Nihad Shabat, as she tried to dry out her possessions there on Monday.  Her family has been sleeping inside a shelter made of sheets and blankets.  \"We're worried about getting flooded again. We cannot afford to buy a tent.\"A recent UN report found that across Gaza more than 80% of buildings had been destroyed and 92% in Gaza City.According to the NRC - which has long led the so-called Shelter Cluster in Gaza, made up of some 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - about 260,000 Palestinian families, or about 1.5 million people, are in need of emergency shelter assistance, lacking the basics to get through winter.The NGOs say they have been able to get only about 19,000 tents into Gaza since the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 10 October.  They say they have 4,000 pallets of aid - containing non-food items, including tents and bedding - blocked from entering.  Supplies that have been bought are currently stuck in Egypt, Jordan and Israel.Jan Egeland blames what he calls \"a bureaucratic, military, politicised quagmire\" running \"counter to all humanitarian principles\" for the hold-up. In March, Israel introduced a new registration process for aid groups working in Gaza, citing security reasons.  It requires that they give lists of their local Palestinian staff.  However, aid groups say that data protection laws in donor countries prevent them from handing over such information.Many tents have fallen to pieces, leaving displaced Palestinians without proper shelterMany items, including tent poles, are also classed as \"dual-use\" by Israel, meaning they have a military as well as civilian purpose, and their entry is banned or heavily restricted.Cogat, the Israeli defence body that controls the border crossings, told the BBC that \"over the last few months\" it had coordinated the entry of \"close to 190,000 tents and tarpaulins directly to the residents of the Gaza Strip\". It said that \"in accordance with the terms of the agreement\" of the ceasefire, it was allowing \"hundreds of trucks carrying food, water, fuel, gas, medicines, medical equipment, tents, and shelter supplies [to] enter the Gaza Strip every day, in coordination with the UN, international organizations, donor countries, and the private sector\". On Sunday, Cogat wrote on X: \"We call on international organizations to coordinate more tents and tarpaulins and other winter humanitarian responses.\"It said it was working with the new US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that had been set up in southern Israel and other international partners to plan \"a catered humanitarian response for the upcoming winter\".International aid groups are hoping that the CMCC - which will oversee implementation of President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan - will help ease restrictions on their work.With a foreign donor conference on reconstruction in the Palestinian territory expected to take place in Egypt soon, they say basic shelter supplies must be allowed to enter while longer-term plans are developed.\"It would not be a good thing if all these nations meet in Cairo to discuss long-term reconstruction for Palestinians in great need if they die before their high-rise buildings can be reconstructed,\" says Mr Egeland, who was previously the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator.  \"They need a tent today, they don't need a promise of a beachfront structure in five years.\"Displaced Palestinians have nowhere else to go after so much of Gaza was devastated in the warPalestinians have told the BBC that many tents - brought in by international agencies and Gulf donors - have been stolen and are available on the black market in Gaza.They say that with a small increase in supply, prices have dropped from about $2,700 (2,330 euros; £2,050) before the ceasefire, to around $900-$1,000.There are pleas for international help to distribute more shelters, more fairly.\"I hope everyone will join with us to end this crisis we're living through,\" says Alaa al-Dirghali in Khan Younis.  \"The tents endured two years under the sun and two years under the rain and they couldn't last this downpour.\"\"Until this moment, people are re-erecting these broken tents because they don't have any alternative.  I pray to God that those responsible for handing out tents will give them to those who actually need them.  They're getting stolen and sold to people at a very expensive price.\"\"When the rain came, the tents couldn't protect us,\" says Rami Deif AllahIn Gaza City, Rami Deif Allah, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, was drying out soaked mattresses in the weak sunshine, with his elderly mother and children.He said a relative had given him a waterproof tent but that it was still flooded.\"We evacuated about 11 times and there was no safe place for us so we took shelter in these humble tents but it was all in vain. When the rain came they couldn't protect us,\" he said. \"The water flooded us from above and below.\"Like all Gazans, Rami longs for a permanent dwelling.\"We pray for this war to be fully over, and for everyone to return to their homes,\" he went on.  \"Even if we don't find our houses standing, with our sweat and blood we will rebuild. This situation of living out on the streets is unbearable.\"Correction 18 November 2025: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said NGO said 44,000 pallets of aid were being blocked from entering Gaza. The correct figure is 4,000.",

    "body": "16 hours agoJonah FisherEnvironment correspondentJonah Fisher/BBCGrant Mitchell from Severn Trent Water says every day 10 tonnes of wet wipes is removed from sewage at Minworth Wastewater Treatment works Long the scourge of water companies for blocking pipes, a ban on the sale of wet wipes made of plastic has been signed into law.The new rules will come into force in 2027 and will bring England into line with legislation across the rest of the UK. Plastic wipes don't disintegrate when flushed down the toilet, so when oil and fat congeal on them, so-called fatbergs form in sewers, which water companies say cost them £200m a year to clear.Most of the wipes that are sold in the UK are now made of non-plastic materials but the government and water companies say they should not be labelled as \"flushable\" because they can still cause blockages.The wet wipe manufacturers contacted by the BBC said their non-plastic \"flushable\" wipes have been thoroughly tested and comply with all the rules. PA MediaLast month, this massive fatberg was removed from a sewer in west London - it weighed 100 tonnes, Thames Water saidFatbergs can become huge if the blockage is not cleared. Just last month a massive stinking lump of wet wipes, fat and oil was removed from a west London sewer. It weighed the same as eight double-decker buses and took a specialist team more than a month to break down.The market for wet wipes has been growing steadily for years. According to government figures in 2023, 32 billion wipes were sold to UK consumers of which about 12 billion contained plastic. If they were all laid out flat that's enough to cover 2,200 football pitches with plastic wipes. Though they welcomed the new legislation for England, water industry sources were also quick to point out its limitations. UK companies will still be able to manufacture and export plastic wet wipes, and they will still be available for people to buy from pharmacies both in person (behind the counter) and online. Businesses like hotels will be allowed to buy the wipes, without restrictions.The medical profession successfully argued for an exemption from the wet wipe ban, arguing that non-plastic wipes absorb too much of the detergents and disinfectants impregnated in them, with potential consequences for patient safety. Where your wet wipes end up when you flush themAt Minworth Wastewater Treatment works in the Midlands the scale of the current problem can be both seen and smelt.Minworth serves a population of more than two million people across Birmingham and the Black Country and Severn Trent, who run the facility, say 10 tonnes a day of wet wipes end up here.\"It's a nightmare,\" Grant Mitchell, Severn Trent's head of blockages says, as we survey a small mountain of wipes.He's just shown us the area where the \"un-flushables\" are filtered out from the sewage. It's grotty stuff. There are dead rats, a rubber duck as well as a huge ball of soiled wipes.\"Wet wipes are a problem because they're made to not break down like toilet paper,\" he says. \"So they stay in one piece, and they gather together with fat, oil, and grease from kitchens, congeal and create a fatberg which causes flooding.\"Also on hand at Minworth is Emma Hardy the Minister for Water and Flooding.\"It's going to make a huge difference,\" Emma Hardy, the Minister for Water and Flooding, said of the ban as we sheltered from the rain at Minworth. \"I think people maybe underestimate the amount of problems that these wet wipes cause.\"Daniel Jolly/University of East AngliaDaniel Jolly from the University of East Anglia has been researching how quickly biodegradable wipes breakdownWhile many brands say their wipes are \"flushable\" and environmentally friendly, whether they can and should be disposed of down the toilet is being questioned.Daniel Jolly is researching how fast these biodegradable wet wipes break down. In a lab at the University of East Anglia in Norwich we watch as he simulates what a toilet flush does to a wipe.\"This isn't toilet paper\" he says as the wipe slowly breaks apart into fibres while he stirs the water inside an tank. \"Even though it's the same basic materials, this is built completely differently and it's much stronger.\"Jolly has been carrying out tests on the banks of the River Yare to see how quickly the plastic-free wipes disintegrate.\"It's a period of most likely months to a year, or two years, depending on the environmental conditions that they're in,\" he says. \"That's much slower than toilet paper which is between weeks to several months, but much better than a plastic wipe which can last hundreds, even thousands of years in certain situations.\"Research commissioned by the government found that some non-plastic wipes failed tests on how fast they disintegrated, meaning they could still block sewers. Jolly is now looking at what impact the biodegradable wipes have on aquatic life as they fall apart. Jonah Fisher/BBCMany non-plastic wipes are now marketed as \"flushable\", but the government and water companies say they should be thrown in the bin after useUntil March 2024 the water companies ran a certification scheme which gave the green light for some wipes to be put in the toilet, called \"Fine to Flush\".  But that was discontinued because of fears it was causing confusion among consumers and replaced with a new slogan \"Bin the Wipe\".Now the advice from the government and the water companies is very clear. Only the three P's - pee, paper and poo should be put down the toilet. \"Restricting the sale of wet wipes containing plastic is a step in the right direction,\" said a spokesperson for Water UK, the industry's trade body. \"But we really need a ban on their manufacture and mandatory 'do not flush' labelling on all wet wipes.\"Some of the manufacturers who market \"flushable\" wipes told the BBC that they were in fact moist toilet tissues, but Water UK said it still viewed them as wet wipes so they shouldn't be flushed. \"I would encourage them [the wet wipe manufacturers] to show leadership on this right now,\" says Minister Hardy. \"Instead of marketing them as being flushable, provide labelling to inform the public that they need to bin them and not flush them down the toilets.\"Additional reporting by Gwyndaf Hughes",

    "body": "Don't blindly trust what AI tells you, says Google's Sundar Pichai6 hours agoFaisal Islam,economics editor, Rachel Clun,business reporter and Liv McMahon,Technology reporterGetty ImagesPeople should not \"blindly trust\" everything AI tools tell them, the boss of Google's parent company Alphabet has told the BBC.In an exclusive interview, chief executive Sundar Pichai said that AI models are \"prone to errors\" and urged people to use them alongside other tools.Mr Pichai said it highlighted the importance of having a rich information ecosystem, rather than solely relying on AI technology.\"This is why people also use Google search, and we have other products that are more grounded in providing accurate information.\"However, some experts say big tech firms such as Google should not be inviting users to fact-check their tools' output, but should focus instead on making their systems more reliable.While AI tools were helpful \"if you want to creatively write something\", Mr Pichai said people \"have to learn to use these tools for what they're good at, and not blindly trust everything they say\".He told the BBC: \"We take pride in the amount of work we put in to give us as accurate information as possible, but the current state-of-the-art AI technology is prone to some errors.\"The company displays disclaimers on its AI tools to let users know they can make mistakes.But this has not shielded it from criticism and concerns over errors made by its own products.Google's rollout of AI Overviews summarising its search results was marred by criticism and mockery over some erratic, inaccurate responses.The tendency for generative AI products, such as chatbots, to relay misleading or false information, is a cause of concern among experts.What is AI, how does it work and why are some concerned about it?\"We know these systems make up answers, and they make up answers to please us - and that's a problem,\" Gina Neff, professor of responsible AI at Queen Mary University of London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\"It's okay if I'm asking 'what movie should I see next', it's quite different if I'm asking really sensitive questions about my health, mental wellbeing, about science, about news,\" she said.She also urged Google to take more responsibility over its AI products and their accuracy, rather than passing that on to consumers.\"The company now is asking to mark their own exam paper while they're burning down the school,\" the said.'A new phase'The tech world has been awaiting the latest launch of Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, which is starting to win back market share from ChatGPT.From May this year, Google began introducing a new \"AI Mode\" into its search, integrating its Gemini chatbot which is aimed at giving users the experience of talking to an expert.At the time, Mr Pichai said the integration of Gemini with search signalled a \"new phase of the AI platform shift\". The move is also part of the tech giant's bid to remain competitive against AI services such as ChatGPT, which have threatened Google's online search dominance.His comments back up BBC research from earlier this year, which found that AI chatbots inaccurately summarised news stories.OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini and Perplexity AI were all given content from the BBC website and asked questions about it, and the research found the AI answers contained \"significant inaccuracies\".In his interview with the BBC, Mr Pichai said there was some tension between how fast technology was being developed and how mitigations are built in to prevent potential harmful effects.For Alphabet, Mr Pichai said managing that tension means being \"bold and responsible at the same time\".\"So we are moving fast through this moment. I think our consumers are demanding it,\" he said.The tech giant has also increased its investment in AI security in proportion with its investment in AI, Mr Pichai added.\"For example, we are open-sourcing technology which will allow you to detect whether an image is generated by AI,\" he said.Asked about recently uncovered years-old comments from tech billionaire Elon Musk to OpenAI's founders around fears the now Google-owned DeepMind could create an AI \"dictatorship\", Mr Pichai said \"no one company should own a technology as powerful as AI\".But he added there were many companies in the AI ecosystem today.\"If there was only one company which was building AI technology and everyone else had to use it, I would be concerned about that too, but we are so far from that scenario right now,\" he said.",

    "body": "17 hours agoCelia HattonGetty ImagesSince 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications.But the rules weren't always so strict.In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity.\"Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'\" he remembers. \"I was astonished!\"In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership.US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned.Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.Jeff Stein's story brought a swift reaction in WashingtonIn the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret.But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: \"There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence.\"The Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA.Stein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale.Fosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment.High-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018.Very few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent.\"For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,\" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \"And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses.\"AidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China.A four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the first known effort to tally all of China's state-backed investments around the world. The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access.AidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries.Getty ImagesMore than 70% of the container shipping terminals at Rotterdam, the largest seaport in Europe, are Chinese-owned  \"China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,\" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds. That size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities.\"The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,\" Mr Shih says. \"This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis.\"Some of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025.In it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year. Beijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China.Global alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it \"stayed very much alive\" as a guiding strategy.\"There are all kinds of plans still being published,\" he says, \"including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan.\"At a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating \"high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement\" until 2030.AidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how the Chinese government bankrolled the purchase of a UK semiconductor company.The United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA.AidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy.\"At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,\" he says. \"I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen.\"However, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts.\"The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,\" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC.\"Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation.\"China's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment.In the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company.It shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech.Nexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company.That bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing.Nexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions. The company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets.Xiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past.\"We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,\" she says. \"Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this.\"Xiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China.\"There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,\" she says. \"Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe.\"If China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over?\"No! There's gonna be multiple laps,\" maintains Brad Parks. \"There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital.\"So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot. \"They're going to move from defence to offence.\"",

    "body": "We all know our phones aren't great for our relationships, but that doesn't stop us reaching for them dozens of times a day.That's how so called phubbing - unintentionally snubbing someone in favour of your phone -creeps into everyday moments.This can impact your relationship by making partners feel ignored and parental phone use can really affect children from weakening bonds with younger kids and denting self-esteem in older ones.Rather than criticising yourself about your lack of self-control, focusing on being more intentional about when we pick up our devices can be more effective, according to one psychologist.Dr Kaitlyn Regehr, Associate Professor at University College London suggests one simple way to stop you picking up your phone mindlessly when you're with someone else.Every time you reach for your phone, tell the other person why you're doing it, and when you're done, put it down and re-engage.It sounds almost too easy, but Dr Regehr tells Woman's Hour that this small shift can help change our behaviour as we often check messages, swipe notifications or \"Just quickly look something up\" without thinking.What matters is being transparent, so if a message pops up that you need to check, you should tell the person or people you are with: \"I just need to reply to this, then you'll have my attention again.\"By naming it - \"I need to check my train times\" or \"I'm replying to my mum\" - you interrupt the automatic habit of checking your phone and it also signals to the person beside you that they still matter.\"It stops the other person feeling ignored,\" Dr Regehr says.\"And it keeps you accountable, because you're less likely to drift into other apps or endless scrolling.\"Doing this could help improve your relationships too.Dr Claire Hart, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southampton, led a study which involved speaking to 196 people about their relationships and phone use. Overall the results showed that the more you feel you're being phubbed, the worse your relationship tends to be.\"Not everyone reacts in the same way,\" Dr Hart says. \"It depends on personality, but once one person feels ignored, it can trigger retaliation.\"They pick up their own phone, and that's when it becomes a dangerous spiral as each partner feels rejected or less valued than whatever's on the screen.\"Every time you are phubbed you lose connection and once you've left a shared moment to look at a screen, it can take a while to get back to what was going on before.",

    "body": "Is this the beginning of the rise of the machines?Last week saw AI triumph outright for the first time in our Premier League predictions battle, although BBC Sport's own expert human, Chris Sutton, points out he is still top of the overall league this season.This time, as well as AI, Sutton faces a different hi-tech challenger. His guest opponent for this weekend's fixtures is a computer game: Football Manager 26, the latest edition of the long-running management simulation series.The FM26 game engine has played out this weekend's matches and you can see its results, including goalscorers and red cards, below.Miles Jacobson, the studio director of Sports Interactive, the company behind Football Manager, also joined in.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, FM26Image caption, FM26 has a database of more than 750,000 players and staff, created with the help of more than 1,500 researchers around the worldFM26 is released next week and, for the first time, allows people to manage across men's and women's teams as this edition includes a women's football database featuring more than 36,000 players.There are some tactical innovations too, including the ability to pick a different formation for your team depending on whether you are in or out of possession, but the rise of set-pieces in the Premier League this season is something that has already been part of the game for a while.Jacobson told BBC Sport: \"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is using some of the things Tony Pulis used to do with set-pieces, by having a set-piece coach to come up with ideas.\"But set-piece coaches are something that have been in FM for a while, and we have regular conversations with quite a few of them about things they are looking at.\"At the moment, long throws have become fashionable again, but will it last if people start doing defensive training to deal with them?\"With the prevalence of set-piece coaches, it is something that won't necessarily negate itself over time, but clubs seeking advantages will always be looking at the past as well as the future for ways to innovate.\"That's what we're seeing this season - one of the reasons the Premier League table is all over the place at the moment is because people are looking for those marginal gains, which is something people try to do constantly inside FM too.\"Chris Sutton and Miles Jacobson were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.FM26's Premier League predictions, including goalscorers and red cardsPremier League predictionsSaturday, 1 NovemberAmex Stadium, 15:00 BSTLeeds have made a great start and I am pleased for Daniel Farke. He took a lot of stick when he was at Norwich, when I kept hearing how he wasn't a Premier League manager, but apart from their heavy defeat at leaders Arsenal, his side have been competitive in all of their games so far.I am still going with a Brighton win here, though. The Seagulls did not play well when they lost at Manchester United last weekend, then went out of the Carabao Cup at the hands of the Gunners on Wednesday, but they are unbeaten at home so far and I am expecting them to bounce back.Sutton's prediction: 2-0FM26's prediction: 1-1Miles' prediction: Leeds are doing better than expected but I'm still going for a Brighton win. 2-1AI's prediction: 2-1Turf Moor, 15:00 BSTArsenal know how to win games in so many different ways, and that puts them in an unbelievably strong position.They have got flair players, but also have this amazing record of scoring from set-pieces and are strong defensively too.We talk about machines when I go up against AI or a computer game at predictions but, let's face it, Arsenal are a machine at the moment and no-one is stopping them.There have been prettier Gunners teams than this, but they are just so effective and they don't concede.That's why we might see a fair few results where it is '1-0 to the Arsenal' - as their old song under George Graham in the 1990s used to go - but when they hit the straps there will still be games where they take teams apart.Like the other promoted teams, Burnley have been really competitive and ran Liverpool and Manchester City close earlier in the season, despite losing on both occasions.The Clarets' late win at Wolves last week was a massive result for them and it really takes the pressure off them here. You don't get many free hits in the Premier League but this is one of them - Burnley are probably not going to get anything out of this game, but it doesn't matter too much.I am expecting Scott Parker's side to be robust, keep it close, and stay in the game, which is a sign of where they are at... but Arsenal will still win - and you can probably guess what score I am going for.Sutton's prediction: 0-1FM26's prediction: 1-2Miles' prediction: Like Leeds, Burnley have done better than I thought they would, but there's a reason Arsenal are unbeaten for such a long time. 1-2AI's prediction: 0-3Selhurst Park, 15:00 BSTThese teams are next to each other in mid-table and it feels like they have both made positive starts to the season - they also both progressed in the Carabao Cup in midweek.There were a lot of doubters when Keith Andrews succeeded Thomas Frank as Brentford boss - about Andrews himself and also how the team would do without Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa - but they have coped admirably.The Bees are a very good counter-attacking team, so it is going to be fascinating to see how they get on against a Crystal Palace side who can be awesome on the break.Sutton's prediction: 1-0FM26's prediction: 0-0Miles' prediction: It's an interesting transition for Brentford to go from Frank to Andrews in his first managerial role but he is doing well. They have kept quite a few of the old backroom staff and the system they have got in place at the club is more owner-driven than most clubs. 1-1AI's prediction: 2-1Craven Cottage, 15:00 BSTThis is massive, for both teams.Wolves thumped Fulham here last season, winning 4-1 in one of Gary O'Neil's final games in charge before Vitor Pereira took over - and boy how Pereira could do with a similar result this time too.It doesn't get much worse for a manager than arguing with your own fans, which is what happened after Wolves lost to Burnley last time out, and Pereira's side are bottom without a league win this season.Fulham are on an awful run too, suffering four straight defeats. They haven't always played too badly, but you can just sense the confidence sapping out of them.Wolves' problem is they are conceding too many - currently their average is more than two goals a game - and I don't think you can stay in the Premier League doing that.Pereira shored things up when he first came in - O'Neil's Wolves conceded 40 from their 16 league games last season before Pereira took charge, then only let in 21 goals in their next 16 under him.That's what he has to do again, but it is clear they have not replaced the players they sold in the summer with the same quality, and there is no sign he will stop them leaking goals.This is the sort of game where I actually fancy both teams to lose but I am going to back Fulham to edge it at home.Sutton's prediction: 2-1FM26's prediction: 0-1Miles' prediction: Wolves actually did all right in the Carabao Cup this week despite losing 4-3 to Chelsea - I know that wasn't their full first-team but they have shown glimpses of what they can do in the past few weeks too. They would probably settle for a draw here, and so would Fulham. 2-2AI's prediction: 2-1City Ground, 15:00 BSTThe Nottingham Forest fans seem to be happy with Sean Dyche as manager and I think they will be patient with him - he has that affiliation with the club after starting his playing career there.I think they might have to wait a bit longer for his first Premier League win, though.Manchester United have picked up a bit, and Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are proving me right after I said in the summer they would prove to be great signings.They bring great variation when they play together - Mbeumo runs in behind, while Cunha comes deep looking for the ball to feet - and they both link the attack so well.Defensively, there are still problems with United, however.They have put together a three-game winning streak but they are not at the stage where I trust them to turn up every week, and I can see that run coming to an end here.Sutton's prediction: 1-1FM26's prediction: 1-2Miles' prediction: Sean Dyche will be trying to tighten things up at Forest a little bit, but United are on a roll. 0-1AI's prediction: 1-2Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 17:30 BSTThis is always a bit of a grudge game because the two sets of fans don't really like each other.Chelsea need the result more, and they also have a much better record in this fixture, but their home defeat against Sunderland was another example of how flaky they are at the moment.Tottenham have made the better start to the season, but it still feels like there is more to come from them when their injured players come back - which won't happen this week.I don't really know which way to go with my prediction, so I am going to for a draw. I feel like I am turning into AI.Sutton's prediction: 1-1FM26's prediction: 1-1Miles' prediction: Tottenham have a lot of injury problems going into this one, while Chelsea have a few disciplinary problems. I'm hoping for a good game. 2-2AI's prediction: 2-2Anfield, 20:00 BSTLiverpool boss Arne Slot made a lot of changes for Wednesday's Carabao Cup defeat by Crystal Palace but it still felt like another damaging defeat, their sixth in the past seven games.Slot's side play Real Madrid and Manchester City after this, and they desperately need to end this slump in form before it gets any worse.He rested players against Palace for this weekend, so he knows how important it is, but on current form, Aston Villa are favourites - they have won their past four league games and are on a roll.Looking at both teams over the past few weeks you would expect Villa to get something here, but I need to use all my knowledge to get the better of AI.So, with this game I am going to base my prediction on something that I thought about when I was a player - history.Villa have taken only one point from their past seven visits to Anfield, and have won only one of their past 15 league games against Liverpool - although that was a 7-2 success in October 2020.I had my bogey teams - most of them felt like that by the end to be honest - and I don't think AI will understand that part of the game (Sutton does not know anyone else's predictions when he makes his).So, I am going with Liverpool to win, with Mohamed Salah getting a hat-trick.Sutton's prediction: 3-1FM26's prediction: 3-1Miles' prediction: In-form Villa versus out-of-form Liverpool... but they have to come back into form at some point. I just want a goal from Florian Wirtz because I've got him in my Fantasy Premier League team. 2-1AI's prediction: 1-2Sunday, 2 NovemberLondon Stadium, 14:00 BSTNewcastle marched on in the Carabao Cup in midweek and, after winning it last season and ending their long wait for silverware, I am starting to think about whether Eddie Howe can get his hands on another trophy.West Ham, in contrast, are in deep trouble. Nuno Espirito Santo had a free week to work on things on the training ground but whoever he picks, it doesn't seem to make much difference.The Hammers concede a lot of goals from set-plays and I feel as if Newcastle are going to just be too strong for them in every area.Sutton's prediction: 0-2FM26's prediction: 2-1Miles' prediction: I feel like both teams should be doing better in the Premier League, but especially West Ham. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-2Etihad Stadium, 16:30 BSTI mentioned history earlier, and Manchester City have won all eight of their home Premier League games against Bournemouth since 2015, scoring 31 goals and conceding five, but I still don't think anyone will be overly confident they will beat the Cherries this time.City are so reliant on their big number nine and their big goalkeeper this season, and that has to change. They need other players to step up.It also feels like a mistake for Pep Guardiola to ignore the rise in the importance in set-pieces - City are the only Premier League team not to score from one this season. He says he wants to focus on creating more chances in open play but it is proven that corners and throw-ins work, so my advice to Pep is that maybe it is time for him to get some big players in, and launch it!I am tempted to go for Bournemouth to get at least a draw here because they will cut through City and get some chances, but instead I am going to be brave and back Erling Haaland and City, mainly because they are at home but also because they have Gianluigi Donnarumma in goal.Bournemouth will score but City will win. I have got Cherries keeper Djordje Petrovic in my Fantasy team at the moment, so I need to move him out.Sutton's prediction: 3-1FM26's prediction: 3-2Miles' prediction: Bournemouth are absolutely flying and have all the confidence in the world. If you look at their bench, they have got some incredible players that aren't getting to start at the moment. It's a really interesting journey they are on at the moment, and we will have to wait to see if they can keep it up. Given their form, and City's, I am going for an exciting draw. 2-2AI's prediction: 3-0Monday, 3 NovemberStadium of Light, 20:00 BSTI am torn here. I am always wrong about Sunderland and I know that means I have got a large fanbase on Wearside.Because of that, I don't want to jinx the Black Cats by saying they will win... but it is also hard to make a case for Everton getting anything.My 606 co-host Roman Kemp said their Hill-Dickinson Stadium will be a fortress for them this season, but Tottenham didn't have too much trouble there last Sunday with a 3-0 win.David Moyes' side really need to respond after that defeat but what he needs more than anything as he goes back to one of his former clubs is a finisher.Beto misses so many chances, but I am backing him to put his boots on the right feet this week and score to grab his side a point.Sutton's prediction: 1-1FM26's prediction: 0-4Miles' prediction: Everton have lost their last two games and Sunderland are looking strong at home, but Oliver and Paul Collyer, who are the founders of Sports Interactive, are massive Everton fans and I would not live it down if I went for a Sunderland win. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-1How did Sutton do last week?Chris got four correct results, including one exact score, from the 10 games played in week nine, giving him 70 points.That was enough for him to beat his guest, The Charlatans guitarist Mark Collins, who got three correct results with one exact score, for a tally of 60 points.The BBC readers did better, with five correct results, including three exact scores, leaving them on 140 points, and they took the contest to the final game of the weekend - Tottenham's 3-0 win at Everton.AI was the only predictor to back Spurs, going for a 1-0 away victory, which meant it ended up with six correct results and three exact scores, and a winning total of 150 points.\"I'm still top of the league and that's what counts,\" said Sutton. \"The machines are not taking over yet.\"Weekly wins, ties and total points after week nineWinsTiesPointsChris30630Guests21585You20780AI11670Source: Guest leaderboard 2025-26PointsJames Skelly190James Walsh110Addison from JJFC100You *87Rod Jones80AI *74Kid Wild& Chris Sutton *70Mark Collins& Tommy Longhurst60Blanco, Orlando Bloom,Theo Ellis & Tom Grennan50Aya from JJC30Katherine Parlour10* Average after nine weeksSource: BBC",

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterThe prime minister has said Chancellor Rachel Reeves will face no further action over the failure to obtain the correct licence when renting out her family home.However, Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"regrettable\" Reeves did not share all the relevant emails when she first told him about the issue on Wednesday evening.The chancellor initially said she was not aware a licence was needed but later found correspondence between her husband and the letting agent showing he was told one was required but the agency would apply on their behalf.The letting agent has said an \"oversight\" meant it had never ultimately applied for the licence.Reeves has apologised for the \"inadvertent mistake\" but said she accepted full responsibility.Conservative Party chairman Kevin Hollinrake called for a full investigation, saying the chancellor's story \"keeps on changing\".\"On Wednesday, the independent adviser on ministerial standards said he was simply willing to take Rachel Reeves's word and the case was closed,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\"The next day some more evidence came to light, which meant Rachel Reeves's story on Wednesday was a false narrative of the event.\"Reeves put her four-bedroom south London home up for rent in July 2024, when Labour won the general election and she moved into 11 Downing Street.The house falls in an area where Southwark Council requires private landlords to obtain a selective licence at a cost of £945. Reeves or her letting agent could face an unlimited fine if the council takes the matter to court.Southwark Council has refused to comment on Reeves's case but said it only takes enforcement action against landlords who do not apply for a licence within 21 days of receiving a warning or where a property is found to be in an unsafe condition.Reeves says she has now applied for a licence.The chancellor said she first became aware that her property did not have the correct licence on Wednesday when the Daily Mail, who first reported the story, contacted her.After consulting his ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus, who decided against launching an investigation, Sir Keir accepted Reeves's apology and said he was happy the \"matter can be drawn to a close\".However, the release of the emails between her husband and the letting agent on Thursday reopened the row.After reviewing the emails, Sir Laurie said he still believed Reeves made an \"unfortunate but inadvertent error\".While he did not rule on whether the ministerial code had been broken, he said he found \"no evidence of bad faith\".In a letter to Reeves on Thursday evening, Sir Keir said he agreed with his ethics adviser and saw \"no need for any further action\".He accepted the emails from the estate agent were only found by her husband on Thursday morning and Reeves was \"acting in good faith\".However, he added: \"It would clearly have been better if you and your husband had conducted a full trawl through all email correspondence with the estate agency before writing to me yesterday.\"Defending his colleague, Trade Minister Chris Bryant said he did not think the fault lay with Reeves and she would be \"entitled to feel a bit grumpy\" about the situation.\"She realised that her husband had actually had some emails, some correspondence with the estate agent - and the estate agent had said categorically in terms we will sort out this licence for you and then subsequently it didn't happen,\" he told the BBC.The revelations come at a politically awkward time for Reeves, who is preparing for a Budget at the end of the month amidst speculation the government is planning to break a manifesto commitment not to raise income tax.In a statement, Gareth Martin, owner of Harvey & Wheeler, the estate agent which rented out the property on behalf of Reeves, said: \"In an effort to be helpful our previous property manager offered to apply for a licence on these clients' behalf, as shown in the correspondence. That property manager suddenly resigned on the Friday before the tenancy began on the following Monday.\"Unfortunately, the lack of application was not picked up by us as we do not normally apply for licences on behalf of our clients; the onus is on them to apply. We have apologised to the owners for this oversight.\"At the time the tenancy began, all the relevant certificates were in place and if the licence had been applied for, we have no doubt it would have been granted.\"Our clients would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for.\"",

Members of Al-Shamie's family attended the hearing via videolink as the inquest was opened and adjourned at Manchester Coroner's Court earlier.The court heard Al-Shamie was identified at the scene by fingerprints and \"secondary evidence\" at the scene, including his mobile phone and car.Inquests into the two victims, which opened on Wednesday, heard Mr Cravitz was stabbed while Mr Daulby died from a gunshot wound to the chest fired by police.Melvin Cravitz (left) and Adrian Daulby (right) were killedAl-Shamie, a Syrian-born UK citizen, began his rampage by driving his Kia Picanto at security staff and the external gates of the synagogue as worshippers were gathering for Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year for Jews.CCTV footage from the scene showed Al-Shamie driving his car into the gates and external wall of the synagogue at 09:30 BST, striking a security guard, before attacking worshippers and security guards with a knife.He then tried to storm the synagogue, wearing a fake suicide belt, before being shot dead.Det Ch Supt Lewis Hughes told the hearing that armed officers responding to the call \"discharged several rounds\" at Al-Shamie as \"he ran towards them aggressively while carrying a knife and wearing what clearly presented as a suicide belt\".He added: \"Al-Shamie sustained multiple bullet wounds and collapsed to the ground.\"Al-Shamie wasn't pronounced dead until 16:38 BST because of concerns about the belt on his body, the inquest heard.EPAPrince Charles visited the synagogue to pay tribute to the victims last weekDet Ch Supt Hughes continued: \"Three other victims were very seriously injured, which consisted of a security guard struck by the vehicle, a worshipper completing security duties, outside, who was stabbed, and another worshipper, inside, who also sustained a gunshot injury.\"Whilst all received very serious injuries requiring extensive medical treatment, all are recovering and it is not anticipated that there will be any further loss of life arising from this incident.\"The hearing was also attended by representatives from Greater Manchester Police, the government's legal department, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, the Independent Office for Police Conduct and Counter Terrorism Policing North West.Judge Alexia Durran, chief coroner of England and Wales, released Al Shamie's body to his family for burial.She said it was \"not the day to test or ask questions of [Det Ch Supt Hughes] about his evidence\". \"There will be time at the inquest hearing to do so,\" she said. Judge Durran adjourned the inquest until February 19, when a pre-inquest review will be held.More on this story",

It is also understood that he did not object to the King's decision to remove his titles.His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew.Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation. These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoKaty Austin,Transport correspondent  and Emer Moreau,Business reporterGetty ImagesThe number of bus journeys taken in England has dropped in recent yearsA proposed plan to trial free bus passes for under-22s in England will not go ahead as it is \"unaffordable\" at the moment, the government has said.The trial was one of a number of recommendations put forward by the Transport Committee, a cross-party group of backbench MPs, in a report this August - with the suggestion it would boost access to jobs and education. In its response, published on Friday, the government said no money was available for such a scheme during the current spending review period, which runs until 2028/2029. Responding to the government's decision, committee chair Ruth Cadbury accused the Department for Transport of \"lacking in ambition\".\"Throughout our inquiry we heard about the consequences of poor connectivity,\" Labour MP Cadbury said. \"Young people unable to get their first jobs or taking exhausting journeys to reach school or college. Older and disabled people feeling isolated and depressed, and high streets starved of customers.\"\"It is hard to shake the feeling that an opportunity may be missed, particularly to improve services in rural and underserved communities.\"  The announcement of the government's plans on under-22 bus travel comes in the week when the Bus Services Act has become law. Welcomed by the committee, it will place tougher requirements on operators that wish to cancel certain services and give local authorities more control, including through franchising. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the new law would make it \"easier for local leaders to take control of their buses\" and was \"putting passengers first\". Cadbury said while the new law is \"positive and necessary\" it cannot be \"the last word\". Of the other recommendations put forward by the committee, some were received positively. These included a suggestion that funding should be laid out over a longer period, and should be weighted to take account of rural needs. However, along with free travel for under-22s, other points of action were rejected - including a call for minimum service levels for buses. The government argued that \"significant differences in demographics, need and geography\" would make minimum levels of service \"very challenging to implement at a national level, whilst also ensuring value for money\".The number of bus journeys taken in England has dropped in recent years, while fares have risen faster than inflation.The committee found that this was a barrier to opportunity and growth in some areas.'It would have been so beneficial'Gracie MooreGracie Moore spends £120 a month on bus faresGracie Moore is 22 and lives in Slough. She spends £120 a month to get the bus to and from work every day.Gracie said the government's decision was \"disappointing\".\"It would have been so beneficial, considering that under 22s are so negatively impacted by inflation,\" she said. \"Things like buying our first house or affording bills are already difficult, so this would have taken the pressure off for us.\"Gracie previously lived in Madrid, where she enjoyed unlimited travel on bus, train, tube, and tram for only €8 (£6.90) a month with a young person's travel card.The UK, she said, \"seem[s] to be one of the only countries who cannot effectively subsidise travel costs\".Bus passengers spend £39.1bn in local businesses every year, according to research from KPMG.But experts told the Transport Committee that the bus sector's contribution to the economy declined by around £8.9bn between 2011 and 2023.The committee's report said: \"The current deregulated nature of the bus sector can encourage commercial operators to \"deprioritise\" less profitable routes, often leaving vulnerable communities without a service.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterIf you moved house in the last five years, you could have unclaimed money sitting in your old gas and electricity accounts.Around £240m is sitting in closed energy accounts which can be returned to customers, according to the regulator Ofgem and suppliers.Energy suppliers are obliged to return credit to customers, but if their contact details are out of date, this can be difficult.Most people may only be owed a few pounds, but some could claim back more than £100.Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said people should check letters and emails and contact their old suppliers if they think they have outstanding credit.The majority of closed account balances are returned automatically, Energy UK said. But sometimes it is hard to contact a person after they move house and close their account, so customers are being encouraged to check for themselves.Tim Jarvis, director general for retail at Ofgem, said: \"Moving house requires a lot of life admin – and it's understandable that some things will be missed. \"But with almost two million closed accounts currently in credit, the message is clear – if you've moved in the last five years, reach out to your old supplier, provide them with the correct information, and you could be due a refund.\"The advice from Energy UK is to keep your direct debit active until the final bill has been settled. Any leftover credit should automatically be paid to customers.Under Ofgem rules, suppliers must issue a final bill within six weeks and issue a refund within 10 working days after that, but Ofgem said missing customer details were causing delays.Earlier this week Ofgem announced plans to clear some of the record levels of debt that customers owe to suppliers.Energy debt and arrears in England, Wales and Scotland rose by £750m in a year to £4.4bn.But the proposed plan to clear this debt would involve higher bills for everyone else, a solution that has been criticised.Most households already typically pay £52 a year to deal with historic debt.The chair of the government's Energy Security and Net Zero Select Committee said \"parts of the sector that are making healthy profits\" should contribute towards the debt.",

    "body": "11 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe government has been urged to get a grip on long A&E waits with campaigners saying it is the rot eating away at the heart of the NHS.The plea by Age UK comes as it publishes a report detailing \"heartbreaking\" stories of how older people are suffering, spending hours in corridors and side-rooms.It highlights cases of people being left in their own excrement, having blood transfusions and even dying in these make-shift treatment areas.And it said older people were much more likely to experience long waits, with data showing one in three over 90s attending A&E in England last year faced a 12-hour wait or more.The government said the situation was unacceptable, but added it was taking action.The Age UK report said while 12-hour waits were once virtually unheard of, they had now become the norm in too many places.It highlighted the case of an 86-year-old who was left in a disused corridor for 36 hours.Another man, who had soiled himself, was left in his own excrement for 20 hours, while others suffered the indignity of having to use bedpans in corridors.Susan, 79, from south London, is one of those who has experienced a long wait, according to the Age UK report.She said it took 22 hours for a bed to be found for her after she arrived at hospital having had a heart attack.She spent a large part of her wait on a couch in a curtained-off area near A&E where there was no privacy. She believes she heard two people dying on couches nearby.Regarding one of the deaths, she said: \"I was next to a man who was clearly unwell. He was alone for some time, then his wife was brought in. They whispered as they had little privacy. Then, after a long silence, she was led away, crying. I'm certain he died. And he died right next to me.\"The report pointed to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from NHS England which showed there were more than 1.7 million 12-hour waits in 2024-25 at major hospitals – around one in 10 of those who attended A&Es.Two thirds of them were experienced by people aged over 60.The report said as well as being horrible, long waits were risky.Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said it was a \"crisis hiding in plain sight\" and that the government should take immediate action.\"No-one should have to spend their final days in a hospital corridor where it's impossible for staff to provide good, compassionate care.\"As we head into winter, we fear that an already difficult situation will get worse.\"Long waits are like a rot eating away at the heart of the NHS, undermining public trust.\"Age UK said a major cause of the problem was the lack of available support in the community, which meant hospitals could not discharge patients who are medically-fit to leave wards. That results in a shortage of beds available for new patients.It called for a renewed effort and drive to tackle this.RCN general secretary Prof Nicola Ranger said the problems were a \"moral stain\" on the health service.\"No elderly or vulnerable person should be forced to endure these conditions. \"Overstretched and understaffed nursing teams work hard every day to deliver the best care, but they face an impossible task.\"Health minister Karin Smyth said: \"No one should receive care in a corridor - it's unacceptable, undignified and we are determined to end it.\"She said the government was investing more money in the NHS and detailed data on corridor care would soon be published to hold the system to account.\"To tackle a problem you've got to be honest about it,\" she added.",

    "body": "US space agency Nasa has rejected reality star Kim Kardashian's claim that the 1969 space mission to land the first man on the Moon was faked.\"Yes, we've been to the Moon before... 6 times!\" Nasa acting administrator Sean Duffy wrote on social media.Kardashian made the comments on the latest episode of her long-running TV series The Kardashians, telling co-star Sarah Paulson she thought the Moon landing \"didn't happen\".Despite being consistently debunked, conspiracy theories as to whether humans actually reached the Moon have persisted for more than 50 years, particularly with the rise of social media. In the episode, Kardashian can be seen showing Paulson an interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who along with Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission.\"I'm sending you a million articles with both Buzz Aldrin and the other one,\" Kardashian says, before reading a quote allegedly from Aldrin responding to a question about the scariest moment of the expedition.\"There was no scary moment because it didn't happen. It could've been scary, but it wasn't because it didn't happen,\" she reads.It is unclear which article Kardashian was reading from, or if the quotes were actually from Aldrin.Moments later, the reality star is seen telling a producer \"I centre conspiracies all the time\", adding that she believes the Moon landing was fake.\"I think it was fake. I've seen a few videos on Buzz Aldrin talking about how it didn't happen. He says it all the time now, in interviews. Maybe we should find Buzz Aldrin,\" she says.Following the broadcast, Duffy tagged Kardashian in a post on X, rebuffing her comments, and promoted Nasa's current moon exploration program Artemis, which is \"going back under the leadership\" of Donald Trump.\"We won the last space race and we will win this one too,\" he added.In response, Kardashian wrote back asking about the interstellar object named 3I/Atlas, which astronomers said could be the oldest comet ever seen.\"Wait…. what's the tea on 3I Atlas?!?!!!!!!!?????\" she replied.Duffy later invited Kardashian to the Kennedy Space Center for the launch of the Artemis mission to the moon.For  decades, scientists and experts have rebutted conspiracy theories claiming the Apollo 11 mission was a hoax.\"Every single argument claiming that Nasa faked the Moon landings has been discredited,\" according to the Institute of Physics.",

    "body": "The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew of sexual abuse,  have celebrated his title of 'prince' being stripped from him as a victory which is \"unprecedented in history\".\"This normal girl from a normal family has taken down a prince. We are so proud of her,\" Sky Roberts, Giuffre's brother, told BBC Newsnight through tears.But Mr Roberts told the BBC removing his title was \"not enough\" and called for an investigation into Andrew, adding that he \"needs to be behind bars\". Andrew has denied all claims against him.Giuffre took her own life earlier this year. The publication of her posthumous memoirs this month intensified pressure on the Royal Family over Andrew's friendship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.Follow live updates on this storyBuckingham Palace announced on Thursday that King Charles III had initiated a formal process to \"remove the style, titles and honours\" of Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.Asked how Giuffre might have responded to that decision, her brother said: \"She is celebrating from the heavens now saying 'I did it'.\"\"She'd be so proud. He's just Andrew.\"In her memoir, Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein - alleged Andrew had sex with her three times as a teenager and that he \"believed that having sex with me was his birthright.\" Andrew, who has denied the allegations, reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology.\"It truly is a moment for her and all survivors,\" Giuffre's sister-in-law Amanda Roberts said.\"Everything she fought for was not in vain,\" she added, noting that she \"broke down\" when she heard the news at work.While the pair celebrated what they described as a moment of \"victory\", Giuffre's brother also stressed it was \"not enough\".\"We have to have some sort of investigation that goes further into this,\" he said.\"[Andrew is] still walking around a free man. He needs to be behind bars.\"Earlier this month, Andrew voluntarily gave up several royal titles including the Duke of York, saying \"we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family.\"The King's decision to strip Andrew of his title of 'prince' follows the emergence this month of emails from 2011 that showed Andrew had maintained contact with Epstein, despite claiming otherwise.Giuffre's family also addressed the implications of the King's decision for the US, where calls have grown for the release of documents related to Epstein. Partial records have been released that named Andrew as a passenger on a flight with Epstein.\"The US government hold the key to the larger scope of the Jeffrey Epstein case,\" Mr Roberts said.\"The UK is setting an example for what the US should be doing right now.\" \"There's many more of them, I promise you.\"",

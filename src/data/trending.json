    "body": "Murder and MI5: How an extraordinary battle erupted over what the state keeps secret49 minutes agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent BBCPaul Thompson was shot dead while being driven home in a taxi through Belfast in April 1994. He was murdered in a sectarian attack by loyalist paramilitaries who had set out to kill Catholics.The taxi driver was a friend who was collecting a fare at another address in the Springfield Park area in the west of the city. But no one at the address had rung the taxi firm. The call is suspected to have been a deliberate decoy by the killers who wanted to lure a taxi as prey. Paul was not specifically targeted. They could not have known he would ask for a lift or be in the area.One resident described hearing a heavy burst of gunfire after 23:00, running to the car and finding Paul.Members of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for the killing. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the group repeatedly murdered Catholic civilians like Paul.Family Handout/PA WireMembers of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for killing Paul, who was nicknamed TopperOn the morning of the day that Paul was killed, locals had told police about a hole in a barrier – known as the 'Peace Line' – which separated the largely Catholic Springfield Park area from a largely Protestant neighbouring area. The residents were concerned the breach could give loyalist paramilitaries access to launch an attack.The hole was not fixed. After the murder, those responsible escaped through it.An inquest into Paul's death was opened in 1995 but never concluded. No-one has ever been held to account. There has never been a full investigation.Left by themselves to fight for answers, his mother Margaret and brother Eugene, both now dead, came to suspect collusion between British security forces and informants – meaning state agents - in the group responsible.In 2024, a coroner decided to release to the family a summary of secret information held by the police. This was said by the coroner to be of central relevance to the case and the police supported the move. But the British government and MI5 argued this would prejudice national security and mounted a legal challenge.PA MediaPaul Thompson was killed by the UDA, which used the cover name of the Ulster Freedom FightersThe case, which centred on who had the power to decide to release the information, reached the Supreme Court last summer, with Paul Thompson's brother, Eugene, tuning in to hearings from a hospice, as he neared death from cancer.The case is widely viewed as a major test of the state's policy of neither conforming nor denying (NCND) information involving national security.Who decides what is secret?The NCND policy is a position adopted by the government and security services when responding to questions about sensitive matters. It means there will be no confirmation, no denial, and no acknowledgement that the information requested is true, false, or even exists.Eugene Thompson's barrister, Monye Anyadike-Danes KC, said the family had concluded the murder happened because the authorities were colluding with the \"very group that actually perpetrated the killing\". She said Eugene was \"trying to find out why his younger brother was murdered\" and felt a \"deep responsibility\".PA MediaEugene Thompson, who has since died, spent years trying to find out the truth about his brother's deathEugene, she added, believed the public should be able to trust that those who kill will be held accountable, especially when they are agents of the state. She asked the judges not to let the NCND policy be used to \"conceal the involvement of state parties in the killing of an ordinary citizen\".Just before Christmas, the court ruled that the government's assessment of damage to national security \"should have been accepted by the coroner\" unless it was plainly irrational or there was no supporting evidence.The justices found the coroner had failed to understand it was \"solely\" for the government to make submissions on national security, not the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Jon Boutcher, who had argued for the release of the summary of police files.PA WireJon Boutcher argued for the release of the summary of police filesPaul Thompson's case is part of a battle over the truth and whether it can be told. The battle concerns official secrets, often connected to state agents, and it pits bereaved families and senior police officers against the government and the security service, MI5.It raises a profound question: can the state, especially when it is implicated in killing, be trusted as the arbiter of what should remain secret?The spycatcher who was himself a spyOther cases in the coming months will force these issues further into the spotlight – and they come at a time when MI5's integrity is under significant scrutiny.Yet the Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case creates a precedent that says the government and MI5 can withhold information from bereaved families, for national security reasons, even when the police want it to be disclosed.Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, described it as a \"grim day for truth\" and part of a pattern of \"national security being used as a shield to cover up and conceal the state's role in very serious crimes such as murder and other serious human rights violations.\"The government, by contrast, welcomed the court's \"unanimous judgment\".\"This is a highly complex case with wide-ranging implications,\" it said. \"The government will therefore take time to fully consider all aspects of this judgment.\"The Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case has created a precedentDuring the Troubles, the state made widespread use of informants, otherwise known as agents, who were tasked with carrying out actions and often paid. Agents existed in the IRA and in loyalist paramilitary groups. They were run by the police, the army, and MI5.The former Met Police chief Lord Stevens, who led UK government-commissioned investigations into collusion in Northern Ireland between the 1980s and 2000s, once said that of 210 people arrested during his enquiries, only three were not state agents.Collusion occurred in a number of ways, he said, ranging from the state withholding intelligence and evidence from investigators, to state agents being involved in murder. In some cases agents told the authorities in advance about planned attacks but nothing was done to stop them.One of the most notorious agents was codenamed Stakeknife. It has been publicly known for more than 20 years that Stakeknife was a man called Freddie Scappaticci. He died under MI5 protection in 2023 having never been charged with any of the many murders and other crimes to which he is linked.Pacemaker Press/ PAFreddie Scappaticci, or Stakeknife, died under MI5 protection in 2023Scappaticci was a senior figure in the IRA's internal security unit, which was tasked by IRA leaders with identifying and killing British agents in the organisation. But, with the spycatcher himself a spy, the result was one British agent killing other agents, or people accused of being agents, and the state repeatedly not intervening to save them.Intelligence agencies and historic wrongdoingA long-running police investigation into Stakeknife, Operation Kenova, was forbidden from officially naming Scappaticci in its final report, published in December, despite the fact that his identity was widely known.The head of the Kenova team, Sir Iain Livingstone, pleaded with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn for the right to name Scappaticci in his report, but Benn said he would decide after the Supreme Court ruling in the Paul Thompson case, which came later in December.That ruling has, in effect, strengthened Benn's power to stop him being named. If permission is granted, a revised version of the Kenova report can be published.Jon Boutcher, who was Livingstone's predecessor leading the Kenova investigation, has described the situation preventing Scappaticci being named as a \"pantomime\". It leads to the truth being \"suppressed,\" he argues, with \"profound and severe adverse impacts on victims and families, legitimate public discussion and debate, media freedom, open justice and public confidence in state agencies and the criminal justice system\".PA WireThe integrity of MI5, which is currently led by Sir Ken McCallum, is under scrutinyBoutcher, the PSNI chief constable, is involved in a significant and extraordinary stand-off with the government and MI5 over NCND.He has called for reform of the policy, a principle he fully supports but believes is being wrongly applied and has become a dogma that can be used to conceal wrongdoing.He has recommended the policy is reviewed to ensure it is applied proportionately and only where genuinely necessary for the protection of life or national security. The government has not yet responded to the call for a review of the policy.Boutcher has directly asked whether NCND's continued application on Stakeknife amounts to it being used as a tool for covering up things that should never have happened.\"I question whether this decision protects agents, or rather does it actually protect the government and intelligence agencies from accountability for historical wrongdoing.\"More from InDepthIn the Paul Thompson case he argued that he, as chief constable, rather than the government, had the right to allow the coroner to release a summary of police files. The high court and court of appeal backed his position before it was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.During the hearings, government barrister Sir James Eadie KC said Boutcher was being \"thoroughly disingenuous\" and that \"politics is being played with national security\". He argued the government is best placed to make assessments on national security, as only it has access to the full range of necessary advice. The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5.The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material.For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is \"unprecedented\" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s.\"If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool,\" he says.Trust, state secrecy and the publicBoutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed?He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case.Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day.In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife.But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife. Scappaticci was engaged in a pretence to help shore up his reputation: publicly fighting a legal case, while hoping – and expecting – he would lose.VCG via Getty ImagesMany families of those killed or injured in the Troubles are still fighting through the courtsHowever, the government feared Scappaticci would win because a judge would assume he was not Stakeknife and force ministers to be honest.Jon Boutcher has now confirmed an extraordinary fact: the judge who heard the case did so after being secretly briefed on the real identity of Stakeknife.That judge, the then Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord Carswell, ultimately allowed the government to maintain NCND, creating the legal precedent on the policy.\"The full facts about this and the government's explanation will never be known while it is able to hide behind the shield of NCND,\" Boutcher has said.There is a second extraordinary fact: the government barrister who did the secret briefing was Philip Sales, who as Lord Sales was one of the Supreme Court justices in the Paul Thompson case. This fact was uncovered by the journalist John Ware.This is an issue because it is Lord Sales' ruling in the Thompson case which has a central bearing over whether Scappaticci can be named and more details revealed about what went on, including Lord Sales' own role.I asked the Supreme Court whether, given Lord Sales' role in the Scappaticci matter, if it was appropriate for him to have heard the Thompson case.In a statement, the court said: \"Great care is taken in the selection of the panels which will hear a case at the UK Supreme Court.\"A Justice will not deal with a case where it is considered there is a conflict of interest and individual Justices are careful to ensure that they have none.\"The cases of Seamus Dillon and Sean BrownTwo further cases that touch on the potential release of information about the role of the state during the Troubles are also before the Supreme Court.Troubles-related inquests were shut down in 2024 with the passing of the Legacy Act, which created a new body called the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to examine relevant cases, including those being investigated by police.The families of four men who were either killed or injured during the Troubles won a further legal victory, when the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled the government has too much veto power over the disclosure of material by the ICRIR.Lady Chief Justice Siobhan Keegan said that the provision in the Act giving the Northern Ireland secretary \"the final say\" on disclosure of sensitive national security information by the ICRIR would risk undermining public confidence in the body.The UK government's appeal will be ruled on by the Supreme Court in the coming months. The lead respondent in the case is Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was killed in 1997.PA WireMartina Dillon's husband Seamus was killed in 1997 by the paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)The paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) claimed responsibility. A coroner had opened an inquest on the basis there was evidence of collusion by state authorities, but the inquest was halted by the Legacy Act. No-one has ever been held accountable.The government has also registered an appeal in another key case.Sean Brown was also murdered in 1997 by members of the LVF. The 61-year-old father-of-six was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports club in County Londonderry. There were investigative failures by police and no-one has been brought to justice.PA MediaSean Brown, a father of six, was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports clubDecades later, a coroner issued a summary of secret material stating that \"a number of the individuals linked through intelligence to the murder were agents of the state.\" Sean's family want a public inquiry, and have won judgments over the past two years at the High Court and Court of Appeal. The government, which was found to have acted unlawfully by refusing a public inquiry, has registered an appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the issue has constitutional significance regarding who should order inquiries.'The state viewed itself as above the law'At its heart, this vast battle over secrecy centres on two core claims by the state: that only the government and MI5 can ultimately be fully trusted on national security, and that their decisions on what information to release are solely about protecting the public.But these claims have been undermined by MI5's actions and omissions in several recent cases, all during the leadership of MI5's current director general, Sir Ken McCallum.A public inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which killed 22 people, concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held about the suicide bomber who carried out the attack. The inquiry chairman only uncovered what MI5 had done through his own persistent investigations during secret evidence sessions.The government has been resisting calls by families bereaved by the Manchester Arena attack for MI5 officers to be fully included in planned new legislation - known as the Hillsborough Law - that's designed to stop cover-ups and enforce truth-telling by public officials.Getty ImagesA public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of key intelligence it heldAnother ongoing case is an example of how MI5's evidence cannot always be taken at face value: MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about having maintained its NCND secrecy policy in relation to an abusive neo-Nazi agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete. But MI5 had in fact told me the man was an agent when attempting to prevent me from investigating him. After MI5 apologised, we then showed that inquiries into what happened by MI5 and the government were deficient and unreliable, with further falsehoods provided to the court. This prompted the most senior judge in England and Wales to dismiss MI5's explanations and led the prime minister to order a new investigation, which will report this year.In the Stakeknife investigation, MI5 disclosed key documents years after enquiries began, aer Scappaticci had died and charging decisions had been made, and at a point when the Legacy Act banned police from investigating further. The new material revealed MI5 had greater and earlier knowledge of Stakeknife than detectives had previously been told, including that MI5 had been involved in tasking him. The lead detective said it was a \"significant failure on the part of MI5\". A review commissioned by MI5 found no deliberate wrongdoing.Cover-ups and failures to disclose information have a long history in Northern Ireland. Lord Stevens, recalling his investigations, has said: \"I was misled deliberately, I was criminally obstructed from doing my job by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and military, whilst MI5 failed to disclose information.\"Judge Pomerance, who was senior counsel on another major investigation, concluded bluntly: \"The state viewed itself as above the law\".The battle of bereaved familiesLast July, days before Eugene Thompson died, Jon Boutcher delivered a letter of apology on behalf of PSNI. He apologised for the police's failure to take action that may have prevented Paul Thompson's murder, and for failures in the investigation, including not properly pursuing suspects.Mark Thompson from Relatives for Justice (no relation of Paul and Eugene Thompson) says the apology was \"important\" but that Eugene was by this stage \"very ill\".Thompson familyJust before he died, Eugene Thompson (right) received an apology for police failings over the murder of his brother Paul (left). Their mother Margaret is also picturedMark had watched the Supreme Court hearings with Eugene on a laptop in his hospice and describes the experience as \"tough\". Eugene was \"praying and hoping that before he died the judgment could be made\", Mark says.Bereaved families caught up in these cases have had to battle for decades, trying to fill voids left by the lack of proper investigations by the state.\"You became an investigator, tracking down witnesses. You became an expert in the law in that field. And you fought your own case tooth and nail.\"Eugene Thompson became an \"accidental lawyer and expert in his own case\", he says, as he campaigned for answers about why his brother Paul was murdered.\"I think if we take anything from the legacy of him, it's the example of never giving up.\"Email: security.investigations@bbc.co.ukSignal: @investigation.56Click here to learn how to use SecureDrop, an anonymous whistleblowing tool that works only in the Tor browser and follow the advice to stay secure.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge1 day agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"Back in Columbia University, those years ago, the student from Pakistan had asked me a question. \"Don't you find it interesting,\" he said, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Make sure pupils don't ever use phones at school, Phillipson tells teachers1 hour agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterPA MediaAll schools in England should follow new government guidance and be phone-free for the entire school day, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said.In a letter to schools seen exclusively by the BBC, she said it was \"not appropriate for phones to be used as calculators, or for research during lessons\", as well as during break times and lunchtime.Ofsted will be inspecting schools on the implementation of their mobile phone policies going forward, she confirmed, with teachers also being advised not to use their phones in front of pupils.One head teachers' union said using Ofsted to \"police\" schools' mobile phone policies was \"deeply unhelpful and misguided\".Schools were first given guidance on phones by the previous Conservative government in February 2024, but Phillipson said in her letter that it \"did not deliver the clarity or consistency that schools need\".She said the government had therefore \"strengthened\" the guidance issued last week, to make it \"explicit\" that pupils should not be using their phones at school.Phillipson's letter to schools comes just under a week after the announcement that the government would be launching a three-month consultation on banning social media for all under-16s in the UK.The education secretary has encouraged teachers to \"contribute your professional insight\".Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservatives, has already said her party would introduce such a ban if it was in power.Last week's announcement also included tougher guidance for schools from Ofsted, including telling staff not to use their devices for personal reasons in front of pupils.Recent research by the survey tool Teacher Tapp suggested 86% of primary school teachers said they were able to use their phones at school for personal use, but only during breaks, while 44% of secondary school teachers said they were allowed to use their phones freely.Only 2% of both primary and secondary teachers surveyed said their schools banned staff from using phones entirely during the school day.Teaching unions have generally welcomed the social media consultation, but pushed back on the suggestion of Ofsted monitoring schools' mobile phone policies.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said school leaders \"need support from government, not the threat of heavy-handed inspection\".The Association of School and College Leaders also said the government had been \"sluggish\" in responding to the online risks posed to children.Although the government consultation on social media concerns the whole of the UK, its guidance for schools on phones only includes England, as education is a devolved policy area.The Senedd said last year that phones should not be banned \"outright\" from schools in Wales, but that schools themselves should be supported to set and implement their own policies.In Northern Ireland, Education Minister Paul Givan previously advised schools to restrict pupils in their use of mobile phones, and has recently supported a campaign encouraging parents not to buy their children smartphones until they reach 14 years old.And in Scotland, schools have been given government guidance on setting their own rules, such as pupils having to hand in phones before lessons, or not being allowed to use them on school trips.",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorPA MediaSir Keir Starmer voted against allowing Andy Burnham being allowed to run as an MP The other day I compared the saga of Andy Burnham, his ambitions and the forthcoming by-election in Greater Manchester to a long and twisting marble run.If, and it was a big if, the marble trundled all the way to the bottom, it was possible to imagine Burnham as prime minister, before this year was out.But, as I said then, it was also possible the marble would fly off the run spectacularly – which is precisely what has now happened.In an exercise of brute power, which is simultaneously an illustration of how they perceive their own weakness, No 10 has scuppered Burnham's attempted run from Manchester to Westminster and perhaps on to Downing Street.Yes, this was a decision taken by a committee of the Labour Party, but allies of Sir Keir Starmer are making it perfectly clear he joined the remote meeting on Sunday morning and he cast a vote to block Andy Burnham.The relationship between the two men has long been fascinating to observe.Burnham's first act in politics was very much as a creature of Westminster: an adviser, an MP for 16 years, a cabinet minister. He has run for the Labour leadership twice before. Here he is talking to me more than a decade ago about his ambition to be prime minister. He later reinvented himself - by defining himself against Westminster as the Mayor of Greater Manchester.But his ambitions beyond the north west of England have long been transparent - and long provoked a roll of the eyes or a raised eyebrow from Sir Keir.Burnham's interventions last autumn, around the time of Labour's annual conference, deeply irritated many within the party. He gave an interview to The New Statesman, which carried the less than cryptic headline \"Andy Burnham's plan for Britain.\"Shortly after came an interview in The Telegraph, headlined \"Andy Burnham: MPs want me to challenge Starmer\".Burnham's team would point out, rightly, that politicians don't write the headlines but the wider point stands – his desires were very, very clear.Just the other day, he set out in The Guardian how he believed his approach to his mayoralty in Greater Manchester could be applied nationally.'You should not block democracy'Of course, aspiring to lead the country is noble, but it shouldn't be surprising that the current occupier of that role might have a rather sniffy view of such manoeuvring, particularly when Starmer can argue that it is he who won Labour's colossal majority not Burnham, whatever people might think of how governing has gone for Labour since.No 10 has calculated that it would rather weather a short-term storm – the gales of reaction for and against this decision currently gusting across social media – than authorise a circus lasting weeks, then months, with Burnham as a by-election candidate and one question dominating: what's your plan if you become prime minister?\"I'm afraid no-one is convinced that Andy is coming in to be a team player and the last thing we should do is allow this kind of psychodrama,\" one senior party figure tells me, adding: \"We can't allow insecurity and destabilisation to indulge one man's personal ambition.\"Others are livid, arguing it is absurd and counterproductive to spike the prospects of someone they see as one of the party's brightest lights.\"You should not block democracy. Keir is running scared and it's a very bad look,\" one senior Labour MP said.All this means that in the space of just a few months, those loyal to the prime minister have briefed heavily against Health Secretary Wes Streeting, whose ambitions they view with nervousness too - and have now blocked Andy Burnham from returning to Westminster.They argue that the electorate is sick of political soap opera and they want to get on with governing – against a tricky international and domestic backdrop.Their critics, within the Labour Party and beyond, say both are acts of a weak prime minister seeking to cripple capable rivals who might, they argue, do a considerably better job than him in No 10.This will likely be far from the last act this year in the drama of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership, and how much of a future it has.",

    "body": "13 hours agoJacob PhillipsFamily handoutAlex Pretti was killed in Minneapolis on SaturdayA man who was shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis has been identified by his family as 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti.He has been described as an avid outdoorsman who loved mountain biking and is understood to have joined protests after Renee Good, also 37, was shot dead by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in her car earlier this month.Conflicting accounts have emerged about the moments leading up to his death.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an agent fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they claim had a handgun, resisted attempts to disarm him. Some eyewitnesses and officials, as well as Pretti's family, have challenged that account.Videos show no evidence to support the claim he used any armed force to threaten agents.Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, his family said in a statement. They told the Associated Press news agency (AP) that he was upset by US President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration in the city. Pretti's mother also said her son cared immensely about the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations.\"He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,\" Susan Pretti told AP. She added: \"He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.\"Pretti had no interactions with law enforcement beyond traffic tickets, family sayPretti loved adventures with his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog Joule, who died around a year ago, AP reported. His family said he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to AP, court records show he had no criminal record.Pretti's parents, who live in Wisconsin, said they had also recently told their son to be careful while protesting.\"We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,\" his father Michael Pretti told AP. \"And he said he knows that. He knew that.\"Pretti's family also explained he owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota - but they had never known him to carry it.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara also said police believed he was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, the BBC's US partner CBS reported. 'Please get the truth out about our son'After seeing videos suggesting their son was a \"domestic terrorist,\" Pretti's family issued a statement saying \"the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting\".They claimed videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents. \"Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,\" they urged in their statement.Pretti was a Democratic voter and had taken part in the wave of street protests after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, his ex-wife told AP.She said that he was someone who may shout at law enforcement officers at a protest but had never known him to be physically confrontational.ReutersA woman cries as people gather around a makeshift memorial close to where Alex Pretti was shotA US citizen born in Illinois, Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir. He went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to his family.He worked as a research scientist before returning to education to qualify as a registered nurse.His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple of days before he was shot dead when they spoke about repairs he had done to the garage door at his home, AP reported. A Latino man had completed the work and Pretti's parents said with all that was happening in Minneapolis he gave the man a $100 (£74) tip.Doctor Dmitri Drekonja, who worked with Pretti, told ABC News the pair had bonded over their interest in mountain biking and would compare notes on which trails to ride.\"He was the type of person you enjoyed being around and the notion that this helpful, smiling joking guy was being labelled a terrorist? It's galling,\" he said.ReutersPeople gather around a makeshift memorial close to where Alex Pretti was fatally shotNeighbours described Pretti as quiet and warmhearted.\"He's a wonderful person,\" Sue Gitar told AP, who lived downstairs from the nurse and said he moved into the building about three years ago. \"He has a great heart.\"Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbours said.\"I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun,\" said Gitar.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoJustin RowlattClimate EditorAFP via Getty ImagesThe new project could link offshore wind farms in the North Sea to more than one country via 'interconnectors'The UK is set to back a vast new fleet of offshore wind projects in the North Sea alongside eight other European countries including Norway, Germany and the Netherlands.The government says the deal will strengthen energy security by offering an escape from what it calls the \"fossil fuel rollercoaster\".For the first time, some of the new wind farms will be linked to multiple countries through undersea cables known as interconnectors, which supporters say should lower prices across the region.But it could prove controversial as wind farm operators would be able to shop around between countries to sell power to the highest bidder - potentially driving up electricity prices when supply is tight.Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will sign a declaration on Monday at a meeting on the future of the North Sea in the German city of Hamburg, committing to complete the scheme by 2050.Jane Cooper, deputy CEO of industry body RenewableUK, said the deal would \"drive down costs for billpayers\" as well as increasing \"the energy security of the UK and the whole of the North Sea region significantly\".But Claire Countinho, shadow energy secretary, warned \"we cannot escape the fact that the rush to build wind farms at breakneck speed is pushing up everybody's energy bills.\"National GridA valve hall inside a converter station that will form part of 'interconnector' onshore infrastructureA network of undersea cables already connect the electricity grids of European countries - the UK has 10 such cables - but connecting wind farms directly to multiple countries will be a first. Most energy economists agree more connections between the UK and other European grids should reduce costs and improve the security of supply.The UK National Grid published a paper earlier this month suggesting such an arrangement could cut so-called constraint payments, made when wind farms are asked not to generate power because the electricity network is too congested.A separate report said UK consumers had enjoyed savings of £1.6bn from the nine existing undersea cables linking the UK with Europe since 2023.National Grid said the cables help smooth spikes in prices because, thanks to time zone differences, surplus energy generated off-peak elsewhere can be sold cheaply to the UK.But interconnectors have proved controversial in Norway where there have been concerns that selling power to foreign countries could reduce supplies for Norwegian customers and therefore increase the price they pay.To stop this happening, the government brought in new rules to restrict electricity exports when domestic supply could be at risk.Norway also refused permission for a new interconnector to Scotland.Nato and the European Commission are also taking part in the summit, which is expected to include pledges to strengthen security for offshore energy infrastructure amid rising concerns over sabotage and unsafe maritime activity.The agreement underlines Europe's continued commitment to wind power, despite renewed criticism from US President Donald Trump, who again attacked what he called \"windmills\" during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.The North Sea countries pledged to develop 300 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity three years ago. This new deal means 100GW of the total will be built jointly.  It is expected to say 20GW of that should be under way by 2030.China currently leads the world in offshore wind, with 43GW of the world's 83GW of installed capacity, according to a report last year from industry body RenewableUK.The UK ranks second, with almost 16GW already in operation. The UK government has awarded contracts for a further 20GW, including 8.4GW agreed in a record-breaking bidding round earlier this month.The government was criticised by the Conservatives for \"locking in\" high offshore wind prices.Reform has also repeatedly attacked the cost of net zero, but the Lib Dems and Greens both support the expansion of renewables to tackle the threat of climate change and boost green jobs.SNP and Plaid Cymru also support the growth of offshore wind, but argue Scotland and Wales should have control of their energy resources.Additional reporting by Miho Tanaka.",

    "body": "The killing of a second US citizen in less than a month during immigration raids in Minneapolis has sparked angry protests and widespread condemnation.Hundreds of demonstrators braved freezing weather to take to the streets over the shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, during a confrontation on Saturday.Videos from the scene show the scuffle between federal officers and Pretti. Federal and state authorities have offered conflicting versions of what happened in the moments leading to the shooting.Trump ordered federal agents to the Democrat-held state in December, pledging a massive deportation of undocumented migrants. On Saturday night hundreds of people paid tribute to Pretti, lighting candles and chanting his name near the spot where he was shot.During the day, hundreds of protesters showed their anger against the shooting and  raids by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), as armed and masked agents used tear gas and stun grenades.Protests have spread to other US cities, including New York where people held signs saying, \"Justice for Alex\" and \"abolish ICE\", as well as to Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.The Trump administration has described Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist\".  Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said he was there \"to perpetuate violence\", saying he approached federal agents with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun.Videos have emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and the man just before the shooting.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti resisted their attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened.BBC Verify analysed multiple videos showing the moments just before the shooting. They show Pretti filming agents with his mobile phone. One of the agents pushes another person over, and Pretti then stands between that person and the agent.The agent pepper-sprays him in the face and, as he tries to help the woman on the ground, more agents join and he is wrestled to the ground. None of the available videos shows Pretti holding a gun.An agent in a grey jacket can be seen empty-handed as he reaches to remove something from Pretti's waist. He then turns away from Pretti, now holding what appears to be a pistol in his right hand.Less than a second after this, an agent shoots Pretti. Ten shots are heard.What we know  about fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in MinneapolisWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?If you are in Minneapolis, please share your storyIn filed testimony, two witnesses challenged the DHS account of what happened, both saying they did not see Pretti brandish a weapon.But Deputy Attorney-General Todd Blanche told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that the videos were unclear and \"there is a lot we don't see\" in them so it was important to have an investigation.President Donald Trump said local and state officials were \"inciting Insurrection\", suggesting they had called off local police from protecting federal immigration officers at the shooting scene.Governor Walz strongly disputed the federal government's account of the incident. \"I've seen the video from several angles and it's sickening,\" he told reporters.\"Thank God we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It is nonsense, and it's lies,\" he saidWalz reiterated his call for trump to end ICE operations in Minnesota and urged protests to remain peaceful. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also called for ICE agents to leave the state. \"How many more residents, how many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end?\" he said.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the man who was killed was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record other than traffic violations.It is legal in Minnesota to carry a handgun in public if you have a permit.Republican Senator Bill Cassidy called the events in Minneapolis \"incredibly disturbing\". The \"credibility\" of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security are at stake, he said in a post on social media.\"There must be a full joint federal and state investigation.\"The latest shooting follows weeks of tensions between the Minnesota authorities, federal agents and protesters who have taken to the streets to observe the agents during their anti-immigration raids.Earlier this month, an ICE agent shot dead Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident who was taking part in such an observation.Trump's crackdown in Minneapolis was launched in December after some Somali immigrants were convicted in a massive fraud of state welfare programmes. The state is home to the largest community of Somali immigrants in the US.ICE agents have the power to stop, detain and arrest people they suspect of being in the US illegally.",

    "body": "What we know about fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis21 hours agoAoife Walsh,WashingtonandOlivia IrelandWatch: Video shows moments around fatal shooting in MinneapolisFederal agents shot and killed a man in Minneapolis on Saturday, the second person to be fatally shot in the city during the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown this month.Local officials identified the man as 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a US citizen who lived in Minneapolis and worked as a nurse. Videos have emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and the man in the lead up to the shooting. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened. \"Please get the truth out about our son,\" they added. The incident, which came two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration agent, has led to further protests and renewed calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave the city. Here is what we know so far.What happened in the moments before the shooting?The shooting occurred on Saturday morning near Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis at 9:05 local time (15:05 GMT).Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, said agents had been carrying out a \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operation when Pretti approached agents with a \"9mm semi-automatic\" handgun.Bovino did not specify if Pretti was brandishing the gun, but said agents attempted to disarm him and he \"violently resisted\". The commander said a Border Patrol officer then \"fired defensive shots\". Videos from the moments before the shooting show Pretti filming agents with his phone in the middle of the street. Whistling and shouting can be heard from bystanders in the background. From one angle, an agent appears to push a woman. When the camera pans back to Pretti, he is seen with his arm around her. The agent then pushes back a second woman. At the same time, Pretti reaches his arm out and stands between her and the agent.The agent then sprays a substance in his eyes. Pretti turns his face away and reaches one open hand up in the air. He appears to be clutching a phone in the other. No gun is visible.Another video from a different angle shows the agent grabbing Pretti by the arm, before more agents get involved. Pretti is brought to the ground, with at least six agents on top of him. One agent can be seen striking at his head.Another officer, who appears to approach the scuffle with empty hands, pulls back with what appears to be a gun in his hand. As he moves away toward a vehicle, a split second later another agent standing beside him opens fire. The agents jump back from the man lying on the ground and the firing continues. A total of 10 gunshots are heard. What do we know about the gun?US Department of Homeland SecurityDHS shared a photo of a firearm on social media, which they say belonged the man who was shot After the shooting, DHS shared a photo of a firearm on social media, which they said belonged to Pretti. The agency also said he had two magazines of ammunition and no ID. Bovino told reporters it looked like a \"situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement\". He did not provide any further evidence.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference that Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. His only previous interactions with law enforcement, as far as police are aware, were related to parking tickets.In a sign of the tensions between federal and local authorities, the police chief also said the DHS had not provided his team with \"any specific details\" about the deadly incident itself.Later, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked to clarify if Pretti had brandished a gun. She said: \"Individuals showed up to impede a law enforcement operation and assaulted our officers. \"They responded according to their training, and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him. And, I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, said he understood the risk of people trying to bear witness and document the actions of federal agents.\"Thank God, thank God, we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It's nonsense, people. It is nonsense, and it's lies.\"Pretti's parents ask for the 'truth' to be toldEPAProtesters and police clash at the scene of the shootingAlex Pretti's parents Michael and Susan have called for \"the truth\" to be told about their son, after he was shot dead in the confrontation with federal immigration officers.\"We are heartbroken but also very angry,\" they said in a family statement, according to several US outlets. \"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting.\"They added that videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents. Instead, they said, he was holding his phone with one hand and using the other to shield a woman who was being pepper-sprayed.\"Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital.\"Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact.\"Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoJoshua Nevett,Political reporterandChris Mason,Political editorPA MediaPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's allies fear Andy Burnham's leadership ambitionsAndy Burnham has said he is \"disappointed\" after being blocked from standing as a candidate for the upcoming parliamentary by-election in Gorton and Denton by Labour's ruling body.As a directly elected mayor, Burnham had to get approval from Labour's national executive committee (NEC), after he applied to be a candidate on Saturday.But Labour said the party had decided to deny him permission to stand to \"avoid an unnecessary mayoral election, which would use substantial amounts of taxpayers' money and resources\".Burnham, a former minister, is widely seen as a potential leadership challenger to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer should he return to Westminster. Writing on X, Burnham expressed concern about the ruling's \"impact on the important elections ahead of us\", and said he would return with \"full focus\" to his role as mayor.\"I decided to put myself forward to prevent the divisive politics of Reform from damaging that. We are stronger together and let's stay that way,\" Burnham said.However, he criticised how the ruling was made known on Sunday, saying: \"The fact that the media was informed of the NEC decision before I was tells you everything you need to know about the way the Labour Party is being run these days\".The seat in Greater Manchester is vacant after former Labour minister Andrew Gwynne stood down on Friday as an MP on health grounds.The move to block Burnham has infuriated Labour MPs and is likely to anger some ministers who said local party members should have had the option of choosing the Greater Manchester mayor as the candidate.It is a big political gamble by allies of the prime minister and risks inflaming tensions within the party, which is consistently trailing Reform UK in national opinion polls.One senior Labour source who had been supportive of Burnham's candidacy said: \"They're gambling the PM's whole premiership on winning a very hard by-election without their best candidate. It is madness.\"The decision was made by 10 members of the NEC, including Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, party chair Ellie Reeves and the prime minister himself on Sunday morning.NEC sources told the BBC the vote was 8-1 in favour of blocking Burnham's candidacy.The prime minister was among those who voted to block him from standing.Mahmood abstained as the chair, while Labour's deputy leader Lucy Powell voted to allow him to stand.Labour sources have told the BBC that in the meeting, lots of concerns were raised about the costs of an election to replace Burnham as Greater Manchester mayor and the \"prospect of a divisive campaign\".Burnham was elected as mayor of Greater Manchester in May 2024 for a term that runs until May 2028.Sir Keir's allies say Burnham is doing \"a very good job\" as mayor, arguing that an election to replace him \"would cost the party hundreds of thousands of pounds\" and \"cost the country millions of pounds during a cost-of-living crisis\".The prime minister's supporters were worried Reform UK \"would outspend us ten to one\" during the by-election campaign.The argument those who blocked Burnham intend to make publicly is that during a period of geopolitics dominating the headlines and deep concerns about the cost of living at home, there would be no appetite in the country for a \"return to political psychodramas of the Tory years\".There was \"overwhelming support\" in the meeting \"for upholding clear Labour Party rules preventing mayors and PCCs standing in by-elections\", a source said.Earlier, Mahmood told the BBC allowing elected mayors to run as candidates in parliamentary by-elections had \"organisational implications\" for the party.A mayoral election in Greater Manchester could also be costly for the taxpayer, with the last one costing about £4.7m.In a statement, the Labour Party said: \"The NEC believes that causing an unnecessary election for the position of Greater Manchester mayor would have a substantial and disproportionate impact on party campaign resources ahead of the local elections and elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd in May.\"Although the Party would be confident of retaining the mayoralty, the NEC could not put Labour's control of Greater Manchester at any risk.\"Housing secretary says it's not the right time for Burnham's return to ParliamentLocal government secretary Steve Reed said the NEC had decided against Burnham's candidacy \"because of the huge inconvenience to two million voters across Greater Manchester of having a by-election for a new mayor\".\"I know that's disappointing for Andy,\" Reed said. \"But it's good news for the people of Greater Manchester because he's been doing such a good job as the mayor there.\"Reed said \"voters don't like elections that come mid-term\" but added that \"in due course, I look forward to seeing Andy back in Parliament\".Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC he was \"absolutely furious\" about the decision and suggested the prime minister did not \"understand the depth of anger there will be amongst our members about this\".\"I think it shows weakness and cowardice,\" McDonnell said, describing the move as \"factionalism gone wild\".He said he had messaged Starmer to tell him \"if he thinks this strengthens his position, I think it will used to hasten his demise if he's not careful\".He said it was an \"insult to people's intelligence\" to claim the decision had been made because of the difficulty and expense of finding a new mayor of Greater Manchester.Karl Turner, Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull East, said it was regrettable that the NEC had stopped Burnham from becoming a candidate because he believes he would have been a \"frontrunner to win the seat\".He said while he wanted Starmer to remain prime minister, the decision to block Burnham \"provides more chance of a challenge\" if the party lose the by-election.But other Labour MPs welcomed the decision, with John Slinger, who represents the Rugby constituency, saying the \"quick and clear decision\" meant the party could \"move on from the damaging, introspection and psychodrama of the last week\".Burnham, who was previously MP for Leigh, has been touted as a possible Labour leadership contender but can only mount a challenge if he is an MP.The former cabinet minister has previously not denied he could challenge Sir Keir.But in his letter to the NEC on Saturday, Burnham insisted he would be in Parliament \"to support the work of the government, not undermine it\".\"I have passed this assurance on to the prime minister.\"Labour will now move ahead with picking someone else to be their candidate in Gorton and Denton.Once the deadline for applications passes on Sunday night, an NEC selection panel will shortlist candidates, who will go through to a vote of local party members next weekend.Gorton and Denton has traditionally voted Labour and the party won the seat in 2024 with a majority of 13,000.Since then, the party's popularity has declined and Labour could face challenges from Reform UK and the Green Party, who came second and third there at the general election.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoAnnabel RackhamBBCAllana Falconer has competed in 20 different Hyrox races since taking it up in 2023Hyrox is a fitness craze that shows no signs of dying out - with 1.3m people expected to compete in an event somewhere in the world this year.The competition, which is split between running and fitness exercises, has proven particularly popular with young millennials and Generation Z - people in their twenties to early forties. Its rapidly growing popularity has been attributed to social media.Fashionable looks are often a non-negotiable for competitors, with many choosing to compete in high-end fitness brands, matching their outfits with their team members.Allana Falconer, who works in sustainability and started competing in 2023, says she has \"fallen in love\" with it.She has competed in 20 different races across six countries and 12 different cities.\"All my holidays revolve around Hyrox or I incorporate events into holidays,\" she tells the BBC World Service.The 29-year-old says the most she has spent so far was £2,000, when she travelled to Chicago for the World Championships last year.Exercise is part of their identityONE LDNEvgenia Koroleva spent £75,000 creating a bespoke Hyrox space in her London gym\"For competitions abroad, I normally spend approximately £400 per trip for two nights' stay and travel and £120 for a ticket,\" she adds.As she is racing so much, she says she needs lots of fitness kit too, adding that \"I burn through ridiculous amounts of shoes.\"Evgenia Koroleva, the founder of ONE LDN gym, says for anyone that takes fitness competitions seriously, \"the costs can be absolutely astronomical\".She estimates an athlete travelling to compete in a Hyrox competition will spend between \"£500 to £1,000\" in one weekend, with the ticket alone about £120.\"Hyrox has created this addiction for people who do it because they never really do one race. When they do their first race they then sign up for another one and because the course is the same it creates this level of competition with yourself,\" she adds.The cost of participation is higher than a marathon, and some people have criticised it. \"Travelling abroad plus the costs involved to run around a bit and get out of breath is a stretch for me,\" said one former participant on Reddit. Fran Sirl, personal trainer and owner of parkfit, who runs outdoor fitness classes in Richmond Park, says sports like this can feel intimidating and says he reminds his clients you don't need specialist kit or equipment to get fit.\"I take groups out into the park. Sometimes we start out with a walk, then add lunges and push-ups on a bench. \"Exercise doesn't need to be expensive or complicated. It's about finding something that makes you want to go back and do it again, whether that's a high intensity workout or just going for a walk.\"Most athletes the BBC spoke to felt the prices for Hyrox were fair due to the cost of hiring large event spaces, specialist equipment and judging panels.Evgenia says the fact people are willing to pay so much reflects a wider \"cultural shift\" in how much people in their 20s and 30s spend on exercise.\"Exercise is non-negotiable and part of their identity,\" she adds.Spending money on fitness is a priority for those born between 1997 and 2012 (Gen Z), according to exercise app Strava.Its survey suggests that a third of them plan to spend more on fitness this year with almost two thirds saying they would rather spend money on new gym clothes than a date.\"Mara-cations\" (marathon vacations) and Hyrox holidays are now so popular that some travel companies are offering bespoke trips abroad for competitions.In Hyrox, UK competitions often sell out quickly, which is why many of those wanting to take part travel further afield.Hyrox, which hosted its first competition in 2021, has a near 50/50 gender split.The race involves doing a one-kilometre run eight times, broken up with exercises such as burpee broad jumps, sled pulls and rowing.Those taking part can compete on their own or with a partner - either in a mixed or same sex team. Dr Florence Kinnafick, a senior academic at Loughborough University who specialises in physical activity and mental health, says the different disciplines can mean competing becomes \"addictive\".The \"emphasis on competition isn't attractive to everybody,\" she says.Kinnafick also warns of a risk of overtraining, if people get \"obsessed\" with improving their time.But when it comes to the exercises themselves, she says whilst it is a hard event, there's nothing \"particularly technical\" making it safe for newcomers.'I've caught the bug'Jorell has competed in 10 different Hyrox races across Europe.Jorell Hill, who has competed in 10 races so far, says he has \"definitely caught the bug\".\"I did my first one [Hyrox] in December 2024 and since then I haven't been been on a single holiday abroad that hasn't been for a half marathon, marathon or Hyrox.\"The 27-year-old, who fits his training around his job as a firefighter, says his life \"used to be going out, seeing mates, going to the pub and drinking a lot\" but now nearly all his holidays involve \"fitness retreats and competitions\".He has travelled to \"six or seven different countries for competitions\" and hopes to compete in America and further afield this year.Jorell, who moved to London just over a year ago, has made most of his friends through fitness.\"Instead of spending money on going out clothes, I'm just buying new fitness kit,\" he says.",

He was 53. Dane starred as family patriarch Cal Jacobs on hit HBO teen drama show Euphoria. Before that, he was perhaps best known as Dr Mark Sloan, or 'Dr McSteamy', on medical drama Grey's Anatomy.The California-born actor was diagnosed last year with ALS and spent the last few months raising awareness for the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).\"With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS,\" reads a statement from his family. He was married to fellow actress and model Rebecca Gayheart, with whom he had two children.The written statement said he spent his final days surrounded by friends and his devoted wife, and his two daughters, Billie and Georgia, \"who were the center of his world\". \"He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he's received,\" it said. Dane also played Jason Dean in fantasy drama series Charmed, and Captain Tom Chandler in action drama show The Last Ship, while appearing in films such as Marley & Me, Valentine's Day and Burlesque.FilmMagicEric Dane and wife Rebecca Gayheart pictured in 2017ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare degenerative disease that causes progressive paralysis of the muscles. It affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, causing patients to slowly lose their ability to speak, eat, walk and breathe independently. \"Because, you know, my father was taken from me when I was young,\" he told the programme. \"And now, you know, there's a very good chance I'm going to be taken from my girls while they're very young\".His father died by suicide when Dane was seven years old. The actor was born in San Francisco in 1972 and made his television debut in the Wonder Years in 1993. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoThere is one image of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor dominates the today's front pages, marking the moment the former prince was arrested and released on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The Daily Express runs the picture of Mountbatten-Windsor slouched in the back of the car while leaving police custody on Thursday evening. The paper headlines on the King's comment that \"the law must take its course\". Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Guardian also leads with the same picture and the King's comment about his brother. The front page also previews a editorial in the paper reflecting on challenges for the Royal Family going forward, remarking that the \"old model – of discreet exile and silence – seems finished\". \"Downfall\" is the one-worded headline on the front of the Daily Mail, next to a zoomed-in version of the Mountbatten-Windsor photograph. It describes the former prince as looking \"haggard, shamed and haunted\" as he was released from police custody. The Daily Telegraph reports the former prince has become the first senior member of the Royal Family in modern history to have been arrested.  \"The magnitude of his fall from grace seemed etched on his face,\" the paper says. The Times has called the arrest of Andrew the \"biggest crisis for the monarchy since the abdication\".Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor \"has nowhere to hide\", the Daily Mirror reports. A former royal protection chief Dai Davies called the moment \"huge\" and says that the situation \"could affect the whole monarchy\". \"Now he's sweating\" is the headline of the Sun, a reference to the 2019 BBC Newsnight interview in which he claimed to be unable to sweat due to a medical condition. The Metro's headline also focuses on the response of King Charles to his brother's arrest. The King is believed to have had no warning before the arrest, which happened on the former prince's 66th birthday. The i Paper reports that Thames Valley Police \"carried out a morning raid at his temporary farmhouse residence on the Sandringham estate\". The Daily Star also carries the zoomed in image of Mountbatten-Windsor \"looking tired\" leaving the Aylsham police station after \"11 hours in police custody\". And, the one paper not focused on the former prince, Financial Times features the latest developments from the US on Iran. President Donald Trump has set \"a 10-day window to decide on Iran strikes\" or make a deal, the paper reports. It says in recent days the US has bolstered its \"huge military force deployed to the Middle East\". Related Internet Links",

Around 15 out of 100 breast cancers are of this type.Cats develop this subtype more often than humans, giving scientists access to samples, and offering clues to new medicines that might help in treatment. Getty ImagesCancer is one of the leading causes of illness in catsAlmost a quarter of UK households own at least one cat, making the animal almost as popular as dogs as a trusted companion.But while cancer studies have been carried out extensively in dogs, cats have remained unexplored.The scientists say both household pets could give clues to environmental factors involved in some types of cancer.They share the same spaces as us, meaning that they are also exposed to the same environmental factors that we are. \"This can help us understand more about why cancer develops in cats and humans, how the world around us influences cancer risk, and possibly find new ways to prevent and treat it,\" said Prof Geoffrey Wood of the Ontario Veterinary College, Canada.The research is published in the journal, Science.",

[sic]\"Stern and Lord Mandelson did not reply to requests for comment.Many of his emails to Epstein flagged potential deals, and in February 2010 he forwarded a short news article about the financial woes of EMI at the time. EMI is a now-defunct conglomerate that included EMI Records, formerly one of the major players of the music industry. It was acquired by Universal Music in 2012.\"Troubled industry but related to P,\" Stern wrote to Epstein.\"P\", which Epstein apparently used to refer to women, is believed to be an abbreviation of the word \"pussy\", another term Epstein often used.For birthdays and New Year greetings, Stern wished Epstein \"lots of P\", according to the recently released files. He once offered to get Epstein fashion show tickets \"to review Chinese P\". He would send Epstein a \"P factor\" for the places he visited, giving the Spanish island Ibiza 9/10, and Sarah Ferguson's 50th birthday party 0.2/10.The emails have been newly released by the US Department of JusticeAt the time Epstein had considered asking Stern for his help in an EMI investment, Lord Mandelson was First Secretary of State and Business Secretary in the UK government.Stern said it was \"too early to get Mandelson involved before i know more\".Epstein appears to have emailed Lord Mandelson a few days later, saying: \"please email me bens contact info.. or havehim cal me re emi. [sic]\"In reply, Lord Mandelson appears to say: \"Gave to [redacted]. Email is [redacted]. Talk re EMI ??\".It's not clear exactly who \"ben\" is.Epstein sent another reply to Stern, suggesting that if the deal went ahead, he would put US businessman and former Sony Music company CEO Tommy Mottola in charge of it.He wrote, \"my friend is tommy mottola former head of sony I'd like him to be brought in to fix it\".Mottola did not reply to a request for comment. US Department of JusticeAn image from the Epstein files showing David Stern at the opening of a new office for his company Asia Gateway in Beijing in 2011Epstein's proposed deal did not go ahead – and EMI's main lender Citigroup ended up taking control of the company.However later on, in 2011, Epstein's circle were still discussing a bid for EMI.Kevin Law, a businessmen in the US state of Connecticut who was often in touch with Epstein, apparently wrote: \"Tell your buddy Andrew from the UK if he's interested in EMI as we discussed I can put him in the syndicate w KKR.\" It is not clear if Epstein's \"buddy\" referred to here is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.PA MediaDavid Stern sits to the left of the Queen at a Pitch@Palace event at St James's Palace in London, in November 2016Law has said he \"never bid on EMI with any group nor did I ever do a business deal with Epstein,\" and said he did not know the former prince.The giant private equity firm KKR declined to comment. At the time KKR had a controlling stake in a rival record company, BMG.Stern was apparently still keen on acquiring a record company in 2011. He wrote: \"EMI may now come up for sale. Could actually be of interest to Chinese if structured properly. Also, most certainly great asset to have for P!\"However Epstein did not buy it then either.In November 2011, Citigroup split EMI into two parts and, the following year, sold it to Universal and a consortium involving Sony and record executive David Geffen.The DOJ files show other discussions between Epstein and associates about buying model agencies and fashion-related businesses, which also did not go ahead.French prosecutors have previously suspected that Epstein used his contact in the fashion industry, Jean-Luc Brunel, to house and transport young girls.More on this story",

Spring is just around the cornerByDarren BettLead Weather PresenterA major change in the UK's weather pattern is heading our way.The brief spell of cold weather with frost, ice and hill snow is ending, with temperatures set to jump by up to 10C from Friday onwards.The blocked weather pattern which has been maintaining the recent wintry spell is being pushed away with milder air sticking around for the next week or so.It will be accompanied by further spells of wet weather coming across from the Atlantic. Heaviest rain is expected to be over western hills and the ongoing threat of flooding is likely to continue.How warm will it get?Image caption, Maximum temperatures this weekend will be higher than the average for mid FebruaryRecent days have seen temperatures typically 4C or 5C (39-41F) by day and as low as minus 9C (16F) in Scotland at night. It also felt colder in the strong south-easterly wind.The cold air is being pushed away to the east of the UK and a change to south-westerly winds will bring much milder air from the Atlantic. Daytime temperatures will be 10-14 Celsius (50-57F) in many parts of the country over the weekend and into next week. The risk of frost is much reduced with temperatures at night generally falling to 5-9 Celsius (41-48F).There has been a stark lack of mild days in Scotland this year, with the start of 2026 marking the longest wait for the temperature to reach 12C (54F) in the country since 1986.Why such a significant change?Image caption, Jet stream further north allowing south-westerly winds to lift temperaturesThe cold blocking area of high pressure over Scandinavia that has been in place for much of 2026 so far is being pushed away. That means milder winds can push across the whole of northern Europe more consistently. The jet stream, which has been positioned across the UK for the last few weeks will move further north at times, keeping the UK in warmer air. Risk of flooding to continueImage source, BBCWeatherWatchers/s PaceImage caption, Flooding in Datchet. A large number of flood warnings are in southern EnglandThe persistence of the rain has led to the flooding many parts of the UK have experienced. Parts of Cornwall have had rain falling on each of the last 50 days. Katesbridge in Northern Ireland and Aboyne in Scotland have already had half a years rainfall in just a few weeks.Image caption, Wettest places in each home nation with rainfall totals all well above averageThe predominantly south-westerly winds over the next few weeks will bring in spells of rain and areas of low pressure from time to time. The wettest weather is expected to be over western hills. That means a change of fortune in Scotland, where up to now it has been extremely wet in eastern Scotland but drier than normal in the west of the country.The recent snowfall will also melt rapidly as temperatures rise.Given saturated ground in many parts of the UK and flood warnings, mainly in England, the risk of flooding will remain a concern well in to March.You can find the longer range forecast here.",

    "body": "4 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinWatch: Obama gave \"classified information\" with alien comments, says TrumpUS President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to \"begin the process of identifying and releasing\" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life. Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said \"aliens are real\" on a podcast last week. \"He's not supposed to be doing that,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: \"He made a big mistake.\"Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: \"Well, I don't know if they're real or not.\"Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. \"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,\" Obama said. \"There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.\"After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it's statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe. In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: \"I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!\" Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire \"lightning\" round of questions on the podcast.There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and \"doesn't have an opinion on it\". Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that \"based on the tremendous interest shown\" he will seek the release of files \"related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters\".In 2023, the US House of Representatives held a panel on unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAPs), known more colloquially as UFOs. The hearing produced no major bombshells or confirmation of alien life. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoBethany BellBBC Vienna correspondentBergrettung KalsAn Austrian climber has been found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter after his girlfriend froze to death on Austria's highest mountain last year.The man, named only as Thomas P in line with Austrian privacy laws, has been given a five-month suspended sentence and fined €9,600 (£8,400).His girlfriend, Kerstin G, died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025.In a statement sent to the BBC, the court said it considered Thomas P's previous clean record and the loss of a person close to him \"to be mitigating factors\". It said it also took into account \"the public discussion on social media, which was incriminating for the defendant\".The judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced climber who works with mountain and helicopter rescue teams in Tyrol, said Thomas P was an excellent Alpinist, but that his girlfriend was light-years behind him in terms of her climbing abilities.He said the couple should have turned back as Kerstin G did not have enough experience in winter conditions.The court also heard from Andrea B, a former girlfriend of Thomas P, who described how he had left her alone on a previous tour on the Grossglockner in 2023. She said she had been at the end of her tether, feeling dizzy and her headlight had gone out. She said she was crying and screaming when he suddenly disappeared, walking ahead and leaving her behind.Grossglockner mountain in AustriaAccording to reports in the Austrian media, the court heard how the mountain rescue team found Kerstin's body hanging upside down from a rock face.One of the rescuers told the court she had her rucksack on and her head was tilted back.Her eyes were wide open, she wasn't wearing gloves, and her boots were open, he said.\"We were amazed that she remained in that position.\" If the wind had been any stronger, \"she would have fallen over the south face\".The prosecution said there were strong winds of up to 74 km/h (45 mph), and was very cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20C, they said.They argued that as the more experienced climber, Thomas P was \"the responsible guide for the tour\". They said he failed to turn back or call for help in time to help his girlfriend.Thomas P should never have allowed himself to get into this situation, the prosecutor said.Thomas P pleaded not guilty. He told the court he was deeply sorry. He said he had loved his girlfriend, who was very sporty and that they had planned the trip together.His lawyer Kurt Jelinek said the couple had found themselves in a really difficult and stressful situation.He said Kerstin was not inexperienced and knew what she was getting into.www.foto-webcam.euThis still from webcam footage shows the couple still climbing at 21:00 on 18 JanuaryProsecutors say the couple got stuck on the mountain and that the man failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:30.Video footage from the helicopter showed the couple still climbing. The judge noted that no distress signals were sent.The defence argued that at that point Thomas P and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.But shortly afterwards, the defence said the situation changed dramatically, when Kerstin became exhausted close to the summit.The defence said that she told Thomas P to go to get help.At 00:35 on 19 January, he called the mountain police. The content of the conversation is disputed. Rescuers said it wasn't an emergency call but the lawyer says he denies telling police that everything was fine.He scaled the summit and descended on the other side, leaving Kerstin behind. Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00 am.Webcam images show his torchlit figure coming down from the summit.The trial sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders, raising questions about when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability.The case is subject to appeal.",

    "body": "Lion DNA helps convict poachers for first time5 hours agoAngus CrawfordBBC News InvestigationsGetty ImagesA male lion in Hwange National Park, ZimbabweLion DNA has been used to successfully prosecute poachers for the first time in the world, it has emerged.Wildlife crime experts have only just revealed how they were able to identify the individual animal from body parts found in a suspect's village, as they matched a profile on Zimbabwe's lion database.A blood sample had previously been taken from the male lion, which was being tracked by authorities in Hwange National Park - using a radio collar.Two poachers were convicted for the 2024 incident and sent to prison in what is thought to be the first prosecution of its kind.The details of the convictions and the role the DNA database played have been previously unknown.Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Traffic, which works to combat the illegal trade in wildlife, has shared the detail with us.In May 2024, authorities in Hwange National Park became suspicious after a radio collar worn by a male lion stopped working.Investigators and police traced its last known position and found a snare with lion fur attached to it.After collecting forensic evidence they questioned two men in a nearby village and discovered three sacks of meat, 16 lion claws and four teeth. These body parts would later be tested against the database, with the DNA from all matching the profile of that missing lion.TRACE, Simon DuresA lab in Zimbabwe created a DNA database of all lions in the countryBut possessing lion parts is not necessarily a crime in Zimbabwe.Having them can be explained away as old, traditional ornaments or as coming from an animal that died of natural causes.This has been an obstacle to prosecutions in the past.But thanks to a breakthrough in DNA profiling, that's now changed.The lab generated a DNA profile from the recovered body parts and compared this to the profile previously generated from a blood sample of the lion with the radio collar.The two profiles matched and scientists were able to identify the specific missing animal.TRACE, Simon DuresThe scientist was able to match the two DNA profilesOver the last eight years the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust (VFWT) has received about £250,000 from the People's Postcode Lottery in the UK to build up the DNA database of lions in Zimbabwe.The scientist at the trust, who made the discovery, asked to remain anonymous for his own safety, but said:\"Before we had access to this technology, we were only able to do species identification, but sometimes that's not enough.\"We can essentially match those claws or those products to the lion of interest that we are looking for.\"Within 10 days of the killing, the DNA evidence was presented in court.Two men pleaded guilty and were given 24 month prison sentences.The hearing was told the value of the lion was about $20,000.Richard Scobey, Traffic's executive director, said \"countries now have the forensic capability to bring, solid science-based evidence to court\" and that it will have global impact.TRAFFIC, Viv WilliamsLion bones are sold for use in traditional Chinese medicine. Teeth and claws are bought as jewelleryThis is understood to be the first time that DNA from an individual lion has been identified and used to prosecute poachers.Professor Rob Ogden has been closely involved in setting up the project and is co- founder of the organisation Trace, which promotes the use of forensic science in wildlife law enforcement.He says the prosecution gives \"a message of hope\" and shows what can be done using a combination of training, research and development and forensic casework.Recent figures suggest an increase in the number of lions being killed for their body parts which are then sold both as cultural objects in Africa and for traditional Chinese medicine.It is thought the rise may be down to organised crime gangs also involved in the illegal trade in Rhino horn and ivory trafficking.In Mozambique between 2010 and 2023, 426 lions were killed as a result of contact with humans with a quarter linked to deliberate poaching. A measure of the scale of the trade is also the number of seizures by the authorities in recent years.That includes 17 lion skulls found in Lusaka in 2021, reportedly en-route from South Africa, and a 2023 seizure in Maputo of more than 300kg of lion body parts.Which is why this breakthrough on DNA identification is seen as sending an important message to would-be poachers.",

    "body": "9 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondentPA MediaTwo addresses are being searched following the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorWhen Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at about 08:00 on Thursday, it had nothing to do with Virginia Giuffre, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse.What led to him being arrested started with information that came out in the massive Epstein file release in January, around activities while he was a trade envoy for the British government. But it will not have stopped there.It was emails in those files that seem to be between Andrew and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that led to Thames Valley Police getting involved.One email in particular stood out. In November 2010, after Andrew had returned from a UK government-funded trip to Asia, he was sent a series of country reports relating to his trip. There were further email revelations from the files. A month later, on Christmas Eve, Andrew appeared to email Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money.In a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew seems to suggest Epstein invest in a private equity firm he had visited a week before.These will have formed the beginning of what today turned into a full investigation by Thames Valley Police. But detectives will have not relied only on the emails that we have seen. In order to build a case they will have gone to the government and to the palace asking for emails that might explain what was going on. The palace said last Monday that it would \"support\" Thames Valley Police.Detectives will also have done their own trawl of the three million documents in the Epstein files, and they will have asked for unredacted copies from the FBI or the US Department of Justice. The National Crime Agency is helping UK police forces with those requests.So far we have seen only the tip of the iceberg, but detectives may have seen more of what lies under the surfaceIt is highly unlikely that the police arrested Andrew on Thursday on the basis of just a couple of emails people have seen within the Epstein files.At this stage, Andrew has only been arrested. He has not been charged. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising from his relationship with Epstein and has not responded to specific BBC questions about the files released in January.And a reminder, this arrest has nothing to do with allegations Andrew has previously faced from Giuffre, who said she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions in the early 2000s. An out-of-court financial settlement was reached between Andrew and Giuffre in 2022, which made no admission of wrongdoing on Andrew's part.The police released Andrew under investigation on Thursday evening. Typically with arrests relating to white collar crime, people are held for a few hours to allow for searches and initial questioning. Being released under investigation does not rule out further questioning at a later date. Now detectives will have a big decision to make. This could take weeks. Police officers with a crown on their cap badges will sit down with lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service and decide if there is sufficient evidence to charge the King's brother.If they decide to take the case to court, it will be called R v Mountbatten-Windsor, or in layman's terms, the King against the King's brother.

    "body": "3 hours agoJonny DymondRoyal correspondentPAFollowing Andrew's arrest, the King said the authorities have 'our full and wholehearted support and cooperation'How does this work out any way other than badly for the Palace, the Royal Family, and the monarchy?The King's brother has been arrested, taken from his home on the King's estate at Sandringham, photographed and fingerprinted.Just days ago, this was the man living at Royal Lodge, in thirty-room splendour in Windsor Great Park.Just weeks ago, this was \"Prince\" Andrew, issuing a statement via the Palace proclaiming service and innocence.No one would envy the position of the King right now; his supporters point to the actions he has already taken – stripping titles and home from his brother, as well as promising cooperation with any inquiries.They point to what they say has been the speed and determination with which he has acted.And they point to the statement issued in the hours after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest. A statement made without a single reference to the ties of blood between the King and Andrew.Where he wrote of his \"deepest concern\" about \"Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office\", the authorities, he said, \"have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation\".This, say his defenders, is the King putting to one side whatever family loyalty he may feel.Jonathan Dimbleby, the King's biographer and friend, drew a line on Thursday on the BBC's World at One between the Royal family and the monarchy.\"I don't think that it damages the monarchy,\" he said of the arrest. \"I think we have to separate the notion of a family from the institution of the monarchy.\"I think it's very important. It's very easy to align the two.\"Some believe the arrest will give the Royal Family and the Palace some breathing space, and that the treatment of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor as just-another-suspect will lessen the damage done.It might be a drop of comfort on a terrible news day. But it does not get close to even a glass half full.For years, for decades, the Palace, the institution that serves the Royal Family under its direction, has drawn a line between the public role of members of the family and their private lives.ReutersThere can be little doubt of the struggle the King has had, balancing family loyalty and his duty to the crownAs Andrew withdrew from public life, so the Palace withdrew from representing him.But the distinction – so important to the Palace - is entirely lost on most people; the Palace, the Royal Family, the monarchy, all seem as one.Andrew may not have been on the Buckingham Palace balcony for a while. But for more than six decades he was part of what his father Prince Philip used to call \"the family business\".The idea this is or was a \"private matter\" is for the birds. Mountbatten-Windsor is the former Prince Andrew, and remains in the line of succession to the Crown. Royal blood is the point of a hereditary monarchy.Even if he were simply a \"commoner\", his past relationship with the Royal Family and the place would be enough to draw the monarchy into the controversy.Who knows what might emerge from the \"wholehearted\" cooperation with investigations that the King has promised?The Palace points to the King's unprecedented moves so far – stripping Andrew of titles and home, offering assistance, and refraining in any way from seeking favour from the authorities.There can be little doubt of the struggle the King has had, balancing family loyalty, a situation he inherited upon accession, and his duty to the Crown.But the monarchy is about continuity; it is an accretion of what has come before as well as a living thing that responds to the present.The King's supporters stress how much he has done. The institution's detractors will ask why it did not act earlier, why it was not more curious as reports and allegations mounted, and at what point and why did it change in the way it treated the former prince.The drama of the day will die down, but damage has already been done. The question for the Palace, Royal Family and the Crown - how much more is to come?",

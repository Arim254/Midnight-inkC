    "body": "Where does Old Trafford thriller rank among best Premier League games?Media caption, Kroupi levels for Bournemouth in eight-goal thriller against Man UtdBySteve SutcliffeBBC Sport journalistWhen it comes to the greatest Premier League game ever, where do you even start?Manchester United and Bournemouth served up an eight-goal thriller on Monday, which former Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher described as the \"best game\" so far this season in the English top flight.  Speaking on Sky Sports, Carragher said: \"That's what makes the Premier League the greatest product in the world. \"For the majority of that Manchester United were absolutely fantastic. Bournemouth were not at the races at all in the first half but they were fantastic in the second half. What a game. Brilliant.\"I think we have just seen the best game of the Premier League season so far.\" The Red Devils famously played out a 5-5 draw at West Brom in Sir Alex Ferguson's final match in charge of the club in 2013. And United's 4-4 draw against the Cherries was the 17th time the scoreline has occurred in the Premier League era. But where does Monday's match rank among some of the other remarkable contests we have seen down the years?Liverpool 4-3 Newcastle (3 April 1996)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, This result played a major factor in the outcome of the title race eventually won by Manchester UnitedHaving blown a 10-point lead at the top of the table, Newcastle's title hopes suffered a major blow as they lost a classic in stoppage time at Anfield despite having led twice. \"Collymore closing in...\"Man City 3-2 QPR (13 May 2012)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sergio Aguero's late winner delivered the most dramatic end to a Premier League title raceIn an extraordinary conclusion to the 2011-12 campaign, Manchester City scored twice in stoppage time to beat Queens Park Rangers on the final day and win their first title in 44 years.Sergio Aguero's famous late winner ensured City pipped rivals Manchester United, who had already won that day, to the trophy on goal difference.Liverpool 4-4 Arsenal (21 April 2009)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Andrey Arshavin enjoyed his finest night in an Arsenal shirt at AnfieldOn another remarkable evening at Anfield, Arsenal's Andrey Arshavin produced a stunning individual display - netting all four goals for the Gunners to deliver a serious blow to Liverpool's title ambitions.Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal (5 February 2011)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cheick Tiote scored a sensational late equaliser for NewcastleArsenal were 4-0 up at and cruising at half-time as they looked to chase down league leaders Manchester United. However, Abou Diaby was then sent off for the Gunners as Newcastle produced a stunning comeback to earn an improbable draw - with Cheick Tiote's thumping 87th-minute strike clinching the point.Newcastle 5-0 Man Utd (20 October 1996)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Philippe Albert (right) scored a superb chip to round off Newcastle's 5-0 win With Manchester United having beaten Newcastle to the title the previous season, this felt like payback for Kevin Keegan and his players, who had also suffered a 4-0 reverse to Sir Alex Ferguson's side at Wembley in the Charity Shield just weeks earlier.Tottenham 3-5 Man Utd (29 September 2001)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, David Beckham scored Manchester United's fifth goalManchester United staged a magnificent comeback from 3-0 down at the break to overwhelm Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Dean Richards, Les Ferdinand and Christian Ziege all scored for the hosts but a transformed United hit back through Andy Cole, Laurent Blanc, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Juan Sebastian Veron and David Beckham.Man Utd 4-3 Man City (21 September 2009)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Michael Owen provided the decisive moment for the hosts late onMichael Owen's winner deep into stoppage time gave Manchester United a dramatic victory in a classic derby at Old Trafford.The moment prompted Ferguson to set off on an impromptu wild dance along the touchline, while City boss Mark Hughes - whose side had come from behind three times - questioned why the game had gone on for six added minutes rather than the four allocated.Leeds 4-3 Liverpool (4 November 2000)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mark Viduka scored all four goals for LeedsLiverpool had gone 2-0 up early on with goals from Sami Hyypia and Christian Ziege, but Mark Viduka scored either side of half-time to drag Leeds level.Vladimir Smicer restored Liverpool's advantage, before two goals in three minutes from former Celtic forward Viduka secured an incredible win for the hosts.Crystal Palace 3-3 Liverpool (5 May 2014)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Crystal Palace's late show had huge implications in the title raceTitle-chasing Liverpool had just lost to Chelsea at Anfield, but looked set to power themselves back into the race when they took a commanding 3-0 lead at Selhurst Park.But they squandered that advantage in a chaotic final 11 minutes, leaving Luis Suarez in tears at the final whistle. Man City went on to win the league by two points. Arsenal 3-2 Man Utd (9 November 1997)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, This was another Arsenal v Manchester United match packed with incidentA tight pitch, a packed Highbury and another compelling contest between two of English football's heavyweights. The Gunners went two goals up courtesy of Nicolas Anelka and Patrick Vieira only for the champions to draw level thanks to two Teddy Sheringham efforts. But in a season when Arsene Wenger's side were to wrestle the title away from Manchester, David Platt scored the winner. Everton 3-2 Wimbledon (7 May 1994)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Everton have not been relegated from the top flight since 1950-51Everton are one of only six sides that have never been relegated from the Premier League, but they were on the brink at 2-0 down to Wimbledon in the first 20 minutes of the final day of the 1993-94 season.However, a Graham Stuart double helped the Toffees preserve their stay in the top division, with his winner coming in the 81st minute, which kick-started jubilant scenes at Goodison Park.Arsenal 2-4 Man Utd (1 February 2005)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, There were fireworks in the Highbury tunnel before play even got under wayMost people will remember this game because of the fiery exchange between captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane in the tunnel before the game, but the 90 minutes itself were just as thrilling.Vieira opened the scoring for Arsenal before they were pegged back by an Ashley Cole own goal. Another Gunners legend, Dennis Bergkamp, helped the hosts retake the lead before two goals from a young Cristiano Ronaldo and a delightful John O'Shea chip stunned Arsene Wenger's side.Chelsea 2-2 Tottenham (2 May 2016)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chelsea supporters enjoyed dashing the title hopes of their London rivals TottenhamA match that meant most for a side that wasn't involved - the day that Leicester City were crowned champions will go down in footballing history.Two first-half goals from Harry Kane and Heung-min Son gave Tottenham hope of chasing the Foxes down at the business end of the season. But Gary Cahill and Eden Hazard scored to get Jamie Vardy and his Leicester team-mates' party started as tempers flared in the second half of a match dubbed the 'Battle of the Bridge'.Man Utd v Bournemouth (15 December 2025)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Eli Junior Kroupi's goal rounded off a thrilling evening at Old TraffordManchester United and Bournemouth played out the latest Premier League classic at Old Trafford. The hosts led three times and thought they had won the game when they scored twice in 129 seconds to turn a 3-2 deficit into a 4-3 advantage. But Eli Junior Kroupi's strike in the 84th minute pegged Ruben Amorim's side back once again as both sides had to settle for a share of the spoils.",

    "body": "58 minutes agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterReutersNegotiations over a technology deal between the UK and US have stalled due to stumbling blocks in wider trade negotiations between the two sides.The Technology Prosperity Deal - which was billed as \"historic\" when it was unveiled during US President Donald Trump's state visit in September - saw both countries pledge to co-operate in areas such as AI.However, talks on the agreement are now being held up because of US concerns about what it considers to be wider UK trade barriers.A government spokesperson said \"our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the Tech Prosperity Deal delivers opportunity for hardworking people in both countries\".The New York Times - which first reported the story - said there were \"broader disagreements\" between the two sides, including over digital regulations and food safety rules.The UK government did not comment on these specific claims. The White House has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.When the deal was announced the government was keen to highlight the benefits it said it would bring.\"This Tech Prosperity Deal marks a generational step change in our relationship with the US, shaping the futures of millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic,\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said in a statement.Technology secretary Liz Kendall said the partnership would \"transform lives across Britain\" and was a \"vote of confidence in Britain's booming AI sector.\"At the same time the deal was revealed, a series of US tech firms announced a flurry of investment in the UK.A total of £31bn in planned spending was set out by tech giants including Microsoft, Nvidia and Google.It is believed those investment plans are unaffected.Google, Microsoft and Nvidia have also been approached for comment, but the firms have not yet responded to the BBC.Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said in September his company's UK investment reflected his belief it could become an \"AI superpower\" - an ambition championed by Sir Keir's government.",

    "body": "The UK needs \"more people being ready to fight for their country\" as the nation seeks to deter a potential confrontation with Russia, the head of the military has said.Chief of the Defence Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton said \"a whole-of-society response\" was needed, including an increase in regular forces, cadets and reserves. He also called for more school leavers and graduates to join the defence industry. While the chief of the defence staff suggested there was only a remote chance of a direct Russian attack on the UK, he told an event at the Royal United Services Institute that so-called hybrid attacks showed the threat was worsening. Sir Richard said: \"Sons and daughters. Colleagues. Veterans will all have a role to play. To build. To serve. And if necessary, to fight.\"And more families will know what sacrifice for our nation means.\"The chief of defence staff referenced a Russian spy ship that was recently suspected of mapping undersea cables near UK waters.\"Every day the UK is subject to an onslaught of cyber-attacks from Russia and we know that Russian agents are seeking to conduct sabotage and have killed on our shores,\" he added.At the same time, Russia's military had become a \"hard power [which] is growing quickly\".While Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine had been a strategic failure, he said, \"we should be under no illusions that Russia has a massive, increasingly technically sophisticated, and now highly combat-experienced military\".Sir Richard, who became chief of the defence staff in September, said the UK needed to make itself a \"harder target\" for hybrid threats and to avoid war.Building the nation's resilience went beyond strengthening the military, and included harnessing the UK's universities, energy and manufacturing industries, and the NHS.It also meant building industrial capacity \"to meet the demands in the UK and of our allies to re-stock and re-arm\".\"Building this industrial capacity also means we need more people who leave schools and universities to join that industry.\"He said that \"we need defence and political leaders to explain the importance of the industry to the nation, and we need schools and parents to encourage children and young adults to take up careers in the industry\".Addressing a skills gap highlighted in a recent report by the Royal Academy of Engineering, Sir Richard also talked about the need to work with industry and young people, announcing £50m for new defence technical excellence colleges.In recent weeks, both France and Germany have outlined plans for voluntary national service.Last year, the then-Conservative government set out its own compulsory proposals, which Labour dismissed as a gimmick.Sir Richard said he found himself in a position none of his predecessors had \"looking at the prospect of the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War\".The government announced earlier this year that UK defence and security spending would rise to 5% of GDP by 2035 at the latest.",

    "body": "8 hours agoPeter HoskinsBusiness reporterThree members of Ben & Jerry's independent board will no longer be eligible to serve in their roles, after the ice cream company introduced a new set of governance practices. These include a nine-year limit set on board members' terms. Chair Anuradha Mittal, who earlier said she had no plans to resign under pressure, is among those affected.The move was criticised by the company's co-founder Ben Cohen, who called it a \"blatant power grab designed to strip the board of legal authority and independence\".His remarks are the latest in a long-running row between Ben and Jerry's and its owner over the Cherry Garcia maker's social activism and the continued independence of its board.The BBC understands that Ms Mittal will leave the company immediately, while board members Mr Dodson and Ms Henderson will go at the end of this year.\"Anuradha Mittal, Daryn Dodson, and Jennifer Henderson have served this company with integrity and courage. Over many years, they helped the board make bold, often difficult decisions to uphold Ben & Jerry's social mission,\" said Mr Cohen.Ben & Jerry's said the move is aimed \"to preserve and enhance the brand's historical social mission and safeguard its essential integrity.\"The Vermont-based firm is now owned by The Magnum Ice Cream Company, after a spinoff from Unilever last week that created the world's largest standalone ice cream maker.A spokesperson for Magnum said the firm wanted to build and strengthen Ben & Jerry's \"powerful, non-partisan values-based position in the world\".But Ben & Jerry's would be destroyed as a brand if it remains with Magnum, Mr Cohen told the BBC.Ben & Jerry's was sold to Unilever in 2000 in a deal which allowed it to retain an independent board and the right to make decisions about its social mission.Since the sale there have been deepening clashes between the Vermont-based brand and Unilever, with this conflict now inherited by Magnum.In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel, resulting in its Israeli operation being sold by Unilever to a local licensee.Co-founder Jerry Greenfield left Ben & Jerry's in September after almost half a century at the firm, deepening a dispute with parent company Unilever.In a letter shared on social media by Mr Cohen, Mr Greenfield said Ben & Jerry's had lost its independence after Unilever put a halt to its social activism.",

    "body": "11 hours agoEmily HoltHope JezzardHope Jezzard's phobia of hospitals was so intense that it seemed inconceivable she would ever work in one. Now, Hope is a midwife who helps mothers overcome their fears.Hospital phobia, or nosocomephobia, is one of a number of recognised anxiety disorders commonly associated with traumatic childhood experiences.Hope told BBC Radio 5 Live that her mum was in and out of the hospital during her childhood.  \"She nearly died twice and was put on life support. I had to leave her behind and although I knew she was being helped, it felt like I was being separated from her.\"When Hope entered her teens and early twenties, any routine appointment would set her heart racing, she says.\"It manifested as feeling very anxious, panicky, being very triggered by smells and noises in hospitals,\" she says.John Hawker, a psychotherapist who helps people deal with phobias, says a fear of hospitals is \"quite common\", often begins in childhood and is triggered by sights, smells and sounds.\"Perhaps when somebody was six weeks old, they were given an injection, and the memory of that injection was the smell of surgical spirit,\" he says.\"A bit of their brain was triggered by the smell of surgical spirit, and it doesn't matter how much logic that you tried to use to overcome that; they still don't want to walk into the hospital,\" he says. 'The first few shifts were terrifying'Hope JezzardHope during her training to become a midwifeWhen Hope, who is from Warwickshire, had to go to hospital appointments during her pregnancies and for the births of her two children, she says the support she received from her midwives inspired her to think about pursuing the same career.At first her hospital phobia made the idea seem impossible but \"over time the desire to try and help people trumped my fear,\" she says.She left her job in a coffee shop to study for a degree in Midwifery at Coventry University.\"Going into a hospital was a massive challenge. I had avoided clinical settings for years. The first few shifts were terrifying,\" she says. \"But over time, I became more comfortable.\"She credits talking therapy with helping her work through the negative associations she had with hospitals.\"One of the tools I was given was the idea of the compassionate self - treating yourself in the same way you would a friend if they said to you 'I'm terrified to go into a hospital'.\"You might say 'can I come with you, can I hold your hand, would you like to talk beforehand or talk while it's happening?\"She also advised writing down a \"stream of consciousness\" when feeling overwhelmed by fear.\"Don't try and make sense of it or punctuate it or even make it legible it can be as simple as 'I'm scared I'm going to die'. You can throw it away or keep it and come back to it,\" she says.Tips to cope with a fear of hospitalsWrite down your fears - putting them on to paper can give you perspectiveTake someone with you - a trusted person may help you to relaxTell hospital staff - They will be better equipped to help you if they know Tell your GP - They may refer you to an expert in behavioural therapy, such as a psychologistTalking therapy - You can self-refer to this NHS serviceKim BlackKim now helps other people dealing with their fear of hospitals. Kim Black says she was \"absolutely frozen\" by her fear of hospitals after being diagnosed with hip dysplasia aged four. She says she developed paediatric medical traumatic stress following multiple surgeries.\"I would do anything not to go to the hospital, anything, I would just completely disassociate or avoid it altogether,\" she says.\"I once went to hospital actually dragging my leg behind me and I couldn't lift it up because that was how long I waited to go.\"Kim now helps people to overcome their hospital phobias and build confidence after major surgery.\"Something that I do with my work is actually help prepare people to advocate for themselves and set up good boundaries when they go in,\" she says.She says it helps her to \"get ahead of spiralling thoughts\" by writing them down. \"When I get to the hospital, I speak directly to whoever comes up to me and I tell them straight away, this is what I'm dealing with.\"Mr Hawker says it is possible to combat a fear of hospitals through numerous therapies aimed at helping people detach from distressing memories without having to relive trauma. \"Hopefully overcoming that phobic response will allow somebody to feel much more empowered when they walk into a medical situation,\" he says.Hope says putting herself in the environment that made her frightened for short periods gradually helped her to get used to hospitals.\"Now I'm a midwife and there are moments when I just want to run out of there but I've turned a very negative experience as a child into a very positive way to help people as an adult.\"Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "3 hours agoMark SavageMusic CorrespondentReutersLizzo said the fat-shaming claims had \"haunted\" her for the last two yearsPop star Lizzo is celebrating a legal victory after a judge dismissed allegations of fat-shaming from a 2023 lawsuit filed by three of her former dancers.The singer, whose hits include body positive anthems such as Good As Hell and Juice, marked the development with a video statement posted to her Instagram and TikTok feeds.\"There was no evidence that I fired them because they gained weight,\" Lizzo said. \"They were fired for taking a private recording of me without my consent and sending it off to ex-employees.\"While those specific allegations have been dropped, the case against Lizzo and her production company will continue, over claims that three dancers were subject to sexual harassment.Lizzo's team has called the lawsuit a \"fabricated sob story,\" but a Los Angeles judge ruled that the case could move forward last year.Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams and Noelle Rodriguez say they were pressured into attending sex shows and interacting with nude performers between 2021 and 2023.The claims against Lizzo - whose real name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson - include that she \"pressured Ms Davis to touch the breasts\" of a dancer in a nightclub in Amsterdam.Although she initially resisted, Ms Davis eventually acquiesced, \"fearing it may harm her future on the team\" if she didn't do so, according to court documents.Other incidents cited in the case include the claim that dancers were asked to eat fruit from the naked bodies of sex club workers.Over the summer, Lizzo's lawyers appealed the decision to let those claims got to trial, arguing that group outings were part of the singer's creative process and thus should be shielded by First Amendment free speech protections. In response, a lawyer for the dancers rejected that claim, saying it was not enough to say the sex shows had inspired Lizzo's own performances.\"Under that standard,\" wrote Ari Stiller, \"Johnny Cash could shoot 'a man in Reno just to watch him die' and claim protection if he hoped it would inspire his performance\".Stiller urged the court to allow the claims to proceed to trial.Getty ImagesLizzo said she had worked to celebrate people with larger bodies throughout her career (none of the dancers pictured are thought to be part of the current lawsuit)Lizzo's attorney, Melissa Glass, claimed that Stiller's brief \"regurgitates the false accusations from their [original] complaint\".\"As was true two years ago, the dancers cannot find a single person to corroborate their meritless claims,\" Glass said in a statement to Billboard magazine. \"In contrast, 18 witnesses who worked with Lizzo on the Special tour submitted sworn statements refuting the claims made by Davis, Williams and Rodriguez. We look forward to the Court of Appeals ruling on this matter.\"Lizzo has adamantly denied the allegations against her.\"I am very open with my sexuality and expressing myself but I cannot accept or allow people to use that openness to make me out to be something I am not,\" she said when the claims first emerged in 2023.In her latest statement, the singer added that the fat-shaming allegations had \"haunted\" her for the last two years, adding that it had been \"devastating to suffer through this in silence\". She also stressed that she has \"only encouraged and supported people with bigger bodies and shared my platform with them.\"Thanking her lawyers, Lizzo said she intended to keep fighting the lawsuit. \"I am not settling,\" she said. \"I will be fighting every single claim until the truth is out.",

    "body": "Australia's Prime Minister has visited Bondi hero Ahmed al Ahmed in hospital, after the bystander tried to disarm one of the gunmen in the nation's deadliest gun attack since 1996. \"Your heart is strong\", PM Anthony Albanese told the father-of-two, later calling him \"the best of our country\".The fruit shop owner, who was born and raised in Syria, was shot several times in the shoulder after tackling one of the alleged gunmen. Albanese said Mr Ahmed would \"undergo further surgery\" on Wednesday.At least 15 people have been confirmed dead after Sunday's attack in Sydney during an event to mark the first night of Hanukkah.Police have declared the attack as a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.\"He was trying to get a cup of coffee and found himself at a moment where people were being shot in front of him,\" Albanese said after the bedside visit. \"He decided to take action, and his bravery is an inspiration for all Australians. He is a very humble man.\"\"At a moment where we have seen evil perpetrated, he shines out as an example of the strength of humanity,\" the prime minister added. \"We are a brave country. Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"He later added: \"Ahmed, you are an Australian hero.\"There has been nationwide support for the 43-year-old including from US President Donald Trump who commended his courage, and a US billionaire who donated $99,999 (US$ 65,000; £49,000) to Mr Ahmed, calling him a \"brave hero\".In the footage, Mr Ahmed is seen hiding behind a parked car before he leaps out.He runs at the alleged gunman and seizes his weapon, before turning the gun round on him. The suspected attacker then begins to retreat.Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the  attackers.Mr Ahmed's father previously told the BBC that his son was driven to act by his \"sentiment, conscience and humanity\".He \"saw the victims, the blood, women and children lying on the street, and then acted\".",

    "body": "56 minutes agoDominic Hughes and Catherine SnowdonBBC NewsGetty ImagesPeople needing urgent dental treatment and patients requiring complex care will be prioritised under government plans to improve access to NHS dentists in England. The proposals could mean a saving of £225 for patients requiring numerous appointments for complicated treatments.For years, many patients have found it increasingly hard to find a dentist, with some towns in England referred to as \"dental deserts\", with no access to NHS dentists at all.The British Dental Association (BDA) said that without more funding and real reform, the plans wouldn't solve current issues.Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, health minister Stephen Kinnock said the plans were intended to \"prioritise\" urgent care.He said there was \"a lot of unnecessary routine care going on\" in NHS dentistry services at the moment. If a patient has \"good oral health\" he said they don't need to see a dentist \"more than about once every two years\".He said the current practice of most patients being offered NHS check-ups every six months was \"not the right use\" of dentists' time, and added that it was \"sucking up a lot of money in NHS dentistry\".Under the current system, which dates back to 2006, dentists are paid for what are called Units of Dental Activity, known as UDAs.Different procedures - fillings, extractions and more complicated work - are assigned a different number of UDAs.Dentists who provide NHS care have a contract that says how many UDAs they will carry out each year and are paid accordingly.But this has meant that more money was available to dentists for carrying out simple check-ups, rather than spending longer with patients who needed more complex, time-consuming care.For years dentists have been complaining that the contract for NHS work fails to cover the costs of what they're being asked to carry out.As a result many dentists have been walking away from NHS work – meaning it's increasingly hard for people to access care. There are parts of the country where there is simply no access to NHS dentistry. 'Chronic underfunding'Under the government plans, there would be new incentives for dentists to offer longer-term treatments for major issues such as gum disease and tooth decay through the NHS. Currently, a patient with tooth decay in several teeth or severe gum disease - both of which require complex treatment - would need to be treated over multiple appointments, which is costly and time consuming.But under proposed changes to the dental contract for NHS work, dental practices would be able to offer patients a single comprehensive package of treatment over a longer period, tailored to their needs. And ministers argue that this could save a patient up to £225 in fees. Shiv Pabary, chair of the BDA's General Dental Practice Committee said \"a dental crisis\" had come about directly as a result of the contract put in place in 2006. \"The reforms announced today are trying to tweak a system that's broken.\"He added that until the \"chronic underfunding\" and wider systemic problems were addressed, NHS dentistry would continue to fail to work for \"dentists and for patients\".\"To try and deliver comprehensive care within the same budget that we have at the moment is going to be hugely challenging.\"Mr Kinnock said the government had a \"massive issue to fix\" in dental care and was negotiating with the BDA on a \"radical overhaul\" of the NHS dentistry contract.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS President Donald Trump has repeated his criticism of Rob Reiner - after his earlier remarks about the killed Hollywood director, a longtime Trump critic, sparked widespread condemnation.The US president told reporters the director was \"very bad for our country\", having earlier written on Truth Social that Reiner's death was linked to \"Trump derangement syndrome\" - a term he often uses to describe his critics.Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner were found dead at their Los Angeles home on Sunday, and police have arrested their son Nick on suspicion of murder.They have not suggested any motive in the case, or any evidence that Reiner's politics and criticism of Trump played any role.In his social media post, which called the couple's deaths \"very sad\", Trump criticised Reiner, saying: \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump.\"Those comments were widely criticised, including by prominent Republicans.Kentucky representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who has clashed with Trump since the president returned to the White House in January, wrote on X: \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.\"He added: \"I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was once a staunch supporter of Trump before recently becoming a frequent critic, said that \"this is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies\" and that the murders should be \"met with empathy\".Multiple other senior members of Trump's party appeared to distance themselves from the remarks. Senator John Kennedy, a Republican representing Louisiana, said he thought Trump should not have made the comments.\"I think a wise man once said nothing. Why? Because he was a wise man,\" Kennedy said. \"I think President Trump should have said nothing. I think when the president says these sorts of things, it detracts from his policy achievements.\"Reiner was a lifelong Democrat and prominent liberal activist, and frequently spoke out against Trump.In 2017, for example, he called Trump \"mentally unfit\" for office. And as recently as October, Reiner said he believed Trump was ushering in an age of \"full-on autocracy\" in the US.Hours after his social media post, Trump repeated his thoughts on Reiner in comments given in the Oval Office to reporters, describing the director as a \"deranged person\" who was partly \"behind\" previous claims of collusion between Russia and Trump's team.\"I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape or form,\" he said.Trump has in the past criticised political foes after their death.Following the death of Arizona Senator John McCain - with whom he clashed regularly - in 2019, for example, Trump said he \"was never a fan\" and \"never will be\".In another incident the same year, Trump quipped that the late Democratic lawmaker John Dingell could be \"looking up\" at him from the grave, a comment which was widely interpreted as a suggestion that Dingell was in hell.In a statement following the remarks about Dingell, the White House said that the president was \"just riffing\".Reiner, who was 78, was known for directing several iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, Misery and A Few Good Men.He married Michele, an actress, photographer and producer, in 1989, later recalling that they met during the making of one of his best-known films, When Harry Met Sally. The couple had three children together - including Nick, 32.Michele, 68, owned the Reiner Light photography agency and production house.",

    "body": "1 hour agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterThousands of drivers could have speeding fines cancelled after a fault saw some cameras falsely triggered on English A roads and motorways.National Highways said it had found 2,650 wrongful speed camera activations since 2021 due to a delay between cameras and variable speed signs.Affected drivers will be contacted by police and be reimbursed for any fines while points will be removed from their licences where needed.Not all camera activations are enforced, so not all of the wrongful activations will have resulted in fines.National Highways apologised for the error.\"Safety is our number one priority,\" said chief executive Nick Harris.\"All drivers should continue observing the posted speed limits as normal. Anyone who has been impacted will be contacted by the relevant police force.\"The agency said a temporary fix had been rolled out, providing an extra layer of data from the cameras to police forces so they can filter out any faulty captures.But the agency gave no clear timeline as to when a permanent fix would be in place.National Highways, which runs England's motorways, blamed an \"anomaly\" in how variable speed cameras were interacting with signs on some A roads and motorways.It meant a delay of around 10 seconds between cameras and relevant variable speed signs, meaning some drivers were incorrectly identified as speeding after the limit had changed. So on a road where the speed limit increases, a driver may see a sign saying 60mph, but the camera recording it may still be working on the basis of a previous 40mph speed limit.National Highways said the 2,650 incidents since 2021 represent fewer than two each day, compared with more than six million activations of speed cameras on the affected roads over the same period. It said the anomaly has impacted 10% of England's motorways and major A roads.The fault affects 154 cameras out of a total of 400 across the entire motorway network - all of the variable speed cameras on smart motorways, and a section of the A14 between Huntingdon and Cambridge plus the A1 approach junction to the A14.National Highways is working with police to check activations and promised nobody would now be wrongly prosecuted.Meanwhile, police forces have stopped issuing fines from variable cameras until they have confidence in their accuracy.A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"We apologise to anyone who has been affected. Safety was never compromised, and we are working with policing to ensure nobody is incorrectly prosecuted in future.\"Enforcement is still in place, and the public can remain confident that only motorists who break the rules will be penalised.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoMary McCoolBBC ScotlandAdrian HuntMurdered police detective Ross Hunt and his wife Marjory were childhood sweetheartsThe family of a police detective who was murdered more than 40 years ago while protecting fellow officers are urging the UK government to formally recognise his bravery.Ross Hunt, a detective sergeant in the CID, was attempting to catch a violent knife criminal when he was attacked by three members of the same family in a South Lanarkshire housing estate in June 1983.He was pinned to the ground, beaten with poles and stabbed repeatedly while warning his junior colleagues to retreat to their police cars.DS Hunt's family have tried to have him honoured posthumously, but a five-year time bar means their requests for a medal have been repeatedly refused.They are seeking either the George Medal, the Kings Commendation for Bravery or the Kings Gallantry Medal.DS Hunt's son, Adrian Hunt - who was an 18-year-old police cadet at the time of his father's murder - called the matter \"bureaucracy gone mad\".\"My family have gone through the mill over the years,\" Mr Hunt said. \"There's this intransigence which I don't think there has to be.\"If this had been done at the time, it would have been a significant statement for the family.\"A man lived his life, and was then murdered - he was only months from his 30-year service. We've got a lot of people here who still remember it.\"'Frenzied attack'DS Hunt had been called to an assault in a pub in Larkhall - a teenager, suspected of slashing a man in the back, had fled the scene.The detective identified the suspect and decided to go to his home to arrest him.Mr Hunt, 60, told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme how a \"whole host\" of family members came out of the property armed with poles, knives and sticks and attacked DS Hunt and his three detective constables.\"My father corralled his men back shouting 'Get back to the car' and at that point he was overcome by one of the individuals who sat astride him and began stabbing him, kicking him, punching him – one kick even lifted his body into the air according to witnesses. \"It was just a frenzied attack.\"By the time officers were able to get back-up on the scene, DS Hunt was lying badly injured in the street. He was taken to hospital, but his son believes he was dead on arrival.DS Hunt, aged 56, was nine months away from retirement.Following a trial at the Glasgow High Court, three members of the family - two men and a woman - were convicted of his murder.Adrian HuntDS Hunt with his second eldest son PhilipThe family saw DS Hunt's body lying in an operating theatre in the aftermath of the attack - Mr Hunt described his father as \"stabbed, bruised, beaten and swollen\".It was a brutal and traumatic experience that would leave an indelible mark on the family for years to come. At the time, they did not request a posthumous honour.In fact Mr Hunt, who went on to become a police sergeant like his father, says he was told by police senior management that the death did not merit a bravery award.\"For a few years following his death we really couldn't discuss it,\" Mr Hunt said. \"We were relatively young and trying to move forward with our own lives, but we were still dealing with this legacy.\"We had no way of understanding the protocols at the time, especially way back then.\"Adrian HuntAdrian Hunt was an 18-year-old police cadet when he heard of his father's murderMr Hunt says he and his brothers were only able to contemplate the possibility of a medal when their mother Marjory died in 2013, aged 79.Despite multiple requests, as well as letters to previous foreign and home secretaries, the Hunt family have been refused any bravery award.The UK government's Cabinet Office are responsible for granting honours, decorations and medals through a series of committees.But those committees do not consider applications for incidents that took place more than five years ago because of a policy introduced after the Second World War. They were most recently turned down in October when Mr Hunt wrote again to Downing Street.But their efforts continue, as they run a joint campaign with the family of George Taylor - another officer murdered in the line of duty - to have the rule changed.In 2023 Police Scotland issued their own Chief Constable's Bravery Award to DS Hunt, which was accepted by Mr Hunt and his brother.Adrian HuntAdrian Hunt (right) accepted the award with his brother from former Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain LivingstoneAt the time Mr Livingstone credited DS Hunt for saving the lives of his fellow officers, and for demonstrating \"selfless courage and public service\". The Lanarkshire Police Historical Society have also taken up the campaign to have DS Hunt's \"selfless actions\" recognised nationally.Mr Hunt believes that ultimately, the UK government policy is outdated.\"It just takes someone to grab this by the scruff of the neck and deal with this in the manner that it should be,\" he said. \"As a family, we will never fully realise complete closure but we will take a real comfort and be immensely proud that my father's legacy is properly recognised by the state and will live on in perpetuity.\"The UK government said the five-year time bar on awards was an \"important principle to ensure that awards are timely and clearly linked to specific activities\".",

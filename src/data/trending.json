    "body": "16 hours agoRuth CleggSenior health reporter BBCBack in the 1990s, Alan Reeves would regularly perform on stage, stripping off to thousands as a member of The Dreamboys. He was so sought after that he, along with his troupe of male dancers, popped up in the Spice Girls film, Spice World.The then 24-year-old was, by his own admission, \"a bit of a pin up\".But by the time Reeves was in his 30s, he found himself in a very different situation — his mood was low and his libido had virtually disappeared.\"I just didn't feel right,\" he says.Reeves, now aged 52, says his lack of a sex drive began to have a detrimental impact on his long-term relationship.\"We were going without sex for three, four months at a time. I just wasn't interested,\" he says.\"This kind of thing can cause couples to break up.\"Fragile Films/ Icon Entertainment International/ Polygram Filmed EntertainmentGeri Halliwell and Alan Reeves in the Spice Girls film, Spice WorldNow a fitness and lifestyle coach based in London, Reeves began testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and says it has given him his libido back, turning him \"from a grumpy old man\" to feeling like he's back in his 20s. It just \"felt phenomenal\" he says.And women too are turning to testosterone.Rachel Mason, a 37‑year‑old menopause blogger, says the hormone has been \"amazing\" for her energy levels, concentration, and libido.Prescriptions for testosterone have surged. The latest data from the NHS Business Authority, compiled by the Care Quality Commission, shows that prescribing rose by 135% between 2021 and 2024.This increase comes at a time when sex drive across the UK appears to be waning. According to the National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), which questions more than 10,000 people roughly each decade with new figures due out later this year, the frequency of sex has steadily declined.In 1990, people aged 16 to 44 reported having sex an average of five times a month. By 2000, that had dropped to four times, and by 2010, to three. The next set of results are due later this year, and researchers expect the downward trend to continue — though they do not point to a singular reason for the decline.Against this backdrop, a debate is gathering pace. Can boosting testosterone improve libido, or is much of the attention solely hype, profit, and placebo?Diminishing sex driveAlan Reeves' experience of declining libido is just one example of a trend researchers say is becoming increasingly common.\"Over the years, we have noticed a drop across every demographic,\" says Soazig Clifton, Natsal academic director.\"There are fewer cohabiting couples than there were in the 90s, for example, so that could help explain the reduction in sex drive, but even when we looked specifically at that group, there was a decrease.\"In fact, some of the steepest declines in sexual frequency were among older, married or cohabiting couples.Clifton says it is difficult to say conclusively why sex drive seems to be declining.\"No data we have so far can really tell us with any confidence why, as a population, we are no longer having sex as much,\" she says.There are several studies which try to understand the reason, highlighting that the digital world could be a major factor, making it harder to switch off, as well as offering more choices of things to do.Our stress levels are also generally higher than they were 30 years ago, which may be a factor, says Dr Ben Davis, a GP and sex therapist.\"People have so much going on,\" he explains, \"There's tech obviously, but there's also an increase in stress, depression, loneliness […] all of these will add to a reduction in sex drives.\"And there is another possibility that has generated lots of interest online and become big business —  that low testosterone levels could be having an impact on sex drive.\"Testosterone levels in men are definitely reducing,\" says Prof Geoffrey Hackett, consultant urologist and member of the British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM).\"The rise in obesity, type 2 diabetes, the increasing number of people leading more sedentary lives — all of these reduce testosterone levels. And declining testosterone levels will be a factor in why our sex drive is diminishing.\"Several large-scale studies over the past 20 years which have measured levels in men, suggest that testosterone levels have dropped, but Hackett stresses that the picture is nuanced — having low testosterone does increase the likelihood of a low libido, but that does not mean that everyone with low testosterone will have a low sex drive.Despite this complexity, tube stations, bus stops and social media feeds are now festooned with adverts like: Low libido? Brain fog? Tired? Time to get a testosterone check! Has your man lost his spark? It might be his hormones!So, can testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) really offer a cure‑all for low libido?Testosterone 'gave me my life back'Melissa Green has been taking testosterone for nearly a year. She says it not only gave \"her zest for life\" back – it saved her marriage.The 43-year-old says her low sex drive was having a huge impact on their relationship.Being perimenopausal, her GP had already prescribed her oestrogen and progesterone through hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but Green says the GP would not test her testosterone levels, saying she did not need that extra hormone.The NHS says it follows guidance from the National Institute of Care Excellence which states that testosterone should only be considered for women following a trial of HRT and all other factors which explain low sexual desire have been excluded. Those with concerns should speak to their GP, they add.Eventually, Green went to a private clinic, had blood tests done, and was told her levels were low. After taking her results back to her GP, she now receives some testosterone on the NHS, and a small top up through a private prescription.\"It's given me my life back. In some ways, I feel like I'm back in my 20s,\" she says, \"I've got more energy, I feel sharper, and my sex drive has come back.\"Melissa GreenMelissa Green and her husband, MarcusWhile some are effusive about the impact testosterone has on libido, others say it has had less welcome effects.Cheryl O'Malley was on testosterone for a year. She says while it may have helped return some of the energy she had lost during the menopause, it also boosted her sex drive too much, and left her with feelings of intense rage.\"I was really horny. I wanted to have sex with my husband, but at the same time I hated him.\"That's when you know this is not a good place to be, this was not me, I felt out of control.\"Rachel Mason says when she posts about TRT she finds \"many women are so scared to start testosterone, they worry they will become manly, develop facial hair, lose themselves.\"Rachel Mason @raysecommunityRachel Mason says testosterone has been \"amazing\" for her Mason says she has a \"particularly hairy part\" of her wrist where she applies her testosterone gel on a daily basis, but that the benefits she gets from the hormone are worth it.Along with increased body hair, TRT can come with a range of other side effects. For women, the most common effects are excess hair growth, acne and weight gain, which are usually reversible with reduction in dosage or discontinuation. Alopecia and deepening of the voice are rare with testosterone replacement.For men, it can cause side effects such as weight gain, painful and prolonged erections, male pattern baldness and mood swings. It can also lead to lower sperm production which can impact fertility. There are treatments that can help, but medical advice is recommended.'It's a gravy train'Some NHS GPs and secondary care consultants have told the BBC that private clinics are profiteering by selling TRT as a quick fix to a complicated problem.Dr Paula Briggs, an NHS consultant in sexual and reproductive health, describes it as a \"gravy train\" where people end up paying a lot of money for something they do not need.\"It's out of control,\" she says. \"The wellbeing industry has created this gap in the market they're using to their advantage.\"It's abusive.\"Private clinics, however, say they are improving people's lives by offering a service that the NHS is failing to provide.Jeff Foster, an NHS GP and medical director at Voy, a multi-million pound clinic specialising in men's health, says the private sector is filling a gap in care.\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone.\"TRT is offered via the NHS with most clinics functioning under either endocrinology or urology.Michael Kocsis has been offering TRT through his company, Balance My Hormones, since 2016. He says that he's seen demand grow \"exponentially\" over the past few years.Kocsis says some of his patients have gone through the NHS to be tested, and been told they do not have low levels of testosterone, so have decided to go private.\"Just because their level of testosterone might be a bit higher than the threshold set by the NHS, does not mean that TRT can't help them.\"It's not black and white, it's more nuanced than that.\"AFP via Getty Images\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone,\" says Jeff Foster, a medical director at VoyFor men, testosterone starts to decrease by around 1% from the age of 30 to 40. NHS advice states that this is a normal part of ageing and is unlikely to affect libido.Alan Reeves initially received TRT on the NHS. Two tests showed levels of 10nmol/L (nanomoles per litre) and 12nmol/L, and he was given a course of four injections, three weeks apart. But after his fourth treatment, Reeves was told it could no longer continue, \"without much of an explanation.\"\"I was back to square one,\" he explains. \"That's when I decided to go private.\"Alan Reeves @coachalreevesAlan Reeves is now a fitness and lifestyle coachSo, what is a healthy testosterone level for men? It differs depending on which organisation you ask and which study you read.Guidelines from the BSSM, which have been interpreted from major international studies, suggest that men with less than 12nmol/L, should be considered for TRT and will probably be showing symptoms of hypogonadism — a condition where the testes are not producing enough of this vital sex hormone.NHS guidance differs between trusts, but it states that a man with levels below 6 to 8nmol/L may have testosterone deficiency.For women, testosterone starts to decrease between the ages of 20 and 40 before it plateaus as they enter menopause. It's normal for levels to go down, but the question is how much that reduction has an impact on sex drive and overall wellbeing.There are tests available, but it's difficult to take accurate readings because, while testosterone is also vital for women, the amount needed is a lot less. And even if it is prescribed, it has to be given a \"off-label\" as there is currently no licensed treatments for women available on the NHS.More from InDepthBriggs is wary of the buzz around TRT. She says she has seen a huge surge in patients telling her they need testosterone because they feel low and not in the mood for sex anymore.\"They tell me they've done their research. Often that means they have seen the life changing impact this hormone has had on someone posting about it on social media.\"Just because it works for a celeb does not mean it works for the general population.\"She says GPs in her local area, Cheshire and Merseyside, are inundated with patients asking for testosterone checks. There are many, she says, that will leave with a TRT prescription, only to come back a few months later and say it's had very little impact.While it does help some people, she says, the proportion of those who say they need testosterone, and who will actually benefit from it, is small. Clinical evidence so far when it comes to women, suggests that TRT is only effective for treating those who are postmenopausal with low libido.Briggs says advertising by private clinics has \"blown everything out of proportion.\"\"I'm not against TRT when it's needed, what I am against is seeing it so over-promoted.\"GP Ben Davis also warns that TRT can have a placebo effect, leaving patients sometimes taking and paying for medication privately, that they do not need.Cheryl O'Malley has stopped taking testosterone. She says the intense anger and heightened sexual arousal she experienced during treatment have subsided, and her libido has returned to a level that feels comfortable for her.\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it,\" she says.'It's not a silver bullet'\"For some, medication can be really transformative,\" Davis says, but he adds that it is more than just handing out medication.\"GPs might not have time to discuss with a patient what is behind their low sex drive, could it be their relationship with their partner, could it be how they view themselves, could it be the sex they are currently having is longer turning them on?\"He says that there are so many factors that play into a low libido and testosterone is not the only answer.Cheryl O'Malley\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it [testosterone],\" says Cheryl O'Malley Alan Reeves, however, has been on TRT for seven years now and is prescribed testosterone by the private clinic, Balance My Hormones. He says his life has dramatically improved.\"My libido came back, so much so at first, I wanted sex every night for 10 nights.\"But now that's calmed down and I am just in a good place.\"Nonetheless, Reeves believes \"it is not a silver bullet\" and there is no point in taking testosterone without making other changes to your lifestyle.Otherwise, he says, it's like putting a Ferrari engine in a \"clapped out car\".\"I walk… taller now, that's partly down to testosterone, partly down to me.\"Additional reporting: Nat WrightTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Alpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (13:15-15:15)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in Tuesday's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Before them (09:15-11:15) the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.The first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "8 hours agoJoe PikePolitical correspondent, Gorton and DentonBBCLongsight, in the Gorton and Denton constituency, where campaigning is in full swingSir Keir Starmer's grip on power is weak and while the PM has consolidated his position after Labour's leader in Scotland called for him to quit, there are dangers lurking in the weeks ahead.May's Scottish, Welsh and local elections are the moment many Labour MPs predict Sir Keir could be challenged if results are bad for the party.But a contest in a south-east corner of Greater Manchester - the Gorton and Denton by-election - is taking place at the end of this month and could be just as perilous for the PM.Labour won more than half the vote here just 18 months ago, but since then MP Andrew Gwynne was suspended after offensive text messages he had sent were published and he has now resigned from parliament.The region's mayor Andy Burnham saw this contest as an opportunity - a route back to Westminster and perhaps even the Labour leadership. But Burnham was blocked by Keir Starmer and Labour's ruling committee.Instead, local councillor Angeliki Stogia has been selected as the Labour candidate. Labour candidate Angeliki Stogia is a local councillorShe moved to Manchester from Greece 30 years ago, and tells me she wants to win to stop what she calls the \"division\" offered by Reform UK.We meet in a park and sit under a cafe's gazebo to escape the rain. Like some of the other candidates I speak to, Stogia is fizzing with nervous energy.The relentless pace and scrutiny of a by-election with hustings, media appearances and hours of door-knocking is unlike any other political campaign.It takes a few times of me asking to get clarity over whether Stogia thinks Starmer is a good prime minister - she does.He has yet to visit the campaign and when I ask if he's on Stogia's leaflets, it sounds like he's not. \"I am at the heart of my leaflets,\" she insists.Reform UK's Matt Goodwin is an academic turned GB News presenterReform UK have taken over an industrial unit in the corner of a business park to be its campaign headquarters.Once you get past the security guard on the door, a cavernous space is revealed. There is an enormous union flag, piles of leaflets, and images of Nigel Farage alongside the party's candidate Matt Goodwin.Once a professor who studied right-wing politicians, Goodwin has now been tempted to try and become one. He is also a columnist and presenter on GB News.He argues that Labour has taken voters here for granted and has strong opinions on immigration and integration.When I raise his comments in a recent blog that \"Trump is right. Europe is facing civilizational erasure\", Goodwin shoots back: \"Do you not have concerns about the direction of Europe? … We have very real problems with the pace of change in Western nations.\"The name Gorton and Denton really doesn't sum up this slightly bodged-together assortment of communities, which also includes Levenshulme, and Burnage - once the home of Oasis's Gallagher brothers.Green Hannah Spencer is a councillor - and a qualified plumberThere are up-and-coming streets with nice cafes and grocery shops but also places where units are shuttered. Relative child poverty here is twice the national UK average.Political scientist Rob Ford describes the seat as \"a tale of two Manchesters on opposite edges of Labour's unravelling electoral coalition\".One side of this oddly-shaped constituency is home to lots of university students and graduates and the population is 40% Muslim. The other part of the constituency is 83% white, with many in low-paying jobs.Lots of people I speak to complain about littering and fly-tipping. Some seem pretty vulnerable.One man I met at a cafe said he didn't want to be interviewed, but explained he was in his twenties, unemployed and living with his grandparents. He said his dad was in prison and mum was a drug user. He asked for reassurance that things would work out for him.Gaza's future remains an important issue for the Green Party and Palestinian flags are emblazoned on a lot of their leaflets.The Greens are optimistic about their chances of taking the seat.Their candidate, Hannah Spencer, was more than an hour late to meet us after getting stuck in traffic on the way back from a plastering course. She is already a qualified plumber.I asked her about comments she made online a few years ago that she was \"glad\" to move out of the area and that it was full of \"money laundering takeaways\".Spencer responds matter-of-factly: \"Like a lot of people, it's taken me a while to become proud of the places I've lived. I've struggled a lot in the years that I was here... I think that's the feeling that a lot of people share.\"Tory hopeful Charlotte Cadden is a former police officerFormer police officer Charlotte Cadden is the Conservative candidate. She used to lead the team that helps protect MPs. Now she wants to be one.Although her party came second here in the 2019 election, they were pushed into fifth place in 2024.Can she actually win? \"I'm not ruling anything out,\" Cadden says. \"I have got 30 years in policing, I've worked in this area. I live here… It might be overambitious, but I think we're going to do very well.\"A lot has changed since Labour's solid victory here in 2024. And the fact the result here seems so unpredictable is evidence of the precariousness of the PM's position.",

    "body": "Delivery van 'stuck on deadliest mudflat footpath'39 minutes agoNeve Gordon-FarleighYour SouthendA delivery van appeared to be stuck on mudflats, which locals described as the \"deadliest footpath in Britain\".HM Coastguard Southend said it was called out to reports on Sunday of an Amazon delivery vehicle on The Broomway, at Great Wakering, Essex, after the driver had been following a GPS route to Foulness Island.The Broomway is a route across flat sands from the shore near Southend-on-Sea to Foulness Island and is home to a Ministry of Defence firing range. Amazon said it was \"aware\" of the situation and was \"investigating\".The route, said to be 600 years old covering six miles (10km), is managed by Qinetiq - a global defence and security company - which describes the area as a \"unique right of way which requires both caution and specialist knowledge to negotiate safely\". However, the route is not for vehicles, and people are advised to only walk there accompanied by a guide who knows the mudflats.According to parish council records, 100 people have died on The Broomway, with the last known death in 1919.Jodie Halford/BBCThe vehicle is expected to be removed from The Broomway on Sunday afternoonThe coastguard said it had spoken to a Qinetiq security officer who said the incident had taken place on Saturday evening and that the driver had \"removed themselves from the van and reported the incident to Amazon\". It said the vehicle had already been there during high tide and that, alongside a farmer, Amazon arranged to remove the vehicle on Sunday. Coastguard officers were stood down from the incident after the occupants of the van were confirmed to be safe and the vehicle was due to be removed. More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoJoel Gunter, in JerusalemandFiona NimoniGettyHamas and Israel have both repeatedly accused each other of breaching a ceasefire agreement Eleven Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza on Sunday morning, according to Palestinian civil defence and health officials.The IDF said it had struck terror targets in response to ceasefire violations by Hamas, and that militants had been killed after emerging from a tunnel into the area of the strip controlled by the Israeli military.The Palestinian Red Crescent said a strike on a tent encampment in northern Gaza killed at least six people, while another strike in the south of the strip killed five.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations of a fragile ceasefire agreement since it took effect on 10 October.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has said at least 600 people have been killed since the ceasefire went into effect. The latest strikes came as the preparations continued for the implementation of the second phase of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement. Last month, US President Donald Trump announced a new body called the Board of Peace, which has a mandate from the United Nations Security Council to establish an international force tasked with securing border areas in Gaza, and overseeing the disarmament of Hamas. The board, which was due to have its first meeting in Washington on 19 February, will also oversee the formation of a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza and post-war reconstruction.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.Elsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Washington on Wednesday to meet US President Donald Trump, where they discussed ways to curb Iran's nuclear programme - which Tehran has always insisted is for purely civilian purposes. Netanyahu was expected to press Trump to pursue an agreement that would halt Iran's uranium enrichment, as well as cutting its ballistic missile programme. However, Trump later said there was \"nothing definitive reached\" and that talks with Iran would continue. More on this story ",

    "body": "Gender pay gap won't close for another 30 years, warns trade unions group46 minutes agoJosh MartinPA MediaThe gender pay gap is prominent even in industries where women make up the majority of employees, such as health and social careMoves to close the gender pay gap will not be successful until 2056 if progress remains at its current rate, according to the Trades Union Congress (TUC).The disparity between average wages for men and women is 12.8%, or £2,548 per year, according to TUC analysis of official pay data. It is widest in the finance and insurance industry, at 27.2%. In the leisure service sector it was only 1.5%.The gender pay gap measures the difference in salaries paid to men and women in the same industries. Employers with more than 250 UK staff must report pay data.The government said it was \"tackling the root causes of the gender pay gap and backing women to succeed at work\".Even in industries where woman make up a majority of the workforce, such as education and health and social care, the gender pay gaps are 17% and 12.8%, respectively.Pay disparity between genders meant that the average woman employee \"effectively works for 47 days of the year for free,\" the TUC said.\"Women have effectively been working for free for the first month and a half of the year compared to men,\" TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said.\"With the cost of living still biting hard, women simply can't afford to keep losing out. They deserve their fair share\".Nowak pointed to the recent Employment Rights Act as a \"an important step forward for pay parity\" but said the government needed to increase access to paid parental leave so \"mums and dads can better share care\".The gender pay gap is widest for workers aged 50-59, which the group of unions argues is partly due to the long-term effects of women pausing or reducing their career ambitions and pay to prioritise caring responsibilities.The TUC, the national federation of trade unions, wants improved access to flexible working and better access to childcare in order to help close the gap.Throughout the debate around increasing worker rights under the Employment Rights Act business groups argued that increased benefits and leave provisions would increase their costs and reduce their willingness to hire staff.\"The cost of doing business is already leading to firms cutting jobs. With major changes to employment laws coming down the line, the government must be extra careful not to add to those pressures,\" said Matthew Percival, the Future of Work and Skills Director at business group the CBI.Employers will soon have to publish plans for how they plan to reduce the gender pay gap.A government spokesperson said: \"Combined with changes to flexible working, stronger protections for expectant and new mothers, and wider action to review parental leave and to expand childcare entitlements, we are tackling the root causes of the gender pay gap and backing women to succeed at work.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoFiona NimoniandParham Ghobadi,BBC PersianAFP via Getty ImagesPolice in Munich estimated that 250,000 turned out to see listen to Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's former leader, give an addressHundreds of thousands of people took part in demonstrations around the world against the Iranian government on Saturday, following calls from the exiled son of the late shah for a \"global day of action\".Addressing an estimated 250,000 people in Munich, Reza Pahlavi - who has called for the overthrow of Iran's Islamic regime - denounced a crackdown on recent protests there.Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto saw the largest crowds, with smaller protests in cities including Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Sydney and London.Activists say more than 6,000 people were killed after joining nationwide protests in Iran against the rising cost of living and the government. Thousands more deaths are being investigated.Pahlavi told the crowd: \"My first message is to our brave and fighting compatriots inside the country: know that you are not alone, and today the world stands with you in this struggle.\"Criticising Iran's leadership, he said: \"In contrast to this corrupt, repressive, child-killing regime, you represent a great culture and civilisation, and in a free Iran of tomorrow you will prove to the world what a great nation we are.\"EPAReza Pahlavi and his wife Yasmine Pahlavi in Munich on Saturday Pahlavi's daughter, Noor Pahlavi, addressed a crowd in Los Angeles. The BBC's US partner CBS News reported her as saying Iranians had \"never been this close to freeing up themselves from this Islamic regime\". She called on US President Donald Trump to end ongoing nuclear talks with Iran's leadership, describing it as \"negotiation with murderers\". On Friday, Trump told reporters a change in Iran's government would be the \"best thing that could happen\", though it was unclear whether his comments were in reference to Pahlavi, who is seeking a role in Iran. Trump told news agency Reuters last month that Pahlavi seemed \"very nice\" but expressed uncertainty over whether he could muster enough support within Iran to eventually lead it.Andolu via Getty ImagesThe largest rally was held in Toronto, where an estimated 350,000 people turned out to protestLightRocket via Getty ImagesPeople gathered to protest across the world, including in LondonIn Toronto, where an estimated 350,000 joined a demonstration, participants told BBC Persian they were there to speak out on behalf of friends and family inside Iran.Street protests broke out in Iran on 28 December, initially sparked by economic turmoil and fuelled by long-running discontent with the country's leaders.Demonstrations spread to more than 100 cities and towns across all of Iran's provinces. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has confirmed the deaths of 6,872 protesters, including more than 150 children.Many demonstrators in Iran have chanted Pahlavi's name and called for his return to political leadership.Groomed from birth to inherit the throne, Pahlavi was 18 years old when the 1979 Islamic revolution swept away his father's monarchy.Almost 50 years later, Pahlavi is once again seeking to shape his country's future.But critics question whether his vision for Iran would ultimately lead to a democracy.More on this story ",

Dumfries and Galloway Council also approved a community asset transfer in 2019, which paved the way to realise its \"inclusive community vision\".Stories you may have missedThe report recognised the park for its strong community engagement, sensory‑rich play and accessibility.Now its model for \"small‑scale, high‑impact transformation\" could be replicated across the world.Dr Andrzej Zieleniec is chairman of Include Us, which runs the park. He said the recognition was very welcome.\"I think it is amazing that a wee park in Dumfries has come to the attention and been recognised in such a prestigious report,\" he said.\"Being featured in this report positions Catherine Street Inclusive Park as a significant contribution to global thinking on inclusive urban design.\"It demonstrates how local, community‑driven initiatives can inform international policy and practice.\"Include UsSites in Jakarta, Barcelona and Nairobi were highlighted alongside Dumfries in the reportThe park is close to Dumfries town centre, across from its main library and Dumfries AcademyDevelopment manager, Lisa Callander-Bone, said they were \"honoured\" to feature in the report.\"It demonstrates that when communities come together with purpose and imagination, we can create places that change lives, not just here in Dumfries, but as part of a wider global story about inclusion, equity and children's rights,\" she said.\"This accolade is for all who have supported our inclusion vision.\"",

The 18-year-old student turned to BookTok - a community of book lovers on TikTok - in her bid to reduce her screentime. She is not the only young person to spend hours glued to her screen - statistics suggest 18 to 24-year-olds average six hours and 20 minutes online every day. And less than a third of young Scots say they enjoy reading in their spare time. But could social media trends like BookTok persuade them to put down their phones, and pick up a book instead? BookTok is a TikTok community where users share book reviews, recommendations, and literature-themed content such as \"what would Lizzy Bennet wear?\"It is especially popular for genres like romance, young adult fiction and \"romantasy,\" often turning older books into sudden bestsellers.Some of the most popular BookTok videos have more than eight million interactions.Rebecca Yarros has found success with books including Onyx Storm, part of her Empyrean series which is currently being adapted for TV.Meanwhile, Sarah J. Maas has developed a cult following, particularly for A Court of Thorns and Roses.Amy LairdAmy has made reading a regular habit since finding BookTokAmy felt she was spending so much time on her phone, she was missing out on real life experiences. \"I was averaging about seven hours a day and thought I'm experiencing life through this device where reality is being curated for me,\" she told BBC News.Since turning to BookTok, she has made reading a regular habit.\"On average, I'd say I read every other day, even if it's just 10 pages of a novel per night,\" she said.\"My favourite books are Pride and Prejudice, The Handmaid's Tale and Gone With the Wind.\"Some BookTok videos have racked up eight million \"likes\"UK adults spend four hours and 30 minutes online each day, according to a 2025 report by Ofcom - 10 minutes more than in 2024.People aged 18 to 24 were found to be most active online, averaging six hours and 20 minutes daily.A study by the National Literacy Trust found that in Scotland only three in 10 people from the age of eight to 18 enjoyed reading in their free time and  one in six read daily in their free time.Isabella Potamitis BriozzoIsabella reads for hours before she goes to bedBookTok helped decrease screen time for 19‑year‑old student Isabella Potamitis Briozzo.\"I usually read for two to two-and-a-half hours before I go to bed,\" she said. \"And if I have any spare time I try to read as much as I can.\"Isabella discovered her favourite series - The Caraval by Stephanie Garber - through BookTok and \"just got addicted immediately\".\"Some of my favourite books come from BookTok,\" she said. \"Usually over the holidays, I tend to go days where I just read and that's all I do, it's just something that helps me relax,\" she added.James GreenJames like to use BookTok to get summaries of booksJames Green, a 20-year-old student at Manchester Metropolitan University, has recently being diagnosed with ADHD.He recognises that his attention difficulties exist without social media, but believes platforms like BookTok can genuinely help rebuild reading habits. \"It definitely helped me and inspired me to read more,\" he said.  \"It actually helped me put down my phone, because it made me want to read a lot more.\"He added: \"Short form content is helpful in giving a useful but concise insight into different books, which is why it is a good way to form a reading habit\"Meanwhile Caroline Cronjaeger, a 25-year-old student, is writing her dissertation on Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway - a book she found on YouTube.\"I read quite a lot, from two to three hours day,\" she said.\"Even more if I have a lot of free time and a really good book in my hands.\"Mrs Dalloway is also the reason why I chose to study English literature.\"",

    "body": "Children 'weaponised' by both sides of trans debate, Cass says9 hours agoLaura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergDr Hilary Cass is the author of a major review into the treatment of children and young people questioning their genderChildren have been \"weaponised\" by both sides of a toxic debate about transgender rights, the author of a government review into the treatment of children and young people questioning their gender has said.Dr Hilary Cass told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg \"people at the extremes\" had caused \"quite a lot of distress for young people\".She also suggested \"unrealistic images and expectations on social media\" had misled children, and that if some young people had \"taken more time\" they might not have pursued medical treatments.Her 2024 review found gender medicine had been operating on \"shaky foundations\" when it came to evidence for medical treatment.In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, she said there was a \"lack of realism about what transition would really mean and how hard it would be\" - pointing to \"quite intensive medical treatments\" and \"sometimes quite brutal surgeries\".She added: \"There are a tiny number of people who will never be comfortable with their biological sex, with the gender associated with their biological sex.\"And for them, a medical pathway is the only way they're going to live their life comfortably. And we don't understand why that is, but we have to try and help those people thrive as much as the young people who are going to grow out of this.\"The review was commissioned after concerns about the treatment of growing numbers of children and young people with worries about their gender, particularly at the Tavistock Clinic in LondonWhen asked how many children with distress about their gender would experience that same distress into adulthood, Cass said it was impossible to assess precisely, but it would be a \"really tiny number\".The paediatrician added: \"When the clinic started, there were about 50 children a year in the UK, and then by the time I started my review it had shot up to 3,500 a year. \"We tried very hard to find out from the Tavistock what happened to the ones who didn't go on medical pathway. They just didn't follow them up and they didn't have that data. \"So that's one chunk of children who don't go on a medical pathway, then there are all the ones that me and parents and teachers will tell you about who go through two or three years of gender questioning and then desist.\" Asked if children had been let down by an adult-led debate, Cass said \"absolutely\", adding they \"were also caught up in all the issues about single-sex spaces and sports and safe areas for women which were actually not to do with the children but they were somehow part of a football within it\".\"That's a real shame that children have been weaponised.\"The vast majority of people in the middle of the debate were silent while the \"people at the extremes\" and rhetoric in the media had been \"frightening for young people,\" the clinician said.She added that some activists for trans rights had been \"so strident that it's made it more difficult for trans people themselves who are just trying to live under the radar\", while equally people who had taken the view no-one should ever transition had \"similarly made it difficult\".Cass, who praised the government's guidance for schools in England published earlier this week, said it was important for there to be caution about very young children beginning the transitioning process because \"if they socially transition too early we think they can get locked onto a trajectory that may not have been the correct natural trajectory for them\".Asked about why the number of children and young people who have gender dysphoria is increasing, Cass said it was \"complex\" but there was a different cultural context, with people \"less locked into gender stereotypes\". \"I think what has kind of misled children is the belief that if you are not a typical girl, if you like playing with trucks, or boys who like dressing up or that you have same-sex attraction that means that you're trans and actually it's not like that but those are all normal variations,\" she said.\"I think children and young people were being given a narrative that it's not okay to be anything but absolutely typical of the other girls on Instagram.\"Cass also said it was \"vital\" that a controversial trial of puberty blockers for under-16s went ahead, or \"we're going to have ongoing charlatans just handing out inappropriate drugs\", pointing to the private sale of the drugs - particularly online.Puberty blockers - which suppress the hormones that cause puberty - are often prescribed to children questioning their gender as a way of stopping physical changes such as breast development or facial hair.They were banned for under-18s after the Cass review raised concerns about their safety, but a clinical trial to assess their safety was announced last year.Campaigners have questioned the ethics of it, while the charity Stonewall said it was \"vitally important\" that all LGBTQ+ people have access to high-quality, evidence-based and timely healthcare.Cass denied that she had stopped young people and families getting the help they needed, saying the new centres would make sure people had \"individualised treatment\".\"The biggest hurdle at the moment is they are still working through the big backlog,\" she said.",

    "body": "'Fast-spreading' measles outbreak hits several schools in London47 minutes agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesHealth experts warn measles spreads very easily and can cause serious health complicationsAt least 34 children have been infected by a \"fast-spreading\" measles outbreak in several north London schools, health officials have said.The cases from Enfield were confirmed in laboratory tests in January, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported.A local GP surgery said one in five children who contracted the illness had been admitted to hospital, all of whom \"had not been fully immunised\".Families have been urged to ensure their children are up to date with their immunisations against the highly contagious disease, which can cause serious health complications.They are free.Enfield's NHS Ordnance Unity Centre For Health said on its website that there was a \"fast-spreading measles outbreak in several schools\" across the borough.It said infections had been confirmed in \"at least\" seven schools in Enfield and neighbouring Haringey.Enfield Councillor Alev Cazimoglu said the current outbreak had \"mainly affected children and some have required additional care with a short stay in hospital\".She added: \"Vaccination is the most effective way to protect yourself and your family. We urge everyone who is not fully vaccinated to act now.\"Enfield Council said it was was working closely with the UKHSA, the NHS and local partners to limit further spread in accordance with national public health guidance.Dr Vanessa Saliba from the UKHSA said the \"big\" outbreak was \"mostly affecting unvaccinated children under 10 in schools and nurseries\".She said: \"Measles is a nasty illness for any child, but for some it can lead to long term complications and tragically death, but is so easily preventable with two doses of the MMRV [measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox] vaccine.\"Children who had missed doses should \"catch up as soon as possible\" to protect themselves and other children who are too young to be vaccinated or unable to do so for health reasons, she added.Dr Saliba also urged those travelling abroad over the Easter holidays to check their vaccination status because \"measles is widespread in some countries with close links to the UK, and there are ongoing outbreaks in parts of Europe\".Measles cases have been rising in the UK and in parts of the globe, with the increase blamed in part on poor uptake of the vaccine.In Enfield, UKHSA figures published last August showed that just 64.3% of five year olds had received both doses of the MMR vaccine in 2024/25 - one of the lowest rates in the country. Meanwhile across the UK as a whole, stats showed that 84.4% of children received two MMR doses by their fifth birthday. The recommended figure is 95%. The figure was 84.5% in 2023-24, down from a high of 88.8% reached in 2014-15.In January, the World Health Organization announced the UK had lost its measles elimination status following outbreaks in 2024.What is measles and what are the symptoms?Measles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes or by touching things that someone with measles has coughed or sneezed on.high feversore, red and watery eyescoughingsneezingSmall white spots may appear inside the mouth.A blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically behind the ears and on the face, before spreading.The rash may be harder to detect on brown and black skin.",

    "body": "'Trump will be gone in three years': Top Democrats try to reassure Europe47 minutes agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent,  in Mar-a-LagoEPAGavin Newsom, Democratic governor of California, told attendees that \"Donald Trump is temporary\"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was the centre of attention at the Munich Security Summit, as European leaders wondered apprehensively what tone he would strike in his remarks on Saturday. While his speech did not fully allay their concerns, it has been viewed as a reassurance to allies that while US relations may have frayed under Donald Trump, they will not break.Rubio's was not the only American political voice at the security summit, however. And even if the secretary of state's remarks had not been so well-received – if he had sharply criticised Europeans the way Vice-President JD Vance did at the conference last year – there were other American politicians doing their best impression of the Persian poet, counselling: \"This too shall pass\".\"If there's nothing else I can communicate today,\" California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a conference event on Friday, \"Donald Trump is temporary. He'll be gone in three years.\"Newsom was just one of dozens of American legislators and governors in attendance – including some Democrats, like the Californian, who may contend for their party's 2028 presidential nomination.ReutersNew York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the biggest attractions at the conferenceMany emphasised that the US would continue to be a strong partner with Europe – lines similar to those offered by Rubio, but unleavened by his criticism of cultural decline on the continent.\"The reason we're here is to provide reassurance that we understand how important our European allies are,\" Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire said.A Republican in attendance, Senator Thom Tillis, echoed her, noting that the US and Europe were not in a \"civil war\". He cautioned American allies not to get caught up in the \"rhetoric of American politics\".That has been easier said than done recently, as Trump has imposed steep tariffs on many US trading partners, and he and some of his top aides have been blunt in their desire to reshape the international order, use American military power and refocus American foreign policy on the western hemisphere.The president's designs on Greenland – which he repeated before departing the White House for a weekend in Florida on Friday – have been only the most jarring example of the shift in the American outlook.Trump's willingness to push boundaries and test the limits of his power has not been limited to foreign affairs. And several Democrats took time in Munich to address more domestic concerns.Virginia Senator Mark Warner warned that the president's talk of nationalising elections and instituting stringent identity requirements for voting via executive order mean the freedom and fairness of November's midterm congressional elections are at stake.\"I never thought I would say that in 2026 America,\" he said.Trump has defended his effort – and the SAVE act, which would implement a national voter identification requirement legislatively – as both popular with a sizable majority of Americans and necessary to prevent voter impersonation at the ballot box.Senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin, who were the focus of a recent unsuccessful indictment attempt by the Department of Justice for their video urging US soldiers to disregard \"illegal\" orders, both commented on being in the administration's spotlight.America, Slotkin said, was \"going through something profound\", before adding, \"We'll get through it.\"ReutersSenator Mark Kelly of Arizona spoke at the Munich Security ConferenceCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proved to be one of the biggest attractions at the conference beyond Rubio. She drew a line between growing wealth inequality – a focus of her domestic policy agenda since she won an upset victory in Congress in 2018 - and the rise of authoritarian governments.\"It is of the utmost urgency that we get our economic houses in order and deliver material gains for the working class,\" she said. \"Otherwise, we will fall into a more isolated world governed by authoritarians who also do not deliver to working people.\"Ocasio-Cortez was another of the Democrats who may have presidential ambitions. And while her appearance could build her foreign policy experience, it also underlined some of the risks associated with stepping out onto the international stage. At one point, she struggled to answer whether the US should defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.While Ocasio-Cortez comes from a different wing of the Democratic Party, her view about the need for Western democracies to provide a compelling alternative to authoritarian governments was similar to one expressed by Joe Biden during his presidency.Trump, with his \"America First\" foreign policy and talk of preserving Western culture, provided a decidedly different view of world affairs. And in 2024, a plurality of Americans voted to return Trump to the White House, setting off a tumultuous year in which Vance's confrontational Munich speech was just the scene-setter.While Rubio has smoothed over some rough edges, the Democrats who made the trip to Munich attempted to provide a more distinct counterpoint.\"Right now, Europe just wants us to be better, right? And I think this has been a very good conference to reassure nerves,\" Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego said. \"Sometimes you have to remind them that this is not all Trump... We're still here.\"",

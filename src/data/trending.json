    "body": "3 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesL-R: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sarah Ferguson and Ehud BarakThe list of some of the world's most rich and powerful people with ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has lengthened, after the US government released millions of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier.There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing. Many people who have featured in previous releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Here is a list of some of the people mentioned in the latest release. Elon MuskThe documents include email correspondence between Epstein and tech billionaire Elon Musk over travel plans Epstein appeared to be arranging, although Musk has said he has never visited Epstein's private island. In November 2012, Musk wrote in one email: \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In another, from December the same year, he wrote:  \"I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose\", adding that a \"peaceful island experience\" is the opposite of what he's wanting.Response: Musk responded in an X post in January, acknowledging that the emails might be used to \"smear my name\", but said he was more concerned about the prosecution of \"those who committed serious crimes with Epstein\". Bill GatesTwo emails from 18 July 2013 are written as though drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they are genuine or were ever sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates \"to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls\".In an interview with NPR, his ex-wife Melinda said the release of the documents brought up memories of their marital struggles.\"I'm able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, my God, how did that happen to those girls?\" she said.\"At least for me, I've been able to move on in life, and I hope there's some justice for those now-women.\"Response: A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: \"These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.\"Donald TrumpThe US president is mentioned hundreds of times in the newly released files, including a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line. Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence.The list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures.Response: Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorPhotographs appearing to show Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground have also been included in the latest Epstein files release.In two of the images, the former prince is seen touching the person, who is unidentified and fully clothed, on her stomach. Another image shows him staring directly at the camera.No context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken.Response: BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.US Department of JusticeAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoingRichard BransonRichard Branson's name appears hundreds of times in the files. In one 2013 exchange, Epstein thanks Branson for his recent hospitality and public relations advice, to which Branson replies that it was \"really nice\" seeing him, adding: \"Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!\"Virgin Group has clarified that \"harem\" referred to three adult members of Epstein's team. Response: In a statement to the BBC, Virgin Group said Branson's contact with Epstein was \"only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event\".The statement added: \"When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations.\"As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again. Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever – Richard believes that Epstein's actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims.\"Sarah Ferguson Sarah Ferguson, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife, who is invariably known as Fergie, appears to also be mentioned in multiple emails, including when Epstein was still under house arrest.An email from an account believed to belong to Epstein says: \"I think Fergie can now say, I am not a pedo.\"In another email exchange from April 2009 there is a request to meet Epstein for a \"quick cup of tea\", that includes the lines: \"My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you.\" Response: The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response.Lord MandelsonEpstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released in the files suggest, including to his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva. The Metropolitan Police has launched a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.In 2009, one year after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor, da Silva sent an email requesting \"anything you can help me with\". Epstein replied: \"I will wire your loan amount immediately\".A separate email exchange appears to show Epstein arranging a place for Mandelson to stay at one of his New York apartments, with Epstein writing, \"thrilled to host and sad I'm not there\".Response: Lord Mandelson has said he will step down from the House of Lords. On Sunday, Mandelson reiterated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\" and for continuing his association following Epstein's conviction. He has told the BBC he \"was never culpable or complicit in (Epstein's) crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death\". He has not responded to the allegations of leaking documents, but BBC understands that he maintains he did not act criminally and did not act for personal gain. He argues that he sought Epstein's expertise in the national interest during the 2008 global financial crisis.Steve Bannon The files also contain thousands of messages that appear to be sent between the late convicted sex offender and one of Trump's former top advisers, Steve Bannon.Most messages were sent in 2018 and 2019 after Bannon left his role in the first Trump White House, as he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death.One text exchange shows Bannon apparently strategising with Epstein on how to change the narrative around his past crimes, suggesting \"first we need to push back on the lies\" and \"rebuild your image as philanthropist\". Response: Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.Miroslav LajčákAn October 2018 text exchange between Miroslav Lajčák - who was serving as Slovakia's foreign minister at the time - and Epstein appeared to show the two messaging about girls and diplomacy. After Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: \"Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl.\"\"Who wouldn't,\" Epstein texts back. \"You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters.\"Response: Following the latest release of Epstein-related documents, Lajčák resigned from his current post as Slovakia's national security advisor. He is not accused of any wrongdoing.Watch: 'Do you think you're the devil himself?' Epstein questioned in newly released interviewHoward LutnickBillionaire businessman and US Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick planned a visit to Jeffrey Epstein's island Little Saint James with his family, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files' release.In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant on what appeared to be the eve of the visit: \"We are looking forward to visiting you\", and, \"We would love to join you for lunch\". Response: The Commerce Department said in a statement to the BBC that \"Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing\".Larry SummersLarry Summers, US President Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary and former Harvard University president, is also in the new documents, including references to meetings and dinners between Summers and Epstein.In emails from 2017, Summers and Epstein joked about Trump and criticised him during his first term. \"Your world does not understand how dumb he really is,\" Epstein said of Trump in one email to Summers.Response: After Summers was mentioned amid a batch of Epstein files released in November, he said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\" and resigned from multiple posts, including his role on the advisory board of OpenAI. Steve TischSteve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, is shown in the release of Epstein-related documents inquiring about a woman he met at Epstein's house.In one email exchange, Tisch asked whether the woman was a professional or a \"civilian\".In other exchanges, Epstein tells Tisch he had a \"present\" for him and described a woman he would introduce Tisch to as \"tahitian speaks mostly french, exotic\".Response: In a statement to CNN, Tisch said he and Epstein \"had a brief association\", adding that he \"did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island\".Brett RatnerThe director of the new documentary on First Lady Melania Trump also appeared in a photo embracing a young woman in the files.Brett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured.Response: There is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner's representative for comment.US Department of JusticeBrett Ratner is seen on the right here alongside Jeffrey Epstein and two women Peter AttiaThe anti-aging influencer and CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, exchanged hundreds of emails with Epstein, including crass comments, the latest documents release shows. In the emails, he wrote that his friendship with Epstein was something he could share publicly and included a discussion of the 2018 Miami Herald story that identified some of Epstein's victims.He also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex, emails show.Response: On 2 February, Attia made a statement on X rejecting that he was \"involved in any criminal activity\", adding that \" I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties\".Casey WassermanThe chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games sent flirty emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of Epstein.Casey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, show him saying: \"I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein.Response: Wasserman said in a statement: \"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light.\" Sergey BrinSergey Brin, co-founder of Google and one of the world's richest men, visited Epstein's private island and made plans to dine at Epstein's home in New York City, according to the documents released on Friday.He also corresponded with Ghislaine Maxwell, who wrote to Brin in April 2003: \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed\", and, \"Look forward to seeing you\". Response: The BBC has reached out to Google for comment. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing in the emails.Ehud BarakFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is mentioned in the newly released Epstein-related documents, showing they corresponded on multiple occasions after Epstein was convicted for sex crimes in Florida in 2008.One exchange shows plans for Barak to stay at Epstein's New York City residence in 2017. Response: Barak has acknowledged his regular interactions with Epstein but said he never observed or participated in any inappropriate behaviour or parties. Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky, the famed linguist, appeared in both releases of the Epstein files, and the latest tranche of documents suggests Chomsky advised Epstein on media coverage of sex trafficking allegations against him. In emails from February 2019, the disgraced financier asked Chomsky if he should \"defend myself\" or \"try to ignore\".A response that appears to be from Chomsky laments \"the horrible way\" Epstein was treated and the \"hysteria that has developed about abuse of women\".\"It's painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,\" the email said.Response: In a statement, Chomsky's wife and spokesperson, Valéria Chomsky, said that \"Epstein created a manipulative narrative about his case, which Noam, in good faith, believed in.\"\"It is now clear that it was all orchestrated, having as, at least, one of Epstein's intentions to try to have someone like Noam repairing Epstein's reputation by association,\" she said.\"Noam's criticism was never directed at the women's movement; on the contrary, he has always supported gender equity and women's rights.\"Brad KarpBrad Karp, the chairman of prestigious law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down from his role after the latest files showed dozens of apparent email exchanges between him and Epstein. One correspondence reportedly is said to show Karp discussing Epstein's pre-existing plea deal on sex trafficking charges.In an email sent in March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, a sender named Brad Karp said: \"The draft motion is in great shape.\" Bloomberg reported that this discussion related to Epstein's efforts to protect the 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors, in which he avoided federal charges, which could have seen him face life in prison. There is nothing in the emails to prove that they were in fact linked  to the plea deal.Response: Announcing his resignation in a company statement on Wednesday, Karp said: \"Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.\" The statement did not mention the Epstein files, and Karp has not commented since. The BBC has contacted Paul Weiss for further comment.Bill ClintonIn the justice department's first release of Epstein documents in December, several images showed former US President Bill Clinton, including a picture of him swimming in a pool, and another with him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was first arrested.Response:  A spokesman for Clinton, Angel Ureña, said on social media in December that photos released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) were decades old. \"They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be,\" he said.\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first,\" he said.In a post on social media, Clinton said that he had told Congress everything he knows. \"I have called for the full release of the Epstein files. I have provided a sworn statement of what I know,\" he said. \"And just this week, I've agreed to appear in person before the committee.\"Deepak ChopraThe files appear to reveal communication between Epstein and the self-help author Deepak Chopra years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from minors.In a February 2017 email, Chopra seemingly asks Epstein to come to Israel with him and an unnamed group.\"Come to Israel with us,\" Chopra says. \"Relax and have fun with interesting people. [if] you want use a fake name . Bring your girls. It will be fun to have you . Love\"In another apparent exchange a month later, the pair talk about God and cells of the human body before Chopra says: \"Cells are human constructs. No such thing ! Universe is human construct No such thing. Cute girls are aware when they make noise.\"Later in the discussion, Chopra adds: \"God is a construct. Cute girls are real.\"Epstein also asks the alternative medicine advocate: \"Did you find me a cute Israeli?\"Response: Since these emails emerged, Chopra has posted a statement online saying he was \"deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims in this case\" and denied his involvement in \"any criminal or exploitative conduct.\"\"Any contact I had was limited and unrelated to abusive activity. Some past email exchanges have surfaced that reflect poor judgment in tone. I regret that and understand how they read today, given what was publicly known at the time. My focus remains on supporting accountability, prevention, and efforts that protect and support survivors.\"The BBC has asked Chopra if in his dealings with Epstein, he was aware of any wrongdoing.",

    "body": "6 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentGetty ImagesA pay-off given to Lord Mandelson after he was sacked as ambassador to the US is being reviewed, UK Foreign Office sources have told the BBC.The review was instigated after fresh details emerged about the peer's contact with Jeffrey Epstein and a separate police investigation was initiated in the UK, they said.The Labour peer is thought to have been given a pay-off of up to £40,000 after he was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links with the late convicted sex offender.On Friday police searched two homes linked to Lord Mandelson after the latest release of files in the US indicated email exchanges with Epstein about fiscal policy. Lord Mandelson has not been arrested.Government sources confirmed that the Foreign Office reached a financial settlement with Lord Mandelson, but have not said how much this was for.However, he is believed to have been given an exit payment equivalent to three months' salary according to the Times. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"Peter Mandelson's civil service employment was terminated in accordance with legal advice and the terms and conditions of his employment.\"Normal civil services HR processes were followed. Further information will be provided to Parliament as part of the government response to the motion passed last week which is being co-ordinated by the cabinet office.\"While Lord Mandelson's salary as US ambassador has not been disclosed, the post typically has a salary of £155,000-£159,999. This would put a three months' pay-out at around £40,000.His association with Epstein - and the fact he remained in contact with the financier after the latter was convicted - was known at the time of his appointment in December 2024.However, the peer was sacked from the role after Downing Street said new information about the depth of this relationship had emerged - including emails showing he sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced charges for sex offences in 2008.Email exchanges in the latest US government release in January on Epstein included those while Lord Mandelson was a member of Gordon Brown's cabinet.Among them is one that indicates Lord Mandelson gave Epstein advance notice of a €500bn bailout by the EU to save the Euro in 2010.Another included a 2009 memo in which Brown's policy adviser Nick Butler wrote about the UK's struggling economy and recommended selling off government-held assets to raise public funds.The Metropolitan Police is currently investigating the peer over allegations of misconduct in public office.Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Hayley Sewart said enquiries were ongoing.\"This will be a complex investigation requiring a significant amount of further evidence gathering and analysis. It will take some time to do this work comprehensively and we will not be providing a running commentary.\"",

    "body": "23 hours agoHarriet Agerholm,BBC NewsandSimon LockUS Department of JusticeJeffrey Epstein and Peter Mandelson onboard a yacht in an unspecified locationLord Mandelson appears to have recommended a holiday home to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein with \"privacy\" to host his \"guests\", documents released by the US Department of Justice suggest.In an email to Epstein in 2010, he says he \"found you a great place to stay on the Amalfi coast\" offering \"privacy with accompanying rooms for your 'guests'\", according to documents in which Lord Mandelson's email address is redacted.Quote marks are used around the word \"guests\".A spokesperson for Lord Mandelson said he \"did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019\" and his lawyers said he had \"no recollection of this email, which was sent over 15 years ago\".BBC News and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism have identified Lord Mandelson as the sender of the email in part because his email address is partially visible despite the redaction.It is unclear which \"guests\" are being referred to and we have not determined if Epstein went on to stay in the accommodation.The email chain in the US government release is from 12 August 2010, the month after Epstein completed his 2008 sentence for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl in Florida.According to the document, Lord Mandelson tells Epstein he is due to arrive back in London from \"Myk\", later in August.\"Found you a great place to stay on the Amalfi coast near to Positano. Zeferelli [sic] home converted into beautiful suites and privacy with accompanying rooms for your 'guests',\" he writes in a message sent from his Blackberry, the document suggests.US Department of JusticeWhile the sender of the email is redacted in the published file, the black redaction box does not completely cover his email address in one reference on the chain.The correspondence is just one exchange between Lord Mandelson and Epstein revealed in the US Department of Justice releases that sheds new light on the friendship between the men.In other published emails from 2009, Lord Mandelson asks how they should celebrate Epstein's release from prison, to which the disgraced financier responds: \"With grace and modesty (those are the names of two strippers)\".A spokesperson for the peer said: \"Lord Mandelson regrets, and will regret until to his dying day, that he believed Epstein's lies about his criminality.\"Lord Mandelson did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019.\"He is profoundly sorry that powerless and vulnerable women and girls were not given the protection they deserved.\"Epstein died in a New York prison cell in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "19 minutes agoBBCThe continued fallout from the government's handling of the Peter Mandelson scandal dominates Sunday's papers. \"The relegation battle\" is the Observer's headline as it pictures the prime minister attending an Arsenal game on Saturday. The paper reports that Sir Keir Starmer is under pressure to replace his Downing Street team, and that donors are telling him that \"time is running out\".The Sunday Telegraph reports that Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy had previously warned the PM against appointing Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US. The paper says Lammy is the first cabinet minister to break openly with Sir Keir, writing that his \"future now hangs in the balance\".\"Get your act together\" is the message from a former home secretary to the prime minister on the front page of the Sunday Mirror. David Blunkett says Sir Keir \"must rise to the challenge\" and show that Labour is \"a party of service\".Lord Mandelson received a taxpayer-funded pay-off worth tens of thousands of pounds despite being sacked as ambassador to the US, according to the Sunday Times. The former ambassador is thought to have been given an exit payment of up to £40,000 after he was sacked in September last year. UK Foreign Office sources have told the BBC the pay-off is currently being reviewed.The Mail on Sunday has more details from the latest release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The paper cites emails that suggest the late sex offender had a private dinner with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor at Buckingham Palace accompanied by a young model. Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Epstein.The Sunday Express says the Red Arrows may use foreign-built jets for the first time  after government delays in picking a replacement plane.Actress Beverley Callard has revealed she was diagnosed with breast cancer just 20 minutes before the start of filming for a new show, the Daily Star reports.Finally, the Sun splashes its front page with the news that footballer Kyle Walker and his wife are expecting a fifth child together.According to the Sunday Telegraph, Sir Keir is said to be \"devastated\" and considering his future. The paper adds that the deputy prime minister, David Lammy, has let it be known that he had not been in favour of appointing Lord Mandelson as ambassador. The mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, tells the Observer that it would be a mistake to oust Sir Keir. \"Football is a 90-minute game\", he says, adding that \"you wouldn't dream of saying in the 35th minute because you're 2-0 down - we'll take all the players off and sack the manager\".The Mail on Sunday says it's unearthed emails that show Jeffrey Epstein took a Romanian model \"in her early 20s\" to a \"private dinner\" at Buckingham Palace with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. It says the former prince entertained Epstein and four women at the Palace while Queen Elizabeth II was away at Balmoral. Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing.The Sunday Express says the \"Red Arrows may use foreign built jets for the first time\". It says government \"dither and delay\" in picking a replacement for the aging British Hawk aircraft has \"tipped the balance to US firms\". A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence says \"no final procurement decisions have been made\".The Express also carries pictures of a 15-foot gold sculpture of President Donald Trump. It says the statue, dubbed \"Don Colossus\", was commissioned by \"cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and backers\" of the president, and depicts the moment he \"raised his fist after an assassination attempt\" in Pennsylvania in 2024. \"It's fools gold\" according to the Daily Star Sunday, which reports that the sculpture \"languishes unwanted in storage\" because the artist has not been paid in full.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "12 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykNurPhotoSuspected attacks on northern Italy's railway network have led to severe travel disruption in the region, the authorities say, as thousands gathered for the start of the Winter Olympic Games. Police reported three separate incidents involving damage to railway lines that they believe are connected to the Games. A fire hit rail infrastructure between Bologna and Venice, triggering delays of up to two-and-a-half hours, and police later found severed cables and an explosive device in locations nearby.The Ministry of Transport called the incidents an act of \"serious sabotage\", which they said mirrored vandalism during the Paris Olympics in 2024. Police said a track switch was set alight near Pesaro, on the Adriatic coast. Several hours later, police discovered severed electric cables near Bologna, along with a rudimentary explosive device left by a track nearby. Bologna's rail station is a major transport hub, linking cities in the north and south, and east to west lines. \"These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy's image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling and positive,\" said Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini. A police spokesperson earlier said that they were investigating the incidents and that no one had claimed responsibility. Salvini compared the events to the Paris Summer Olympics, when saboteurs damaged France's high speed rail network. \"There are similarities in action and timing to the French incident,\" he told AFP.Bologna's high speed, state-owned railway had to temporarily close, but traffic was returning to normal by Saturday afternoon. The opening ceremony of the Games took place on Friday evening in Milan, in Cortina in northeastern Italy and two other locations. Milan and Cortina are both reachable by train from Venice.Events are spread over hundreds of miles of northern Italy, in locations including the Alps and Dolomite mountains.",

Most of the warnings are located in the south-west and the Midlands. There is currently one flood warning in Scotland and none in Wales.The Met Office said on Thursday that rain had fallen every day of 2026 in south-west England and South Wales, with both areas seeing 50% more rainfall than usual.The UK was hit by a succession of three named storms in January, bringing heavy rain, strong winds and disruption.Flood warnings are clustered in Devon and Hampshire, as well as between Gloucester and Worcester. However, more than 230 flood alerts are scattered across much of England apart from the far north and East Anglia.Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service warned that flooding was \"imminent\" after \"heavy prolonged rainfall\" had caused local levels at the River Dene to rise.Rain is expected to continue falling throughout the weekend and into the start of the new week.Northern Ireland had its wettest January in 149 years, while County Down and Cornwall had the wettest January on record, according to the Met Office.February has also seen similarly intense rainfall.Provisional Met Office data shows some parts of the UK recorded more rainfall in the first five days of the month than it would normally expect over the course of the whole month.Aberdeenshire has been one of the wettest places of all, with Aboyne receiving over 130% of its normal February rainfall in just five days.Last week, Storm Chandra brought flooding and travel disruption, and saw dozens of schools close.It was the third named storm to batter the UK so far this year, after Ingrid and Goretti.",

    "body": "11 hours agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesFinancial crime prosecutors in France say they have opened a preliminary inquiry into former Culture Minister Jack Lang over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.Lang, a major figure in French socialist governments between the 1980s and 2000s, is being investigated for suspected \"laundering of tax fraud proceeds\". It follows the US Department of Justice's release of the Epstein files, which have documented links between the Lang family and the late American sex offender.Lang, now 86, denies wrongdoing and on Saturday described the allegations against him as \"baseless\". He told AFP the investigation \"will bring much light on to the accusations that are questioning my probity and my honour\".Hours after the investigation was announced, Lang offered to resign as head of the Arab World Institute, a body that promotes cooperation and exchanges between France and Arab nations.In a letter to Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, seen by AFP, Lang said he would submit his resignation at the next board meeting. Barrot, who had summoned Lang for talks on Sunday, said he had acknowledged the resignation offer and planned to start the process of looking for a successor. Lang's daughter Caroline, 64, is also being investigated in the case. Earlier this week she stepped down as head of a French film producers' union.On Tuesday, he told broadcaster BFMTV he had known nothing about Epstein's crimes when he met him \"some 15 years ago\". The US financier was convicted in Florida in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution.Lang - who served as culture minister between 1981 and 1993 and later as minister of education - says he was introduced to Epstein by US actor-director Woody Allen.He said he had found Epstein \"passionate about art, culture and cinema\".In a separate interview on Tuesday, he told RTL radio that Epstein had been \"generous\" and \"courteous\", adding: \"When I meet people I don't ask to see their criminal record.\"Details from the files revealed by French media suggest Lang appealed to Epstein for funds or favours on several occasions - including the use of Epstein's car and private plane for himself and his family.Caroline Lang told French news website Mediapart that she met Epstein in 2012, when he told her he wanted to \"invest in young French and international artists\".She said his lawyers had set up a company, Prytanee LLC, based in the US Virgin Islands. Mediapart said Caroline Lang had received half of the shares, but she said she had not invested in it or received any funds from it.An email in the Epstein files suggested she contributed her art knowledge, Mediapart reports. She told the website she had been \"incredibly naive\".Resigning from her post in the Independent Production Union, she said: \"I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union.\"The files do not suggest either Lang or his daughter were implicated in Epstein's sexual crimes.Epstein died in prison in New York in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.AFP via Getty ImagesLang (right) made his name in the 1980s, under the presidency of François Mitterrand (left)",

    "body": "6 hours agoAlicia CurryGetty ImagesKing Charles (left) will host Nigerian President Bola Tinubu (right) in MarchKing Charles III and Queen Camilla will host Nigeria's president in the country's first state visit to the UK in 37 years, Buckingham Palace has announced.Bola Tinubu and First Lady Oluremi Tinubu have accepted an invitation to be guests of the King at Windsor Castle from 18 to 19 March.State visits are considered a form of soft-power diplomacy, using the pomp of royal hospitality to strengthen relations with important international partners.The last Nigerian state visit to the UK took place in 1989, when military ruler Gen Ibrahim Babangida travelled to meet the late Queen Elizabeth II for a four-day trip.Tinubu and his wife were received at Buckingham Palace in September 2024 and also held a bilateral meeting with the King on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai.But a state visit allows for ceremonial pageantry aimed at elevating the occasion and demonstrating the importance with which the UK views those visiting.The visit comes at a time of improving diplomatic and economic links between the UK and Nigeria - with trade between the two worth more than £8bn in the year to October, government figures show. This makes the African nation one of the UK's most important partners in the continent.In 2024, the two countries signed a new trade and investment partnership designed to expand opportunities for business. The agenda for the March visit has not been disclosed, nor details of the events planned for it - but state visits typically include carriage processions and a state banquet, and usually coincide with visiting leaders having political meetings.Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty ImagesThe last Nigerian state visits to the UK took place in 1989In 2025 alone, the King presided over three state visits - those of French President Emmanuel Macron, US President Donald Trump and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier - the first time the UK had held such a number in a single year since 1988.The King has longstanding ties to Nigeria, a Commonwealth country, having expressed a love for Pidgin English and Nigerian Afrobeats music. Before coming monarch, he visited the country four times as the Prince of Wales - in 1990, 1999, 2006 and 2018. Camilla, then the Duchess of Cornwall, joined him on the latter trip.In 2023, the King's Trust International - formerly the Prince's Trust - officially launched in Nigeria, announcing a project aimed at tackling youth unemployment.

    "body": "Savannah Guthrie tells mother's possible kidnappers 'we will pay' in plea for her return3 hours agoKayla Epstein'We will pay': Savannah Guthrie's new message about missing motherUS news anchor Savannah Guthrie and her family have released a new video pleading for the safe return of their mother. \"We received your message, and we understand,\" Guthrie said in the video posted to Instagram on Saturday evening, as she is flanked by her two siblings. \"We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her.\"\"This is the only way we will have peace,\" she continued. \"This is very valuable to us. And we will pay.\" Her video did not provide any details about the message she referenced.Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, last weekend and authorities believe she was taken against her will. Earlier this week, authorities said they had yet to identify a person of interest or suspect in the case.They are offering a reward of $50,000 (£36,000) for information.Nancy Guthrie was discovered missing when members of her church grew concerned when she did not attend Sunday services. Authorities say that early on Sunday morning, a doorbell camera in her home was disconnected and removed. At about 02:28 local time, the app connected to her pacemaker, a implanted cardiac device, was disconnected from her phone.FBI Special Agent Heith Janke has said the bureau is looking into a potential ransom note sent to several media outlets.ReutersAuthorities on Friday said they were \"aware of a new message regarding Nancy Guthrie\". They are \"inspecting the information provided in the message for its accuracy\".Janke said the note \"had facts associated with a deadline with a monetary value they were asking for\", NBC News reported.A presenter for a local CBS News affiliate told the BBC that her channel had received the \"message\" but did not detail its contents.According to news website TMZ, which reportedly received one of the letters, the kidnappers were demanding millions of dollars' worth of the cryptocurrency, which is popular with criminals and often difficult to trace.BBC NewsThe family has released two previous videos saying they are willing to speak with the potential kidnapper, and asking to provide proof that her mother was alive.In a Thursday video, Camron Guthrie - the son of the missing woman - confirmed  the family had not had any direct contact with kidnappers.\"We have to know that you have our mum,\" Camron said in the family's latest video message. \"We want to talk to you.\"The FBI did arrest one individual regarding a fake ransom note on Thursday.Family, and law enforcement, have warned that Nancy Guthrie may be at risk without her medication.\"She is without any medicine,\" Savannah Guthrie said in a previous announcement. \"She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer.\"President Donald Trump said last week he had spoken to Guthrie and offered federal law enforcement help.\"I think we're doing very well, meaning we have some clues, I think that are very strong and I think we could have some answers coming up fairly soon,\" Trump told reporters on Friday.Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Thursday investigators were no closer to finding out who was responsible - but that they were working on the assumption she was still alive.\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" he said. \"Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes.\"Savannah Guthrie, 54, is an American broadcast journalist who has served as the co-anchor of NBC News' TODAY since 2012. She is also the network's chief legal correspondent and a primary anchor for its election coverage. Previously, she was NBC News' White House correspondent.Watch: What we still don’t know about the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s mother",

    "body": "1 day agoRianna CroxfordInvestigations correspondentUS Department of JusticeDavid Stern, Sarah Ferguson and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor pictured together An aide to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was asked by sex offender Jeffrey Epstein about arranging a dinner with a \"beautiful friend\" of his, nearly three years after the then-prince claimed to have cut ties, new emails show.\"I have a very beautiful friend comoing [sic] to london on tues. ANdrew might want to have her for a dinner,\" Epstein wrote in October 2013 to David Stern.Emails appear to show Stern, a trusted royal insider, acted as a go-between for the pair after the then-Duke's relationship with Epstein began to receive scrutiny following his 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing. The BBC has tried to contact Stern for comment.No further correspondence confirms whether Mountbatten-Windsor met Epstein's \"friend\".Other emails seen by the BBC suggest that Stern, an enigmatic figure with little online presence, also invited Epstein to a dinner at Windsor Castle in 2017 - nearly a decade after he was convicted of child sex offences.The latest email, released by the US Department of Justice, from Epstein suggesting that \"Andrew\" meet his \"beautiful friend\" is sent three years after he had separately suggested that \"The Duke\" might enjoy having dinner with a 26-year-old Russian woman in August 2010.Correspondence seen by the BBC, released by the DOJ, shows that Stern regularly communicated with Epstein about royal business and personal affairs from at least 2009 to 2017, by which point he was acting as a director of Mountbatten-Windsor's company Pitch@Palace - a Dragons' Den-style start-up competition where entrepreneurs could present their ideas to potential investors.Stern, an investor and German national, resigned as a director of Pitch@Palace in 2019. He was also a director of the St George's House Trust, based in Windsor Castle, from 2016 until 2022.In April 2017, Stern emails Epstein - nearly a decade after his conviction - to say that he was organising a \"super\" dinner at Windsor Castle in May that year, asking \"who else\" he should invite.In another email, dated the same day, Epstein appears to have the power to directly invite another business associate of his to the Windsor dinner, writing: \"I know you hate london do [sic] want a dinner invite at windsor castle with the top Chinese. biz people? may 26\".The recipient asks Epstein if he will be present at the dinner, to which he responds: \"no, I have a havard [sic] event\", potentially implying he was invited but unable to attend.The emails suggest that Epstein continued to have a much more influential and closer relationship with Mountbatten-Windsor and royal residences in the years after the former Duke had claimed to BBC Newsnight to have cut contact with him in December 2010.In 2014, Stern messages Epstein to say that \"PA [Prince Andrew] sends his birthday wishes and love\" alongside a picture of him with the then-Duke and Duchess of York.The message apparently from Stern also wishes Epstein \"Happy Birthday\" and shares a crude photo of champagne being poured down a naked woman, adding: \"Champagne for you (even though you don't drink it)\".He appears to keep in frequent contact with Epstein about his work and access to the Palace, emailing Epstein in 2010 that he was at Prince Andrew's \"birthday party\" and boasting about the famous celebrities he had encountered.Other emails seem to show that Stern had also acted around this time as a conduit between Epstein and Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of York.In 2011, emails include one from Stern's account which sent Epstein a message from \"Sarah\" mentioning \"The Duke\", in which she congratulates him on the apparent birth of a \"baby boy\".After the crash of a business venture in 2009, Ferguson also appears to write to Epstein: \"I urgently need 20,000 pounds ($27,521) for rent today\" following an exchange with Stern, which she is copied into.A spokesman for Sarah Ferguson previously told the BBC that she was told to congratulate Epstein on a baby but has no knowledge beyond that.Further emails, as part of the three million published last week, also shed new light on Epstein's apparent invitation to have dinner with \"The Duke\" at Buckingham Palace in 2010, and that the sex offender requested to bring three women along with him.On 27 September that year, Epstein emails \"The Duke\" to say that he is in London and asks what time Mountbatten-Windsor would like him and a woman, who the BBC is not naming.\"The Duke\" suggests they could have \"dinner\" at Buckingham Palace and \"lots of privacy\", to which Epstein agrees, responding that he is with three women.Epstein asks if he should \"bring them all, so as to add some life\", in the email exchanges. \"Yes. Plenty of space here for chat! Bring them,\" says \"The Duke\".In a previous email, sent months prior, Epstein had described one of the women as \"a great friend\" and \"very pretty\" after \"The Duke\" asked who she was.Another email, sent the evening before the dinner, appears to show that Epstein had also personally invited a fourth woman to the Buckingham Palace meet-up, asking if she wanted to join and that she agreed.The BBC has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising out of his association with Epstein.The BBC has spent days trying to contact Stern for comment.More on this story ",

    "body": "Japanese people brave snow to vote in snap election 54 minutes agoKelly NgWatch: Tokyo residents head to the polls amid rare city snowfallPeople across Japan are braving snow to vote in a snap election called by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, whose coalition is expected clinch a decisive win, according to polls. This is first mid-winter election in 36 years in Japan, which usually holds polls during milder weather. But Takaichi called an election to seek the public's mandate soon after winning the party's leadership race.  Polls show her Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) coalition with the populist Japanese Innovation Party could bag up to 300 of the 465 seats in the Lower House.This is a turnaround for the LDP, which lost its decades-old coalition ally and parliamentary majority because of corruption scandals and rising costs.Getty ImagesJapan is holding a rare mid-winter electionAfter two LDP prime ministers who stepped down as their ratings plummeted,  Takaihi has emerged as a popular candidate with voters. She appears to have won them over by offering tax cuts and subsidies. But critics are sceptical of whether her pledge to spend more will help a sluggish Japanese economy, given the country's government debt is one of the highest among developed nations. Observers say Takaichi's personal popularity may help boost the LDP's showing in this election. But snow could disrupt voter turnout, especially in the northern and eastern regions. The turnout for early voting this time, which was reported to be nearly 4.6 million people, was down 2.5% from the last election in 2024. The drop has been attributed to the weather.Several areas, including Niigata Prefecture in central Japan, reported heavy snow on Sunday. Japan's transport ministry said 37 train lines and 58 ferry routes were closed and 54 flights cancelled as of Sunday morning. There was rare snowfall in Tokyo as people headed out to vote.An admirer of former UK leader Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi has long pursued the ambition of becoming Japan's \"Iron Lady\". A known ally of Japan's late former PM Shinzo Abe, she advocates similar positions including strong defence and nationalist policies.Despite her traditional views on gender and family, Takaichi has proven especially popular among young voters between the ages of 18 and 30, polls show. Approval ratings for her government have mostly hovered above 70% since she first took office in October.She has garnered a strong following on social media, with 2.6m followers on X. The LDP's campaign video which she fronted was streamed over 100 million times in less than 10 days.The 64-year-old has also become an unlikely fashion icon as \"sanakatsu\" - which roughly translates to \"Sanae-mania\" - has spread. The black leather tote bag she is often seen carrying has sold out and the pink pen she used at her first press conference has gone viral. Getty ImagesSociologist Yuiko Fujita from Tokyo University sets this enthusiasm against the backdrop of how Japanese politics has traditionally been dominated by older men.\"The fact that the prime minister is now a woman, someone with a different background from what people are accustomed to, creates a feeling that something is shifting,\" she told Nikkei Asia.However, some are not convinced her popularity will translate into votes. \"This is not a presidential election but a parliamentary election, in which the LDP's candidates are mostly men tainted by past scandals,\" political science professor Koichi Nakano, from Sophia University, told the BBC.The snap election is a gamble for Takaichi as her party now faces a more unified opposition. The LDP's former longtime coalition partner Komeito has joined forces with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan to form the largest opposition bloc in the Lower House.Another major hurdle the LDP faces is how to convince voters that its spending-heavy measures will not exacerbate Japan's financial fragility. The government's policy package may offer households short-term relief, but \"fails to address the underlying problems of weak productivity and stagnant real wages\", Masahiko Takeda, a senior fellow focusing on Asia at the Australian National University, wrote in an article this week.Moreover, Takaichi has dug herself into \"a deep hole in foreign and security policy by antagonising China\", said Nakano.Takaichi angered Beijing, Tokyo's largest trading partner, late last year with her suggestion that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. The rift has plunged the historically tense relationship to its lowest point in more than a decade.Meanwhile she has pursued closer ties with US President Donald Trump as Tokyo seeks more stability in its relationship with Washington, its closest ally.On Friday, Trump endorsed Takaichi in a rare move for a US leader.",

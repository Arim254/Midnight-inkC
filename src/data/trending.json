    "body": "What does Piastri need to do to get back on track?A thrilling finish to the Formula 1 drivers' championship is in prospect with only one point separating leader Lando Norris and McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri going into this weekend's Sao Paulo Grand Prix.Reigning champion Max Verstappen is only 36 points behind Norris before the race at Interlagos, which offers extra points as it's a sprint event.After the race in Brazil, there are three more grands prix to come this year, in Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.Before Sao Paulo, BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.Do you think the huge difference in results between Max Verstappen and his various team-mates over the years, compared with the closer battles Lewis Hamilton has had with some of his (Nico Rosberg, George Russell and Charles Leclerc) says more about Max, or the quality of his team-mates? - SimonThis is a very complex question, to which it's not possible to give a definitive answer, because there are so many variables.Yes, Verstappen has had a big advantage over several of his team-mates, especially in recent years.But he and Carlos Sainz were relatively evenly matched in 2015 - in fact, on average qualifying pace, Sainz was slightly ahead over their year and a bit as team-mates.And the same went for Daniel Ricciardo, although Verstappen inched his way from a little bit behind the Australian on average in 2016 to definitively, if not massively, ahead by the end of 2018.After that, you also have to factor in Verstappen's pre-eminence in the Red Bull team, the fact that everything was solely focused on him, and that the Red Bull car ended up in a place where it was very difficult to drive.Even so, Sergio Perez did beat Verstappen on merit a handful of times.At the same time, before arriving at Ferrari, Hamilton had definitively beaten all his team-mates through his career apart from Fernando Alonso in 2007, when they were to all intents and purposes even, and George Russell over there years at Mercedes.Jenson Button scored more points than Hamilton over their three years together at McLaren from 2010-12 but Hamilton finished ahead two of the three years and scored considerably more wins. He also had a difficult season in 2011 when off-track factors affected his driving.It can also be argued that, on balance, Hamilton has had a higher calibre of team-mate for more of his career than Verstappen.What Verstappen has not had alongside him since 2018 is a driver who is both experienced and a recognised top liner.It would be fascinating to see him alongside Leclerc, Russell or one of the McLaren drivers, for example.Having said all of that, though, right now pretty much everyone in Formula 1 accepts that Verstappen is the stand-out driver on the grid. He's right up there in the debate about who is the greatest of all time.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Oscar Piastri was 104 points ahead of Max Verstappen in the drivers' championship after winning the Dutch Grand Prix on 31 August. Third-placed Verstappen has narrowed that deficit to 35 pointsWhat does Oscar Piastri need to do to get back on track? He's on a sequence of terrible results and showing nowhere near the true pace of the McLaren - his confidence in the car seems to have totally collapsed. - IeuanIt's hard to be sure what exactly has gone wrong for Piastri in recent races as, since the summer break, he has presented a confusing picture.After he controlled the Dutch Grand Prix from the front, and Lando Norris retired with a fuel-line failure from second place, Piastri was 34 points ahead in the championship, and looked set for a comfortable cruise to the title, on the evidence of his season up to that point.In Italy, he was a little off Norris' pace, but not so much that it looked anything out of the ordinary.Then he had that bizarre weekend in Azerbaijan, when it seemed like another driver was in the car, and he crashed three times, as well as jumping the start.But in Singapore, he qualified ahead of Norris, who then barged him aside at the first corner.Then came Austin and Mexico, where Piastri was simply off the pace.McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said this was about Piastri not adapting as well to the car on two quite similar surfaces that both suffered from low grip and which demanded a different kind of driving style.Norris got on top of this sooner than Piastri, but Stella pointed out that it's worth remembering that Piastri is in only his third season and still has areas in which he can learn and grow.Stella says that, of the four remaining races, there is \"no reason to think that one may favour one driver or the other\".So let's see how things pan out before jumping to too many conclusions about what exactly has happened to Piastri in the past four events.What's gone so wrong at Alpine? In 2016 the plan was to be back at the front within five years, but nearly a decade on both their cars were lapping together in Mexico, 30+ seconds behind anyone else. - MattIn the past decade or so, this team have had two separate five-year plans to move to the front, the first when they were Renault under Cyril Abiteboul, the second as Alpine under Laurent Rossi.Both obviously failed.One issue is that the Renault engine has lacked performance compared with the best since the start of the hybrid era in 2014.Another is that the team did not for a while have the budget to compete with the big teams at the front.Under the budget-cap era since 2021, management is at fault. And that's not just me saying that - Flavio Briatore said so when he was appointed executive adviser by then Renault chief executive officer Luca de Meo last year.Briatore said: \"The problem of Alpine was no management - they chose a few wrong managers.\" This was most obvious in the driver market. Remember 2022, when Alpine had the possibility to go into 2023 with Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri as their drivers?What happened? They lost both through poor management - Alonso by prevaricating, showing what he perceived as a lack of respect and delaying in offering him a deal, until he lost patience and jumped ship to Aston Martin; and Piastri by not having him under contract.The embarrassment of taking that fight to the contract recognition board, only to be told they had no contract with Piastri to enforce summed up the situation.From the possibility of Alonso and Piastri, they ended up with Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon. People inside the team were tearing their hair out about that.The driver situation was symbolic of other management issues.Rossi was in charge as chief executive officer for much of that time, and was definitely at fault in mishandling and underestimating Alonso, especially. But it was De Meo - who has now left Renault - who was ultimately responsible for all that.Briatore has now come in with a new mandate to… well, no one is quite sure.The Renault engine programme is ending this year, and they will buy customer Mercedes power-units from 2026. That might well increase performance, but what does it say about Renault's ambition?It would be unfair to look too much at this year's performance, as attention has been focused on next season for some time.But is Briatore restructuring the team for success, or a possible sale? Renault insist it's the first. Others in F1 see plenty of evidence for the latter.If it's the first, new managing director Steve Nielsen - who is widely respected within F1 - has a lot of work to do to right the ship.Sao Paulo Grand Prix5-7 NovemberLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and Sports Extra 2; live text updates on BBC Sport website and appIt seems clear that Yuki Tsunoda is losing his seat at Red Bull and Isack Hadjar is replacing him but what's the situation at Racing Bulls? Is Liam Lawson expected to be retained and who will join him? - PeterRed Bull said at the Mexican Grand Prix that they were going to wait a little longer to make decisions about their three F1 seats other than the one occupied by Max Verstappen.The expectation is that Isack Hadjar will be promoted to the second seat at Red Bull alongside Verstappen after an impressive rookie season at Racing Bulls.It would be easy to make the argument that this might be another case of a driver being promoted too soon by Red Bull, but in the circumstances it's easy to see why that decision would be made.Liam Lawson struggled badly in his two races at Red Bull this season, and Yuki Tsunoda has not made a strong case to be retained, to say the least.In those circumstances, the obvious solution would be to promote Briton Arvid Lindblad - the next-in-line Red Bull junior - to Racing Bulls from Formula 2, and choose between Lawson and Tsunoda as his team-mate.Given Tsunoda has been in F1 since 2021 and Red Bull are obviously not especially convinced about his potential, you could see them dropping him and keeping Lawson alongside Lindblad.There is also the question of Irishman Alex Dunne, who Red Bull are interested in signing after he was released from the McLaren young driver programme in September.The expectation is that they will pick Lawson or Tsunoda alongside Lindblad, drop the other, and then promote Dunne in 2027 if he has a convincing season in F2 after his impressive rookie campaign this year.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gilles Villeneuve's Ferrari on three wheels during the 1979 Dutch Grand PrixWho was your F1 idol growing up? - AidanGilles Villeneuve was my childhood hero. I was aware of, and vaguely interested in, F1 beforehand, but it really came alive when I came back from a family holiday in the summer of 1979 and turned on the television.Call it luck, call it serendipity, call it whatever, but the first thing that came on screen was a Ferrari on three wheels being driven at apparently impossible speeds.That was the 1979 Dutch Grand Prix, after a mid-race puncture for Villeneuve, who had been battling for the lead with Williams' Alan Jones, and it immediately caught my attention and imagination.It wasn't always easy following F1 in the UK back then. TV schedules constantly shifted. If a race was live, it was on a show called Grandstand, which covered all kinds of sports, and you'd get a few minutes of F1 here and there in between the horse racing or snooker or whatever.But Villeneuve was the first driver with whom I identified. His death at the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix was a shock - and I can still remember that weekend vividly, albeit I was very young and it was a long time ago - but my interest in F1 only grew from there.Get in touchSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

    "body": "5 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorIt has been called the 50-year tax taboo.It is more than half a century since a chancellor of the exchequer chose to put up the basic rate of income tax - that was Labour's Denis Healey, who delivered his Budget on 15 April 1975.Not once since have any of his successors done the same thing.Five decades later, could Rachel Reeves change all of that in three weeks' time?That was one of the big questions hovering over Downing Street as us reporters headed in almost before dawn for the chancellor's breakfast time speech and news conference.Tradition dictates that three weeks out from a Budget the air is full of every conceivable voice but the chancellor's. But not this time.Why?You can pick your expression of choice: softening up, expectation management, pitch-rolling. They all translate as preparing us for unpopular choices to come.Reeves volunteering to commandeer the broadcasting apparatus of Downing Street – the specially built news conference room in No 9 – tells you everything about the scale of what she is toying with at the end of the month.Well, I say everything, not quite. The actual choices, the decisions, including which taxes will go up and by how much, will come at the end of the month.What we got this morning was the argument, the case for what she will do. One senior figure said to me, think of the news conference as being like the first five pages of the chancellor's speech on Budget Day, in which she sketches out the economic landscape as she sees it before she announces what she is going to do.On the day itself, reporters tend to gloss over those opening pages afterwards, because the choices are more newsworthy than the argument.So, the Treasury's rationale goes,  Reeves wanted to set out the argument in isolation today, so it does get heard.In the next three weeks, expect plenty of focus on page 21 of Labour's election manifesto from last year.Here is what it says, in black and white: \"Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.\"It is why I chose to read it out, word for word, to the chancellor in the news conference – scrutinising their promises on your behalf.Reeves told me she regarded it as a \"courtesy\" to you to set out in broad terms the trade-offs she is contemplating.Senior government figures know that driving a coach and horses through that manifesto promise will be visible from space and could be a, if not the, defining moment for Sir Keir Starmer and Reeves.Of course, perhaps in the end she will choose not to put up income tax – and be able to say words to the effect of \"it wasn't as bad as you thought\".  But economists are suggesting that perhaps, given the state of the books, the government might have run out of better ideas.And barely anyone now disputes taxes are going up, whichever ones they might be.",

    "body": "A 14-year-old British boy who took his parents to court after they sent him to boarding school in Africa must remain there until at least the end of his GCSEs, a High Court judge has ruled.The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was taken to Ghana in March 2024 after being told he was visiting a sick relative.In fact, his parents wanted him to move there after concerns about his behaviour in London, including absences from school, having unexplained money and carrying a knife, court papers said. The boy denies being part of a gang or carrying a weapon.A judge ruled on Monday the boy should remain in Ghana and prepare to return after completing the equivalent of GCSEs.After saying he was unhappy and homesick in Ghana, the boy found publicly funded lawyers and brought a case against his parents to the High Court in London, in February. He lost his first bid to return when a High Court judge ruled he was at risk of suffering greater harm in returning to the UK.Then, in June he won a Court of Appeal bid to have the case reheard after the most senior judge in the Family Division, Sir Andrew McFarlane, said there had been confusion in the previous decision.On Tuesday, the High Court handed down its judgement, which ruled against the boy's wishes, citing ongoing disruption, including to his schoolwork and to his family life.Judge Mrs Justice Theis said: \"I am acutely aware that the conclusion I have reached does not accord with [his] wishes and how that will feel for him... \"[He] has the talent, ability and intelligence to make this work together with his family. It will be difficult but they all have the common aim for [him] to return to live with his family.\"The boy, who is nearly 15 and has British and Ghanian citizenship, remains in school in Ghana and is studying for his GCSEs. He previously told the court that he was \"living in hell\" and was \"desperate\" to return to the UK.He described feeling \"like an alien\" in Ghana and being \"abandoned\" by his family. He does not speak Twi and said he has struggled to make friends and feels socially anxious.The boy \"welcomes\" the judge's decision to set out a clear roadmap for his return to the UK, said his solicitor, James Netto, of the International Family Law Group.Mr Netto described the case as \"extremely difficult... on every level\". He said the boy never wanted to be in a position where he was \"obliged\" to bring court proceedings against his own parents, but their actions \"left him with no meaningful alternative\". \"His position remains unchanged: he wants to return home,\" Mr Netto added. The boy's mother said she would not be able to care for him if he returned to the UK before his GCSEs were over. She said: \"It is really hard to be away from him... I feared and continue to fear if he were to come back now, that he could end up dead. I know he does not see it like that…\"Handing down her judgement, Mrs Justice Theis explained that the boy should \"remain living in Ghana with the aim of setting out a road map and taking the necessary steps for [him] to return here after completing his GCSEs\". She added: \"Whether that would take place will need to be reviewed nearer the time.\"The \"road map\" includes taking part in family therapy funded by their local authority. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterPost Office campaigner Alan Bates has agreed a multi-million pound compensation figure from the Post Office, sources close to the deal have confirmed to the BBC.The payout for Sir Alan comes more than 20 years after he started campaigning for justice for victims of the Horizon scandal which led a group of 555 sub-postmasters launching landmark legal action against the Post Office.The exact sum paid to Sir Alan has not been made public and he has not responded to requests for comment.Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT system indicated shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts.Hundreds more poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution.Marriages broke down, and some families believe the stress led to serious health conditions, addiction and even premature death.A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"We pay tribute to Sir Alan Bates for his long record of campaigning on behalf of victims.\"We can confirm that Sir Alan's claim has reached the end of the scheme process and been settled.\"As of September 2025, a total of £1.23bn had been awarded to more than 9,100 sub-postmasters.Sir Alan first received an offer of redress in January 2024, which he rejected, describing it as \"cruel and derisory\".He was made another offer in May 2024 which he said was around a third of what he had requested. In May of this year, he said that he'd received a third offer for less than 50% of his original claim.Sir Alan was part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, under which claimants can either receive £75,000 or seek their own settlement.As part of plan to claim his own settlement, Mr Bates told the BBC his lawyers had included compensation owed for his 20 years of campaigning for justice for those sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal.The Post Office/Horizon scandal reached new heights in the public consciousness last year after Sir Alan's campaign for justice was portrayed in the ITV drama series Mr Bates vs the Post Office.The government adopted all but one of the recommendations of a report published following an inquiry into the scandal.The inquiry detailed the full human impact of the scandal for the first time: the report said that more than 13 people may have taken their own lives as a result of what happened to them.Earlier this year, Sir Alan accused the government of putting forward a \"take it or leave it\" offer of compensation amounting to less than half of his claim.Many victims have previously complained about being forced to accept low offers of compensation, without the benefit of legal help.Last month, the government announced that all victims who are claiming compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice to help them with their offers.There are four different compensation schemes, which are aimed at different groups of victims.Individual eligibility for compensation depends on the particular circumstances of each case.However, the schemes have been criticised for being too slow and complicated, with many of the worst-affected victims receiving far less than their original claims.",

    "body": "6 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentDavid BraunThey look like simple stones, but they were state of the art tools millions of years ago, made with great skill and precisonThe very first humans millions of years ago may have been inventors, according to a discovery in northwest Kenya.Researchers have found that the primitive humans who lived 2.75 million years ago at an archaeological site called Namorotukunan used stone tools continuously for 300,000 years.Evidence previously suggested that early human tool use was sporadic: randomly developed and quickly forgotten.The Namorotukunan find is the first to show that the technology was passed down through thousands of generations.According to Prof David Braun, of George Washington University, in Washington DC, who led the research, this find, published in the journal Nature Communications, provides incredibly strong evidence for a radical shake-up in our understanding of human evolution.\"We thought that tool use could have been a flash in the pan and then disappeared. When we see 300,000 years of the same thing, that's just not possible,\" he said.\"This is a long continuity of behaviour. That tool use in (humans and human ancestors) is probably much earlier and more continuous than we thought it was.\"David BraunThe stone tools were so sharp that the researchers could cut their fingers on some of themArchaeologists spent ten years at Namorotukunan uncovering 1,300 sharp flakes, hammerstones, and stone cores, each made by carefully striking rocks gathered from riverbeds. These are made using a technology known as Oldowan and is the first widespread stone tool-making method.The same kinds of tools appear in three distinct layers. The deeper the layer the further back the snapshot in time. Many of the stones were specially chosen for their quality, suggesting that the makers were skilled and knew exactly what they were looking for, according to the senior geoscientist on the research team, Dr Dan Palcu Rolier of the University of São Paulo in Brazil.\"What we see here in the site is an incredible level of sophistication,\" he told BBC News.\"These  guys were extremely astute geologists. They knew how to find the best raw materials and these stone tools are exceptional. Basically, we can cut our fingers with some of them.\"Geological evidence suggests that tool use probably helped these people survive dramatic changes in climate. The landscape shifted from lush wetlands to dry, fire-swept grasslands and semideserts,\" said Rahab N. Kinyanjui, senior scientist at the National Museums of Kenya.These sharp environmental changes would normally force animal populations to adapt through evolution or move away.  But the toolmakers in the region managed to thrive by using technology rather than biological adaptation, according to Dr Palcu Rolier.\"Technology enabled these early inhabitants of East Turkana to survive in a rapidly changing landscape - not by adapting themselves, but adapting their ways of finding food.\"The evidence of stone tools at different layers shows that for a long and continuous period, these primitive people flew in the face of biological evolution, finding a way of controlling the world around them, rather than letting the world control them.And this happened at the very beginning of the emergence of humanity, according to Dr Palcu Rolier.\"Tool use meant that they did not have to evolve by modifying their bodies to adapt to these changes. Instead, they developed the technology they needed to get access to the food: tools for ripping open animal carcasses and digging up plants.\"David BraunThe Namorotukunan site, located in Kenya's Turkana Basin, lies close to the ancient course of a long dried up major river which once attracted settlements of early humans and their ancestorsThere is evidence for this at the site: of animal bones being broken, being cut with these stone tools, which means that through these changes, they were consistently able to use meat as a way of sustenance.\"The technology gives these early inhabitants an advantage, says Dr Palcu Rolier.\"They are able to access different types of foods as environments change, their source of sustenance is changing, but because they have this technology, they can bypass these challenges and access new food.\"David BraunArchaeologists excavate a 2.58 million year old site in northern Kenya at the site of NamorotukunanAt around 2.75 million years ago, the region was populated by some of the very first humans, who had relatively small brains. These early humans are thought to have lived alongside their evolutionary ancestors: a pre-human group, called australopithecines, who had larger teeth and a mix of chimpanzee and human traits.The tool users at Namorotukunan were most likely one of these groups or possibly both.And the finding challenges the notion held by many experts in human evolution that continuous tool use emerged much later, between 2.4 and 2.2 million years ago, when humans had evolved relatively larger brains, according to Prof Braun.\"The argument is that we're looking at a pretty substantial brain size increase. And so, often the assertion has been that tool use allowed them to feed this large brain.\"But what we're seeing at Namorotukunan is that these really early tools are used before that brain size increase.\"\"We have probably vastly underestimated these early humans and human ancestors. We can actually trace the roots of our ability to adapt to change by using technology much earlier than we thought, all the way to 2.75 million years ago, and probably much earlier.\"",

    "body": "18 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondentAn investigation into allegations that Sheffield Hallam University faced sustained pressure from China to shut down human rights research has been referred to counter-terrorism police.The BBC and the Guardian newspaper have been reporting that documents show China waged a two-year campaign of intimidation and harassment, including demands the university stop sensitive research by one of its professors into claims of forced labour in the Xinjiang region of China.A South Yorkshire Police spokesperson said the force has referred the investigation on because the \"allegations fall under Section 3 of the National Security Act\".Section 3 of the act deals with \"assisting a foreign intelligence service\".An offence is committed if someone behaves in a way that \"intends that conduct to materially assist a foreign intelligence service in carrying out UK-related activities,\" or in conduct likely to assist that service.Internal documents from Sheffield Hallam University were released under a Subject Access Request to Professor Laura Murphy, whose research is alleged to have been targeted.They showed university staff in China had been threatened by individuals identified as being from China's National Security Service, who demanded the research by Prof Murphy taking place in Sheffield be shut down.The documents went on to state that \"a decision by the university not to publish a final phase of the research on forced labour in China was communicated to the National Security Service... Immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed\".China is not believed to have an organisation named National Security Service, so it is not clear who the individuals were.A few months later, at the start of this year, Prof Murphy was told by the university that she could not continue her work on China. She started legal action for infringement of her academic freedom. The university then reversed its position. In a statement issued earlier, Sheffield Hallam University had apologised to Prof Murphy.A spokesperson said: \"The university's decision to not continue with Professor Laura Murphy's research was taken based on our understanding of a complex set of circumstances at the time, including being unable to secure the necessary professional indemnity insurance.\"The insurance for social sciences staff had been suspended by the university's insurers as a Chinese firm had brought a defamation suit against Sheffield Hallam after it was named in a report she produced. That lawsuit is ongoing.The university spokesperson added: \"Following a review, we have since approved Professor Murphy's latest research and are committed to supporting her to undertake and disseminate this important work.\"For the avoidance of doubt, the decision was not based on commercial interests in China. \"Regardless, China is not a significant international student market for the University.\"We have apologised to Professor Murphy and wish to make clear our commitment to supporting her research and to securing and promoting freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "3 hours agoDaniel Sandford,UK correspondent and Rachel HaganFar-right activist Tommy Robinson has been found not guilty of a terror offence after refusing to give police access to his phone in July 2024.The 42-year-old, who was charged under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was stopped by officers at the Channel Tunnel in Folkestone while driving a friend's silver Bentley to Benidorm, Spain. Robinson refused to give officers the Pin to his phone during the stop, arguing that the device contained confidential journalistic material.Judge Sam Goozee said he could not be sure that the police stop had been lawful.\"I cannot put out of my mind that it was actually what you [Tommy Robinson] stood for and your political beliefs that acted for the principle reason for this stop\", said Judge Goozee.Robinson had been detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which allows officers to question people at UK ports to determine potential links to terrorism.When he was asked to hand over the phone's Pin, Robinson replied: \"Not a chance bruv... It's my work, I'm a journalist.\"His barrister, Alisdair Williamson KC, argued that the stop was politically motivated, saying the \"predominant influence\" on PC Mitchell Thorogood's decision to stop him was: \"'oh look, it's Tommy Robinson\"'.Williamson added: \"If MI5 didn't think that Mr Lennon is a terrorist, what did PC Thorogood think he was going to learn by asking him about publicly available information?\"He also noted that Robinson's frequent trips to Benidorm, should have lessened, not heightened, suspicion. Police had said they became suspicious of Robinson's \"vague replies\" about his travel plans.Judge Goozee criticised the conduct of officers involved, saying they had \"no real recollection\" of questions asked during the 40-minute stop and failed to record clear reasons for selecting Robinson. The stop, he said, \"gave the impression of an arbitrary decision based on who you are.\" Adding that the decision appeared to be based on a \"protected characteristic.\"\"I cannot convict you,\" Judge Goozee concluded.Supporters in the public gallery at Westminster Magistrates' Court cheered as he was cleared of all charges. In a video recorded before the hearing, Robinson said his legal fees had been paid by Elon Musk.After the verdict, he again thanked the Tesla boss billionaire again, saying: \"Elon Musk I am forever grateful. If you didn't step in and fund my legal fight for this then I'd probably be in jail.\"",

    "body": "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said \"heads should roll\" at the BBC, following reports that a Panorama documentary misled viewers by editing a speech by US President Donald Trump.The Telegraph said it had seen an internal memo suggesting the programme edited two parts of Trump's speech together so he appeared to explicitly encourage the Capitol Hill riots of January 2021.Badenoch told GB News the edits were \"absolutely shocking\", adding that director general Tim Davie should be \"identifying who put out misinformation, and sacking them\".A BBC spokesperson said: \"While we don't comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.\"The one-hour programme, Trump: A Second Chance?, was broadcast last year and was made for the BBC by independent production company October Films Ltd, which has also been approached for comment.In his speech in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, Trump said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"However, in Panorama's edit, he was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"The two sections of the speech that were edited together were more than 50 minutes apart.The \"fight like hell\" comment was taken from a section where President Trump discussed how \"corrupt\" US elections were. In total, he used the words \"fight\" or \"fighting\" 20 times in the speech.After showing the president speaking, the programme played footage of flag-waving men marching on the Capitol, the Telegraph said.According to the leaked memo, this \"created the impression President Trump's supporters had taken up his 'call to arms'\". But that footage was in fact shot before the president had started speaking.On 6 January 2021, hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, protesting about Joe Biden's election victory. Five people died in relation to the riot.The House of Representatives accused Trump of encouraging violence with false claims of election fraud, but he was acquitted of an impeachment charge that he incited a mob to storm the Capitol.According to the Telegraph, the document said Panorama's \"distortion of the day's events\" would leave viewers asking: \"Why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?\"When the issue was raised with managers, the memo continued, they \"refused to accept there had been a breach of standards\".Speaking to GB News on Tuesday, Badenoch said: \"That is fake news, actually putting different things together to make something look different from what it actually was.\"And I do think heads should roll. Whoever it was who did that should be sacked, that's what Tim Davie should be doing, identifying who put out misinformation, and sacking them.\"She continued: \"The public need to be able to trust our public broadcaster... They should not be telling us things that are not true.\"This is a corporation that needs to hold itself to the highest standards, and that means that when we see people doing the wrong thing, they should be punished, they should be sacked.\"Former prime minister Boris Johnson also said the corporation needed to respond, asking on X: \"Is anyone at the BBC going to take responsibility - and resign?\"The Telegraph said the report it had obtained about BBC bias was written by Michael Prescott, formerly an independent external adviser to the broadcaster's editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left the role in June.The newspaper said a whistleblower sent a copy of the 19-page dossier to every member of the BBC board last month. BBC News has not seen a copy of the memo.In its statement, the BBC said: \"Michael Prescott is a former adviser to a board committee where differing views and opinions of our coverage are routinely discussed and debated.\"BBC News has approached Mr Prescott for comment.Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage, chairwoman of the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said: \"At a time when trust in both politics and mainstream media is so low, our state broadcaster has an additional responsibility to ensure that it reports contentious and potentially inflammatory issues with a straight bat.\"These allegations are extremely worrying and come at a critical time for the BBC. The DCMS committee will meet tomorrow and will no doubt discuss the implications of this.\"Downing Street said Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy and senior officials in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport have received a copy of the internal memo, and have been assured by the BBC that the corporation is examining the issues it raises.The prime minister's spokesman said: \"We take any criticisms of the BBC's editorial standards very seriously and we expect the BBC to consider any feedback that they receive seriously and carefully.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoPhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterFor the first time in Great Britain, there are more over-16s using vapes or e-cigarettes than smoking cigarettes, according to the Office for National Statistics.Some 5.4 million adults use vapes daily or occasionally, compared with 4.9 million using cigarettes, an ONS survey for 2024 suggests.Daily use of vapes is most common among 25-49 year olds, with rising use among women. The popularity of cigarette smoking has been falling for the past decade as the harmful effects of tobacco encouraged many to quit, while less risky vape use has been rising - particularly among younger age groups.Vaping poses a small fraction of the risks of smoking, the NHS says, since cigarettes release thousands of chemicals when they burn, many of which are poisonous and can cause cancer. Switching to vaping reduces those risks but the long-term effects of vaping aren't yet known. Health experts say vaping is not competely harmless, so children and non-smokers should never vape.The charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said the drop in smoking was \"good news for public health\" but warned that those still smoking \"are trapped in a cycle of addiction that will likely take their lives\".ASH says smoking is responsible for 70,000 deaths every year and is the leading cause of preventable death in the UK. It is urging the government to invest in and support communities where smoking rates remain high.The ONS's Opinions and Lifestyle Survey suggests that 10% of adults aged 16 and over currently use an e-cigarette every day or occasionally - slightly more than the 9.1% who say they currently smoke.The number saying they've given up smoking has risen - 74.2% in 2024, up from 70.3% in 2023.Back in the 1970s, less than 30% had quit the habit. At that time, nearly half of the population were smokers.But much has changed since then. In 2006-2007, a ban on smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces was introduced and in 2015, a ban on smoking in cars with children was brought in.More recently in 2017, plain cigarette packaging was introduced.And government legislation currently progressing through parliament - called the Tobacco and Vapes Bill - will soon mean anyone born on or after 1 January 2009 will not be legally allowed to buy tobacco in the UK.Rules on how vapes are packaged and displayed in shops are also set to be tightened over concerns that the devices are appealing to children.It has been illegal for businesses to sell or supply single-use or disposable vapes in the UK since June. The ban is aimed at reducing environmental damage and cutting the number of children and young people vaping.The BBC understands the government will make it illegal to sell nicotine pouches and other nicotine products to under-18s as part of the Bill.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson told the BBC there were no limits on how strong these pouches can be.\"The Tobacco and Vapes Bill will let us set rules on nicotine strength, flavours and packaging to keep young people safe.\"The ONS survey suggests 6.7% of people aged 16 and over in Great Britain use a vape or e-cigarette every day, up from 5.9% in 2023.Another 3.3% say they use one occasionally.This equates to 5.4 million current vape users, a rise from 5.1 million in 2023.The use of e-cigarettes daily or occasionally remained highest among 16-24 year olds in Great Britain in 2024 at 13%, down from 15.8% in 2023.Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of ASH, said there were still concerns about non-smokers and young people taking up vaping.

Wire traps, or snares, are often set for antelope - both for food and illegal trade - but many large mammals become victims as by-catch.These pressures are changing pack sizes, diets and survival strategies, according to Dr Becker. A single incident can have knock-on effects, impacting dozens or even hundreds of animals.​​In one scene, a wild dog reappears after losing a leg in a snare trap. Despite his injury, his natal pack welcomes him back, ensuring he eats his share and keeps up on hunts.​​For those not as fortunate, the Zambia Carnivore Programme exists to protect them. The organisation, along with other local groups, removes snares, safeguards dens and provides information for law enforcement on illegal trade in ivory and bushmeat.BBC StudiosA pride of lions plays beside a riverReflecting on the conservation focus of the series, Dr Becker said: \"Ultimately, it's a message of optimism in the face of some very concerning trends.\"​​Its incorporation in wildlife programmes is now an inevitability, according to the producers. The external forces acting on these creatures are clear and series like Kingdom can shed light on the need to protect them.Speaking about conservation, ​​series editor, Simon Blakeney, said: ​​\"It’s a challenge, but it's not hopeless.\"Kingdom begins on BBC One at 18:20 GMT on Sunday and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer.

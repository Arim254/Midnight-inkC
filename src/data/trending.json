    "body": "Trump and Infantino - too close for comfort?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Donald Trump and Gianni Infantino will attend the World Cup drawBySports editor in WashingtonUpdated 1 hour agoStaged just a mile from the White House, Friday's World Cup draw will have a distinctly political feel.The glittering ceremony will take place at the Kennedy Center, the famous Washington arts venue now chaired by US President Donald Trump after he overhauled its board this year.Alongside stars from football, US sports and show business, Trump will be in attendance, as will the leaders of the other two co-hosts - Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney.Proceedings, however, seem to have been planned with the US president very much in mind.Seventies group Village People have been booked to play YMCA, a Trump favourite that is regularly heard at his campaign rallies. And, in a break with tradition, the draw ceremony will feature the awarding of a new Fifa Peace Prize, with Trump widely expected to be the recipient.Such gestures will only underline the alliance forged between the US president and Fifa counterpart Gianni Infantino, who announced the award last month after claiming that Trump deserved to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution to the Israel-Gaza ceasefire, and enthusiastically praising his policies.For critics, such moves are a threat to Fifa's commitment to political neutrality, one enshrined in its statutes, and risk turning the draw - and the tournament itself - into propaganda tools. They believe Infantino and Trump are effectively too close for comfort, and that it sends a message that world football's governing body is aligning with the Make America Great Again (Maga) movement, and endorsing what many feel is a divisive administration. Is it wise, they ask, that Fifa is seen to associate so closely with a man who only this week made disparaging comments about Somali immigrants, describing them as \"garbage\"?Asked about the new award amid reports that the Fifa Council was not consulted about it, one senior official at the governing body told BBC Sport: \"Why can't this be bigger than the Nobel Peace Prize? Football has huge global support, so it's right that it recognises extraordinary efforts to bring about peace every year.\"They pointed to the fact that in 2019 there was no such controversy when Fifa gave the president of Argentina an award to honour his contribution to football, and said the organisation deserves praise for endorsing peace in a divided world.Media caption, Dan Roan reports from Washington before the 2026 World Cup drawA special relationshipPresident Bill Clinton chose not to attend the draw for the World Cup in 1994, when the US last hosted the event. But it is no surprise that Trump has chosen to play a prominent role, given the global platform the World Cup offers him. In a sign of the kind of scenes that may lie in store at next year's event, Trump appeared at the Club World Cup final this year, when he chose to remain on the podium as Chelsea celebrated winning the tournament, clearly enjoying remaining at the centre of attention after handing them the trophy.More recently he greeted Cristiano Ronaldo at a White House dinner held in honour of the Saudi Crown Prince. Just days later, the forward was handed a surprise reprieve by Fifa when it suspended two matches of a three match ban after he was sent off for elbowing Dara O'Shea during a defeat to the Republic of Ireland, ensuring his availability for Portugal's opening matches at the World Cup. There is also the regularity with which Trump and Infantino have appeared together in recent years, including at events outside the sporting realm.Since first visiting the Oval Office in 2018 during Trump's first term, Infantino has been spotted with Trump at the Davos Economic Forum, the signing in Washington of the Abraham Accords - an agreement between Israel and some Arab nations in the Middle East in 2020 - and even as a guest at Trump's second inauguration in January.Fifa formally hailed the pair's close friendship after that event, with Infantino himself insisting that it made practical sense given the importance of the US hosting both the expanded Club World Cup and the World Cup.Fifa also claimed Infantino had a duty to develop and promote the game globally, and that he also held regular meetings with other world leaders.While Infantino seemed to have much less of a rapport with US President Joe Biden during his time in the White House, that has indeed been the case with other heads of state.Since replacing predecessor Sepp Blatter almost a decade ago after promising to restore Fifa's reputation and finances following a huge corruption scandal, Infantino has appeared close to Russian President Vladimir Putin - who awarded Infantino a Russian Order of Friendship medal in 2019 - along with the rulers of two other World Cup hosts in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.Infantino's proximity to such leaders has inevitably sparked controversy and criticism, but it is the relationship with Trump that has caused the biggest backlash within the game.Earlier this year, delegates from Europe's governing body Uefa staged a walkout from the Fifa Congress in Paraguay when Infantino arrived hours late after joining Trump on a tour of the Middle East, accusing him of prioritising \"private political interests\" which \"does the game no service\".In 2018 Infantino himself said \"it is very clear that politics should stay out of football and football should stay out of politics\".But he defended the trip with Trump, insisting it had been crucial as it allowed him \"to represent football\" in \"important discussions\" with \"world leaders in politics and economy\".But the episode only intensified scrutiny on the relationship, as did Fifa's decision to set up a new office in New York's Trump Tower. Infantino also made a surprise appearance at a summit in Egypt in October as Trump and other world leaders signed a declaration for bringing peace to Gaza.The only sports leader present, Infantino claimed football could contribute to peace efforts, and said Fifa would help rebuild facilities in Gaza - but his presence again raised eyebrows.Image source, Getty ImagesA welcoming World Cup?Amid such football diplomacy, there have also been concerns about the impact that some of Trump's policies and statements could have on the World Cup, and uncertainty over how welcome visitors from some countries will be.In June the White House listed 19 countries, predominantly in Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean, which would face full or partial immigration restrictions, referencing a need to manage security threats.Amid suggestions that the list could be expanded to as many as 30 countries after an Afghan man was identified as the suspect in the recent shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House, Fifa has vowed to have a welcoming and unifying tournament.But Iran and Haiti, whose teams have qualified for the World Cup, are among the countries affected by the ban. Last week Iran said they planned to boycott the draw because of the limited number of visas for their delegation.The June executive order exempts athletes and coaching staff from travelling for the World Cup, but fans could face a ban.\"We want to make sure that we're as welcoming as possible,\" Andrew Giuliani, the executive director of the White House's World Cup Task Force, said on Wednesday.Giuliani hailed a programme designed to shorten wait times for interviews for visitor visas for those with tickets, but he did not rule out Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids targeting undocumented immigrants at World Cup venues. Giuliani insisted that authorities wanted to ensure visitors came into the US legally to prioritise the safety of US citizens.Such a stance worries civil liberties campaigners, with Human Rights Watch (HRW) claiming the draw will take place against \"a backdrop of violent detentions of immigrants, National Guard deployments in US cities, and the obsequious cancellation of Fifa's own anti-racism and anti-discrimination campaigns\". They are among a group of organisations who on Wednesday claimed the World Cup was at increasing danger of being \"weaponised for authoritarian aims.\"\"There is still time to honour Fifa's promises for a World Cup not tainted by human rights abuses, but the clock is ticking,\" HRW said. Having praised Infantino as \"one of the greatest men of sport\" during a meeting at the Oval Office last month, Trump suggested he might even take matches away from Democratic-run host cities if he had concerns over safety and security.While it is unclear whether the president will - or even could - follow through with a move that would cause major logistical and legal disruption, his words added to the uncertainty surrounding the tournament.At the same meeting Trump suggested he could launch \"strikes\" against Mexico if it would stop drugs from being trafficked into the US. Coming after Trump's trade policies had already caused friction with both Mexico and Canada, it only reinforced concerns about the level of co-operation between the three World Cup co-hosts over issues such as security at the tournament.Infantino could claim that, given the unpredictability of some of Trump's statements, having a close relationship with him is even more crucial.But others would argue it also risks impeding his ability to stand up to the US president.Image, elections and revenueFor Trump, the World Cup has been a focus of his second presidency. It gives him an ideal chance to project his image on a global stage, along with the celebrations marking the 250th anniversary of US independence next year.Hailing the event as an \"incredibly significant economic opportunity\" for the US, Trump is also hoping it provides a welcome tourism boost after a sluggish year for the industry in the US, with Fifa claiming it will generate £22bn for the economy and create almost 200,000 jobs. The tournament is also a chance for the country to show it can deliver a successful mega-event, before Los Angeles hosts the Olympics and Paralympics in 2028.For Infantino, the most lucrative sports event ever staged is also a very useful money-spinner. It enables him to honour his pledge to grow the game in the US, boost Fifa's commercial revenues, and increase payments to national football associations - doing no harm to his chances of a third re-election as president in 2027.A deregulated market in the US has enabled Fifa to run an official ticket resale platform for the tournament that will earn it an unprecedented 30% commission on every transaction.Fan representatives have condemned the move, claiming that supporters are at risk of being exploited by a pricing model that fails to reflect the spirit of the World Cup. But it also helps explain why Fifa expects to bring in a record £10bn in its 2023 to 2026 cycle.The true strength of Trump and Infantino's relationship could well be tested in the coming months. But both men clearly view their alliance as mutually beneficial.",

    "body": "12 minutes agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterReform UK has received a record £9m donation from cryptocurrency investor and aviation entrepreneur Christopher Harborne, new figures from the Electoral Commission show.It is the largest ever single donation by a living person to a British political party.Mr Harborne, who is British but lives in Thailand, has previously given large sums to the Conservatives under Boris Johnson's leadership, as well as Reform's predecessor the Brexit Party in 2019 and 2020.While the next general election is not due until 2029, the donation comes ahead of local elections next May.Reform UK has been consistently leading in national opinion polls since the spring.Mr Harborne's donation breaks the previous record for a living person, which was £8m from supermarket tycoon Lord David Sainsbury to the Liberal Democrats in 2019.His cousin Lord John Sainsbury left £10m to the Conservatives in his will in 2022.Two of Mr Harborne's businesses - AML Global and Sherriff Group - are linked to private aircraft and aviation.Reform leader Nigel Farage has been a supporter of cryptocurrency, announcing in May that his party would be the first in the UK to accept donations in Bitcoin.Mr Harborne's donation, which was made on 1 August, was not in cryptocurrency.Farage said he speaks to the businessman \"maybe once a month, maybe once every six weeks\", but insisted: \"I've not promised him a single thing in return for his donation.\"\"Does he want anything from me? No. Absolutely nothing in return at all,\" he said.\"He just happens to think that we've not made the most of Brexit, that we're not getting into the 21st Century technologies.\"According to the Electoral Commission's latest figures, Reform UK received donations totalling more than £10.2m between July and September.This was more than the Conservatives, who received £4.6m in donations, followed by Labour on £2.1m and the Liberal Democrats on £1m.Aside from Mr Harborne's donation, the next biggest during the three-month period was £1m given by games programmer and tech entrepreneur Jeremy Elliott San to the Conservatives.Labour's biggest donor was the Unite union with £362,625, while the Liberal Democrats received its largest sum - £50,000 - from Neale Powell-Cook, who owns a food supply company. It is the first quarter since last year's general election that Reform has received more in donations than the Conservatives.A Reform spokesman said the figures \"show the incredible progress\" the party is making.\"This is further evidence that we have all the momentum in British politics,\" he added.However, overall the Tories have still received more donations since July 2024 - around £14.4m compared with £13.5m for Reform.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the Tories had been \"out-raising\" other parties throughout this year, while Mr Harborne's donation to Reform was a \"one-off\".\"If you look at the breadth and depth of our donors, and the trend, I'm really, really pleased with the announcement today that shows that we've had our best performing quarter since I became leader,\" she told broadcasters.Liberal Democrat spokesperson Lisa Smart said the latest figures showed \"some eye-watering donations\".\"Our elections are not being fought on an even footing if they can be bought by a small handful of individuals,\" she added.Political parties are required to report all donations above £11,180 to the Electoral Commission. Opposition parties also receive public funds to support their parliamentary duties, with allocations based on their performance at the previous election.Between July and September, Reform received £227,835 in public funds - far less than the £2.3m received by the Conservatives and the £1m for the Liberal Democrats.",

    "body": "Suspect arrested in pipe bomb incident on eve of Jan 6, ending years-long manhuntA man has been arrested in connection to two pipe bombs placed outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees on the eve of the 6 January Capitol riot nearly five years ago.The arrest was confirmed on Thursday by two sources familiar with the case to BBC's US partner, CBS News. He is expected to face charges in DC federal court later Thursday, thought the charges are unclear. It ends a long-running manhunt in the case, which involved an extensive investigation and a $500,000 (£375,000) reward.The pipe bombs were safely deactivated and did not explode.Officials have not yet commented on the identity of the suspect, or what led to the arrest.Earlier this year, the FBI released CCTV footage of the alleged suspect. It appears to show an individual with a backpack, a light grey hooded sweater, placing something near a bench outside the Democratic National Committee building in Washington. The person is shown later walking to place the second bomb.Both were placed the night before the 6 January riot, and were discovered as rioters began to storm the Capitol. At the time, US senators were meeting in the Capitol to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Joe Biden had won, defeating Donald Trump. Trump, who was president at the time, addressed a large crowd of supporters at a \"Save America\" rally near the White House, where he urged them to march \"peacefully\" to the Capitol, but also made unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud.The crowd numbered between 2,000 and 2,500 people, and contained members of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. Many were carrying weapons.Hundreds then forced their way into the Capitol building through windows and doors, overwhelming police. It took law enforcement almost four hours to restore order.As the riot began, a passerby discovered the two pipe bombs, police had said at the time. The items allegedly left behind included pipes, wires, kitchen timers, and homemade black powder, according to the FBI.According to a report obtained by the BBC's US partner CBS News, the bombs had one method of detonation: a 60-minute kitchen timer. But they ultimately did not explode for unknown reasons. Police had been searching for a suspect ever since.Many of those convicted or charged in relation to the riot have since been pardoned by Trump earlier this year, shortly after he took office for his second term in January. Pardons or commutations were issued for more than 1,500 people. Trump also ordered the US Department of Justice to drop all pending cases against other suspects. At the time, Trump referred to the accused and convicted as \"the hostages\", and said that their lives had been \"destroyed\".\"What they've done to these people is outrageous. There's rarely been anything like it in the history of our country,\" he had said.",

Her behaviour was becoming more and more unacceptable.\"The hearing was shown CCTV from the rugby club showing PC Pritchard \"twerking\" on the dance floor in a series of suggestive dance moves.A female police officer, identified to the hearing only as \"Police Constable A,\" said: \"PC Pritchard came up from behind me, put both her arms around my neck, then put them under my armpits and grabbed my breasts and squeezed them.\"PC Pritchard apologised to PC A when giving evidence to the hearing earlier this week.She said: \"My behaviour that evening was inappropriate I've never acted like that before.\"I'm absolutely mortified at what's happened - I don't recognise the person I see on that CCTV - all I can do is apologise.\"She broke down in tears as she said: \"I feel I've let down the police, I've let down myself and I've let down my family.\"She said she has had \"panic and nightmares\" and felt \"people thought I was a sexual predator\".The panel chair, Assistant Chief Constable Chris Allsop, said on Thursday that \"all the allegations against PC Pritchard have been found proven\".\"Overall, the panel finds that the breaches of standards are of medium to high seriousness which could justify dismissal as gross misconduct,\" he said. Barrister Fiona Clancy, representing PC Pritchard, had argued she should be allowed to keep her job in the police.\"She accepts her behaviour was unacceptable.  This was a short-lived episode, of brief duration, and there is no risk of it happening again.\"PC Pritchard has been doing voluntary work while she has been waiting for this hearing, and has kept her fitness levels up – there is a genuine motivation to keep serving the community.\"More top stories",

    "body": "5 hours agoTom Singleton,Technology reporterandLaura Cress,Technology reporterOfcom has told the BBC it has never heard from a porn company it has fined £1m for failing to comply with the UK Online Safety Act.It said it had been emailing AVS Group Ltd since it launched its investigation in July, but had not had a response at any point - so the firm had been fined an extra £50,000.The Act makes it a legal requirement for websites that host pornographic material to put in place what the regulator determines to be \"highly effective age assurance\" to prevent children from being able to easily access explicit content.Ofcom said AVS must now implement highly effective age assurance within 72 hours or face an additional penalty of £1,000 a day.In addition to the AVS fine, Ofcom also announced that one \"major social media company\" was going through compliance remediation with its enforcement team.The regulator has not named the platform but says there may be formal action if it does not see sufficient improvement soon.Ofcom said the fine showed the \"tide on online safety\" was beginning to turn.\"This year has seen important changes for people, with new measures across many sites and apps now better protecting children from harmful content,\" said Oliver Griffiths, Ofcom's online safety group director.\"But we need to see much more from tech companies next year and we'll use our full powers if they fall short,\" he added.Ofcom has already started issuing fines to some companies for not implementing proper age verification, including deepfake \"nudify\" applications. However, online message board 4Chan has so far refused to comply with a £20,000 fine issued by Ofcom over the summer.The Online Safety Act is being implemented in phases, and is intended to prevent past practices which Ofcom described as online platforms being \"unregulated, unaccountable and often unwilling to prioritise people's safety over profits\".Tougher age checks for porn websites were introduced in July, though some people have pointed out these could be easily avoided with a virtual private network (VPN), which reroutes internet traffic.In October, Pornhub's parent company told BBC News it had seen a 77% drop in UK visitors since the age checks had come in. Baroness Beeban Kidron, founder of 5Rights Foundation, told the Today programme the fines were \"nothing\" to tech firms.\"Business disruption is everything,\" she said.\"Unless we're prepared to use the law, they're not really doing what Parliament asked them to do.\"We need a whole different attitude about the level of intensity and robustness from the regulator to say - we've got the law and we're using it.\"The BBC has contacted a company called TubeCorporate, the adult content publishing platform behind AVS group Ltd sites, for a response. The address which the firm uses is in the central American country Belize, and appears to be the registered address of a large number of companies: although they do not have physical offices there.Also introduced this year were tougher guidelines on ensuring the internet was safer for women and girls, with Ofcom vowing to name and shame platforms that did not comply. Critics say the Act needs to be toughened to make the internet safer, particularly for women and girls.",

    "body": "14 hours agoAlex TaylorBBC News reporterGetty ImagesIt's that time of year when winter viruses take hold, and a cacophony of coughs fill households, offices and public transport.Often people turn to cough medicine for a fix. But does this work, or are homemade remedies like honey and lemon just as good?Jacky Smith, a professor in respiratory medicine at the University of Manchester,  spoke to Radio 4's Sliced Bread to unblock fact from fiction.Own brand products can do the jobGetty ImagesMost coughs come from colds, and cold viruses usually need to work their way through you naturally. Cough medicines can't treat the underlying virus but they can soothe your throat and reduce the tickly sensations that make you cough.If it's a dry cough then choosing balsams or sickly-sweet syrup-based soothing agents like glycerol, can help \"coat your throat\" and protect against the dryness, says Prof Smith.But paying more for these isn't worth it with cheaper supermarket-own brands just as effective as the big names, she says.The one thing to look out for on the label though is sugar content which as you'd expect with sweet syrups is often very high. Sugar-free cough medicines could be a better option if that's a concern.Cough medicines often also advertise that they contain certain \"active ingredients\". These can include dextromethorphan, which claims to suppress your cough reflex - although Prof Smith says the impact is minimal.Dosing is always important she adds, but especially with dextromethorphan which can be addictive. \"You certainly wouldn't want to exceed the doses advised on the label,\" she says.Levomenthol - an ingredient found in some cough syrups for chesty coughs - meanwhile, offers a \"cooling sensation\" at the back of the throat, which limits the tickle by masking the sense of irritation.Drink water and wait it outGetty ImagesIf it's a chesty cough then many find themselves battling what can feel like oceans of phlegm and a tight chest.This can come from secondary infections like bronchitis, which inflame the airways, or the extra build-up of phlegm in your nose and sinuses.It's natural to turn to an over-the-counter syrup, but Prof Smith's advice is to remain sceptical of their impact.The ingredient guaifenesin, for instance, is claimed to loosen phlegm, but this lacks conclusive proof.And while sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine might help you sleep at night, they don't treat the cough itself.There's similarly little evidence that plant extracts, like thyme and squill, have any impact.Instead, Prof Smith says the best approach is for people to \"wait it out\", drink water to stay hydrated and take lozenges that encourage swallowing and \"inhibit a cough\" for a period of time.What about honey and lemon?A warm homemade mixture of honey and lemon can have just the same soothing effect for dry coughs as many over-the-counter options.A Cochrane review  – an independent review of evidence - suggested that for children over one year with coughs and colds, the use of honey and lemon could \"be of some benefit,\" adds Prof Smith.Cough it outIt's also worth remembering that coughing is necessary. It's how our body gets rid of the mucus.If it's a mucus-y cough, spitting out the excess can ease the airways.\"I will cough up whatever I need to,\" says Prof Smith. \"I won't try and suppress it, get it out.\" If you do, make sure you use a tissue. But should you swallow, no harm is done and the stomach can still break it down.You should only worry about the colour of what you're coughing up if it's dark brown as \"there may be some blood in it\".Most chesty coughs generally settle after a few weeks without needing antibiotics, but if it lingers beyond three weeks, Prof Smith urges people to go to their GP.More to explore",

    "body": "4 hours agoTinshui YeungUK MOD CrownHMS Glasgow is the first Type 26 frigate to be built for the Royal NavyThe UK and Norway have signed a defence pact that will see them operate a combined fleet to hunt Russian submarines in the North Atlantic.The deal is designed to protect undersea cables - which British officials say are increasingly under threat from Moscow - with a 30% rise in Russian vessels spotted in UK waters over the past two years, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).Under the agreement, the navies from the two Nato member states will operate a fleet of British-built Type-26 frigates.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the agreement \"historic\", saying that it strengthens the UK's ability to protect its critical infrastructure.The announcement comes as Sir Keir welcomes his Norwegian counterpart, Jonas Støre, to RAF Lossiemouth in northern Scotland on Thursday.The two leaders will hear from maritime patrol crews who have been tracking Russian vessels, including the spy ship Yantar, which was recently accused of pointing lasers to disrupt RAF pilots.Russia describes Yantar, which is operated by the country's Ministry of Defence, as an oceanic research vessel. Western nations have often tracked it in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables.Britain is heavily reliant on its network of undersea cables that carry data. There are also vital oil and gas pipelines connecting Britain to North Sea neighbours such as Norway.BBC Verify look at reports of a Russian spy ship entering UK waters and shining lasers at RAF planeThe Lunna House agreement - named after the Shetland Isles base used by the Norwegian resistance during the World War Two - is backed by a £10 billion UK-Norway warship deal signed in September.Norwegian Defence Minister Tore O Sandvik, who signed the deal with UK Defence Secretary John Healey, said the two countries would \"defend themselves together.\"At least 13 anti-submarine ships from the UK and Norway - at least five of them Norwegian - will operate jointly in northern Europe.The warships will monitor Russian naval movements in the waters between Greenland, Iceland and the UK, defending seabed cables and pipelines critical to British communications, electricity and gas networks.The agreement also extends to joint war gaming, and the use of UK-built Sting Ray torpedoes. Royal Marines will also receive training in Norway to fight in sub-zero conditions.The two countries will also collaborate to develop \"motherships\" for uncrewed mine hunting and undersea warfare systems, and the Royal Navy will adopt advanced Norwegian Naval Strike Missiles, which can take out enemy ships at ranges of more than 160km (100 miles).Healey said: \"In this new era of threat and with increasing Russian activity in the North Atlantic, our strength comes from hard power and strong alliances.\"The UK and its Nato allies have become increasingly concerned about the risk Moscow poses to underwater cables and pipelines, amid heightened tensions following the invasion of Ukraine.The Ministry of Defence has also come under criticism from a committee of MPs for being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack.Attacks on undersea infrastructure could cause \"catastrophic disruption\" to the financial and communications systems Britons rely on, the National Security Strategy Committee warned in a September report.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRachel Clun,business reporterandKevin Peachey,cost of living correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesHousehold energy bills will rise to help fund a £28bn investment in the UK's energy network.Energy regulator Ofgem has approved the funding in a five-year plan to improve electricity and gas grids. The money will go towards maintaining gas networks and strengthening the electricity transmission network.The work is estimated to add £108 to energy bills by 2031.But Ofgem said people would end up saving about £80 more than they otherwise would, as the investment will help lower the reliance on imported gas and make wholesale energy cheaper, leading to a net energy bill rise of about £30 a year.Companies that run energy networks - including power lines, cables and gas pipes - are separate from suppliers.This plan sets the framework for how they deliver a safe and secure supply, and the cost controls they face for five years, from next year.Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the investment \"will keep Britain's energy network among the safest, most secure and resilient in the world\".Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Brearley said the UK needed to move away from its dependence on gas.\"Gas has a really big part to play in our energy system for some time but we need to diversify our risk,\" he said.Spreading the risk means \"we'll be much better at electricity prices in the future and that will protect people's bills\".Ofgem chief Jonathan Brearley says the UK needs to move away from the dependence on gasOf the £108 Ofgem says will be added to energy bills, £48 will be for gas and £60 for electricity.But the regulator said the investment would deliver about £80 worth of savings, including £50 in savings alone from the energy grid expansion.Mr Brearley said the £108 added to bills by 2031 \"will go up over the five years, so it's not all happening at once\".\"It's about 2-3% on bills in April and increases roughly in a straight line from there.\"That would mean an additional £40-£50 from April.A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"Upgrading our gas and electricity networks after years of underinvestment is essential to keep the lights on and ensure energy security for our country.\"Energy bills remain relatively high, and are set to go up slightly in January after Ofgem separately announced a small rise to its price cap, which will increase a typical household's bill by £3 a year.The regulator's investment announcement also comes after a government pledge in the Budget to remove certain costs, which will cut about £150 from a typical annual energy bill. The investments approved by Ofgem include £17.8bn for the gas network. That includes funding for cyber security and gas pipe replacement.The £10.3bn in electricity funding will go towards projects including replacing ageing infrastructure, investing in new transmission lines and reinforcing the electricity grid so power can be moved around the network.Ofgem said the investment would also reduce inefficiencies in the system such as offshore windfarms being paid billions a year to switch off as the grid cannot take their power.At the moment, when it is very windy, the electricity grid cannot cope with the amount of energy generated by the UK's offshore windfarms as there are not enough cables to transmit it.Speaking ahead of Ofgem's announcement, Scottish Power chief executive Keith Anderson told the BBC's Today programme the removal of constraints in the system was important.\"It will give us a system that is fit for purpose for the country for the 21st Century,\" he said.National Gas owns and operates Britain's gas transmission network, and will receive funding through the Ofgem plan.Its chief executive Jon Butterworth welcomed the investment, saying it confirmed \"the critical role that the gas transmission system plays in Britain's energy security now and for decades to come\".He said the company would undertake a detailed review of the decision in the coming weeks to ensure that it also \"supports the country's clean energy ambitions\".Lawrence Slade, chief executive of the Energy Networks Association, said Ofgem's announcement was \"a significant point in our plans for delivering an electricity transmission network that will supply the clean, more affordable and secure energy the country needs for future growth\".Energy UK chief executive Dhara Vyas said the increased investment was critical, but the added cost for businesses and households needed to be considered by the government so that it was funded \"in the fairest way possible\" and with certainty around future costs.Greenpeace UK's senior climate adviser, Charlie Kronick, said the energy grid was \"no longer fit for purpose\" and needed immediate, vital upgrades. But he added there must be \"robust safeguards and strong regulation\" to protect bill payers and provide value for money.Simon Francis from campaign group End Fuel Poverty Coalition echoed the concerns from Greenpeace, saying network and transmission companies should not be handed a blank cheque and should come with \"proper scrutiny\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoLeigh Boobyer,BBC WalesandJohn Maguire,SwanseaFamily handoutKyle Sieniawski, 14, is believed to be the youngest person in the UK to have died with motor neurone diseaseThe family of a teenage boy who died after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) has warned the rare, degenerative condition can hit \"anybody at any age, at any time\".Kyle Sieniawski, 14, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, died on 27 November, after being diagnosed less than a year ago with MND. The disease typically affects people aged over 50, and Kyle is believed to be the youngest person to have died with MND in the UK.Former rugby league star Kevin Sinfield, who is currently running seven ultramarathons in seven days for MND awareness, told Kyle's family the \"community\" will be there for them, and Kyle \"will always be remembered\".Kyle's mum, Melanie Sieniawski, told BBC Breakfast: \"It can affect anybody at any age, at any time. \"They need [to do] as much fundraising and awareness as they can - to get a cure as soon as possible.\"His father, Mark, said the family wanted to keep raising awareness. \"To be honest what Melanie and I went through was horrific\", he said, describing his son's condition as \"horrendous to watch\".Kyle Sieniawski died less than a year after being diagnosed with Motor Neurone DiseaseIn January, aged 13, Kyle was diagnosed with MND after he began losing mobility in his arm. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was subsequently left unable to use any of his limbs. Following his diagnosis, Kyle's family said they were \"desperate\" to bring him home from hospital but were unable to do so because their property could not be adapted to meet his needs.His parents and brother, Liam, spent more than nine months living with him at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff.He relied on a breathing mask and feeding tube, and was moved into intensive care last month after developing an infection.Family handoutKevin Sinfield met Kyle's family in Swansea during his ultramarathon fundraising challenge for MNDKyle 'was a fighter'Kyle's family described him as \"brilliant\" and a \"troublemaker\", adding \"his personality shone right through\".Mr Sieniawski said the teenager \"was a fighter\", and had received visits from many others affected by MND while in hospital.\"They all thought he was brilliant,\" he said.\"He touched so many people, to be honest. He was amazing. \"He had banter and laughter with everybody. We had so many strangers come to visit him. They all thought he was amazing.\"Family handoutKyle died less than a year after he was diagnosed with MNDEx-Leeds Rhinos rugby player Sinfield met Kyle's family at Gorseinon Rugby Club, Swansea, midway through his latest MND fundraising challenge on Wednesday.The 45-year-old took on the challenge in honour of his friend and former teammate Rob Burrow, who died with MND in June last year.Sinfield began the 7 in 7: Together challenge in Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk, on 1 December, and is undertaking seven ultramarathons across UK to Ireland, before concluding the challenge in Leeds on Sunday.He is running at least 45km (27.9 miles) each day of his challenge, in bursts of 7km (4.3 miles).In south Wales, he took time out to meet Kyle's family on the third of his ultramarathons, with hundreds of wellwishers joining him for part of the route through Swansea.\"We'll run a bit faster and harder this leg,\"  he told Kyle's family.The player-turned-rugby coach hopes to raise £777,777 - in honour of the number seven shirt worn by Burrows - to add to the more than £10m he has raised since 2020.Family handout'His personality shone right through,\" said Kyle's parents, paying tribute to their sonFollowing their son's death last week, Kyle's family said in a statement: \"Kyle fought with everything he had, but in the end it all became too much for him and he very sadly passed away.\"\"We're just completely heartbroken.\"Kyle... we'll miss you so very much buddy and we love you more than words could ever possibly say.\"What is MND?MND affects nerves found in the brain and spinal cord, which tell your muscles what to do.This leads the muscles to weaken and stiffen over time and ultimately impacts how you walk, talk, eat and breathe.It is a relatively rare condition, and is most commonly diagnosed in people over 50.A person's lifetime risk of developing MND is one in 300; about 5,000 adults in the UK will have the disease at any one time.More top stories",

    "body": "3 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe number of flu patients in hospital has hit a record high in England for this time of year with NHS leaders warning the country is facing an unprecedented flu season.NHS figures show there were an average of 1,700 patients in hospital with flu last week - that is more than 50% higher than the same time last year - and early indications from this week are that hospitalisations have continued climbing sharply since.It comes as the flu season hit a month earlier than normal this year, with experts warning there appears to be a more severe strain of the virus circulating.And NHS bosses are urging patients not to clog up A&E with everyday niggles as new figures show thousands turned to hospitals for minor ailments such as hiccups and ingrowing toenails last winter.There were more than 200,000 A&E attendances in England from November to February for conditions that could have been dealt with elsewhere, according to NHS England.This represents more than 2% of all attendances during that four-month period, taking up vital resources at under-pressure A&Es, health bosses said.Patients with such minor conditions are being advised to seek help elsewhere, including from pharmacists, GPs and NHS 111 – either via the phone or online – as some of them can be managed at home.NHS England urgent and emergency care director Prof Julian Redhead said alongside the high number of flu cases in hospital the NHS was having to plan for more doctor strikes in the lead up to Christmas.British Medical Association members are taking part in a five-day walkout from 17 December in their long-running pay dispute.Prof Redhead said: \"Today's numbers confirm our deepest concerns - the health service is bracing for an unprecedented flu wave this winter. Cases are incredibly high for this time of year and there is no peak in sight yet.\"He said staff could be stretched \"close to breaking point\" in the coming weeks.Already close to 2% of beds are occupied by flu patients, with the 1,700 average last week the highest at this point of winter since records began in 2010. And at an NHS England board meeting on Thursday morning chief executive Sir Jim Mackey warned the numbers were continuing to rise sharply.\"We've had a really, really big increase,\" he said.He suggested by the end of next week there could be anywhere between 5,000 and 8,000 beds occupied by flu patients. The highest level ever recorded so far is 5,400.He said with this in mind the forthcoming doctor strike felt \"cruel\" and \"calculated\" and aimed at \"causing mayhem\".Prof Redhead said because of the demands being place on the NHS it was vital patients used services sensibly.NHS England published A&E attendance figures showing between 1 November 2024 and 28 February 2025 there were:6,382 visits for nasal congestion 83,705 visits for earache 96,998 visits for sore throats3,890 visits for ingrowing nails8,669 for itching skin384 for hiccupsThe attendances were to either major A&E units or minor injury units run by hospitals.Although research shows one of the factors driving unnecessary A&E visits is difficulty accessing GP services, with latest figures showing more than a fifth of patients cannot get through to their GP on the day they try.And Dr Vicky Price, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the emphasis on unnecessary A&E attendances was just a \"smokescreen\" to distract from the pressures frontline staff were dealing with.She pointed out that there had already been nearly half a million waits of over 12 hours in A&E for patients, depriving htem of privacy and dignity.\"These delays are not caused by minor ailments but are a result of a failure to address the longstanding issues of capacity, flow and workforce.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

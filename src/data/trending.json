The White House Chief of Staff, referred to by the president as the “most powerful woman in the world”, is the gatekeeper to the Oval Office and a crucial figure in delivering Trump’s national agenda. \nShe also rarely speaks to the media, making her an elusive figure in the president’s top team despite her significant influence. But in a series of interviews for Vanity Fair, she refers to Donald Trump as having an “alcoholic’s personality”, describes JD Vance as a “conspiracy theorist” and Elon Musk as an “odd, odd duck”. The White House has described the articles as a “framed hit piece” and accused Vanity Fair of taking statements out of context.\nIn today’s podcast, Justin and Anthony go through some of the most revealing lines from the interviews, and speak to the journalist who sat down with Susie Wiles - Chris Whipple - to find out why he thinks Wiles wanted to speak with him, and how he responds to White House criticism of the interviews.\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\nChris Whipple, Journalist and author of several White House books, including Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History \nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

    "body": "4 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesA Paris court has rejected an effort by the French government to suspend the website of fast-fashion giant Shein in response to it selling childlike sex dolls on its platform.The court said the request for a three-month suspension was \"disproportionate\" - but did order age verification for the sale of adult products.The action against Shein was taken after France's consumer watchdog last month reported it to authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" and weapons. Shein said its priority remained protecting French consumers and ensuring compliance.The court acknowledged the seriousness of selling the childlike sex dolls and weapons in its judgement, but said these had been isolated incidents. It noted that the Chinese company had taken action to remove the offending items once it had been made aware of them, and that the issues related to a small number of the hundreds of thousands of products on sale on its site. In response to the initial controversy, Shein announced it would be banning the sale of all sex dolls on its site internationally. A request by the French government for Shein to be forced to suspend the sale of third-party items on its website - the source of the initial offending items - was also rejected. In ordering age verification measures to be put in place for the sale of adult items, the court said the fine for each breach would be €10,000 (£8,700; $11,700). The decision to suspend Shein's website in early November coincided with the company opening its first physical store in the French capital. Its launch drew both shoppers and protesters, with opposition related to the sale of childlike sex dolls, and also its profile as a fast-fashion retailer. Shein said in a statement: \"We remain committed to continuously improving our control processes, in close collaboration with the French authorities, with the aim of establishing some of the most stringent standards in the industry.\"Our priority remains protecting French consumers and ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations.\"",

    "body": "8 minutes agoCachella SmithEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe Trevi Fountain is one of Rome's key attractions with around nine million visitors this yearTourists in Italy's capital Rome will soon have to pay a €2 (£1.75; $2.34) entrance fee if they want to see its famed Trevi Fountain up close.The new barrier for visitors to view the Baroque monument will come into force from 1 February 2026.While the coins tossed into the fountain are donated to charity, the fees collected will go to the city authority to pay for upkeep and managing visitors. The city expects to raise €6.5m a year from the fountain alone.Announcing the move on Friday, Rome's Mayor Roberto ‌Gualtieri was quote by news agency Reuters as saying that \"two euros isn't very much ... and it will lead to less chaotic tourist flows\".The Trevi levy is part of a new tariff system for certain museums and monuments in the Italian capital.Access to a number of sites that currently charge for entry will become free for Rome's residents, such as the Sacred Area of Largo Argentina.At the same time, tourists and non-residents will have to pay to see the Trevi fountain and five other attractions including the Napoleonic Museum.Children under the age of five, and those with disabilities and an accompanying person, will be exempt from the fees.Tourists will still be able to view the Trevi Fountain - built by Italian architect Nicola Salvi in the 18th Century - for free from a distance.The site currently sees an average of 30,000 visitors per day, according to the City of Rome.Following restoration work which took place last year, Gualtieri introduced a queuing system to prevent large crowds massing around the landmark.Access is capped at 400 people at the same time.",

    "body": "After 17 hours of at times heated debate, EU leaders agreed in the early hours of Friday morning to jointly raise €90bn (£79bn; $105bn) in zero-interest loans to keep Ukraine financially afloat for the next two years. Kyiv had been clear: the money wasn't a nice-to-have; it was a must-have. With the US under Donald Trump no longer looking to provide new direct military aid to Ukraine, the war-torn country has turned to Europe. Without the cash, Volodymyr Zelensky told EU leaders he wouldn't have enough money to pay Ukrainian soldiers or buy the weapons he needed to counter Russian aggression.The now agreed EU loan will be guaranteed by the bloc's common budget. But in a blow to Brussels' desire to demonstrate decisive European unity over Ukraine to EU sceptics in Washington and Moscow, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic only agreed to support the plan -  it required unanimity to be passed - if they were exempt from it individually. Yet another indication of the divisions in Europe over attitudes to Ukraine and to Moscow.Hungary and Slovakia are known to be closer to the Kremlin. This brings them into direct confrontation with EU countries geographically nearer to Russia such as Poland and the Baltic States. They view Ukraine's survival against Russia as existential. If Kyiv were to lose to Moscow on the battlefield because it was cash or weapons-strapped, they believe that would embolden Russia and would be a disaster for European security and stability more broadly.Arriving at the start of Thursday's fraught summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said EU leaders had a clear decision to make: pay money today, he said, or pay in blood tomorrow. He said he wasn't talking about Ukraine. He was talking about Europe.The new EU joint-loan plan for Ukraine replaces a much-debated EU proposal to raise the €90bn using frozen Russian state assets held in the bloc (€210bn euros' worth in total), mostly in Belgium. Kyiv had described that idea as morally justified, considering the billions of dollars' worth of destruction wreaked by Moscow on Ukraine. But a number of EU countries feared legal retribution by Russia. They worried too that the eurozone's international reputation as a safe destination for global assets could be damaged. Brussels said on Friday it was considering using the frozen Russian assets eventually, to repay the EU loan to Ukraine. But that would be something to be worked out in the future - if a peace deal is signed.For now, on top of the new EU loan, it's estimated Ukraine will need another €45bn euros to cover all its costs for 2026/2027.Brussels hopes non-EU allies of Ukraine like the UK, Japan and Canada might pick up some of that tab. Not going bankrupt now also opens the door for Kyiv to receive loans from banks like the IMF.",

He was found guilty of secretly drugging his wife, Gisèle, and inviting scores of men to rape her while she was unconscious for years.Gisèle's decision to waive her anonymity and hold a public trial turned her into a feminist icon, celebrated for her powerful testimony and courage.Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office, the BKA, says that the victims of sedation and subsequent sexual abuse are \"almost exclusively women\".It says such crimes \"usually take place by exploiting a relationship of trust\" in marriage, partnerships, families or among close acquaintances.",

    "body": "The UK has announced sanctions against militia leaders and groups it says were involved in violence against civilians in Syria.Three groups and four commanders have had their assets frozen over their involvement in suspected atrocities during clashes in coastal regions which saw about 1,400 killed earlier this year, as well as during the Syrian civil war, the Foreign Office said.Two businessmen will also face sanctions over their financial support for ex-President Bashar al-Assad's regime.\"Accountability and justice for all Syrians is vital to ensure a successful and sustainable political settlement\" following the sudden downfall of Assad's rule in 2024, the foreign secretary said.\"These designations send a clear message to those who seek to undermine the peaceful and prosperous future of all Syrians,\" Yvette Cooper added.Cooper said the UK remained committed to working with the Syrian government to \"support the country's economic recovery and deliver for a Syria that recognises the voices and needs of all citizens\".Since Islamist-led rebels ousted Assad last December, sectarian divisions have been exposed in Syria.Violence erupted this spring along Syria's coast, pitting security forces of the new government - mostly Sunni Muslims - against armed men linked to the former regime. The clashes occurred in the heartland of the Alawites - an offshoot sect of Shia Islam which Assad belongs to.Under Assad's 24-year rule, peaceful protests against his regime were violently repressed, eventually leading to 13 years of civil war that saw more than half a million people killed.The individuals sanctioned by the UK government are: Ghaith Dalla – A former senior regime military commander, leader of a pro-regime militia group.Miqdad Fatiha – A former regime military commander, leader of a pro-regime militia group.Mohammad al-Jasim – Commander of Sultan Suleiman Shah militia group.Sayf Boulad – Commander of Hamza Division militia groupMudallal Khoury – a Syrian-Russian businessman who helped finance the activities of the Assad regimeImad Khoury –a Syrian-Russian businessman who helped finance the activities of the Assad regimeThey will be subject to an asset freeze, travel ban and banned from acting as company directors in the UK.The militant groups Sultan Murad Division, Sultan Suleiman Shah Division and Hamzat Division are also subject to an asset freeze under the sanctions, the Foreign Office also said. Earlier this year, the UK lifted asset freezes on Syrian bodies including government departments and the country's central bank following its change of regime.The then Foreign Secretary David Lammy visited the country in July and met its interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa.

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul Hastie,Paris GourtsoyannisandJosh Martin,Business reporterGetty ImagesBaroness Michelle Mone in the House of Lords with her businessman husband Douglas BarrowmanThe UK Government is unlikely to see most of the £148m it is owed by a faulty PPE supplier linked to Baroness Michelle Mone after the company was wound up.PPE Medpro, a consortium run by Mone's husband Douglas Barrowman, was placed into liquidation at the Insolvency and Companies Court on Thursday. It follows a High Court ruling in October, which found that the firm breached a contract to supply 25 million surgical gowns during the Covid pandemic.PPE Medpro filed for administration in September, a day before the order to pay. HM Revenue & Customs is separately owed £39m in tax.Records filed by PPE Medpro's administrators have revealed it only had around £600,000 available to pay unsecured creditors.At the Insolvency and Companies Court, barristers for the three joint administrators asked for the firm to be kept in administration to pay off money owed.But lawyers for the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said PPE Medpro was \"hopelessly insolvent\" and asked for the firm to be wound up.Despite the order to pay back the money, as an unsecured creditor it's unlikely the DHSC will recover the millions of pounds owed.In his ruling, Judge Sebastian Prentis placed the company into liquidation.He said: \"The department's debt is very large indeed and it is a debt which has been incurred through the supply of defective equipment at a time of national crisis.\"Judge Prentis said that there would be \"questions of how this debt may be recovered\" from the firm, adding that there was \"very little\" money left.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the DHSC would not rest until it had got back the \"hard-earned taxpayer money paid to rogue operators like PPE Medpro\".He added: \"During the pandemic, when the whole country was making huge sacrifices, separated from family and loved ones, PPE Medpro supplied defective PPE and unfairly profited.\"We will keep going after PPE Medpro with everything we've got to get these funds back where they belong - in our NHS.\"'Establishment win'PPE Medpro was awarded lucrative contracts worth £122m to supply medical gowns to the NHS during the pandemic.It gained access to the  government's VIP lane to fast-track approved suppliers.However, the equipment has been in storage since 2020 after the company failed to prove it was correctly sterilised.Mone described the October court ruling as \"nothing less than an establishment win for the government in a case that was too big to lose\".She was made a peer by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015, but took a leave of absence and lost the Tory whip following the PPE revelations. Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Kemi Badenoch have both urged the Baroness to depart the Lords altogether.The UK government's insolvency service confirmed that an officer had been appointed to manage PPE Medpro's liquidation.A spokesperson said: \"As with all cases of this nature, they will investigate the cause of the company's failure and conduct of directors.\"Interpath Advisory were appointed joint liquidators of the company. They will wind up the company's affairs in accordance with their statutory duties.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoBecky Morton,Political reporterandDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentGetty ImagesForeign nationals working as prison officers in the UK have been given a temporary exemption from new visa rules, following warnings some jails were facing a staffing crisis.Prisons have increasingly been relying on overseas recruits, particularly from Nigeria and Ghana.But organisations representing officers had warned jails faced losing thousands of staff, after the government increased the minimum salary requirement for a skilled worker visa.The Ministry of Justice said the move would \"ensure jails can continue to run safely with the right level of experienced staff\".Under changes introduced in July as part of efforts to reduce migration, individuals must earn at least £41,700 to obtain a skilled worker visa, up from £38,700.The starting salary for a prison officer is generally below this amount, particularly outside London.The Prison Officers Association (POA) said the salary threshold changes meant jails stood to lose more than 2,500 overseas recruits, which it said would have had \"a catastrophic effect on prison stability\".Meanwhile, chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor warned earlier this year that many jails were heavily dependent on prison officers recruited from west Africa.He said many were in danger of not having their visas renewed, which would have a \"devastating effect\" on prisons.The exemption only applies to applicants already in the country and lasts until the end of 2026, with a lower salary threshold of £33,400 in place until 31 December 2027.The POA welcomed the new exemption, calling it a victory for \"common sense\".The trade union's general secretary Steve Gillan said: \"It might not be perfect, but it will mean the prison service hopefully can remain stable.\"The association's national chairman Mark Fairhurst added: \"Our members can now go about their daily lives without the threat of removal from the country.\" The Times newspaper reported that Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood had initially resisted granting the exemption, arguing that the focus should be on recruiting British people.Earlier this week, Justice Secretary David Lammy told MPs he was in discussions with Mahmood over the issue.He stressed that he wanted to recruit more prison officers locally, but \"the most important thing\" was to meet the demand for prison places.A Home Office source said prisons were being treated differently given their importance to public safety and national security. They denied Mahmood was against the move, but said she wanted it to be temporary, with prisons hiring British workers in the future.A Ministry of Justice source said prisons were under strain and the exemption would provide \"breathing space\" to structure a programme to hire more officers from the UK.A government spokesperson said: \"Net migration has already fallen by more than two-thirds under this government. We are clear numbers must fall further as we create a migration system that is controlled and fair.\"However, public safety is the first duty of any government and we must ensure jails can continue to run safely with the right level of experienced staff. This is vital given the prison capacity crisis we inherited.\"Prisons have been able to sponsor visa applications for overseas recruits since 2023 due to a shortage of British applicants.In April, the government revealed more than 700 Nigerians had been recruited to work in UK prisons last year, with the nationality accounting for 29% of job applicants and 12% of staff hired at jails in England and Wales.This made Nigerians the most common nationality behind Britons to apply for or be offered a job in UK prisons in 2024. This was followed by people from Ghana, who had 140 job offers.The Prison Governors Association has said a surge in applications from west Africa appears to have been fuelled by word of mouth and jobs being promoted online by the expat Nigerian community.",

    "body": "5 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondentandDoug FaulknerUN-backed experts say there have been improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since the ceasefire, but 100,000 people still experienced \"catastrophic conditions\" last month. In August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) which monitors and classifies global hunger crises said that half a million people - about a quarter of Gaza's population - lived in areas suffering from famine.The UN and other humanitarian agencies have been able to increase food getting into Gaza since October's ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC report was \"deliberately distorted\" and \"doesn't reflect the reality in the Gaza Strip\".The latest IPC analysis suggests that a month ago, half a million Gazans were still facing emergency conditions and more than 100,000 were still under the highest level of food insecurity - IPC Phase 5 - experiencing \"catastrophic conditions\". It projects that number will continue to decrease but stressed the situation remains \"highly fragile\".  IPC Phase 5 signifies the most extreme level of food insecurity, labelled \"famine\" for an area or \"catastrophe\" when referring to households. The report said no areas in Gaza were now classified as \"in famine\".Israel rejected the original findings of famine by the IPC and has continued to criticise its methodology.  Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's crossings, said the number of trucks with food aid entering each week went beyond what the UN had determined it needed.\"The report relies on severe gaps in data collection and on sources that do not reflect the full scope of humanitarian assistance,\" the body said in a statement.Responding to the Cogat ctiticism, the IPC said publicly available data from UN sources and Cogat had been used for the analysis. The IPC said acute malnutrition was at critical levels in Gaza City and serious in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis.In the coming months the situation is expected to remain severe but the number of people facing the most severe conditions is predicted to fall to 1,900 by April, according to the report.But it added that, if there were renewed hostilities, the entire Strip would be at risk of famine.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that the second phase of the US-brokered peace plan - which would see Israel withdraw troops further from Gaza and Hamas disarm - was close but key issues still needed to be resolved.The IPC said key drivers of food insecurity included restricted humanitarian access, displacement of more than 730,000 people and the destruction of livelihoods - including more than 96% of crop land in Gaza being destroyed or inaccessible.Israel imposed a total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March this year, which was eased in May, saying it wanted to put pressure on the armed group Hamas to release hostages remaining in Gaza at the time.Ahead of this IPC report, Cogat said the body had not engaged with the US or Israel and its methodology, \"reinforcing a false narrative, driven in part by Hamas-sourced claims\".It also denied Israel was preventing winter and medical supplies from entering the territory and that there was a shortage of drinking water.Unwra, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said that while, the report stated Gaza was no longer in famine, the situation remained \"critical\".\"Overall living conditions in the Gaza Strip are still catastrophic, made worse by the winter weather,\" it said in a statement, adding there must be \"sustained, expanded, and consistent humanitarian and commercial access\".",

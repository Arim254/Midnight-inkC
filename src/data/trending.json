    "body": "2 hours agoJamie WhiteheadBBCA number of people are feared to have been killed and injured in Nigeria after an explosion in a mosque in Borno state. Eyewitnesses said the blast in the Gamboru market of Maiduguri, the state capital, happened during evening prayers. One report suggests seven people were killed, but there has been no official confirmation of any casualties. Unverified footage on social media appears to show the aftermath of the explosion, with people stood in a market area with dust particles in the air. No group has admitted carrying out the attack, but militants have previously targeted mosques and crowded places in the area with suicide and improvised explosive device (IED) attacks.Maiduguri has been central to an insurgency by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province. Military operations by Boko Haram to create an Islamic caliphate in Borno state began in 2009. Security measures against the group have failed to prevent sporadic attacks against civilians in north-east Nigeria. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoJames FitzGeraldPA MediaKimberlee Singler was detained in London two years agoA Colorado mother who is accused of murdering two of her children has been extradited from the UK to the US, authorities say.Kimberlee Singler, 37, is alleged to have carried out the attack in Colorado before fleeing to London, where she was arrested in December 2023.She challenged her extradition at Westminster Magistrates Court - reportedly on the basis that her sentence, if she was convicted, would break European human rights law. But she was unsuccessful.A district attorney in Colorado confirmed on Tuesday that Ms Singler was back in the US and was in custody. She was being held without bond and was expected to appear in court \"in the coming days\".The district attorney, Michael Allen, said Ms Singler was facing charges of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse and one count of assault.At the extradition hearing in London, the court heard that Ms Singler's alleged crimes were \"committed against the backdrop of acrimonious court proceedings\" relating to the custody of her children with her ex-husband.Prosecutor Joel Smith said police in Colorado Springs responded to a 911 call reporting a burglary at a Colorado residence at 00:29 local time (06:29 GMT) on 19 December 2023.When officers arrived at the defendant's address, they found her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son dead and a \"blood-stained handgun\", which was discovered on the floor of the bedroom.Mr Smith said DNA tests were carried out on the gun and a knife which revealed the presence of mixed profiles matching the children and Ms Singler.A third child, who has not been named, was found with a serious injury to her neck. She was taken to hospital and survived.Mr Smith said Ms Singler blamed her husband for the attack, but it was found he had been driving a \"GPS-tracked truck\" in Denver, giving what the prosecutor described as a \"complete and verifiable alibi\".Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Adrian Vasquez, the Colorado Springs police chief, said the extradition of Ms Singler was \"a significant milestone\" in the investigation.Chief Vasquez added: \"I know these acts have deeply impacted this community, and our hearts remain with the victims.\"",

    "body": "US authorities have discovered more than a million more documents potentially related to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein that they plan to release in the coming days and weeks, officials say. The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice (DoJ) about the discovery and turned over the documents for lawyers to review.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,\" the DoJ said on social media on Wednesday. The department said that given the volume of material, the process could take \"a few more weeks\".The agency said it would \"continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump's direction to release the files\". The statement did not specify how the FBI and New York prosecutors came across the additional material. The news comes after the justice department released thousands of documents last week - some heavily redacted - related to their investigations into Epstein. The files were released after Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act - signed into law by US President Donald Trump - that ordered the agency to share all the documents with the public while protecting victims’ identities. Many of the documents released last week had names and other information blacked out, including names of people the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case.The justice department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the  aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations. The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".Included in the first release of documents were emails appearing to be exchanged between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein.The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the justice department.This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

    "body": "4 hours agoGabriela PomeroyandAnastasiia Levchenko,Kyiv Three people - including two police officers - have been killed in an explosion in Moscow, Russian authorities have said. Two traffic police officers saw a \"suspicious individual\" near a police car on the city's Yeletskaya Street, and when they approached the suspect to detain him, an explosive device was detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee has said. Reports in Russia say the third person killed was the suspect, but this has not been officially confirmed. The blast took place close to the location where a senior Russian general was killed in a car bombing in the capital on Monday. Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died after an explosive device - which had been planted under a car - was detonated.Investigate Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement on Telegram that a criminal case was being investigated in Moscow \"regarding an attempt on the lives of traffic police officers\". The officers have been named by Russian media as Ilya Klimanov, 24, and Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Sources in Ukraine's military intelligence agency, HUR, told the BBC that a local resident, eliminated two representatives of the Russian law enforcement agency, \"as a sign of disagreement with the Kremlin's aggressive policy\" and said that a man \"threw an explosive package through the car window, causing an explosion\".According to the HUR sources, two other people were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Ukrainian military sources also told the BBC on Wednesday that the two officers killed had \"participated in hostilities against Ukraine,\" and added there was \"evidence of their involvement in the torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war\".There are no details and Moscow has not commented. Speaking to Reuters news agency, Alexander, a resident who lives close by, said: \"There was an explosion.\"It was loud bang - like with the car a few days ago.\"Russia said it suspected Ukraine was behind Monday's explosion, without providing any evidence. However Ukraine has not said whether it was involved in Fanil Sarvarov's death.It is also not known whether the two explosions are linked. Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department.He was the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year.",

    "body": "10 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentThe government's partial U-turn on what opponents dubbed the \"farms tax\" was a Christmas present for those who had campaigned against the imposition of 20% inheritance tax from next April.About half the farms that would have been affected will now be exempt.But given that minsters had defended the policy in the 14 months since last year's Budget, the questions are: Why change it? And why now?Sustained protests - the regular convoys of tractors, horns blaring, converging on Parliament Square - certainly played a part. The National Farmers' Union which had organised the noisy demonstrations had also engaged in quieter diplomacy behind the scenes with Downing Street and the agriculture department. It has been reported that discussions shifted to mitigating rather than obliterating the policy completely. But there are other factors.A consequence of last year's landslide Labour election victory is that more of the party's MPs represent rural and semi-rural seats. Behind closed doors, some of them had been pressing hard for concessions. While only one voted against, more than 30 of them actively abstained on a parliamentary vote on the inheritance tax policy earlier this month to demonstrate their concerns.Beyond this, the reasons for the timing of the government's volte face are speculative.One of the rural rebels told me that conversations with ministers had been more positive this month - though they had not been told in advance of yesterday's announcement.And some believe that Sir Keir Starmer's appearance this month before the liaison committee - which consists of senior MPs who chair cross-party parliamentary committees - played a role.He was subjected to uncomfortable questioning by the Labour MP Cat Smith and the Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, both of whom in effect suggested some farmers were contemplating suicide - or as Smith put it, \"actively planning to expedite their own deaths\" - before inheritance tax was introduced next April so they could pass on their family farms.The prospect of personal tragedies - and awful headlines - was made very clear to the prime minister.Downing Street is keen to get on the front foot when MPs return to Parliament in January, and dispelling this particular political dark cloud might have been regarded as an essential precursor.The Conservatives maintain that the policy change was \"sneaked out\" while MPs were away and could not subject ministers to scrutiny.A recess reversal certainly does not radiate confidence from a government that has 400 of parliament's 650 seats.While some Labour MPs are relieved that the government has listened, others are wondering why it persisted with a policy that was going to raise relatively little revenue. This change is going to cost £130m. To put that in context, it is a tiny fraction of the around £900bn generated in total in taxation annually.And of course with Labour trailing in the polls, there are concerns about the government's ability to make the political weather.Something of a modus operandi is emerging where revenue raising policies are announced by the Treasury, then there is a public backlash, and internal Labour discontent followed some time later by a partial reversal once the political damage has been sustained.Think winter fuel, welfare reform and now family farms.The policies may have changed but questions over political judgment remain.",

    "body": "6 hours agoFaarea Masud & Simon BrowningBBC NewsGetty ImagesThe number of passengers passing through UK airports will be the most ever seen on any Christmas Eve since records began in 1972, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said.It projects over 335,000 people will be flying in the UK on Wednesday, which is up 5% from Christmas Eve in 2024, though minimal disruption is expected.Britain's roads are also expected to see one of the busiest Christmas Eves since records began said the RAC, though another motoring lobby says traffic peaks for the season have passed.The RAC said the worst time to travel on Wednesday is from 1pm to 7pm as millions hit the road to get home before Christmas Day on Thursday, with delays expected on major routes.Manchester airport said on Christmas Eve it expects around 75,000 passengers passing through, with 208 flights leaving the UK, but that number will halve on Christmas Day. Its most popular destinations on Christmas Eve are Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin.Heathrow meanwhile says it is expecting its busiest December period ever, including 152,000 passengers using it on Christmas Day. EasyJet said 558 flights will depart on Christmas Day, part of \"its busiest festive season ever\".Stansted Airport said Christmas Day for it, meanwhile, will be relatively quiet.The busiest single day of the festive period for air travel was Friday 19 December.Getty ImagesThe RAC meanwhile said particular tight spots on the roads will be the clockwise northern and western sections of the M25 from mid-morning, and the M5 north from Gloucestershire towards the West Midlands later in the afternoon.While millions will travel by rail, earlier last-train times mean many may take to the road, making them even more congested. Several rail routes will be restricted or closed over the Christmas period for maintenance.National Rail trains do not run on Christmas Day and only a small number will run on Boxing Day.National Express coaches says it is running on Christmas day to 96 destinations.The RAC's mobile servicing and repair's team leader Nick Mullender said 2025 was \"looking to be the busiest getaway period since our records began\" in 2013.He said this year's Christmas Eve would be the busiest, with workers saving on annual leave days and  heading off on getaways at the last minute.Meanwhile the AA, which provides traffic updates across the UK, said 19 December was the busiest part of the season.For Christmas Eve, it warned the M27 will close in both directions between Junction 9 (Whiteley/Park Gate) and Junction 11 (Fareham East/Gosport) from 8pm until 4am on 4 January for major works at Junction 10.This closure affects road journeys between Southampton and Portsmouth.Drivers are advised to check tyres, expect delays and ensure oil and coolant levels are correct. It expected a rise in breakdowns as the weather becomes colder and 4.2 million journeys will be taken on roads.You can see how weather will affect your Christmas travel plans on the road.You can see here how other transport, such as ferries, are affected.",

    "body": "Two British campaigners are among five people denied US visas after the State Department accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" American tech platforms into suppressing free speech.Imran Ahmed, an ex-Labour adviser who now heads the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), and Clare Melford, CEO of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), were labelled \"radical activists\" by the Trump administration and banned from entering the US.A French ex-EU commissioner and two senior figures at a Germany-based anti-online hate group were also denied visas.European leaders have condemned the measures, while the UK government said it is \"fully committed\" to upholding free speech.\"While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content,\" a UK government spokesperson said.French President Emmanuel Macron described the travel ban as \"intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty\" while the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"unacceptable and an attempt to challenge our sovereignty\".The US billed the measures as a response to people and organisations that have campaigned for restrictions on American tech firms, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying they belonged to a \"global censorship-industrial complex\".He said: \"President Trump has been clear that his America First foreign policy rejects violations of American sovereignty. Extraterritorial overreach by foreign censors targeting American speech is no exception.\"Ahmed from the CCDH, which says it advocates for government action against hate speech and disinformation online, has links to senior Labour figures. He was previously an aide to Labour minister Hilary Benn, and Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney has served as a director of the group he founded.The US government labelled Ahmed a \"collaborator\" for the CCDH's purported past work with the Biden administration. BBC News has contacted the CCDH for comment.Melford founded the GDI, a non-profit that monitors the spread of disinformation, in 2018.US Undersecretary of State Sarah B Rogers accused the GDI of using US taxpayer money \"to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press\". A GDI spokesperson told the BBC that \"the visa sanctions announced today are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\".\"The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.\"Also targeted was Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, who suggested that a \"witch hunt\" was taking place.Breton was described by the State Department as the \"mastermind\" of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes content moderation on social media firms. However, it has angered some US conservatives who see it as seeking to censor right-wing opinions. Brussels denies this.Breton has clashed with Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of X, over obligations to follow EU rules.The European Commission recently fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges - the first fine under the DSA. It said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\".In response, Musk's site blocked the Commission from sharing adverts on its platform.Reacting to the visa ban, Breton posted on X: \"To our American friends: Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"Also subject to bans were Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of HateAid, a German organisation that the State Department said helped enforce the DSA.In a statement to the BBC, the two CEOs called it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary\". They added: \"We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "5 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThe amount of flu circulating has started to fall in England, latest data suggests.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it was encouraging news heading into Christmas, but warned the virus could always bounce back in the new year.The UKHSA uses a range of different measures to monitor flu rates, including sample testing in hospitals and in GP practices.The latest data covers last week up to Sunday with the UKHSA concluding the virus was circulating \"at medium levels\".Similar trends are being seen elsewhere in the UK. Public Health Scotland said it had seen two weeks of cases decreasing.The fall in England comes after the agency said last week that the spread was stabilising after several weeks of rises.This year's flu season started early, driven by a mutated strain of the virus, which prompted concern about the pressure that could be placed on hospitals.NHS England data for the total number of people in hospital is not being published this week.But there are signs in UKHSA's sample testing that the numbers being admitted to hospital are beginning to fall, suggesting the projections of record numbers of patients ending up in hospital with the virus over the festive period will not be realised.Dr Jamie Lopez-Bernal, an infectious diseases expert at UKHSA, said it was \"encouraging news\".But he added: \"The virus is still very much with us and everyone, especially those most vulnerable to winter bugs, needs to take care to protect themselves or help not to spread these viruses to others.\"This is particularly important over Christmas as families come together to celebrate. So if you have any cold or flu-like symptoms you should try to minimise contact with others.\"He said there were simple steps we can all take to protect one another when mixing indoors.\"Washing hands regularly and ensuring indoor spaces are well ventilated helps, and we advise those who have symptoms and need to go out, to consider wearing a face covering in indoor public spaces. These simple measures can help make a difference to reduce the spread.\"Flu is always unpredictable, is still circulating and could bounce back even further in the new year as we have seen in past years,\" he warned.

Jethro Tull were formed \"out of the ashes\" of The John Evan Band and McGregor's Engine, the blues band Abrahams formed with Clive Bunker in the Luton/Dunstable area, said Anderson.Abrahams played on Tull's first album, This Was, but left shortly after it was finished, and went on to found another successful band, Blodwyn Pig.After pursuing a solo career between 1971 and 2017, he retired from performing following a stroke. Anderson described him as a \"homebody\" who \"liked to gig around the home counties\". He said: \"We all offer our condolences to Mick's family and close friends, who can feel justifiably proud of his achievements and musical legacy.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentEvery time you think the Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor story must have finished, there is another twist.The latest batch of documents from the Epstein files includes emails that could further damage his reputation. Or perhaps his reputation is already at rock bottom and this will only reinforce existing negative impressions.Public opinion might be divided too, in reaction to this drip-drip of pictures and emails.There might be some who have had enough of all these seedy headlines and do not want any more Andrew all over their Christmas dinner. They have already formed an opinion and this will only provide further confirmation.While others will see these latest documents as evidence of the need to press even harder into Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein and his circle. What more is there to find, they will ask.There are still outstanding calls for Andrew to give evidence to a US Congress committee and the US Department of Justice. And these latest emails will only add to the questions.\"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" someone called A in Balmoral asks Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's friend and companion who is now  serving a 20-year prison sentence in the US for sex trafficking.Maxwell replies: \"I have only been able to find appropriate friends. Will let you know about some church meetings on those dates.\"She signs off with \"kisses\", and the emails seem to be between people who are very close.The identity of A, who also uses the name \"Invisible Man\", is not made clear and we do not know for sure it is Andrew. And there might be some quizzical looks at some of the language in the emails - for instance \"Fall\" rather than \"Autumn\", which is more like American English than British.But there are lines in the emails that seem to tally with Andrew's biography, such as talking about when he left the Royal Navy.Elsewhere in the files, there also seem to be documents detailing arrangements in 2002 for a trip to Peru, with calls from Maxwell for discreet introductions to friends when he is there, with the suggestion from Maxwell of \"intelligent pretty fun and from good families\".All of that could be read in many different ways, innocent or otherwise. And appearing in these files is not any proof of guilt or misbehaviour.But part of the challenge with this released information is to put apparently random pieces into some kind of context.The email sent by \"A\" asking for \"inappropriate friends\" was sent in August 2001, which is five months after Virginia Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the then Prince Andrew in London at Maxwell's house.That is a claim that Andrew has always strongly denied and he has always rejected any claims of wrongdoing arising from his links with Epstein.However, further documents show that the US Department of Justice formally sought to question Andrew, asking in April 2020 for the UK government to assist in getting him to give evidence in cases linked to Epstein.In the event that he would not voluntarily give evidence, the US authorities asked their UK counterparts to compel him.There were also detailed questions about Andrew's relationship with Epstein from US authorities, including asking for details for any financial payments between them or any women associated with Maxwell or Epstein.There could be more questions about what happened to that request. It arrived when the Covid lockdown had just begun and attention was elsewhere.There has already been some embarrassment for Andrew from the Epstein files, with a picture of him lying on the laps of people in what is thought to be the saloon at Sandringham, with Maxwell in the background.It is a room in Sandringham where the royals could be gathering this week to watch the King's message and they might have to erase that other image from their thoughts.So far for Andrew it is more bad news, but perhaps similar to the previous bad news, of which there has been plenty.A year ago there were multiple \"What next for Andrew?\" pieces, after his disastrous scandal surrounding his links to an alleged Chinese spy.And it could not have been foreseen then how much further there was still to fall, with Andrew experiencing the most public loss of status for a royal in modern history.No-one would have predicted the loss of his titles and his status as prince.Next year there will be questions about his finances and his Crown Estate lease from the Public Accounts Committee.And who knows how much more could emerge from this vast cache of Epstein documents?This is a downward spiral - and every time you think it has ended, has kept going deeper.",

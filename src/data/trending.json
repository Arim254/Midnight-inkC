    "body": "The Metropolitan Police has said it will \"take no further action\" over claims Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked his police protection officer for information on accuser Virginia Giuffre.The allegations, first reported in the Mail on Sunday in October, said the then-prince gave the officer Ms Giuffre's date of birth and social security number, just before the paper published a photo of the pair meeting in February 2011.On Saturday, the Met said a further assessment \"has not revealed any additional evidence of criminal acts or misconduct\".Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has not commented on the reports, but has consistently denied all allegations against him.A spokesperson for the police force said: \"The Met remains committed to thoroughly assessing any new information that could assist in this matter.\"To date, we have not received any additional evidence that would support reopening the investigation. In the absence of any further information, we will be taking no further action.\"As with any other matter, should new and relevant information be brought to our attention, including in any information resulting from the release of material in the US, we will assess it.\"Ms Giuffre took her own life earlier this year. In a statement on Saturday, her family said they were \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision to drop the investigation \"without explanation and without speaking to us\".They added: \"With the Epstein files about to be released by Congress since the passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, we are surprised that the Metropolitan Police didn't wait to see what further evidence might appear.\"While we have hailed the UK's overall handling of the case of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor previously, today we feel justice has not been served.\"Ms Giuffre said she was among the girls and young women sexually exploited by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy circle.She claimed she was forced to have sex with the then-Prince Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London, in 2001.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges related to Epstein, her former boyfriend - he died in a New York police cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.In her memoir, published posthumously, Ms Giuffre described her allegations against the former prince in detail.She alleged the third time she had sex with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was on Epstein's island, as part of what she called \"an orgy\".She also recalled seeing a picture of Epstein and the former prince together in New York in 2011, saying she was \"revolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll\" but \"mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein\".In an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor said he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\", and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"He reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, formally ending a civil sex assault case against him in the US.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has faced years of scrutiny over his past relationship with Epstein. He has always denied allegations of wrongdoing related to Epstein.Earlier this year he was stripped of his title as prince following weeks of intense pressure over his links to the convicted sex offender. He had previously given up his other royal titles - including the Duke of York.He is also due to leave his mansion in Windsor, the Royal Lodge, by next October. It's expected he will move to Sandringham, in Norfolk, early next year.On Friday, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was one of a number of high-profile figures to feature in photographs released by Democrats, showcasing Epstein's ties to the rich and powerful.Epstein was associated with many well-known figures, and merely being named in files related to the disgraced financier is not an indication of wrongdoing by any of the parties mentioned.A cropped section of a picture showing the former prince talking to Microsoft founder Bill Gates was included in the latest batch of photographs.It was a cropped version of an image taken by a photographer working for Getty Images in 2018, with the original version showing them in conversation with King Charles.",

    "body": "3 hours ago\"Starmer rocked by new Andy Burnham coup plot\" is the Mail on Sunday's top story, detailing the Manchester Labour mayor's apparent \"deal\" to become an MP. Citing unnamed sources, the paper claims Burnham is close to striking \"a deal to fight a by-election to return to the Commons and mount a leadership challenge\" against Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.Relatives of Virginia Giuffre proclaim \"justice has not been served\" after the Metropolitan Police dropped an investigation into Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the Sun reports. The former prince was accused of asking his personal police officer to dig up information about Giuffre. Andrew has consistently denied all allegations against him.Health Secretary Wes Streeting warns \"Britain facing tsuanmi of flu\", writes the Sunday People in its top story. Hospital admissions are up 50% \"with the worst to come\", the paper writes, quoting Streeting.Hospital paediatric units are full due to a \"spike in flu cases\" across the UK, the Independent reports, leading to \"children's operations being cancelled\", including cardiac procedures. Overcrowded wards are \"increasing the risk of medical emergencies\", the paper writes.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch will \"ditch the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars\" if she defeats Labour at the next election, the Sunday Telegraph says. Writing for the paper, Badenoch calls the government's electric vehicles quota an \"economic act of self-harm\", as she vows to unwind the commitment. The paper says Downing Street has insisted it will press ahead with the ban.The Sunday Express leads with its investigation into an alleged government scheme for \"failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals to leave voluntarily\". According to the paper, \"illegal migrants are getting help setting up businesses and are being handed accommodation, food, and travel assistance\" on returning to their \"home country\". A Home Office spokesperson says the claims are \"untrue\", telling the paper: \"This scheme ensures migrants return to their home country, settle and don't re-enter the UK for a fraction of the price.\"\"Home Sec to announce crackdown on violence against women\", writes the Sunday Mirror in its top story, declaring it a \"national emergency\". The paper says offences \"will be disclosed to new partners, all police forces will get specialist units, and squads will track down online predators\".\"Tens of thousands of people have followed the King's advice to check their eligibility for cancer screening\", writes the Sunday Times on its front page. It follows, in the paper's words, King Charles's \"heartfelt speech on Friday about his diagnosis\".The Observer depicts the government's social media debate on its front page as a Shakespearean dilemma: \"to ban or not to ban\". Australia became the first country to impose a 16-year-old age limit on social media earlier this week and the UK government is now \"split\" over whether to pursue a similar measure.\"TV star Jeremy Clarkson reckons he has picked up a swathe of female admirers since he started hosting Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\" according to the Daily Star. The paper calls it the \"unlikeliest showbiz exclusive of the year\".Related Internet Links",

The Syrian government has issued a statement condemning the attack. The identities of those killed are being withheld for 24 hours until their next of kin have been informed, the US Central Command said.In a post on X, the US Central Command, which directs American military operations in Europe, Africa and the Indo-Pacific, said the attack was \"the result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman\", while a Pentagon official said initial assessments showed the attack was \"likely\" to be carried out by the Islamic State group.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security force.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.The ambush occurred in Palmyra, located in the centre of the country, while the soldiers were \"conducting a key leader engagement\", according to Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell.He added the attack is under investigation.A Pentagon official said: \"This attack took place in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"Trump added that the three injured US soldiers were \"doing well\". Syria's state news reported that two Syrian service personnel had also been injured.Getty ImagesUS and Syrian forces were ambushed in Palmyra in central SyriaUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said: \"Let it be known, if you target Americans - anywhere in the world you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"In a post on X, Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said the country condemned the attack, and extended its condolences to the families of the victims. Tom Barrack, US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, said: \"I strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist ambush targeting a joint US–Syrian government patrol in central Syria.\"We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.\"Last month, President Ahmed al-Sharaa met with Donald Trump at the White House in a visit that the Syrian leader said was part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.Syria recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.The global coalition is aimed at eliminating the remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.In 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks. The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondentandAlex SmithSpecialist rape and sexual offence investigation teams will be introduced to every police force in England and Wales by 2029, the government has pledged.It is part of a long-delayed plan aimed at halving violence against women and girls within a decade.The strategy - which will include funding for undercover units operating online, and a roll out of domestic abuse protection orders - is due to be unveiled on Thursday, after being pushed back three times this year.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the measures will help to \"bear down on abusers, stopping them in their tracks. Rapists, sex offenders and abusers will have nowhere to hide.\"The government says the new teams will have officers with specialist investigation skills for working on rape and sexual offence cases.More than 50% of police forces already have these teams in place, but the government says every force will have dedicated officers by 2029.It says staff will have the right training to understand the mindset of abusers and victims.Announcing the move, the home secretary said: \"This government has declared violence against women and girls a national emergency.\"For too long, these crimes have been considered a fact of life. That's not good enough. We will halve it in a decade.\"Also announced is a roll out of domestic abuse protection orders, which have been trialled over the last year, across England and Wales.They can ban individuals from contacting a victim, visiting their home or posting harmful content online, and can also be used in cases involving coercive or controlling behaviour. Breaching an order is a criminal offence.There will also be almost £2m in investment for special undercover units of police officers operating online - to target those harassing women and girls on the internet.A report released earlier this month found that more than a quarter of police forces in England and Wales had not implemented basic policies for investigating sexual offences.It said sexually-motivated crimes against women in public remained widespread, criticised the limited nature of data on them, and called for urgent action to prevent predators from offending.The publishing of the government's strategy has been long delayed. It was initially expected to be announced in the spring.In Labour's general election manifesto last year the party pledged to use \"every government tool available to target perpetrators and address the root causes of abuse and violence\".On Tuesday, the chairs of three Commons select committees raised their concerns over repeated delays in publishing the plans.The BBC has previously been told that changing attitudes among boys and young men will be at the centre of what is proposed.It is understood it will be built around three goals: preventing radicalisation of young men, stopping abusers, and supporting victims.Some domestic abuse survivors have told the BBC the time for talking is over - and these measures must be implemented quickly.",

    "body": "8 hours agoTom McArthurandIlma HasanWatch: Anger and chaos in Salt Lake stadium, Kolkata as Messi leaves event earlyAngry fans attending Lionel Messi's tour of India ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch after his appearance at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium.Thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to catch a glimpse of the football star, but were left disappointed when he emerged to walk around the pitch and was obscured by a large group of officials and celebrities.When the Argentina and Inter Miami forward was whisked away early by security after around 20 minutes, elements of the crowd turned hostile.West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, said she was \"deeply disturbed and shocked\" by the events.ReutersAs it became apparent Messi's appearance had ended, local media say the scene turned ugly Announcing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and \"sports lovers\" for the incident at the stadium.\"The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,\" the chief minister said on X.A spokesperson for Messi said that he fulfilled the time commitment that had been agreed in advance. In terms of the organisation of the event itself, he referred the BBC to the apology issued by Banerjee on social media. A police official told reporters that the event's \"chief organiser\" had been arrested, without giving any further details, AFP reports.Authorities will look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets, the official added.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the \"private event\".Messi is in India for his 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour', a series of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi. His tour began with the unveiling of a 70ft (21m) statue of himself in Kolkata, which had been assembled over the course of 27 days by a 45-strong crew. Messi appeared virtually due to security concerns.Thousands of fans travelled to the city's stadium for a chance to see the footballer in person.They were chanting, buying jerseys and wearing \"I love Messi\" headbands.Messi initially walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended on Saturday, some frustrated fans stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, as others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.The 2022 World Cup winner - considered one of football's greatest ever players - had been expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium, the AFP news agency reports.\"Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi... Why did they call us then? We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face,\" a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.One angry fan told the Press Trust of India news agency people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\"I paid Rs 5,000 for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians,\" they said. \"The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.\"Messi was accompanied on his brief visit by his Inter Miami teammate and Uruguay star Luis Suarez, and Argentina's Rodrigo de Paul.Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan also met Messi earlier in the day, according to the Reuters news agency.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesMessi waving to fans as he arrivedThousands of fans had gathered for the eventKolkata is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal and has a large football fanbase in an otherwise cricket-crazed country.In the city, it is common to see hundreds of thousands of fans gather at stadiums at a derby of local clubs.In the early hours of Saturday, thousands lined the roads and congregated outside the hotel where Messi was staying to try and catch a glimpse of him.Hitesh, a 24-year-old corporate lawyer, flew nearly 1,900 kilometres from the south Indian city of Bengaluru.\"For me it's personal. You can see I am quite short, and I love to play football with my friends,\" Hitesh told the BBC, standing in front of the statue.\"Messi is the player I related with the most, no one can match his talent.

    "body": "10 hours agoJames Cook,JerusalemandRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, IstanbulIsrael said it killed a senior Hamas commander on Saturday in a strike on a vehicle inside Gaza.In a joint statement, the Israeli military and security agency Shin Bet announced it had \"eliminated\" Raed Saad, the head of weapons production for Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, in Gaza city.Saad had been regarded as one of the most prominent Qassam commanders and led several brigades during Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israeli communities east of Gaza City. The Hamas-run Civil Defence spokesman, Mahmoud Basal, told the BBC that four people were killed in the strike. He said multiple passers-by were also injured by the blast.A local Hamas official in Gaza told the BBC that the strike also killed Saad's aide and another lower-ranking official identified as Abu Imad al-Laban.The BBC is prevented by Israel from reporting independently from inside Gaza and is unable to verify details of the incident. The IDF and ISA joint statement added that Saad had been \"responsible for the deaths of many soldiers\" killed in the Gaza Strip as the result of explosive devices.Saad is believed to be a member of the newly formed five-member leadership military council established since a ceasefire took hold in October. Israel has attempted to kill him on multiple occasions.One of the most notable attempts was during a surprise Israeli operation in Gaza City in March 2024, when Israeli forces reportedly sought to arrest or kill him. Sources at the time said Saad had been inside the targeted complex but managed to escape moments before the raid.He has long been considered one of Israel's most wanted Hamas figures, with Israeli attempts to kill him spanning more than two decades.Saturday's attack happened on the Palestinian-controlled side of the so-called Yellow Line which has divided Gaza since an unstable US-led ceasefire came into effect on 10 October.Israeli forces control the area to the east of the line, which includes just over half of the Gaza Strip.The first phase of US president Donald Trump's 20-point plan for peace in the region required the return of all 20 living and 28 dead hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.About 1,200 people were killed in the attack and more than 250 people were taken hostage.All have been returned except for the remains of an Israeli police officer, Ran Gvili, 24, who is believed to have been killed while fighting Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim.Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action.The diplomatic focus is now shifting to the next stage of President Trump's plan which would require the disarmament of Hamas as part of what it calls the de-radicalisation and redevelopment of Gaza.It envisages Gaza being run by the \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee,\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Trump.Security would be provided by an International Stabilisation Force although its make up remains unclear.The eventual aim is for a reformed Palestinian Authority to take control of the territory, and for Israeli forces to withdraw, after which \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\". Many aspects of the plan are controversial in Israel where prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state.Trump is due to meet Netanyahu to discuss the plan in the US on 29 December.",

    "body": "How monogamous are humans? Scientists compile 'league table' of pairing up4 days agoHelen BriggsEnvironment correspondentGettyMeerkats are incredibly social animals and live in large groups known as 'mobs' or 'clans'Humans are a bit like meerkats when it comes to pairing up, according to a study that examined the monogamous lifestyles of different species.In our romantic life, we more closely resemble these social, close-knit mongooses than we do our primate cousins, a \"league table\" of monogamy compiled by scientists suggests.At 66% monogamous, humans score surprisingly highly, far above chimps and gorillas – and on a par with meerkats.However, we are by no means the most monogamous creature. Top spot goes to the Californian mouse - rodents that form inseparable, lifelong bonds.GettyChimpanzees are highly social and form strong bonds but have very different social structures from humans\"There is a premier league of monogamy, in which humans sit comfortably, while the vast majority of other mammals take a far more promiscuous approach to mating,\" said Dr Mark Dyble at the University of Cambridge.In the animal world, pairing up has its perks, which may be why it has evolved independently in multiple species, including us. Experts have proposed various benefits to so-called social monogamy, where mates match up for at least a breeding season to care for their young and see off rivals. Dr Dyble examined several human populations throughout history, calculating the proportions of full siblings – where individuals share the same mother and father – compared with half-siblings, individuals who share either a mother or a father, but not both. Similar data was compiled for more than 30 social monogamous and other mammals.Humans have a monogamy rating of 66% full siblings, ahead of meerkats (60%) but behind beavers (73%).Meanwhile, our evolutionary cousins fall at the bottom of the table - with mountain gorillas at 6% rating, while chimpanzees come in at just 4% (alongside the dolphin).In last place is Scotland's Soay sheep, where females mate with multiple males, with 0.6% full siblings. The Californian mouse came top, at 100%.However, being ranked alongside meerkats and beavers doesn't mean our societies are the same - human society is poles apart.\"Although the rates of full siblings we see in humans are most similar to species like meerkats or beavers, the social system that we see in humans is very different,\" Dr Dyble told BBC News.\"Most of these species live in colony-like social groups or perhaps live in solitary pairs that go around together. Humans are very different from that. We live in what we call multi-male, multi-female groups, within which we have these monogamous, or pair-bonded, units.\"GettySoay sheep are the most promiscuous of all the animals studiedDr Kit Opie at the University of Bristol, who is not connected with the study, said this is another piece in the puzzle over how human monogamy arose.\"I think this paper gives us a very clear understanding that across time and across space humans are monogamous,\" he said.\"Our society is much closer to chimps and bonobos – it just happens that we've taken a different route when it comes to mating.\"The new study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences.",

    "body": "10 hours agoSee the weather forecast for heavy rain across parts of ScotlandForecasters are warning of likely flooding and dangers from fast flowing water as a prolonged period of heavy rain sweeps across Scotland.An amber alert has been issued for the south west of the country from midnight, while a lesser yellow warning covers much of the western mainland.The Met Office said 50-70mm of rain could fall widely in the amber area, rising to 110-130mm in the Galloway Hills and other parts of the Southern Uplands during Sunday. Homes and businesses were likely to be flooded and fast flowing rivers or floodwater could pose a \"danger to life\" while bus and rail travellers face possible cancellations or delays, it warned.The Met Office amber warning covers much of southwest Scotland, including Dumfries & Galloway, Scottish Borders, parts of South Lanarkshire and parts of Ayrshire, lasting for the whole day.Strong and gusty south westerly winds are also expected throughout Sunday, worsening conditions.Separate yellow weather warnings are already in place across much of the country, including Glasgow, Fife and Stirling. These warnings will run to either the end of Sunday or 09:00 on Monday, depending on the area.Getty ImagesForecasters believe the volume of rain is likely to lead to some floodingThe Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has issued 10 flood regional alerts ahead of the worst of the rain, with latest flood warning updates posted online. ScotRail has already cancelled Sunday services between Kilmarnock and Dumfries as a precaution.Police Scotland said people should avoid travelling unless it was necessary while Transport Scotland warned travel was likely to be affected by the poor conditions.  Scottish Borders Council said a multi-agency incident response group will operate from the council's emergency control centre from 07:00 on Sunday, to co-ordinate the response and any recovery efforts.Regular updates for the public will be provided via SB Alert and a dedicated severe weather page on the council's website.The local authority said it would monitor river levels with Sepa, while surface water flooding could also become an issue.Met OfficeThe Scottish government's transport secretary, Fiona Hyslop, advised people to plan ahead and leave plenty of time for journeys.She said the heavy rain was \"likely to impact the transport network\".Hyslop added:  \"It's important people plan their journeys before they set off. Motorists should make sure their routes are available, follow the travel advice from Police Scotland and drive in accordance with the conditions.\"If you are planning to travel by train, ferry or plane, please check with your operators to see if the conditions are having any impact on your services.\"Police Scotland Supt Andrew Barclay, of the force's Road Policing Unit said motorists should \"drive to the conditions and be aware of increased stopping distances\", as well as having alterative routes planned.He added that people should make sure to have sufficient fuel, warm clothing, food and water, as well as a charged mobile phone, in case affected by the disruption.Trains and ferriesTraffic on the A83 Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll has been diverted along the alternative Old Military Road route as a safety precaution in case of landslides.A decision on returning traffic to the A83 trunk road will be made on Monday, following safety inspections of the road and the hillside.As well as cancelling Kilmarnock to Dumfries services, ScotRail said there would be speed restrictions on some routes.In a social media post the rail operator stated: \"As a safety precaution, speed restrictions will come into force along sections of our Oban, Fort William, Mallaig and Kyle of Lochalsh routes. \"These will be introduced from 18:00 this evening and remain in place until 09:00 on Monday. Please be aware that journey times will take longer as a result.\"A number of CalMac ferry services have also been cancelled due to strong windsThe warning comes just days after Storm Bram swept the country.It saw amber wind warnings in place in north-west Scotland, and the M74 shut between junctions 12 and 13 near Abington in South Lanarkshire after high winds toppled numerous HGVs on Tuesday evening.The second named storm of the season also caused problems for rail travellers with fallen trees and damaged overhead cables, and more than 1,000 properties lost power.At the height of the storm, gusts of 76mph were recorded on South Uist in the Western Isles with similar speeds also felt in Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway.",

But while she might not have a degree in interior design, her ideas have been a hit with younger viewers and she has made content creation her full-time job over the past year. \"Everything is so gloomy and the world is a bit of a scary place at the moment - houses want to be joyful,\" she said.Rachel VerneyPatterned bedding and framed graphics can boost the colour in bedroomsDopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in our brain's reward and pleasure systems. Often referred to as the \"feel-good\" hormone, it influences mood, motivation, and attention. Psychologist Dr Natasha Sharma said vivid colours produced small dopamine hits, which, in uncertain times, provided a sense of optimism and reward.She said dopamine decor allowed people to \"externalise\" their identity and boost their mood, giving a \"heightened sense of wellbeing\".Dr Sharma, from Wolverhampton, added that a home dominated by grey or neutral tones could result in \"feelings of emotional flatness\".Alice Cullinane/BBCNicola Brighton sells bold mirrors and wall prints to decor loversNicola Brighton is among those making a living from the trend, creating kitsch prints and neon mirrors in unique shapes which are stocked in stores across the UK and US. Since 2022, her business Printed Weird, which is based in Birmingham, has grown 62% and her designs frequently sell out as customers look for nostalgia to add to their homes.\"When you come home from work and you've had a rubbish day, you can just look at things that bring you joy and happiness,\" Nicola said.She started her business from her mum's spare bedroom seven years ago, fuelled by a love for colourful decor and a mission to put affordable items on the market.\"Through what you love, why not put that silliness on your wall? It's an extension of your personality and will bring you joy,\" she said.Rachel VerneyBrightly coloured rooms are believed to activate \"neural pathways\" linked to reward and vitality But while Google searches for dopamine decor have risen more than 110% in the past year, estate agents warned the trend could put off potential buyers.Paul Fox Estate Agents, based in Lincolnshire, recommended a neutral colour scheme over bold hues, adding \"timeless\" shades helped sell homes quickly.\"First impressions are everything, so by ensuring that the home is painted in popular colours you are likely to attract buyers,\" the agent said.Alice Cullinane/BBCJodie Edmonds moved into her first house in July and has filled it with bright coloursDespite the agent's advice, new homeowners like Jodie Edmonds have decided to add personality to their walls.\"I'm not bothered when it comes to reselling, people have different tastes and can change the decor,\" she said.For Jodie, a colourful scheme is a way to express herself and make guests feel happier.\"A grey house would make me feel low, a bright house makes me feel motivated and inspired,\" she said.How to add dopamine decor to your home without breaking the bankRachel Verney recommends you introduce colours you love into your decor by starting with items like cushions and rugs, and not being afraid to mix colours and patterns Simple touches to practical items go a long way - vinyl wrap your fridge in an exciting pattern, paint your appliances and radiators any colour of the rainbow or add a fun printed shower curtain and quirky bathmat to a boring bathroomGet crafty to create affordable dupes of your favourite brands, like adding bows to cushion covers or updating candlesticksShop second hand and upcycle pieces from charity shops and Facebook Marketplace to save money and items from landfill Add plants to shelves, mantlepieces and uninspired corners to boost your mood.

    "body": "Supermarket skincare dupes could save you hundreds. But do budget beauty products work?3 hours agoGrace DeanRachael ParnellRachael says with some of the dupes she \"can't tell the difference\"When Rachael Parnell heard Aldi was selling a new skincare range that looked similar to products from luxury brand Augustinus Bader, she was \"super excited\".She rushed to her nearest store to pick up the Lacura face cream for £8.49 for 50ml - a fraction of the £240 price tag of the Augustinus Bader 50ml product.The sleek blue tube and gold lid of both products look remarkably similar. And though Rachael has never tried the high-end cream, she says she's impressed by the product so far.The BBC reached out to Aldi about the likeness of the product packaging - but they have not provided a comment.Rachael has been buying skincare dupes from high street stores and supermarkets for years, and she's not alone. More than a quarter of UK shoppers say they've bought a skincare or makeup dupe. This rises to 44% among 18-34 year olds, according to a survey by Barclays in February.Dupes are skincare products that mimic bigger name brands and provide budget-friendly alternatives to high-end products. They often have similar names and packaging, but in some cases the ingredients can vary significantly.Victoria WoollastonLuxury vs budget: Augustinus Bader's 50ml face cream costs £240, while Aldi's new Lacura face cream is £8.49 Rachael, 34, from Warwickshire, says she's attracted by the low prices of budget alternatives and often finds the quality good. When asked about two cleansing balms she has bought - one from a high-end brand and the other a low-priced equivalent - she says: \"It's the same to me, I can't tell the difference.\"'Expensive isn't necessarily better'Skincare experts say some alternatives to high-end brands are good quality and help make skincare more affordable.\"I don't think more expensive is necessarily better,\" says consultant dermatologist Sharon Belmo. \"Not every low-budget skincare brand is bad - and not every luxury skincare product is the best.\"\"Some [dupes] are absolutely amazing,\" says Scott McGlynn, who hosts a podcast in which he asks celebrities about their skin routines. Many of the products inspired by luxury brands \"sell out so fast, it's just insane,\" he says.Scott McGlynnSkincare expert Scott McGlynn says some budget products he has used are \"amazing\"Aesthetic and dermatology doctor Ross Perry thinks dupes are fine to use for \"basic skincare\" like moisturisers and cleansers.\"Dupes will serve a purpose,\" he says. \"They will do the basics to a reasonable level.\"Ketaki Bhate, a consultant dermatologist, thinks you can save money when you're looking for single-ingredient products like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and squalane.\"If you're buying a single-ingredient product then you're probably going to be okay in using a dupe or something which is quite low cost because there's very little that can go wrong,\" she says.'Don't be sold by the packaging'But the professionals also suggest consumers do their research and say that more expensive products are sometimes worth the extra money.With luxury skincare, you're not just paying for the brand and marketing - sometimes the higher price tag also comes from the ingredients and their quality, the concentration of the active ingredient, the technology used to develop the product, and studies into the products' effectiveness, Dr Belmo says.Facialist Rhian Truman says it's worth thinking about how some dupes can be sold so cheaply. In some cases, she says they could contain filler ingredients that don't have as many benefits for the skin, or the ingredients might not be as well sourced.\"The big question mark is 'How is it so cheap?'\" she says.Podcast host Scott says in some cases he's bought skincare items that look similar to a big-name brand but the product itself has \"no resemblance to the original\".\"Don't be sold by the packaging,\" he added.SimpleImages/Getty ImagesDr Bhate recommends sticking to more specialised brands for products with ingredients like retinol or vitamin CFor more complicated products or ones with ingredients that can irritate the skin if they're not formulated correctly, such as retinols or vitamin C, Dr Bhate recommends sticking to more specialised brands.She says these will likely have been through expensive trials to evaluate how effective they are.Skincare products need to be tested before they can be sold in the UK, says consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth. If the brand makes claims about the effectiveness of the product, it needs data to back it up, \"but the seller doesn't necessarily have to do the testing\" and can instead reference testing done by other brands, she says.Check the back of the packAre there any ingredients that could indicate a product is low-quality?Ingredients on the back of the bottle are ordered by quantity. \"The baddies that you want to look out for… is your mineral oil, your sodium lauryl sulfate, parfum, benzel peroxide\" being high up on the ingredients list, Miss Truman says.The BBC sent ingredients lists of two BHA 2% salicylic acid toners with similar packaging to Dr Bhate. One is typically sold for six times the price of the other.Dr Bhate says the the list of active ingredients in both products \"looks pretty similar, no red flags,\" but she notes the products have different formulations with solvents and humectants, which break down ingredients and hydrate the skin respectively.\"This will likely lead to varying performance between the two products,\" she says.Dr Bhate also looked at the ingredients lists for two serums with similar branding, one from a luxury skincare brand and one from a supermarket.She says that though they have \"lookalike packaging\", the budget product \"doesn't appear very similar in terms of ingredients\" and the higher-end formula \"seems more complex with barrier lipids and more marine extracts\".But for many people, trying to analyse the ingredients list on a bottle of moisturiser, cleanser or serum can be overwhelming.\"Sometimes it feels like looking at the back of a skincare product ingredient list is like having a chemistry lesson,\" says Riya Asher, a pharmacist and aesthetic practitioner.She recommends focusing on how high up the active ingredient - the one that triggers the effect, like retinol or vitamin C - is in the ingredients list. And if you're not sure which is the active ingredient, she recommends doing your research online.And Dr Belmo says you should focus on your skincare concerns when scanning the back of bottles, such as avoiding oils for acne-prone skin or staying fragrance-free for sensitive skin.Victoria WoollastonVictoria Woollaston reviews skincare products for her website, including by high-end and supermarket brandsVictoria Woollaston posts reviews of skincare products on her website, Mamabella. She's tried both an Augustinus Bader serum and the new product sold by Aldi, and tells the BBC the supermarket serum felt thinner, but that because Augustinus Bader's is stronger it could cause irritation for some people.Victoria feels like there's a \"perfect storm\" for skincare dupes to become popular, as the cost of living crisis pushes shoppers to seek value for money and people have become more interested in the ingredients in their skincare products. She says these companies aren't stealing customers from luxury beauty brands - in her opinion, many of the people who buy budget alternatives would never have been able to afford the high-end products in the first place.\"What my years of tests show,\" says Victoria, \"is that value and efficacy can 100% coexist.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosandAlex SmithWatch: King Charles issues update on his cancer treatmentThe King will be \"greatly encouraged and deeply touched\" by the positive reaction  to a television broadcast where he talked about his cancer treatment, Buckingham Palace has said.In a recorded message, broadcast on Friday as part of Channel 4's Stand Up To Cancer campaign, King Charles said his treatment was being reduced, and urged people to take up offers of cancer screening, saying \"early diagnosis quite simply saves lives.\"The King's type of cancer has not been revealed, and he will continue to receive treatment and monitoring.The Palace said the King \"will be particularly pleased at the way it has helped to shine a light on the benefits of cancer screening programmes.\"\"It has long been the King's view that if some public good can come from sharing elements of his personal diagnosis and treatment journey, then it would be his pleasure and duty to do so.\"His thoughts and warmest wishes will remain with all those affected by cancer and those who care for them.\"Charity Cancer Research UK says around 100,000 people have visited its new online screening checker since it was launched on 5 December - a majority of which came after the King's message was broadcast on Friday night.That tool allows people to check whether they are eligible for NHS and Public Health Agency cancer screenings in their local area.The King, who revealed his diagnosis in February last year, is not described as being in remission or \"cured\" but the regularity of his treatment will be significantly reduced in the new year.In his video message, recorded in Clarence House two weeks ago, he said that he was \"troubled\" to learn that nine million people around the UK are not up to date with the cancer screening available to them.\"That is at least nine million opportunities for early diagnosis being missed,\" he said.He added: \"Too often, I am told, people avoid screening because they imagine it may be frightening, embarrassing or uncomfortable.\"If and when they do finally take up their invitation, they are glad they took part.\"A few moments of minor inconvenience are a small price to pay for the reassurance that comes for most people when they are either told either they don't need further tests or, for some, are given the chance to enable early detection, with the life-saving intervention that can follow.\"PA MediaThe King attended a service at Westminster Abbey on Wednesday as he keeps a busy schedule despite receiving weekly treatmentFollowing the broadcast, the King was praised for his candour in talking about his cancer treatment.Clare Garnsey, the associate medical director of the Greater Manchester Cancer Alliance, said his message was \"very powerful\".Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Miss Garnsey said she, \"like the majority of health professionals who work in the cancer field\" was \"really thankful\" for what the King said.\"I think the message was very powerful about the importance of early diagnosis and how important it is that we all attend for our screening,\" she added.She said it is \"really helpful\" to healthcare professionals when people in \"positions of influence\" - such as the King - speak publicly about their experiences with cancer.These messages highlight that it \"can happen to anybody\", she said, and raise awareness of the potential symptoms someone may experience.Royal biographer and friend of King Charles, Jonathan Dimbleby, said the King's message demonstrated the \"unique role of the sovereign\".Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the King's decision to speak openly about his treatment in such \"warm, gentle, thoughtful, kind terms\" was \"quite extraordinary and it has great impact\".He said the King's message will give people \"great reassurance\" to hear of someone who \"has a cancer and lives with that cancer\".\"It makes you recognise [...] that it's not a death sentence,\" he added.Dimbleby's father, broadcaster Richard Dimbleby, died at 52 in 1965.\"When he died, he had been frightened to say, in advance to himself even, that he had cancer,\" he said, adding that the word cancer was \"hardly usable then\".He said it took \"guts\" for the King to share such a personal message publicly, but \"the fact that he came out and did that will save lives, and people will be less frightened of saying 'we must go and get a test'.\"Dimbleby said that when it was announced that the King was having treatment for an enlarged prostate in 2024, there was a considerable surge in searches to the NHS website.\"No-one else could have done this,\" he added.What can be general symptoms of cancer?Different types of cancer all have their own symptoms - but the NHS says general symptoms can include:A new lump or swellingSweating a lot or a high temperatureFeeling more tired than usualUnusual bruising or bleedingUnusual pain anywhere in the bodyUnexpected weight loss or loss of appetiteNeeding to pee more often or more urgently, or pain when you peeRead more on the NHS website.Until now the King has said little publicly about his illness.In his video message, King Charles said he knew how \"overwhelming\" a diagnosis can feel, but stressed that early detection is \"key\" to give patients the \"precious gift of hope\".The NHS has three cancer screening programmes - for bowel, breast and cervical cancer - available to certain age groups.These tests can detect a problem even before someone experiences symptoms.In his message, the King also urged people to use the screening checker online tool.Cancer charity Macmillan Cancer Support said it was \"incredibly grateful\" to the King for sharing his experience \"with such openness and honesty\".\"The King's reminder of the importance of screening and early detection is an important message for us all,\" it added in a statement.The prime minister said the King's message was \"powerful\" and that he was \"glad\" that the King's treatment will be reduced in the new year.According to Buckingham Palace, the King's recovery has reached a very positive stage and he has \"responded exceptionally well to treatment\", so much so that doctors will now move his treatment \"into a precautionary phase\".Meanwhile, Dr Harrison Carter, director of screening at NHS England, said the health service \"fully supported\" the King's call for people to attend screening tests.\"So, when your NHS screening invite arrives, whether it's for cervical or breast screening, or a bowel cancer testing kit through the post, please do make time to take it up.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlex TaylorCulture reporterRockstar GamesDan Houser was one of the masterminds behind revolutionary video game series Grand Theft Auto.Now, after leaving Rockstar Games and launching his own company, he's released a debut novel about a very different type of game.A Better Paradise is a dystopian vision of the near future in which an AI-led computer game goes rogue.Set in a polarised world, it finds Mark Tyburn attempting to create a virtual haven for people to find sanctuary and reconnect within themselves against an all-consuming social media hellscape.But it all goes wrong when it ends up unleashing a mysterious, sentient AI bot named NigelDave into society - \"a hyper-intelligence built by humans\" - flaws included.Readers get to see his thought processes as he struggles with \"infinite knowledge and zero wisdom\".\"What would an incredibly precocious child, who remembers everything he ever thought - because computers don't forget things - feel like when he started talking?\" Houser says.Getty ImagesWritten before ChatGPTIt feels a bit like A Better Paradise predicted the future. First released as a podcast, the book comes as AI's continued boom means the sector's big seven companies are now collectively worth more than China's economy.But Houser says he began writing the book \"a good year\" before OpenAI's ChatGPT went live to the masses in 2022, complete with a logo eerily similar to his fictional creation.Instead, it was humanity's technological dependency during Covid - at a scale he'd underestimated - that inspired his thinking.In his novel - which sometimes feels monologue-heavy - Houser envisions a hyper-digital, alienating world where people retreat from deepening political problems into a spiral of social media and generative AI.Enter CEO of Tyburn Industria, Mark, who dreams of building the Ark, an immersive gaming experience users can enter in order to reconnect with themselves. It generates a world and mission tailored to each player's innermost wants and needs.But during testing, the Ark becomes a Pandora's box of addiction. Some players find joy; others encounter terror. One even reconnects with his dead sister.Meanwhile, a rogue AI bot named NigelDave slips into the real world, controlling minds and engineering realities no one can control.Mined for advertising, people are left wondering if their thoughts are genuine. Everything is tracked, and nothing is secure. As climate emergencies intensify, society falls to pockets of civil war.The only way to escape is to \"drift\"- which means hiding from a thousand algorithms by living off-grid, constantly moving and suppressing maddening paranoia that your thoughts are not your own.Mirroring our worldTo the reader, NigelDave feels like a nightmare ChatGPT gone wrong.The AI tool recently reached 800 million weekly active users, according to boss Sam Altman, and Houser believes some people are becoming dependent on the technology's affirming \"human veneer\".Microsoft's head of AI Mustafa Suleyman has warned of a rise in AI psychosis - a non-clinical term describing incidents where people increasingly rely on chatbots like Claude, Grok and ChatGPT and become convinced that something imaginary has become real.In some cases, the chatbot fuels grandiose fantasies about future opportunities. In others, it presents in a romantic connection. More troubling are reports of parents saying bots have encouraged their children to kill themselves.In response to the increased scrutiny, ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently tightened its welfare protocols, with updates designed to ensure its chatbot responds \"safely and empathetically to potential signs of delusion or mania\".Bloomberg via Getty ImagesMustafa Suleyman, chief executive officer of of Microsoft AIThe dizzying algorithm-fuelled society in which NigelDave is unleashed mirrors ours too.Parents worry about exposing their children to false information or harmful content. Last year national police chiefs described the \"quite terrifying\" misogynistic radicalisation of boys and young men. And in 2014 Facebook admitted manipulating the news feeds of nearly 700,000 users without their consent to manage the emotions they were exposed to.\"As a parent, you always worry about anything that you expose your kids to that is going to either give them false information or simply bombard them with too much information,\" Houser says.But is it bold for a video game creator to be warning of these dangers - given the long history of video games themselves being accused of making young people violent?Houser insists there's a difference.\"We always had the data about game violence, and it was very clear: as people played more video games, youth violence went down.\"Whatever people were claiming, we knew the opposite was true.\"Getty ImagesPsychology professor and game violence researcher Pete Etchells says numerous studies have shown \"no meaningful effect of playing violent games on aggression\".AI models and social media are another matter - a \"new paradigm\" in altering behaviour that gaming never threatened, according to Matt Navarra, social media consultant and author of the Geekout Newsletter.He says dismissing concerns as a GTA-style moral panic \"understates what is changing\".\"We're talking about external systems that can potentially shape people's beliefs or manipulate attention, personalised experiences, nudge behaviour or even influence identity and emotional states.\"Rockstar freedomCould Houser have pushed forward with A Better Paradise at Rockstar? \"I don't know if I would have had the bandwidth to think about it,\" he tells me.He's previously described the fatigue of managing vast open-world sandbox games like Red Dead Redemption and GTA as playing a role in his departure.The goal with his book was to create \"something truly different in this era of crazy media saturation\".Rockstar GamesSo where next? He's already writing the second instalment of the series, and plans are under way to develop a video game, for which he promises the visuals are ground-breaking.A key message, he says, is to not let your device - or AI - \"tell you what to think\". Otherwise, Houser argues, \"you're giving up control to your phone\".His biggest fear, as creator of worlds, is losing imagination because of the endless torrent of algorithms. Sometimes after scrolling for hours, he realises: \"I've not had an idea all day\".\"If you go offline for a bit - sometimes I make myself go for a walk with no phone, you start to have ideas.\"A human is better thinking than not,\" he says. \"Thinking is a privilege.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "First it was K-pop, now it's K-food. Here's how to bring Korean cooking into your kitchen4 hours agoJiji AhnFuture Publishing via Getty ImagesStanding around a kitchen island with a small group of other food writers, I pull on a pair of plastic gloves and begin massaging a bright red paste into wedges of cabbage. We are in Korean-American TV chef Judy Joo's London flat, learning how to make kimchi from scratch.Kimchi - sharp, funky, fermented cabbage - has become a kind of shorthand for Korean food in the UK. Judy calls it \"the cornerstone of Korean cuisine\".\"Traditionally, Koreans eat kimchi 365 days a year,\" Judy tells me. Kimchi recipes are passed down \"like heirlooms\", she adds.The group joke about the chilli under our nails and the smell lingering on the train home, but we're all excited to have a jar of homemade kimchi ready to put in the fridge.Judy, who's known for bringing Korean food to British audiences, was leading a class tied to Ocado's new Korean food aisle. It's part of what appears to be a growing trend of bringing Korean food further into the British mainstream.Judy JooKorean-American TV chef Judy Joo demonstrates how to make kimchi from scratch...Judy Joo... Her class duly rub red paste into wedges of cabbage Growing up as a Korean in London, I was used to my culture turning up at school in the form of food. On \"international day\", my mum would be asked to send in Korean dishes for pupils to try. Teachers were often more curious than students, and there was usually confusion about whether it was another type of Chinese food.Korean food has never been in competition with other Asian cuisines – it simply wants to be seen and tasted on its own terms. As more Korean restaurants have opened, and as I've gone back to Korea and explored its food there, I've watched that shift happen in both places.'Fermented foods, such as kimchi, have become mainstream'Back in 2009, the South Korean government launched a \"Global Hansik\" campaign to raise the profile of Korean food abroad, putting public money into restaurant promotion, chef training and overseas marketing. The programme drew criticism at the time for lacking clear results but, later, government studies suggested awareness of Korean food in major overseas cities rose over the first half of the 2010s.Since then, Korean food has increasingly travelled alongside the broader \"K-wave\" of pop culture. Food-centred drama Bon Appétit, Your Majesty has showcased Korean fusion dishes, while South Korean competition show Culinary Class Wars returns for a second season on Netflix this month after topping the platform's global non-English TV chart in its first run.The shift is also visible on UK shelves. Searches for \"Korean BBQ\" on Waitrose's website are up more than 60% year on year, and sales of its gochujang paste have risen more than 70%. Kimchi is among its fastest-growing international products.\"Fermented foods, such as kimchi, have become mainstream,\" explains nutritionist Emer Lowry. \"They enhance flavour and texture, but also offer benefits including improved digestion and a diverse, healthier gut microbiome.\"And the interest in Korean food didn't just happen overnight - it's driven by curiosity. Analysis by Bibigo, part of food giant CJ, suggests TikTok posts by UK users mentioning Korean food have risen from just under 10,000 in 2023 to more than 17,000 in 2025.Lola LeeDishes at Cálong in North LondonAt Cálong, a restaurant in North London, chef Joo Won is exploring what it means to cook Korean food in Britain. In his early career in a London hotel kitchen, he worked with chefs from France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Thailand. Between shifts, they would take it in turns to cook meals from home for each other and, one day, the others asked him to make something Korean.\"When they asked me to cook Korean food, I realised I couldn't,\" he says. \"As a Korean person and a chef, being unable to cook Korean food was embarrassing.\"He began revisiting the dishes he grew up with, not just restaurant staples but the home cooking most non-Koreans never encounter. \"In Korea, the real foundation of our food is jang,\" he says, referring to fermented pastes and sauces such as doenjang, ganjang and gochujang.Try this BBC Food kimchi recipe: But ingredients in Britain are different. \"We can't get exactly the same ingredients here that we have in Korea,\" he says. \"So a big challenge is: how do we reinterpret the character of British ingredients in a Korean way?\"We're a restaurant that uses Korean techniques and flavours, but we also rely heavily on what's available here in the UK,\" he continues. \"If an ingredient doesn't suit Korean seasoning, there's no need to put gochujang on it. If every dish at an Italian pasta restaurant came out with the same sauce, it would feel strange.\"As the popularity of Korean food grows, Joo thinks chefs may find it easier to source the authentic products they need. \"At the moment, I'd say we're only at the beginning. It feels like we've just reached the starting line.\"Food is the most important part of Korean dining culture. But Yoonsun Chang - who runs a Korean supper club - says Jeong, a deep warmth and care often associated with Korean hospitality, and inyeon, a sense of meaningful connections formed at the table, are also key. \"What I try to give is jeong, but what's created through these gatherings is also inyeon.\"LoKoLi – short for \"Lovely Korean Life\" – is a one-woman project run by Yoonsun, who creates one-off dining experiences built around Korean food and culture. I first came across her on Instagram and was struck by how much of it she was doing alone, driven by her own desire to show a version of Korean life that reflected what she loved.Guests at her monthly clubs, which she usually hosts at home, often say they want more than the obvious elements of K-culture. They already know the music and dramas. What they're seeking is the quieter, domestic side of Korean life: the table setting, the stories behind everyday dishes.She also pays close attention to how Korean food appears outside Korean spaces. She recalls a time when \"kimchi burgers\" in Britain used \"just some generic pickles\". Now, she says, pubs and restaurants increasingly use real kimchi. \"Seeing that makes me feel Korean culture has really spread,\" she says.'The flavour profiles were so different to what we were used to' For British YouTubers Armand and Max, their introduction to Korean food came after taking part in a viral video for the Korean Englishman YouTube channel.  Now in their early 20s, they say that day changed the way they eat.The video, which featured the pair trying Korean street food in their school playground, was seen by tens of millions - and eventually took them to Korea itself, where they tried barbecue, late-night ramyun and school lunches.\"The flavour profiles… were just so different to what we were used to,\" says Max. \"Fermented cabbage, kimchi, we'd never had that. That was delicious. I can't even compare it to anything.\"Korean EnglishmanBack in Judy's kitchen, as cabbages disappear into jars, she explains that proper kimchi needs weeks to ferment, though we were encouraged to taste it as it developed - as people do when making it at home.The jar I made that day is now bubbling away in my fridge. It's not the kind of kimchi my family would have made, but the process - rubbing paste into each leaf, waiting for the tang to deepen - connects back to kitchens thousands of miles away.Korean food in Britain is still young compared with other cuisines. It has not replaced anyone's Friday-night takeaway. But from supper clubs and YouTube channels to supermarket aisles and small flats where people are learning to make kimchi for the first time, it is steadily becoming part of everyday life.More weekend picks",

    "body": "4 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentHedi StantonHaim: \"Being in a rock band is where our heart and soul will always lie.\" (L-R: Alana, Danielle and Este Haim) \"When are you interviewing Haim?\" my sister Emily texts, late one night. \"I wanted you to ask if I can be their fourth member.\"There's just one problem: I also want to be Haim's fourth member. And we're not alone. Taylor Swift and actress Brie Larson have also begged for the position. Fellow Oscar-winner Emma Stone even teamed up with them for a Spice Girls tribute although, sadly, that wasn't a permanent deal.There's clearly something going on. Sisters Este, Danielle and Alana began their career playing gigs at local delicatessens with their parents. Now they're multiple Grammy nominees.Like all the best bands, they're a tight-knit gang. Their videos often show them striding in unison down the streets of Los Angeles. On stage, they play with such unfettered joy you can't help but think, \"I want to be part of that, too.\"\"The amount of times on tour that young girls came up to us and said, 'After your show, I got a guitar, I picked up drum sticks, I picked up a bass',\" says Alana, the youngest of the Haim siblings. \"That's the biggest honour. That's an award in itself. We've done our job if we can inspire young girls to start a band.\"So everyone is invited to be the fourth Haim sister.\"(Emily, you're in!)Getty ImagesThe band's live shows have seen them rise to the top of festival bills around EuropeThe band have called into the BBC from home, where they're resting up after an extensive tour in support of their fourth album, I Quit.They're currently reeling from the news it's been nominated for best rock album at the Grammys - with Haim the first all-female band ever in contention for the prize.\"I watch the nominations every year, so it kind of feels like The Truman Show when your name is read out,\" says Alana. \"I had to call my sisters to say, 'Did I hear this right or am I hallucinating?'\"The significance of the nomination isn't lost on the trio.\"We really set out to make a rock album this time, so it's a huge milestone,\" says Alana. \"But we're just grateful for the women that came before us.\"All we looked up to were women rock artists,\" adds Este. \"That was our world, growing up, whether it be Stevie Nicks, or Joni Mitchell, or Pat Benatar.\"Heartbreak and humourThe record emerged from a period of emotional upheaval. All three sisters found themselves single, and the music inhabits that strange liminal space where you're relieved to be free, but not quite ready to move on.\"Can I have your attention, please, for the last time before I leave,\" sings Danielle, over an Americana-style acoustic guitar on the opening track, Gone. Then: \"On second thought, I changed my mind.\"Este takes over the vocals on Cry, tracking her progress through the seven stages of grief. \"I'm past the anger, past the rage / But the hurt ain't gone.\"There are a lot of departures, a lot of goodbyes. The sisters want love, but not the specific love they've got. You can hear them working out in real time who they want to be, and refusing to be defined by how others see them.\"I love that description, yes,\" says Danielle. \"I Quit is kind of like a mantra. You have to actively work on shutting out the noise and saying, 'I don't give an [expletive] what people think'. \"When we were in our 20s, I wasn't strong enough to say something like that,\" says Alana, picking up the theme. \"I was more like, 'Oh, please love me'. \"But by the time we get to I Quit, I'm like, 'Screw this, I'm done'.  And with that comes an inner strength that I'm very proud to have.\"The group won the BBC's Sound of 2013 poll, and have subsequently scored four top 10 albums in the UKThat toughness required a new sound - more raw and immediate than anything the band had done before.For Danielle, who co-produced the album with Rostam Batmanglij, formerly of Vampire Weekend, that started with the drums.She plays an acoustic kit on every track, often layering multiple takes, recorded in different studios to capture specific tones. On Everybody's Trying To Figure Me Out, she even tuned her snare drum to match the \"iconic\" thwack of U2's Sunday Bloody Sunday.\"Drums are such a nuanced like thing, and I care so much about it, so much,\" she says, as if that wasn't abundantly clear already.\"'Journey of the drum sound' will be the name of our memoir,\" laughs Alana. \"I've said it a million times, our albums don't start until we find the perfect drum sound, and then we can continue on the journey of writing the songs.\"Haim / RostamI Quit refines Haim's signature sound, blending acoustic rock with hip-hop adjacent beats and hooky pop melodies. Danielle says drums are the foundation of every songThe evolution of Haim's sound also helped them grasp songs that had slipped through their fingers over the last decade.I Quit's first single Relationships is a glossy pop earworm that first came to Danielle on a flight home from Haim's 2017 Australian tour. In the intervening years, it went through \"hundreds\" of re-writes, changing lyrics and tempos, before finally \"coming to life\" at Batmanglij's home studio.By contrast, Take Me Back was made up on the spot, as the band shared raucous stories from their high school days - of boys who couldn't perform in bed and friends who lost control of their bowels \"in the back of a truck\".\"That one fell into place so quickly,\" says Alana. \"We didn't even know if it was going to go on the album. \"It was just us riffing from the heart and being like, 'This is the kind of song that we want to make today', with no pressure. We were laughing through the whole experience.\"At the end of it, we were like, 'This is hilarious, we've got to put it on the album'.\"That candour inspired the album's promotional campaign, where the sisters shared some of their dating horror stories. One man broke up with Este when she told him their future children might have Type 1 Diabetes. He was like, 'Then why are we here?'\" she recalls. Alana shared the story of travelling to London to spend New Year's Eve with a musician she thought she was dating, only for him to high five her at midnight.On tour, fans shared their own disaster stories on Haim's video screens. Among them was a girl in Philadelphia who discovered her boyfriend's private safe contained neither money nor passports, but a shrine to his ex... And his mum.\"When you're going through these heartbreaks, you just feel like there's no light,\" says Alana.'So to be able to laugh at those stories and share them with other people, and then have them tell you even crazier stories, it's so amazing.\"We can laugh at all these things, and it's not going to keep us from trying to find love in the future.\"Jono WhiteThe band recently wrapped up a six-month tour, but say they hope to hit the road again in 2026It's not difficult to sense a shift in the band. The first time we met in 2012, they were still wet behind the ears, and giddy from making their debut at London's O2 Arena.As the support act for Florence + The Machine, the sisters were overwhelmed at the realisation they'd just played the same stage as The Rolling Stones.\"I've been crawling on the floor, trying to soak it all up,\" said Alana. \"I think I have a little Mick Jagger in me.\"These days, Haim are more confident of their place in the rock pantheon. They're festival headliners, with two number one albums and an international fan base.Not only that, but they have successful side hustles in acting (Alana has just been \"shot in the head by Sean Penn\" in One Battle After Another) and soundtrack work (Este's credits include The White Lotus and Loot).But Haim will always be their number one priority.\"Me and my siblings have been playing music since I was four years old,\" says Alana. \"It's like there's nothing else that we were supposed to do. And I'm really grateful we've gotten here and we're still kicking.\"",

    "body": "17 minutes agoCatherine WyattBBC religious affairsHulu/Disney+Host Stassi Schroeder reunites the cast to explore scandals in the Season 3 ReunionInfidelity, divorce, even \"soft-swinging\" - not words traditionally associated with Christianity, but just some of the themes in the hit US reality show, The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.The TV series follows a group of female influencers in Utah - the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) - as they deal with friendship fall-outs, romantic problems, and their relationship with their faith.\"These Latter-day Saints are no angels,\" last month's trailer for season three declared, setting the tone for what was to come. The show became the most-watched unscripted season premiere of 2024 on Hulu and continues to attract millions of global viewers there and on Disney+. And the cast of women, who previously gained notoriety on TikTok under their \"MomTok\" banner, have gained scores of social media followers.But do Mormons living in the UK think the show gives a fair portrayal of their religion? BBC News has spoken to some, many of whom prefer to be referred to as members of the Latter-day Saints rather than Mormons.\"We're normal people,\" Ben, a podcast producer who lives near Burnley, says.\"So there is still infidelity, there are still extramarital affairs, probably at a significantly lower percentage because we are intentionally trying not to do that. But those things still happen.\"The show is appointment viewing for Ben's wife Olivia, who he says \"loves it\" - having put the new season in their calendar so she didn't miss it.Olivia and Ben say Mormons' lives are not as dramatic as the show suggestsWhen the first series aired last year, Ben, 27, feels there was \"hesitancy\" in the LDS community about it. Now, he says people are mostly supportive of the women on the programme and wouldn't say they are \"embarrassed\" by them - \"because we're not\".\"In the UK, if you spend a week with a Latter-day Saint family, it will probably be generally quite boring and average,\" he says.Ben and Olivia are among the approximately 185,000 LDS members in the UK. The church was founded by Joseph Smith in the US in 1830, who said he received a revelation from God, which he translated to become the Book of Mormon.Members of the LDS believe the Book is the word of God, like the Bible. Unlike other branches of Christianity, members do not believe Jesus is himself God, rather that they are separate beings.They are perhaps best known for their missionary tradition, where every year thousands of young Mormons are sent by the LDS to different locations around the world to recruit others to the religion.In 1837 the first missionaries from the newly founded LDS arrived in the UK in Preston, Lancashire - now home to Europe's largest Mormon temple. Earlier this year, plans to expand the temple, where Ben and Olivia sometimes worship, were approved by councillors.'It's not the way they live their life'Traci says she sometimes worries about how Mormons are being representedIn Buckinghamshire, Traci, 57, tells BBC News after growing up in the LDS, she moved away from the faith aged 17 when her mother died. About a decade later, pregnant with twins, she says she prayed every night, scared and asking for help. When her sons were born, and missionaries knocked on the door, she says she \"felt the Holy Ghost's presence\".Since then, she's been a practising member of the LDS - which, among other things, means abiding by a health code that prohibits drinking tea, coffee and alcohol, and eating meat sparingly.Traci, a psychotherapist based in Olney, decided not to watch the Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, but from what she's been told about it, says \"it's not representative of the women\" she knows in the LDS. \"It's not the way that they live their life.\"She says she understands \"sometimes people do have a curiosity about members of our church, they do want to know what makes us tick\", but adds: \"Sometimes I worry, how are we being represented? How do you see us?\"Disney/Natalie CassInfluencer Taylor Frankie Paul features heavily in a storyline about 'soft-swinging' in the showOne of the major themes of the TV show is the pressure the women feel in their family lives. Jessi, a woman in the show whose storyline revolves around an emotional affair she had, says avoiding to deal with issues in her marriage contributed to infidelity - and blamed Utah's Mormonism for creating \"a lot of pressure to have the perfect relationship, the perfect family and everything's great\".Back in the UK, we also spoke to Ben and Olivia's friend Ashlyn who went to university in Utah and now lives in Burnley with her husband Joe, and their nine-month-old son.She says the show is \"a really accurate representation of the church in Utah, and culturally what Utah looks like, where belief meets cultural practices\".The sheer number of Mormons there means that pressure to have a family comes not just from the Church, but from \"everybody that you interact with\", Ashlyn, 25, adds.\"That pressure is very real. A lot of us call it the Utah bubble.\"Becy/Bell Art PhotographyAshlyn and Joe say there are some differences between the LDS in Utah and the UKBut she says it's not the same in the UK. She describes the show's US cast as \"probably more culturally members\" of the LDS, rather than devout believers.Ashlyn describes her experiences of the LDS as encouraging, rather than pressuring. \"Some people view a lot of the commandments, and what people might label 'rules', as very confining and almost like there's all these gates holding me in,\" Ashlyn says, \"whereas for us, it's viewed a little bit more as safety. It helps direct us in the right way.\"'Soft-swinging' and race issues in the showAnd so-called \"soft swinging\", one of the show's scandals, would \"definitely\" be \"discouraged\" by the Church, she says.Influencer Taylor Frankie Paul was at the centre of the story in series one of the show, when she described her and her then-husband as being sexually intimate - but stopping short of \"going all the way\" - with two other couples at various parties.Ashlyn explains how in the LDS, \"we have something called the law of chastity that says we should really save sexual relations within our marriages\".She says her lifestyle in Burnley is \"very family-centered, very healthy, trying to focus on going to church on Sunday, serving others, being a really good example to others, and helping in the community\".Ashlyn adds: \"I don't think it would be as entertaining if The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives was actually just them bringing cookies to their neighbours and just living very wholesome family lives.\"Another theme in the show centres on Layla, a black member of the LDS, who stops attending because she says the Church didn't \"resonate\" with her any more as a person of colour, having converted to LDS and moved to Utah when she was 16.\"There is an old scripture in the Book of Mormon that states that black skin is a curse. It's something that I am aware of now that I wasn't aware of when I first converted,\" she says in the latest series.In 2013 the LDS \"disavowed\" those teachings, and now believes \"everyone is an equal child of God regardless of race\".BBC News spoke to Naomi, a 'Young Women's President' in her local congregation in London, meaning she looks after girls between the ages of 12 and 18 in her area. She told us how as \"a black female\", she hopes the children \"can see me and my example and know what's possible\".Naomi says she hasn't \"had any negative experiences\" in the Church based on her race, and says the teachings \"have been denounced\".Naomi feels accepted by the LDS despite its old teachings on raceThe members of the LDS in Britain we spoke to had mixed opinions on whether The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives represents their way of life, with most agreeing that parts of it were exaggerated depictions.Ahead of the first series of the show last year, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the UK released a statement titled, \"When entertainment media distorts faith\".While it didn't name the show, it said: \"A number of recent productions depict lifestyles and practices blatantly inconsistent with the teachings of the Church.\"We understand the fascination some in the media have with the Church, but regret that portrayals often rely on sensationalism and inaccuracies that do not fairly and fully reflect the lives of our Church members or the sacred beliefs that they hold dear.\"Naomi, who is a TV producer working on reality shows, knows all too well that it's a classic of the genre that \"things are going to be heightened, things are going to be produced to get the desired effect\".\"I'm very aware of that.\"More on this story",

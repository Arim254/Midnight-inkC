    "body": "5 hours agoTabby WilsonBBC/Getty ImagesBlake Lively and Justin Baldoni have been at loggerheads since starring together in It Ends With UsBlake Lively referred to Justin Baldoni as a \"doofus director\" and a \"clown\", according to newly unsealed court documents from the actress's legal case.The pair starred together in It Ends With Us, but Lively sued Baldoni in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment and waging a smear campaign against her. Baldoni strongly denies the claims and is defending the lawsuit.Text messages from 2023 between Lively and people close to her appear to show that Lively called Baldoni a \"rabid pig\", while her friend Taylor Swift suggested Baldoni knew the lawsuit was coming \"because he's gotten out his tiny violin\".Baldoni's $400m (£295m) counter-suit was dismissed by a judge last June. Neither has yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.Lively's case is set to go to trial in May.  The newly unsealed documents show both Lively and Baldoni venting to friends and colleagues about filming It Ends With Us, and the subsequent press tour, ahead of the film's release in August 2024.In the messages, Lively referred to Baldoni as \"this doofus director of my movie\" and described him as \"a clown\" who \"thinks he's a writer now\".In their filing earlier this week, Lively's team did not deny the language she had used but said the text messages were missing context.They referred the court to the \"complete\" text exchange, including subsequent messages from Lively to Baldoni which said \"we all benefit\" from her relationship with Swift and her husband Ryan Reynolds, and \"you will too, I can promise you\".Text messages between Lively and singer Taylor Swift (pictured) appear to be among the unsealed documentsThe messages also show Lively saying of Baldoni: \"Despite his repeated disturbing behaviour and acts, I still feel bad for him.\"To be reminded multiple times daily that he's smearing me for... asking him not to sexually or emotionally harass me? For making his movie better? For calling in all the favours to turn out all the biggest musicians and entertainers to contribute to making his movie better? For leading a marketing campaign for free?\"She continued: \"I literally don't know a single thing I've done that he can smear me about. Ryan [Reynolds] says [Baldoni] should be writing me apology and thank you letters every day. And instead he chooses to make a monster outta me.\"But what's my crime. I've only ever stayed focused on the work and given him every opportunity to make it better. And he just keeps behaving like a rabid pig.\"The messages also appear to show Lively texted Baldoni's former The Man Enough Podcast co-host, Liz Plank in May 2023, and told her that \"today I came home and cried\" following an \"SOS set visit\". Plank responded by saying that she \"thought maybe things had gotten better\", and that it was \"astounding they have gotten away with so much\". It is unclear who \"they\" refers to.The documents note that Plank recalled working on Baldoni's set as \"truly one of the worst days of [her] life\". Later that year, Lively also sent texts to actress and co-star Jenny Slate, and said she was \"dreading\" going back to set and \"getting hits of the experience in really upsetting ways\".In her deposition, Slate also alleged misconduct on the set of the film, with court documents revealing that she had made complaints against Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath during the course of filming It Ends With Us.Similarly, texts sent by Baldoni also suggest friction between him and Lively. In February 2024, Baldoni told Heath that he was concerned that Lively would use the allegations she had made against him as leverage. He wrote: \"She had the nuclear bomb. If she doesn't promote the movie she can leak that I'm a bad person or that she felt unsafe with me and 'all the stuff' she has on me. Then she's the victim.\"Heath is the CEO of Wayfarer Studios, the independent production company behind It Ends With Us, which is named in Lively's lawsuit.Her legal filing accuses Baldoni and Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\", in addition to a hostile working environment.The text messages were unsealed on Tuesday before a summary judgement hearing in Lively's ongoing lawsuit that is scheduled for 22 January.The BBC has contacted Lively and Baldoni's respective legal teams for comment.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAndy GillNorth WestFamily photoSheila Jackson and Peter Greener died when their house was set on fireAn elderly couple who died in a house fire were the unintended victims of an arson attack over a drugs dispute, a court has heard. Sheila Jackson, 83, and Eric Greener, 77, died when their house in South John Street, St Helens, was set alight in July last year.Kevin Weetman, Kylie Maynard and Lee Owens all deny murder, while Owens has admitted the manslaughter of the couple.The jury at Liverpool Crown Court heard all parties in the case accept that another man, Paul Smith, who died shortly after the blaze, was involved in starting the fire. Nigel Power KC, prosecuting, told the jury that the intended victim of the fire was Sheila Jackson's son George Jackson, who sometimes lived at the house in South John Street.It was alleged that Weetman and Maynard had tried to trick George Jackson into working for Weetman as a drug dealer, and that when he declined, Weetman allegedly arranged the attack because of a loss of \"face\".A month before the fire, George Jackson had helped Maynard after she was robbed of drugs. Maynard was selling cocaine from a tent near a local canal and George Jackson had bought drugs from her.But on 6 June last year George Jackson found  Maynard in a distressed state because \"three lads\" had stolen drugs from her. The fire was set during a drugs debt dispute, a court heard George Jackson took her to his mother's house to get something to eat and wash her clothes, and she stayed there for two days and one night.Prosecutor Power said Weetman gave George Jackson some drugs worth several hundred pounds as a \"reward\" for looking after Maynard. When George Jackson picked up the drugs he was asked if he wanted to deal drugs, but he declined, Power said.A few days after he received the drugs, George Jackson received a phone call again asking if he wanted work drug dealing, Power said.He added that when he said no again, a man the prosecution says was Weetman said \"What about my dough?\"Power said Weetman \"resolved to take action to prevent  a loss of 'face'\". He added: \"'Face' is all important in the drug world. And [he] set in motion a plan to kill or at least cause really seriously harm to George Jackson by setting fire to his house in the middle of the night.\"George Jackson was out when the fire was set, on 15 July, but his mother and her partner died in the blaze.It was alleged that Smith and Owens travelled from Liverpool to St Helens on the night of the fire to carry out the attack.Owens has admitted the manslaughter of the couple. The court heard that he only intended that damage to the building should come from the fire. Weetman and Maynard deny having anything to do with the fire or the deaths.The trial is expected to last six weeks.",

She was replaced by Lady Caroline Waldegrave.Alison Hammond and Noel Fielding are the current Bake Off presenters, but Dame Prue has also appeared with previous hosts Sandi Toksvig and Matt Lucas.Dame Prue said: \"Bake Off has been a fabulous part of my life for the last nine years, I have genuinely loved it and I'm sure I'll miss working with my fellow judge Paul, Alison and Noel and the teams at Love Productions and Channel 4.\"But now feels like the right time to step back (I'm 86 for goodness sake!), there's so much I'd like to do, not least spend summers enjoying my garden.\"She added: \"Whoever joins the team, I'm sure they'll love it as much as I have. I feel very lucky to have been part of it.\"Dame Prue was hired for Bake Off after the series jumped from the BBC to Channel 4 in 2016.She replaced Dame Mary, who left the show along with presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins after the move.Channel 4's chief content officer Ian Katz said Dame Prue had been \"a joyous presence in the tent, pairing absolute culinary authority with great generosity and empathy for the bakers\". \"We are grateful for her passion, her wit, her ineffable style, and all the summers she spent in the tent.\"He added: \"She leaves an indelible mark on the show and all its bakers. We will miss her wry, gentle judgement but look forward to working with her on new projects.\"Former contestants also commented on Instagram to share their tributes to Leith.Jasmine Mitchell, who won Bake Off in 2025, wrote: \"Prue, you're amazing and we will miss you so very much.\"Dr Rahul Mandal, who won in 2018, added: \"We will miss you so much. It was a joy and privilege to be in the tent with you. You are kind, funny passionate and always inspired us.\"",

The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones.Many of the victims were too disfigured to be identified, and 69 people had been labelled in Persian as John or Jane Doe, suggesting their identity was unknown when the photo was taken. Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos.Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far.The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah. The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state.Getty ImagesProtesters on a street in Tehran on 9 January BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as \"seditionists\".Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out.Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify.We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. \"It was just too much,\" they said.Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen. Crowds of anti-government protesters in TehranThe slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment.Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming.Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession.BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.BBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.",

    "body": "7 minutes agoClara Bullock,West of EnglandandMaisie Lillywhite,GloucesterGloucestershire ConstabularyMandy Wixon was found guilty of keeping another woman captive for 25 yearsA woman has been found guilty of keeping another woman with learning difficulties captive for 25 years and using her as a slave.Mother-of-10 Mandy Wixon made the vulnerable woman clean her squalid home in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and forced her to live off scraps.Washing-up liquid would be squirted down the victim's throat, bleach splashed on her face, and she had her head repeatedly shaved against her will.At Gloucester Crown Court, Judge Ian Lawrie said there was a \"Dickensian quality\" to the case as Wixon was found guilty of false imprisonment, requiring a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.Mandy Wixon was arrested by police after concerns were raised by one of her sonsThe BBC has only now been able to report details of the case due to reporting restrictions.The court heard that the woman - who the BBC is calling K - was born into a troubled family and, when she was about 16 in 1996, was given to Wixon, who had a loose connection to her family.Now in her 40s, K was found by police on 15 March 2021 after one of Wixon's sons raised concerns for her welfare.The court heard K was regularly beaten and also hit with a broom handle, knocking out her teeth.Her food was limited by Wixon and she could not leave the house and was forced to secretly wash at night.Officers described K's bedroom as looking like a \"prison cell\", with other bedrooms also untidy and dirty.She told police: \"I don't want to be here. I don't feel safe. Mandy hits me all the time. I don't like it.\"Gloucestershire ConstabularyThe victim was kept imprisoned in \"squalid conditions\"Det Sgt Alex Pockett said: \"When the police arrived, the victim had her head held down, it was clear she was extremely scared.\"She had short hair, she looked extremely malnourished, she was in scruffy clothes,\" Pockett added.Sam Jones, prosecuting, told the jury: \"By the late 1990s it appears the woman disappeared into a black hole. Not a single meeting that left a record or a single sighting of her outside the house.\"Since being rescued, K is now living with a foster family, attending college and has been on holidays abroad.Wixon was released on conditional bail and will be sentenced on 12 March.",

    "body": "Driving test cheating soars as candidates turn to Bluetooth headsets and impersonators16 hours agoKaty Austin,Transport correspondentandSimon Browning, Transport reporterGetty ImagesCheating cases during practical and theory driving tests rose by nearly 50 per cent last year in England, Scotland and Wales, new figures show.The cheating methods varied, according to freedom of information data from the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), with more than 1,100 cases involving the use of Bluetooth headsets. Overall, nearly 100 offenders were prosecuted for trying to cheat themselves or for impersonating driving test candidates.Industry leaders blamed the increase on the nationwide shortage of tests and drivers' desperation to pass, while the DVSA blamed a general rise in cheating and improved detection. A Press Association News Agency freedom information request revealed 2,844 attempts to cheat during driving tests in the year to September 2025, 47% higher than the previous year. Of those, more than a third (1,113) involved the use of technology, such as an earpiece connected via Bluetooth to a concealed phone, to try to cheat at a theory test.Meanwhile people attempted 1,084 times to try to take theory tests while impersonating the registered candidate.  And in 647 incidents, people pretended to be the registered candidate for a practical test.Dr Rasha Kassem, leader of the Fraud Research Group at Aston University, warned of the dangers of people passing tests illegally without actually knowing how to drive.\"It means that there will be more accidents, collisions, insurance issues as well, damage to the car, and damage to human beings, injuries, and in some cases, death,\" she said.\"There has to be public awareness, because this is a serious crime, from my perspective, and also in the eyes of the law. It is fraud.\"Impersonators, and those who use them, face punishments ranging from driving bans to prison sentences. They can also be ordered to carry out unpaid work or made to pay court costs. Ninety-six people were prosecuted for attempting to cheat on driving tests or impersonate candidates in the 12 months to September last year.Steps taken to try and prevent fraud including matching a practical test candidate's face with their photo ID, as well as asking theory candidates to roll up their sleeves and show their pockets are empty. Examples of people prosecuted last year, reported by the Press Association News Agency, include 23-year-old Qounain Khan, who was handed an eight-month prison sentence in June 2025 after pleading guilty to impersonating learners at theory test centres 12 times.The court heard impersonators could be paid up to £2,000 for passing a test.Sorina-Ana Turcitu, 42, admitted attempting to take a practical driving test on behalf of someone else. She was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 18 months in September 2025.And Ali Rasul, 22, was handed a two-year prison sentence  in November 2025 after being caught repeatedly trying to cheat the theory test over an eight-month period either by using a hidden earpiece or an impersonator.The rise in reported cheating comes as learner drivers face persistently long waits for practical tests slots. The DVSA said it had no evidence cheating was linked to waiting times.However, Carly Brookfield, chief executive of the Driving Instructors Association, told the BBC she was not surprised that fraud was on the rise in this context.\"It almost seems inevitable in an era of lots of demand, but very little consistent supply, that you are going to get people engaging in risky behaviours, like using a cheat service to try and pass.\"She said people who \"don't want to risk going on the torturous merry-go-round and trying to get another slot...might take the risk, unfortunately, of cheating.\" Dr Kassem also believed long wait times to book a slot was likely to be a factor, with some people resorting to fraud for reasons such as needing to get a licence quickly for a job.In December, the National Audit Office warned that the driving test backlog would not be cleared until November 2027.Causes include poor recruitment and retention of examiners and third-party websites booking up slots using automated programs known as bots.The Department for Transport (DfT) previously announced more action to try to get the backlog down, including employing military driving examiners and only allowing learner drivers to book and manage their practical driving tests from the coming Spring.Marian Kitson, the DVSA's director of enforcement services, said the organisation was committed to tackling practical and theory test fraud, and had increased its detection capabilities.\"It is essential that all drivers demonstrate they have the right skills, knowledge, and attitude to drive safely. People who attempt to cheat driving tests put all road users at risk by trying to obtain a driving licence fraudulently,\" she said.\"Our counter-fraud team carries out robust investigations into suspected fraud, working with the police to bring fraudsters to justice and keep Britain's roads safe.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "1 hour agoJoshua Nevett,Political reporterandRichard Wheeler,Political reporterPeers in the House of Lords have been urged to vote in support of a ban on social media for under-16s in the UK.Lord Nash, a former schools minister, has proposed a change to a bill, which would raise the age limit for users of social media. The legislation will be debated later on Wednesday.It comes amid calls for the UK government to follow Australia in imposing a social media ban for young people - the world's first - last year.But some campaigners and children's charities have opposed the move, which Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out.Earlier this week, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall announced a \"swift\" consultation on measures to \"keep children safe online\" and seek views on the effectiveness of a ban.It will assess the merits of a ban for under-16s, as well as overnight curfews and actions to prevent \"doom-scrolling\".It would also look at whether more robust age checks could be implemented by social media firms, which could be forced to remove or limit features \"which drive compulsive use of social media\".And England's education inspectorate, Ofsted, will give tougher guidance to schools to reduce phone use - including telling staff not to use their devices for personal reasons in front of pupils.Conservative peer Lord Nash argued there was no need for a consultation, partly because polling showed \"the vast majority of parents want it\".\"There is a huge volume of evidence in academic studies around the world that show quite clearly that excessive use of social media is damaging to children's health,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.He said his amendment proposed \"highly effective age verification\".\"The social media companies are perfectly capable, and have told me this, of putting in place highly effective age verification.\"He added: \"We're just asking for a few more years for children to mature so that they do have to deal with social media at 16, they're more likely to distinguish fact from fiction and they can make better judgements.\"Lord Nash's amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill has been co-sponsored by Labour peer Baroness Berger, Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Benjamin and independent crossbench peer Baroness Cass.However, if the amendment passed in the Lords, it could be overturned in the House of Commons by MPs at a later stage.On Sunday, more than 60 Labour MPs wrote to the prime minister saying they backed a ban with the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey also calling on the government to act.Baroness Kidron, an online safety campaigner who founded and chairs the 5Rights Foundation, said there had been a \"growing call\" for a social media ban for under-16s.The independent crossbench peer said support from more than 60 Labour MPs for a ban was \"crucial\" should the Lords approve the amendment.Baroness Kidron told the BBC's Politics Live programme: \"It means that there's at least 60 people on the government benches who are not willing to just walk through [the division lobbies] and overturn it.\"So that's why it's become a huge thing.\"Baroness Kidron said the government had brought forward a \"hastily created consultation\".She said she was \"absolutely furious\" because \"the consultation is not really on the main point of child safety, it's actually a bit of party management trying to deal with their own backbench revolt\".Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy defended the \"short and sharp\" three-month consultation, noting there were \"mixed views that have been put forward about how you tackle this\".She said: \"I just want to say to anybody listening at home, because like them I have a little boy and it keeps me awake at night thinking about some of the things he is exposed to online, I do want to say that we are consulting on what we do not whether we do something.\"We will tighten the law, we will introduce greater enforcement powers and we will introduce other measures as well, and we're consulting on how we best go about that in order to take swift action to deal with what is a problem for every single family in this country.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said her party would introduce a social media ban for under-16s if it was in power.\"The prime minister is trying to copy an announcement that the Conservatives made a week ago, and still not getting it right,\" she said.The Liberal Democrats have called for film-style age ratings to protect children.Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Munira Wilson said there was \"no time to waste in protecting our children from social media giants\" and \"this consultation risks kicking the can down the road yet again\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterHigh street fashion giant Next has bought shoe retailer Russell & Bromley which had collapsed in to administration.Next paid £2.5m in a rescue deal for the upmarket British footwear and accessories seller -- but the future for most of the chain's current staff and shops remains uncertain.Next will own the brand and three of Russell & Bromley's 36 stores, as well as some existing stock for which it is paying an additional £1.3m.Administrators Interpath said it was considering the future of the remaining stores, which for the moment remain open, as well as nine concession stores which all employ around 400 people.Russell & Bromley's chief executive Andrew Bromley said it was a \"difficult decision\" but the sale of the brand was the best way to secure its future.The company is around 150 years old but has become the latest to struggle in a tough retail environment. It joins other brands in a familiar path to largely disappearing off the high street via a process of administration, which means companies are often broken up and the highest value assets sold off to the highest bidder.The Original Factory Shop and accessories retailer Claire's are both currently going through a process of administration, with site closures and jobs at risk. Around 1,000 people lost their jobs after Bodycare collapsed in September, while River Island will close some stores to avoid a total collapse. The woes all come after a tranche of high profile closures such as Debenhams and Wilko.In a statement, Next said it secured \"the future of a much loved British footwear brand.\" \"Next intends to build on this legacy and provide the operational stability and expertise to support Russell & Bromley's next chapter, allowing it to return to its core mission: the design and curation of world-class, premium footwear and accessories for many years to come.\"The three stores Next will acquire are in high-end shopping destinations in or around London: Chelsea, Mayfair and Kent.Next has seen relatively solid performance in the current turbulent retail landscape - unlike Russell & Bromley which has been loss-making in recent years.Its saviour has experience in failing circumstances: last year, Next bought out of administration fashion maternity label Seraphine, and began rolling out its FatFace concessions a few years after snapping it up.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterGetty ImagesThe BBC has announced a landmark deal with YouTube, which will see the corporation make content that is tailor-made for the video streaming service.The broadcaster has previously used YouTube, which is owned by Google, to promote clips and trailers for its own shows in the UK.But the new move will see the BBC make content primarily aimed at YouTube's  digital-native younger audience, although it may also be made available on the BBC's iPlayer and Sounds platforms.The new programmes will feature adverts when viewed from outside of the UK, generating extra funds for the corporation at a time when its future funding model is being debated.The content will include a mixture of entertainment, documentaries, children's channels, news and sport - starting with the Winter Olympics in February.In a statement released on Wednesday, YouTube and the BBC said the deal will showcase \"the best homegrown storytelling and news from across the BBC\".Director general Tim Davie said it would help the BBC help \"connect with audiences in new ways\".\"We're building from a strong start and this takes us to the next level, with bold homegrown content in formats audiences want on YouTube and an unprecedented training programme to upskill the next generation of YouTube creators from across the UK,\" he added.\"Importantly, this partnership also allows new audiences different routes into BBC services like BBC iPlayer and Sounds.\"The BBC has not previously produced original series for YouTube, but its main account on the streaming platform, which hosts trailers and clips, has more than 15 million subscribers. A separate BBC News YouTube channel has around 19 million.It's understood the BBC will increase the number of channels it has on YouTube to 50. In the UK, the corporation will not carry advertising around its content for the streaming platform.The new partnership will also see the BBC and YouTube support the government's Creative Industries Sector Plan by investing in \"the next generation of creators\" across the country.Led by the National Film and Television School, 150 media professionals will be invited to develop their YouTube skills at workshops and events.'Digital storytelling'Pedro Pina, vice president of EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) YouTube said they were \"delighted\" to partner with the BBC \"to redefine the boundaries of digital storytelling\".\"This partnership translates the BBC's world-class content for a digital-first audience, ensuring its cultural impact reaches a younger, more global audience,\" he said.\"Beyond the content, our first-of-its-kind training programme represents a deep investment in the UK's creative pipeline designed to empower the next generation of British talent to lead the global creator economy.\"In doing so, we are not just telling the stories of today; we are building the stage for the storytellers of tomorrow.\"In December, the number of people watching YouTube in the UK (52 million) overtook the BBC's combined offerings (51 million) on certain metrics for the first time, according to data reported by rating agency Barb. And last summer, research suggested that social media and video networks had become the main source of news in the US, overtaking traditional TV channels and news websites.The new agreement between YouTube and the BBC covers the latter's UK-based public service broadcasting wing, as well as international content from BBC Studios. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said last year that the BBC's licence fee is \"unenforceable\" and that \"no options are off the table\" as the government reviews the corporation's current funding model.",

The club, however, said it had not yet received any official notification.It is barely a 10th of the size of a full-scale football field, there are patches of rust on the goalposts and, towering over the length of one of the touchlines, the architecture of conflict looms large in Israel's concrete security barrier.But while it may not rank high up among the world's iconic sporting venues, this children's football club has found itself at the centre of a hard-fought international campaign for its survival.And despite the asymmetrical odds as it took on the Israeli state, that campaign appears - for now at least - to have worked.The club has won a reprieve against the threat of demolition by the Israeli military, which claimed that the pitch was far too close to the barrier.On the very northern edge of Bethlehem, construction of the pitch began in 2020 with the aim of providing a place to practise football for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp.The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal.The notice was followed by a demolition order, issued at the end of December.\"We don't have anywhere else to play, 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back.\"We are building our dreams here,\" she said. \"If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.\"I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction.\"I was upset,\" he told me. \"This is a field I really care for.\"The community fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures as well as the reported interventions of senior officials from some of football's global and regional governing bodies.In its latest statement, the Israeli military repeated its claim that the football pitch, built so close to the wall, posed a security issue.But the BBC understands that a political decision has been made to postpone the demolition order \"for the time being\".Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis.It says it is vital for Israel's protection and that it has dramatically cut the number of attacks.Palestinians, however, say that it has become a tool of collective punishment, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land.For them, the fight over the football pitch highlights a wider injustice.While they are being denied the right to keep a small sporting facility on the boundary of one of their cities, Israel is approving vast new settlements across the occupied West Bank and which are considered illegal under international law.The immediate threat may now have been averted for the football pitch.But the club is taking nothing for granted.Mohammad Abu Srour, one of the board members of the Aida Youth Centre, told me that they feared that the threat might come back when the club is out of the spotlight.\"We're going to continue to campaign,\" he told me.",

    "body": "24 minutes agoJessica RawnsleyandMaia DaviesThe Duke of Sussex was visibly emotional as he told a court the life of his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, had been made \"an absolute misery\" by the publisher of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.Prince Harry was speaking as he concluded his evidence in his case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) at the High Court, much of which focused on articles about his relationships before meeting Meghan.The prince's voice broke as he said the court battle had been a \"horrible experience\" for his family and that all he wanted was \"an apology and some accountability\".He is one of seven high-profile claimants accusing ANL of \"grave breaches of privacy\" over a 20-year period. The publisher has denied wrongdoing.The prince's claim focuses on 14 articles - most of which are about his relationship with a previous girlfriend, Chelsy Davy.In his witness statement, he said the papers' coverage of their relationship had been \"terrifying\" and left him \"really worried something bad was going to happen\".He accused the publisher of \"probably wanting to drive me to drugs and drinking to sell more of their papers\". The prince also said it was \"beyond cruel\" to publish an article detailing \"confidential discussions\" he had with his family after a photo of his dying mother Diana, Princess of Wales, was published in the Italian press.The claimants have accused ANL of \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for stories between 1993 and \"beyond\" 2018, including through private investigators and blagging.In his 23-page witness statement the prince said he had always felt under \"24-hour surveillance\" but at the time the articles were published \"knew nothing of Associated's unlawful acts that were directed at me and those around me\".He said the articles drove him \"paranoid beyond belief\" and made him feel like he was \"part of an endless pursuit, a campaign, an obsession of having every aspect of my life under surveillance\".Harry added that the Mail was the first to publicly disclose Davy's name and the  subsequent \"intrusion was terrifying for Chelsy: it made her feel like she was being hunted\".\"Their behaviour and treatment of Chelsy was not normal,\" he said. \"I was really worried something bad was going to happen.\"Harry told the court he did not remember reading the 2006 article about his and his brother's reactions to the publication of a picture of their mother after her fatal car crash at the time, but said the \"disgusting\" piece made him think: \"If Associated was willing to publish this type of material, then it really makes me wonder how far they are prepared to go.\"Information in the article, he said, suggested they \"were plainly listening in to our calls\".ANL has previously denied allegations of unlawful information gathering.Joining the duke in bringing the lawsuit against ANL are:Actors Liz Hurley and Sadie FrostSir Elton John and his husband David FurnishSir Simon Hughes, the former Liberal Democrat MPBaroness Doreen Lawrence, a campaigner whose son Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racist attack in south London in 1993ANL's lawyer Antony White KC has said the claimants are \"clutching at straws\", and that in some cases celebrities' friends and social circles contributed as sources to Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday journalists.In court on Wednesday, White suggested Harry knew his social circle was \"leaky\", to which the prince responded: \"My social circles were not leaky, I want to make that absolutely clear.\"",

    "body": "<div><p>A woman whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004 has become the fourth person to be named through an international police campaign called Operation Identify Me.</p><p>The woman was named on Friday as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer. She was identified following a tip-off to police in the Netherlands.</p><p>The cause of death remains unexplained, and police are continuing to investigate.</p><p>Operation Identify Me was launched in 2023 to find the names of women who had been murdered or died in suspicious or unexplained circumstances in six European countries.</p></div><div><p>Known as \"the woman with the German keys\", Ms Pommer's body was discovered lying in sand dunes on a remote beach near the city of Wassenaar in July 2004. There were no obvious signs of injury or struggle.</p><p>The BBC visited the beach last year, where Dutch forensic investigator Sandra Baasbank said Ms Pommer was wearing brown plaid leggings and red shiny patent shoes – \"unusual if you are going for a walk on the beach\".</p><p>She had also been carrying a key that linked her to the German city of Bottrop, close to the Dutch border.</p><p>But police were unable to trace the key to a precise address, and her identity remained a mystery for two decades.</p><p>Last year, they added the case to Operation Identify Me, which has seen Interpol \"black notices\" - seeking information about unidentified bodies - released to the public for the first time, and records such as fingerprints shared with police forces around the world.</p><p>It has also seen renewed publicity for the unsolved cases.</p><p>After an appeal linked to the campaign aired on German TV, Dutch police received a \"crucial tip\" about a German woman who had been missing for about 20 years.</p><p>This \"accelerated\" investigations in Bottrop, and DNA testing later confirmed Ms Pommer's identity.</p></div><div><p>Interpol, the international policing agency, says increased global migration and human trafficking has led to more people being reported missing outside of their countries, which can make identifying bodies more challenging.</p><p>Interpol secretary general Valdecy Urquiza said: \"This latest identification is more than just a milestone in our ongoing campaign - it's a testament to what we can accomplish when nations stand together.\"</p><p>Janny Knol, commissioner of the Dutch National Police, said: \"In combination with perseverance of Dutch and German detectives yet another woman has been given a name.</p><p>\"Our thoughts are with all the families who have finally received answers about their loved ones and with the families who are still waiting for these answers.\"</p><p>The first woman to be identified as a result of the involvement of the public through the Interpol-coordinated initiative was 31-year-old British citizen Rita Roberts, who was murdered in Belgium in 1992. Her family identified her after seeing a photograph of her tattoo in a BBC News report.</p><p>A woman found dead in a poultry shed in Spain in 2018 was then identified as 33-year-old Ainoha Izaga Ibieta Lima, from Paraguay in South America.</p><p>Last month, a woman whose body was discovered by the side of a road in a different part of Spain in 2005 was named as 31-year-old Russian national Liudmila Zavada.</p><p>Police are still trying to find the identities of another 43 women found dead in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain.</p><p>The majority of them are murder victims, believed to have been aged between 15 and 30 years old. Most died 10, 20, 30 or even 40 years ago. </p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges by a grand jury. </p><p>James, who led a civil fraud investigation against Trump in 2023, was indicted on charges of bank fraud in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, according to court documents. </p><p>Prosecutors accuse James of alleged bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan for a house in Norfolk, Virginia, the documents state. </p><p>In a statement, James accused the president - who recently publicly pressured prosecutors to file criminal charges against her - of a \"desperate weaponization of our justice system\".</p></div><div><p>\"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State attorney general,\" she said. </p><p>\"These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost.\"</p><p>The US prosecutor assigned to the case, Lindsey Halligan, meanwhile, said the case proved that \"no one is above the law\". </p><p>\"The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" she said. </p><p>\"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\"</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Trump's only goal is \"political retribution\" - Letitia James responds to indictment</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Trump appointed Halligan, his former personal attorney, to oversee the case after another US prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned. Siebert was reportedly ousted after he told the justice department he had not found sufficient evidence to charge James.</p><p>James' first court appearance is scheduled for 24 October in Norfolk.</p><p>The federal government alleges James bought a three-bedroom home in Norfolk using a mortgage loan that required her to use the property as her secondary residence and did not allow for shared ownership or \"timesharing\" of the home. </p><p>The indictment claims the property \"was not occupied or used\" by James as a secondary residence, but was instead \"used as a rental investment property\", which was being rented to a family of three.</p><p>The \"misrepresentation\" allowed James to obtain favourable loan terms that would not have been available for an investment property, prosecutors claim.</p><p>Halligan said that, if convicted, James could face up to 30 years in prison per count and up to a $1 million (£751,755) fine on each count.</p><p>James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said: \"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"</p><p>Trump last month called on US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the justice department, in a social media post to prosecute his political opponents, including James. </p><p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote.</p><p>James was one of several Trump adversaries named in that post. He also called on Bondi to investigate former FBI Director James Comey, who was criminally charged shortly after the post. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday after being charged with making a false statement to Congress.</p><p>The justice department has also reportedly opened investigations into Trump's ex-national security adviser John Bolton and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.</p><p>In the civil fraud case brought by James, Trump was found liable of falsifying records to secure better loan deals, leading to a $500m (£375m) fine. The penalty was thrown out by an appeals court, which called the fine excessive, though it upheld that Trump was liable for fraud. </p><p>During the case, Trump frequently attacked James outside of the courtroom, accusing her of carrying out a \"political witch hunt\" against him. James said the courts had ruled that Trump was \"not above the law\". </p><p>James on Thursday said she stands behind her office's litigation against Trump and his organisation. </p><p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said James's indictment \"is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable.\"</p><p>The New York Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union called it \"the latest in a long list of brazen abuses of power by President Trump\".</p></div>",

reporters, secretary of state Marco Rubio handed Donald Trump a note that read the words “very close”, followed by a whisper where he told the president that Israel and Hamas were on the brink of reaching a Gaza ceasefire agreement. \nAlthough there are many details of the plan still being worked on, this could potentially be a pivotal moment. Posting on Truth Social, the president said that all Israeli hostages held in Gaza would be released soon in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israel. \nIn today’s podcast, Sarah and Anthony discuss Donald Trump’s role in the process, how much credit he can personally take, and what it tells us about US foreign policy. \nHOSTS:\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Alix Pickles.

The next election takes place in May.</p><p>\"Change now seems inevitable,\" he will say, calling on voters to back his party if they want to stop Nigel Farage's Reform UK from winning the election.</p></div><div><p>Plaid Cymru has played a key role during the life of devolution, being an occasional supporter of Labour governments.</p><p>It has been unable to beat Labour in an election - but recent opinion polling has suggested Plaid is vying with the party to win, as is Reform.</p><p>Rhun ap Iorwerth is now trying to position his party as a government-in-waiting.</p><p>Even if Plaid came first it is possible they would have to work with Labour or other parties in some form, with no party having ever won a majority in the Senedd.</p><p>The party leader will tell his conference: \"Today, with a historic nation-building opportunity before us, I'm going to set out the choice facing Wales - two very different futures but only one credible option.</p><p>\"Let's be clear. We're not here to act as Labour's conscience. We are not here to repair Labour. We are here to replace them.</p><p>\"We promise a new government, with new energy and new ideas to prove what every person who believes in Wales already knows - that things don't have to be this way.\"</p><p>With some exceptions, Plaid Cymru has traditionally had more support in the Welsh-speaking heartlands of north and west Wales.</p><p>Ap Iorwerth says his government will be on the side of \"young and old, urban and rural, north and south, Welsh speaker [and] non-Welsh speaker\".</p><p>\"The time is now to stop Reform and elect a government more radical, more ambitious, more impatient to bring about positive change than any which has gone before it,\" he will say.</p></div><div><p>Plaid Cymru is trying to position itself as the leading anti-Reform party for the next Senedd election - with Rhun ap Iorwerth as Wales' next first minister.</p><p>It sees Nigel Farage's party as its main competitor, rather than Labour, reflecting how they feel the UK political climate has changed since the last general election.</p><p>Despite being pro-independence, for them the 2026 vote will not be an independence election, and the issue is unlikely to be front and centre of its pitch as it tries to reach beyond its usual base.</p><p>So far it is not promising wholesale scrapping and rebuilding of how Wales works - something they think is risky in the current financial climate - although the party stresses it will still offer \"radical\" policies.</p><p>An example of that, the party would argue, is its promise of a payment to tackle child poverty.</p><p>Plaid faces a challenge in how they convince voters on the left to switch to them in an election fought with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg1y72091no\">a new voting system</a> designed to give people more choice.</p><p>The Greens and the Welsh Lib Dems will be among those hoping to motivate voters who want to put a roadblock in the way of Reform - as is Labour.</p><p>It will also be competing with a Reform party with lots of money and wide media coverage - two things Plaid has always struggled with.</p></div>",

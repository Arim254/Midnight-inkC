    "body": "12 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentBBCRussia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. Mysterious incidents of so-called \"hybrid warfare\" are mounting in Europe, increasing tensions. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article\"We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now.\" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and Nato countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped.How war could look in the tech-age\"Well that's odd. I've got no signal on my phone.\" \"Me neither. I'm offline. What's going on?\" That scenario, hypothetically, is just one way we could know that a war with Russia had begun, or was about to. (I should add that there can also be other, perfectly benign, reasons for a loss of signal.)That signal interruption could be followed by an inability to make bank payments for essentials like food and fuel. Food distribution would be disrupted, electricity supplies compromised.AFP via Getty Images'We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now,' Putin has saidThere are many ways of fighting a war, and not just the physically destructive wave of drones, bombs and missiles so tragically familiar to the citizens of Ukraine.Our modern, tech-driven society is highly dependent on the network of undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world, carrying data, financial transactions and energy. Covert activity by Russian spy vessels, such as the Yantar, is widely believed to have scoped out these cables for potential sabotage in a time of war, which is why the Royal Navy has recently invested in a fleet of underwater drones equipped with integrated sensors.In a war, these hidden, unseen actions, combined with an almost inevitable attempt to \"blind\" Western satellites in space, would seriously hamper the UK's ability to fight, as well as potentially wreaking havoc on civil society.Getty ImagesIn the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid itAt a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.\"There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,\" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell. \"Medical capacity is limited. Reserve regeneration pipelines are slow… The British plan for mass casualty outcomes appears to be based on not taking casualties.\" With classic British understatement, he says: \"This could be considered an optimistic planning assumption.\"He adds that to fight a long war you need proper back-up. \"It demands a second and even third echelon; personnel, platforms and logistics chains that can absorb losses and continue the fight. Yet this depth is notably absent from current British force design.\"Russia's 'low quality' army\"There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,\" says Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline, a private intelligence company.Two of the biggest military lessons to come out of the Ukraine war are firstly, that drones are now integral to modern warfare, at every level, and secondly, that \"mass\", or sheer volume of personnel and military hardware, matters.Getty Images'There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,' says Justin CrumpRussia's army is generally of a very low quality. Its soldiers are poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Their life expectancy in the deadly \"drone zone\" of eastern Ukraine is short. UK Defence Intelligence estimates that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 Russia's army has suffered more than 1.1 million casualties – that is killed, wounded, captured or missing. Even conservative estimates put the number of Russians killed at 150,000. Ukraine has also suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertain.But Russia has been able to draw on such a massive pool of manpower that it has so far been able to replace its estimated 30,000 monthly battlefield casualties with fresh blood. Russia's economy has also been on a war footing for more than three years now: an economist has been placed in charge of the Defence Ministry, while its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells. According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point. EPA/ShutterstockUkraine has suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertainAnalysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.\"The land war in Ukraine has shown beyond doubt that mass is absolutely vital for anybody that is going to face Russia on land,\" says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House think tank. \"And having deep reserves vastly greater in number than the standing regular armed forces has been shown to be essential.\"How national service conversations backfiredFrance and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. The UK's former Head of the Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, suggested in 2024, the year he retired, that the UK should train what he called \"a citizen army\" to fight a land war in the future. The idea was shot down by No. 10.\"I think it's a cultural thing within the UK,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at Rusi. \"So if you look at the states that are now looking towards [military service] - like Sweden, Germany and France - they are states who culturally still have an institutional memory of when they had that system. \"We haven't had national service since the 1960s and attempts to have that national conversation around it have pretty much backfired.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFrance has recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year olds\"The reality is, our armed forces cannot survive on a diet of government spin, over-the-horizon spending commitments and hollow rhetoric,\" Sir Ben Wallace, who was Defence Secretary in the Conservative government from 2019 to 2023, told the BBC.Responding to this, a spokesperson for the current Labour Defence Secretary, John Healey, told me: \"This characterisation is baseless. \"We increased defence spending by £5bn this year alone, signed 1,000 major contracts since the election and increased MOD spending with British businesses by 6% above inflation in the last year.\"He points to a new defence agreement with Norway, a £300m new investment in the Royal Navy's laser weapon and a £9bn investment into armed forces housing, adding: \"We're a government investing in the transformation of our forces, investing in our British service personnel... to create jobs and growth in Britain's communities.\"Getty ImagesGermany has also introduced voluntary military service for 18 year-oldsBut this is not about party politics. It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition. Billions of pounds have been spent on Ajax, an overdue armoured vehicle project still beset with problems. Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. More from InDepthToday, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia. They are referring to what is known as \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries.But worrying as these are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Getty ImagesA Eurofighter TyphoonThere are several potential flashpoints here, where Nato military chiefs fear that Putin, if he were allowed to achieve his aims in Ukraine, could eventually move on to seek new targets for aggression.One potential target is the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile (100km) stretch of border between Poland and Lithuania, both Nato countries. This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once part of the Soviet Union and were ruled from Moscow. They all voted for independence and have since joined Nato, but all have Russian-speaking minorities and hence there is a risk that Mr Putin could be tempted to send his troops across the border \"to protect them from persecution\".The eastern Estonian town of Narva, for example, is an obvious potential target here, as the majority of its population speak Russian and it sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of Ivangorod. A UK battle group comprising some 900 British military personnel has been stationed in Estonia, about 80 miles west of Narva, since 2017. AFP via Gettty ImagesThe eastern Estonian town of Narva sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of IvangorodIn the event of war, the plan goes, it would be hurriedly reinforced to brigade strength of around 3,000 or more.Another possible flashpoint is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is administered by Norway but where Moscow already has a toehold in the coal mining town of Barentsburg.Litvinenko, Skripal and hostile acts on UK soilThe UK may well be Putin's enemy number one, having been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, and having pushed for more powerful weapons to be delivered to help its defence.Hostile acts on UK soil that have been linked to President Putin include the murder with radioactive Polonium-210 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - a public inquiry concluded that Putin \"probably\" approved his assassination - and the attempted murder of former Russian military intelligence officer turned MI6 agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, using the nerve agent, Novichok.Dawn Sturgess, a mother-of-three, later died after she sprayed the Novichok, disguised as perfume, on her wrists. Putin was \"morally responsible\" for her death, an inquiry concluded last week. Lord Anthony Hughes, the inquiry chair, said: \"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin.\"Russia, which has always denied involvement in the attacks and suggested more than 20 different possible explanations for Ms Sturgess's death, described the report's findings as \"tasteless fairy tales\".Sputnik/ AFP via Getty ImagesPutin accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in UkraineBut the UK is also a core member of the Nato alliance. While questions are certainly raised in private over the reliability of the current US administration in the White House, it is hard to envisage the UK ever having to fight Russia on its own.\"A pure UK-Russia conflict is not likely and can be disregarded, practically,\" says Mr Crump. \"We would definitely fight with allies, although Russia would most likely only launch a conflict if it felt Nato would break.\"The wild card here is US President Donald Trump. While the chairman of Nato's Military Committee, Adm Cavo Dragone recently assured me that the US president was absolutely committed to defending the Nato alliance, others are not so sure. Would Trump, for example, go to war to defend the Estonian town of Narva?Getty ImagesIt is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies\"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to what the United Kingdom is actually capable of,\" concludes Keir Giles of Chatham House, \"because there are so many different situations under which it could be challenged by Russia.\"As a society, the UK – unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States – is unquestionably not ready for war. Even serious preparations for such an eventuality would be both expensive, unpopular and politically risky.But Mr Giles of Chatham House offers some sobering advice to the British public: \"Recognise that the rights and freedoms and prosperity that they take for granted are in fact under threat and that freedom does not come for free.\"\"And understand that lives will have to change. And this is not the fault of the current government or even its predecessors — it's their fault that it is so expensive, but the root cause of the problem is in Moscow.\"Top image credit: Ministry of Defence /PA Wire/ Getty Images.

    "body": "40 minutes agoAnna LamcheGCHQFans of codebreaking, maths and brainteasers can now try their hand at the latest cryptic Christmas challenge set by GCHQ, the UK's intelligence agency.GCHQ released their annual Christmas card on Wednesday, filled with puzzles and hidden codes designed to help children aged 11-18 hone a range of skills \"they might need to become a spy\".The card was created by \"schoolchildren as well as spies\", according to GCHQ, after hundreds of young people entered a design competition in the lead-up to the festive period.It contains seven puzzles set by \"GCHQ's in-house puzzlers\", geared towards testing a range of problem-solving skills including intuitive reasoning and lateral thinking.Students were asked to draw their response to the question: \"What do you think GCHQ looks like on Christmas Day?\". They were challenged to embed hidden codes and ciphers into their designs.Three winners were selected by a panel of judges across three age groups.The famously tricky puzzles \"aren't meant to be solved alone\", GCHQ said, adding: \"We believe the right mix of minds means we can solve seemingly impossible problems.\"\"Puzzles are at the heart of GCHQ's work to keep the country safe from hostile states, terrorists and criminals; challenging our teams to think creatively and analytically every day\", said GCHQ Director Anne Keast-Butler.She said she hoped the puzzle encourages the next generation \"to explore STEM subjects and consider the rewarding careers available in cybersecurity and intelligence\".Meanwhile, the spy agency's \"Chief Puzzler\", known only as \"Colin\", said the puzzles are designed to test \"the same blend of skills our teams use every day to keep the country safe.\"Answers will be released on Wednesday evening.Question 1:Somewhere on the card is a special seven letter word which has no repeated letters, and no letters which are next to each other in the alphabet. Can you find it? Question 2:There is some driftwood in these streams... but where should it be?Question 3:The robber has to find a route through the house. He can't go through the same coloured door twice in a row, and cannot move against any arrows. Eventually he gets caught by the police. How was he acting?Question 4:My gifts from Santa are wrapped in pairs this year – but which one is missing?Question 5:The letters in TWO UV PAIRS have the values 0,1,2,…,9 in some order, with each letter representing a different digit.What is 1234567 ?Question 6:Solve this code. It has lots of four-letter words!Question 7:Find an appropriate 7-letter word...✓ = letter in right place ?? = letter present, but in the wrong place",

    "body": "An Australian man who was jailed in Singapore and deported for charging at pop star Ariana Grande has been ejected from a Lady Gaga concert in his home country.Johnson Wen said on Instagram that he was \"kicked out\" of the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane on Tuesday night before the Lady Gaga show had started.The 26-year-old, who has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events, was sentenced to nine days in jail by a Singapore court last month for grabbing Grande during the Asian premiere of Wicked: For Good.Wen, who told the Singaporean judge in mitigation that he would \"not do it again\", had not disrupted the performance in Brisbane, but was removed because of his history of public nuisance.Videos on social media showed security guards holding Wen by the arm and leading him out of the venue as the crowd both cheered and booed. The BBC has contacted Suncorp Stadium for comment.In a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald, the venue said it was made aware that \"a known serial offender may attempt to attend and disrupt\" the concert by Lady Gaga, who is around halfway through her Mayhem World Tour.\"In the interest of the artist's safety, this individual was deemed a person of interest and not to be allowed to attend,\" it said.Wen has gained notoriety since grabbing Grande at the Wicked: For Good premiere in the South East Asian city state, which is known for its strict laws, including on public behaviour.\"You seem to be attention-seeking, thinking only of yourself and not the safety of others when committing these acts,\" Singaporean judge Christopher Goh reportedly told Wen.Wen was also banned from Singapore following the incident.Other videos on Wen's social media accounts show him jumping on stage and disrupting performances by global stars like Katy Perry and The Weeknd.The incident with Grande sparked outrage in Singapore. Fans accused Wen of \"re-traumatising\" the pop star and actress.Grande has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.",

I have never stopped loving her.\"I don't want to die estranged from Meghan. I want to meet my grandkids. It might be nice to meet her husband too.\"",

    "body": "People spending even more time online now than during the pandemic12 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesUK adults spent over half an hour longer online every day in 2025 than they did during the pandemic, according to an annual survey of internet habits by the regulator Ofcom.The Online Nation report found on average, people in the UK spent four hours and 30 minutes online every day in 2025 - 31 minutes longer than in 2021.Psychologist Dr Aric Sigman told the BBC this was not a problem in itself, but what mattered was \"what this time is displacing and how this may harm mental health\".He added the \"good news\" was society was \"beginning to question online time more critically\".In a year where the major UK Netflix drama Adolescence won praise and politicial attention for shining a light on misogynistic online content, the survey found adults were feeling less positive about the impact of the internet overall.Only a third (33%) said they felt it was \"good for society\" – down from 40% in 2024.However, nearly two thirds of people still believed the benefits of being online outweighed the risks.And many adults said they found the internet to be a source of creativity, with roughly three quarters agreeing being online helped them to broaden their understanding of the world.Children wary of 'brain rot'The report also explored children's experiences of being online.While more than eight in ten aged 8-17 said they were happy with the amount of time they spent on the internet, they also recognised there were negative impacts of endlessly scrolling on smartphones.The term \"brain rot\" was used by some children surveyed to describe the feeling they were left with after spending too long on their devices.It has become a popular phrase to describe overconsuming online posts and videos considered to be the opposite of mentally challenging.And Ofcom found across four of the main services used by children - YouTube, Snapchat, TikTok and WhatsApp – up to a quarter of the time 8 to 14-year-olds spent online was between 2100 and 0500.VPN use more than doublesFrom 25 July, Ofcom required websites operating in the UK with pornographic content to \"robustly\" age-check users, under the Online Safety Act.Some people began using a virtual private network (VPN) at this time - tools which can disguise your location online to allow you to use the internet as though you are in another country.The increase indicates people are likely using them to bypass requirements of the Act.After the age checks became mandatory, the survey said VPN use more than doubled, rising from roughly 650,000 daily users before July and peaking at over 1.4 million in mid-AugustBut it also found the number had since declined to around 900,000 in November.ASMR 'relaxing'The report also found 69% of children aged 13 to 17 said they used online services to help with their wellbeing, either to relax or improve their mood.More than half named ASMR as a tool they had used in particular to help them relax.These videos became an online phenomenon more than a decade ago - which some people claim causes them to feel a tingling sensation.It has led to an entire industry of online creators making special content viewed on platforms such as YouTube. But children were not solely positive about their online experiences.Seventy percent said they had issues with self-improvement media - involving toxic messaging or body shaming.",

    "body": "How monogamous are humans? Scientists compile 'league table' of pairing up5 hours agoHelen BriggsEnvironment correspondentGettyMeerkats are incredibly social animals and live in large groups known as 'mobs' or 'clans'Humans are a bit like meerkats when it comes to pairing up, according to a study that examined the monogamous lifestyles of different species.In our romantic life, we more closely resemble these social, close-knit mongooses than we do our primate cousins, a \"league table\" of monogamy compiled by scientists suggests.At 66% monogamous, humans score surprisingly highly, far above chimps and gorillas – and on a par with meerkats.However, we are by no means the most monogamous creature. Top spot goes to the Californian mouse - rodents that form inseparable, lifelong bonds.GettyChimpanzees are highly social and form strong bonds but have very different social structures from humans\"There is a premier league of monogamy, in which humans sit comfortably, while the vast majority of other mammals take a far more promiscuous approach to mating,\" said Dr Mark Dyble at the University of Cambridge.In the animal world, pairing up has its perks, which may be why it has evolved independently in multiple species, including us. Experts have proposed various benefits to so-called social monogamy, where mates match up for at least a breeding season to care for their young and see off rivals. Dr Dyble examined several human populations throughout history, calculating the proportions of full siblings – where individuals share the same mother and father – compared with half-siblings, individuals who share either a mother or a father, but not both. Similar data was compiled for more than 30 social monogamous and other mammals.Humans have a monogamy rating of 66% full siblings, ahead of meerkats (60%) but behind beavers (73%).Meanwhile, our evolutionary cousins fall at the bottom of the table - with mountain gorillas at 6% rating, while chimpanzees come in at just 4% (alongside the dolphin).In last place is Scotland's Soay sheep, where females mate with multiple males, with 0.6% full siblings. The Californian mouse came top, at 100%.GettyMonogamy is prevalent in birds; such as swans, which form strong pairsHowever, being ranked alongside meerkats and beavers doesn't mean our societies are the same - human society is poles apart.\"Although the rates of full siblings we see in humans are most similar to species like meerkats or beavers, the social system that we see in humans is very different,\" Dr Dyble told BBC News.\"Most of these species live in colony-like social groups or perhaps live in solitary pairs that go around together. Humans are very different from that. We live in what we call multi-male, multi-female groups, within which we have these monogamous, or pair-bonded, units.\"GettySoay sheep are the most promiscuous of all the animals studiedDr Kit Opie at the University of Bristol, who is not connected with the study, said this is another piece in the puzzle over how human monogamy arose.\"I think this paper gives us a very clear understanding that across time and across space humans are monogamous,\" he said.\"Our society is much closer to chimps and bonobos – it just happens that we've taken a different route when it comes to mating.\"The new study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences.",

    "body": "Tourists from dozens of countries including the UK could be asked to provide a five-year social media history as a condition of entry to the United States, under a new proposal unveiled by American officials.The new condition would affect people from dozens of countries who are eligible to visit the US for 90 days without a visa, as long as they have filled out an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) form.Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has moved to toughen US borders more generally - citing national security as a key reason.Analysts say the new plan could pose an obstacle to potential visitors, or harm their digital rights.The US expects a major influx of foreign tourists next year, as it hosts the men's football World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico, and for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.The proposal document was filed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), of which the agency is part.US media reported that it appeared in the Federal Register, which is the official journal of the US government. The BBC has asked DHS for comment.The proposal says \"the data element will require ESTA applicants to provide their social media from the last 5 years\", without giving further details of which specific information will be required.The existing ESTA requires a comparatively limited amount of information from travellers, as well as a one-off payment of $40 (£30). It is accessible to citizens of about 40 countries - including the UK, Ireland, France, Australia and Japan - and allows them to visit the US multiple times during a two-year period.As well as the collection of social media information, the new document proposes the gathering of an applicant's telephone numbers and email addresses used over the last five and 10 years respectively, and more information about their family members.The text cites an executive order from Trump in January, titled \"Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats\".The Trump administration has previously required foreign nationals to make their social media accounts public if they are applying for student visas or H1B visas for skilled workers - the latter of which now also entail a much higher fee.A senior state department official said of the student visa policy: \"It is an expectation from American citizens that their government will make every effort to make our country safer, and that is exactly what the Trump Administration is doing every single day.\" Officers were instructed to screen for those \"who advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to national security; or who perpetrate unlawful anti-Semitic harassment or violence\".As part of the administration's broader effort to toughen borders, officials recently said an existing travel ban - affecting 19 countries in Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean - could soon be expanded. That move was announced in the wake of a shooting attack on two National Guard members in Washington DC, in which an Afghan man has been named as the suspect. The new proposal regarding ESTA data collection for tourists invites views from the public for 60 days. Sophia Cope, of digital rights organisation the Electronic Frontier Foundation, criticised the plan, telling the New York Times that it could \"exacerbate civil liberties harms\".Meanwhile, immigration law practice Fragomen suggested there could be practical impacts as applicants could face longer waits for ESTA approvals.Experts have previously suggested that the changes to travel policies introduced under Trump have had an impact on the American tourism industry. Earlier this year, the World Travel & Tourism Council said the US was the only one of 184 economies that it analysed that was expected to see a decline in international visitor spending in 2025.Other Trump administration policies have also appeared to impact tourism to the country, such as many Canadians boycotting US travel as a form of protest against Trump's tariffs.October marked the 10th straight month of decline in the number of Canadian travellers to the US. In the past, Canadians have made up about a quarter of all international visitors to the US, spending more than $20bn (£15.1bn) a year, according to the US Travel Association.",

    "body": "Image source, BBC SportByDaniel AustinBBC Sport senior journalistDuring the eight and a half years he has spent at Liverpool, Mohamed Salah has been beloved by supporters, who rank the 'Egyptian King' among the club's greatest ever players.But since his unexpected declaration that he feels scapegoated by Liverpool for the club's poor run, having been picked as a substitute for three consecutive matches by manager Arne Slot, Salah's character has been called into question by fans, former players and beyond.So who is Salah the man - away from the latest headlines?Over the past few months, BBC Sport has spoken to some of those who know him best to find out more about the personality and resilience of the man behind the goals, the glory, and the gossip.Mo Salah: Never Give UpAvailable now'You only have problems with Mo if he is not playing'Salah's relentless intensity and refusal to accept lower standards from himself or those around him have underpinned Liverpool's success, and perhaps also explain why he has found criticism of his diminished role tough to handle.\"We are all massively influenced by our past - how we were raised, where we grew up,\" says Jurgen Klopp, who won every major trophy in English and European football while managing Salah at Anfield.  \"Mo knew early on [in his life] that he had to do more than others.\"He always developed. He never stops. That is his mindset.\"After each summer break he came back and had a new skill. It was like he had spent the whole time just practising one particular type of pass.\"We pushed each other, just to make sure that we would never stop. And we never did stop. That moment lifting the Premier League bonded us for life. He will be remembered as one of the greatest of all time.\"I wouldn't say he is easy to manage, but he is also not difficult to manage. You [only] have problems with Mo Salah if he is not playing or you take him off.\"Salah has been criticised by some for not giving more frequent media interviews before his intervention in the mixed zone at Leeds' Elland Road, particularly after defeats and poor performances. He has been accused of demonstrating a lack of leadership. But he has often delivered calls to arms to fans on social media, external in difficult moments, and those who have played alongside him describe Salah as a man who refuses to give up and is capable of inspiring others.\"He will always be trying to prove someone wrong,\" says former Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana. \"He is not macho. I would often tell my children about how he behaves, how he doesn't get too high in good moments, doesn't beat himself up too much in low moments. He would always remain completely focused on the job in hand.\"I would look at him and it would make me feel calm because of how in control he would be all the time.\"Knowing Mo, he will always be fighting, being resilient, and trying to find ways to better himself.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, \"Never give up - did it ever fit to a situation better than this one?\" says Klopp about the T-shirt an injured Salah wore during Liverpool's 4-0 Champions League win over Barcelona in 2019. Lallana says the shirt \"inspired\" the team. James Milner keeps one at home.'He wants to be the best at everything'Salah defended his record when speaking at Elland Road, and compared himself to England captain Harry Kane - delivering what he felt was a reminder to those inside and outside of Liverpool who have forgotten what he is capable of.A level of arrogance is perhaps to be expected in all elite athletes, and some believe it has powered Salah to the heights he and Liverpool have reached.\"He is a really nice guy, considering the success he has had - being a superstar around the globe,\" says James Milner - Liverpool's vice-captain during most of Salah's time at the club. \"He plays as if he has a chip on his shoulder. He wants to be the best at everything - he even got a chess teacher to improve his game, and gave me a thumping a good few times.\"You need different types of leaders, and Mo is a big leader in that group, in terms of the standards he set every day. When you have young players come and sign, they see him and it's 'this is what it takes to be a top player, this is what it is to be a Liverpool player'.\"That desire to always be the best became competition - fraught at times - with team-mate Sadio Mane, Liverpool's other flying forward who played on the opposite wing to Salah for five seasons.\"Were they best friends? No,\" Klopp says. \"Could Mo have passed the ball a few times when he tried to finish it off himself? Yes. But on the pitch they supported each other, they fought for each other.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Throughout his time with Liverpool, Salah has demonstrated his competitiveness on and off the pitch'Mo has lifted the heads of all of us'Salah is more than just a footballer - he is a global sociocultural icon, being named one of the world's most influential people, steering conversations on human rights, and changing attitudes towards Muslims through demonstrations of faith.He was born in a rural village - Nagrig - about 100 miles from Cairo, where most of the roughly 15,000 inhabitants work as farmers and more than half live in poverty.That such a region could produce one of the world's greatest athletes borders on impossible.\"What already set him apart as a kid was his discipline,\" says Maher Anwar Shtiyeh - mayor of Nagrig. \"He remains deeply tied to his roots, despite fame and global recognition.\"He only finds real happiness in his village spending time with his family and friends. He is a role model for the youth of Egypt, the Arab youth, and the youth of the whole Islamic world. He has lifted the heads of all of us.\"As a child, Salah would travel up to five hours by minibus from his village to the capital, where he played youth football for top-flight club Arab Contractors.That helped instil a resilience that has guided him throughout his professional career, alongside support from loved ones.\"You have to be mentally so strong as a young kid following your dream like that,\" says former international team-mate Ahmed Elmohamady. \"His wife is from the same village. They grew up together, which is great because she knows everything about him and has supported him all the way.\"Now anyone in the village who asks him for support, he supports them. It shows what a great human being he is.\"Since leaving Egypt, Salah has maintained close ties with Nagrig and financed an ambulance station, a charitable foundation and a religious institute in the area.Salah has proudly made his faith visible throughout his career - he prays both when walking onto the pitch and after scoring goals.\"When I first met Mo, he was coming here quite regularly,\" says Shafique Rahman - Imam at Liverpool Mosque and Islamic Institute. \"He would arrive a little bit late after finishing training. We had people waiting outside who wanted to see him, but nobody would bother him during prayer.\"The nature of the religion is that everybody is the same in the eyes of God. When people come to prayers they stand extremely close, touching each other's shoulders. Mo felt very safe here.\"Media caption, 'To get up and want to be the best every day – that's a different mindset'When Salah first moved to England - signed by Jose Mourinho's Chelsea after impressing for Basel in Switzerland - he struggled to impose his personality in a squad full of established stars, and lacked self-belief.\"When I first met him, he was 21 - very innocent,\" says former team-mate Mark Schwarzer. \"He was coming to London - a big city, different culture - and I think he was a bit timid.\"When he signed, he was coming into a changing room packed full of international stars - players that were used to winning, and a manager that was a legend of the club. For new players, it was sink or swim.\"The more he didn't score, the more frustrated he became. There was a moment in the changing room when Jose actually kicked a table, and was directing a lot of his frustration towards Mo, and he took him off. Mo was visibly upset.\"It's credit to him, his determination, his dedication, everything, to go on and deliver what he has done.\"Salah rebuilt his career in Italy's Serie A - first in a loan spell with Fiorentina then at Roma, developing a reputation as an on-field leader and ultimate professional.\"He was just different,\" explains BBC pundit and former England and Manchester City defender Micah Richards, who played alongside Salah at Fiorentina. \"You get those characters that just do everything by the book - he was that guy. \"He would always be in bed early, always be eating healthily. He clearly thought, 'I'm going to show everyone exactly what I can do. All those who have doubted me are going to eat their words.' That's exactly what he did.\"For a young African man to set standards for European colleagues to follow was a challenge in itself.\"To succeed in Europe you have to understand the culture of where you are playing, where you are living, without losing any of your principles,\" says former Egypt striker Mido, who played for Tottenham, Roma and Ajax among others. \"This is the balance that he has achieved.\"He has made young boys in Africa dream - 'If someone who comes from the background as I do made it to the top, why couldn't I make it?'\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Football fans in Nagrig were overjoyed when Salah, one of their own, scored the opening goal in the 2019 Champions League final'Mo has left a profound mark on me'Even before Salah's comments following the 3-3 draw with Leeds, doubts about his future were arising.Inside Liverpool, concerns had already been raised about his performances, before transfer rumours were given further encouragement this week, with sources telling the BBC the Reds are open-minded about selling the 33-year-old.Salah is not the only Liverpool hero whose time at the club - which he and Slot have said could be up in the January transfer window - has (potentially) ended with public denigration.In different contexts, Javier Mascherano, Fernando Torres and Trent Alexander-Arnold have met similar fates, while shirts bearing the legendary Steven Gerrard's name were set alight in the street when he was on the verge of joining Chelsea in 2005.If this is the end of Salah and Liverpool's love affair, the human impact he has had on those around him will not be forgotten any time soon.\"He was one of the first people to welcome me, and did so in such an incredible way,\" says Luis Diaz, who played alongside Salah in Liverpool's forward line for three-and-a-half years before joining Bayern Munich earlier this year.\"He came over to me and said: 'if you ever need my help, I'm here for you.' I remember him telling me on the pitch: 'Let's try this... let's make this move so that it works.' And then it would work in the match.\"To share the moment lifting the Premier League with him, to see how happy he was, how much he was enjoying it, was an incredible feeling.\"He is always wanting to be a better player, to be a better person, and he has left a profound mark on me.\"EgyptLiverpoolPremier LeagueUEFA Champions LeagueFootball",

    "body": "3 hours agoDominic Casciani,Home and Legal CorrespondentandBrian Wheeler,Political reporterEPADanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meeting in London earlier this yearSir Keir Starmer has urged European leaders to reform human rights laws to make it easier to deport illegal migrants ahead of crucial talks on a potential shake-up of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).The government has already announced plans to restrict asylum seekers using the \"right to family life\" clause in the ECHR to avoid deportation from the UK. Now the prime minister is urging fellow ECHR members to change the rules to make it easier for states to target people smuggling and set up \"returns hubs\" to hold people with no right to be in Europe, ahead of talks in Strasbourg.The Conservatives and Reform UK have called for withdrawal from the ECHR altogether.But Sir Keir is calling instead for the ECHR to be updated to confront the challenges posed by mass migration.He argues in an article for the Guardian newspaper that urgent reforms to the convention are needed to defeat \"the forces of hate and division\" he says are growing across Europe.\"Listening to legitimate concerns and acting on them is what our politics is about,\" the PM wrote in a joint article with Danish leader Mette Frederiksen. \"That's not empty populism, it's democracy. We are determined to show that our societies can act with compassion while upholding law and order, and fairness.\"Critics say the ECHR is getting in the way of removing more illegal migrants, while supporters say claims about the ECHR's role in migration cases are exaggerated.The talks in Strasbourg are expected to cover difficult issues including combating migrant smuggling and how to create human rights compliant \"returns hubs\" - centres outside of Europe where migrants could be forcibly housed if they can not be returned to dangerous countries.They will also cover the complex rules of Article 8, the right to family life, and Article 3, the ban on inhumane treatment, which feature in many migration cases.Justice Secretary David Lammy and Attorney General Lord Hermer have travelled to Strasbourg to take part in the talks.  Lammy is expected to say: \"The definition of 'family life' can't be stretched to prevent the removal of people with no right to remain in the country… the threshold of 'inhuman and degrading treatment' must be constrained to the most serious issues… and states must be able to take proportionate decisions on the removal of foreign criminals.\"He will say that the convention is \"a critical foundation of peace, stability, and security in Europe\" but will add that it was \"never intended to be frozen in time\".The BBC understands that the aim is for member states to reach a political declaration by the spring which would set how the ECHR is applied in migration cases. If such an agreement were achieved, it could be one of the most important reforms to how human rights law is applied in the 75-year history of the convention.The meeting at the Council of Europe, the political body that agrees the human rights laws which are then applied by the court, comes after months of pressure over migration.Nine members of the human rights body, led by Italy and Denmark, called earlier this year for reforms.The UK did not sign that open letter - but it has been lobbying behind the scenes for talks on reforms.Membership of the convention has become increasingly contentious in the UK in recent years. Both the Conservatives and Reform UK have said they would leave it if they won the next election. Kemi Badenoch has said leaving would not be a \"silver bullet\" but was a necessary step to \"protect our borders, our veterans and our citizens\". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he would oppose such a move saying the convention \"upholds our freedom\" and would \"do nothing to stop the boats or fix our broken immigration system\". The UK's already-announced domestic plan includes legislating to restrict how the right to private and family life applies in removal cases.The BBC understands that if the meeting in Strasbourg is a success, officials will begin working with the member states on a political declaration to clarify how human rights laws should be applied to migration challenges - with a deadline of next May for the final wording.In October Alain Berset, the head of the Council of Europe, told the BBC that he was \"absolutely ready\" to discuss human rights reforms.That olive branch to member states came after months of diplomatic talks paving the way for Wednesday's meeting.\"The European Convention on Human Rights provides the framework we need to address these issues effectively and responsibly,\" said Berset ahead of the meeting.\"Our task is not to weaken the Convention, but to keep it strong and relevant - to ensure that liberty and security, justice and responsibility, are held in balance.\"",

    "body": "The leader of France's far-right National Rally (RN) Jordan Bardella has welcomed \"for the most part\" concerns raised about Europe in US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy.Last week, the White House published a document which outlined Trump's vision of the world and the state of the European continent, which many have characterised as harshly critical of Europe.Speaking to the BBC's Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast, Bardella praised what he said was Trump's \"appeal to American pride\" - but he made clear he did not want Europe to be \"subservient to any major power\".He said there was a \"wind of freedom, of national pride blowing all over Western democracies\".In a wide-ranging interview, the 30-year-old, who opinion polls suggest leads in the race to be France's next president, was also challenged on the RN's political history and his stance on immigration.Listen to Nick Robinson's interview with Jordan BardellaBardella said he shared the majority of the concerns outlined by the Trump administration about Europe facing \"civilisational erasure\", which the White House said is being fuelled by a range of policies, including on migration.\"Mass immigration and the laxity of our governments in the last 30 years with regard to migration policy are shaking the balance of European countries, of Western societies, and namely French society,\" Bardella said.Snap parliamentary elections in June 2024 made the RN the largest single force in parliament, although an alliance of left-wing parties clinched victory.The next French presidential election is due to be held in 2027. A recent poll for Le Figaro suggests Bardella would win with 44% of the vote - just ahead of Marine Le Pen, the RN figurehead whose candidacy is in doubt after she was found guilty of embezzling EU funds and barred from standing in an election for five years.An appeal due early next year will determine whether Le Pen can run - otherwise, the expectation is that Bardella will step in.Bardella batted away suggestions this was sparking tensions between them, stating they were united by \"trust and friendship\".\"I will fight by her side so she can win the appeal. Until the appeal we will campaign together, as we will after, hand-in-hand,\" he said in his interview.The RN was founded by Le Pen's father Jean-Marie in 1972. Known then as the National Front (FN), it has since become a decisive force in French politics. Jean-Marie Le Pen was convicted several times for Holocaust denial and was an unrepentant extremist on race.In his interview with Nick Robinson, Bardella distanced himself from Jean-Marie Le Pen's comments, as have many other RN politicians in recent years.\"I am fighting against the caricature of my political movement, of my ideas,\" he said, adding his responsibility was to bring together the French people and present the country with \"a project of national recovery\". \"My people's expectations for a break with the past are numerous,\" Bardella added.Challenged on the racist and antisemitic history of the RN's precursor, Bardella rejected accusations that the National Front had ever put forward arguments that could \"offend\" some sections of the population\"A lot of Jewish people vote for us and consider us a bulwark against extremism,\" he said.The RN is primarily known as an anti-immigration party and has long pushed for France to have stricter immigration rules, including limiting social spending to French citizens.\"If tomorrow I am the head of government, France will no longer be the target of mass immigration,\" he said, adding that if elected his first provision would be to trigger a referendum on immigration. \"It will allow us to take back control of our borders.\"However, according to the French constitution, a referendum can only be held on certain subjects which do not include immigration, so the constitution would have to be amended first. In order to do so, the RN would have to clinch the presidency and have either an absolute majority in Parliament or enough allies.Bardella - who grew up in the Paris region but himself has parents of immigrant origin - drew a clear distinction between people who he said were born in France but \"reject republican institutions like the police or values like secularism\", and others who \"do everything to become French - espouse the language, culture and national patrimony\".When pressed on what it means to be French if being born in the country is not sufficient, Bardella said he felt being French was an \"honour\" that transcended bureaucracy. \"Being French is adhering to some values and lifestyles, believing in equality between men and women,\" he argued.\"I defend secularism and I feel that Islamism has today become a separate political project... which wants to impose its rules on French society,\" Bardella added, before promising to close down radical mosques and banning \"hate preachers\" from the country if elected.Although he did not expand on France's frequent and longstanding financial woes - the country's debt is more than €3 trillion, or around 114% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - Bardella said the French economy was \"sick\".\"We face two ailments – excessive taxation and excessive regulation,\" he said, promising to free the country from the \"shackles\" that limit growth. The RN has repeatedly voted down the yearly budgets put forward by governments since last year, and has promised to similarly vote down this year's.Bardella's position on Ukraine also bears some differences with that of the current centrist government. While he stated Russia represented a \"multidimensional threat to French and European interests\", and that Kyiv will need security guarantees even in the event of a peace deal, he also said that he was \"firmly opposed\" to sending soldiers to Ukraine. Emmanuel Macron's government, on the other hand, has proposed deploying a steady military presence, albeit far from the front line. But such a decision \"would contribute to an escalation,\" Bardella said, \"especially given that we have nuclear weapons and that President Putin has intentions whose limits are unclear\".If Bardella does stand at the next presidential election and wins, he will be 31. Macron was 39 when he became France's youngest ever president in 2017. While Macron was finance minister for two years under François Hollande, Bardella, in comparison, has never been in government.\"It's true I am 30 years old. Unfortunately I can't do anything about that,\" he argued. \"I recognise the existential questions facing our country... And I'd rather be told that today is 'too soon' rather than tomorrow is 'too late'.\"",

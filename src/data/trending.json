    "body": "12 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentBBCVladimir Putin may have a reputation among some as a ruthless autocrat, a master manipulator of the international scene. But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with RussiaHe could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind? And what else could Ukraine, Europe and even China, do differently?Could Europe do more?At the moment, the continent is preparing for a ceasefire. Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".WPA Pool/Getty ImagesZelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday. (Pictured: Starmer with Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk)Mr Giles said: \"The only thing that will unarguably, undeniably stop Russian aggression is the presence of sufficiently strong western forces where Russia wants to attack, and the demonstrated will and resolve that they will be used to defend.\"This strategy would of course come with huge political difficulty - with some voters in western Europe unwilling to risk a confrontation with Russia.Few analysts expect Ukraine to reverse the tide and make actual territorial gains of its own. Having spent several weeks in Ukraine recently, I heard no mention of any Spring offensive, only the need to slow Russia's advance and increase the price it pays in blood and treasure.Some western diplomats claim Russia's generals are lying to the Russian president, pretending the situation on the ground is better than it is - adding to what they see as a deliberate strategy to exaggerate Russian gains, designed to suggest Ukraine is on the back foot and should thus sue for peace.According to Thomas Graham in Foreign Affairs, in this year, Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded.AFP via Getty Images'It is remarkable they [Ukraine] have held off for so long, not least fighting with one hand behind their back,' says Fiona HillFiona Hill, senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, who served on Trump's national security council during his first term, says the biggest thing Putin has in his favour is that many people believe Ukraine is losing. \"Everyone is talking of Ukraine as the loser when it now has the most potent military in Europe,\" she says. \"Just think what they have done to Russia. It is remarkable they have held off for so long not least fighting with one hand behind their back.\"Trade, sanctions and Russia's economyThen there's the lever of sanctions. Certainly, Russia's economy is suffering. Inflation at 8%, interest rates 16%, growth slowed, budget deficits soaring, real incomes plunging, consumer taxes rising. A report for the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform says Russia's war economy is running out of time. \"The Russian economy is substantially less able to finance the war than it was at the beginning of it in 2022,\" the authors say.But so far none of this appears to have changed much Kremlin thinking, not least because businesses have found ways of evading restrictions, such as transporting oil on unregistered ghost ships.Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via ReutersIn this year alone, Russia has seized 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded, according to Thomas Graham in Foreign AffairsTom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at Rusi, said western messaging about sanctions was convoluted and there were too many loopholes. Russia would, he said, work around recent US sanctions on two Russian oil giants, Lukoil and Rosneft, just by re-labelling the exported oil as coming from non-sanctioned companies.Mr Keatinge said if the West really wanted to hurt Russia's war economy, it would embargo all Russian oil and fully implement secondary sanctions on countries that still buy it. \"We need to stop being cute and go full embargo,\" he said. \"We need to take our implementation of sanctions as seriously as the Kremlin takes circumvention.\"In theory, sanctions could also affect Russian public opinion. In October, a survey by the state-run Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) said 56% of respondents said they felt \"very tired\" of the conflict, up from 47% last year. But the consensus among Kremlinologists is that much of the Russian public remains supportive of Putin's strategy. ReutersThe Ukrainian president arrived in Berlin on Sunday for peace talks with Witkoff and Friedrich Merz (Trump and Zelensky pictured on a previous occasion)The European Union could agree to use about €200bn (£176bn) of frozen Russian assets to generate a so-called \"reparation loan\" for Ukraine. The latest European Commission proposal is to raise €90bn (£79bn) over two years.In Kyiv, officials are already banking on getting the cash. But still the EU hesitates. Belgium, where the bulk of the Russian assets are held, has long feared being sued by Russia - and on Friday, the Russian Central Bank announced legal action against Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court.Belgium says it will not agree the loan unless legal and financial risks are shared more explicitly with other EU members. France has concerns, such is its own vast debts, and fears exploiting the frozen assets could undermine the stability of the eurozone.EU leaders will make a further attempt to agree a deal when they meet in Brussels on 18 December for their final summit before Christmas. But diplomats say there is no guarantee of success.There is also disagreement over what the cash should be used for: keeping Ukraine's state solvent now or paying for its reconstruction after the war.Ukraine's conscription questionAs for Ukraine, it could mobilise more of its armed forces.It remains the second-biggest army in Europe (behind Russia), and the most technically advanced - but it is nonetheless struggling to defend an 800-mile frontline. After almost four years of war, many soldiers are exhausted and desertion rates are rising.Getty ImagesUkraine is defending itself against repeated Russian air attacksArmy recruiters are finding it harder to fill gaps as some younger men hide from press gangs or flee the country. But Ukraine could widen its conscription laws. Currently only men aged 25 to 60 must be available to fight. This is a deliberate strategy by Kyiv to manage Ukraine's demographic challenges; a country with a low birth rate and millions living abroad cannot afford to lose what have been dubbed \"the fathers of the future\".This puzzles outsiders. \"I find it incredible that Ukraine has not mobilised its young people,\" one senior UK military figure told me. \"I think Ukraine must be one of the only countries in history facing an existential threat that has not thrown its mad 20-year-olds into the fight.\"Fiona Hill said Ukraine had simply learned the lesson of history and the devastating impact World War One had on 20th Century European empires, which declined after failing to rediscover the population growth that had fuelled their economic rise. \"Ukraine is just thinking of their demographic [future].\"Strikes, diplomacy and TrumpIf Ukraine could import and manufacture more long-range missiles, it could hit Russia harder and deeper.This year it stepped up its air strikes on targets both in occupied territory and the Russian Federation. Earlier this month Ukraine's military commanders told Radio Liberty they had hit more than 50 fuel and military-industrial infrastructure facilities in Russia during the autumn.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, says some Russians experienced fuel shortages earlier this year. \"By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's thirty-eight major refineries at least once.\"Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel.\"But would more deep strikes on Russia make an impact, when both the Kremlin and public opinion in Russia seem indifferent? AFP via Getty ImagesAs well as defending its territory, Ukraine has stepped up air strikes in the Russian federationMick Ryan, former Australian major general and now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says deep strikes are not a magic bullet. \"They are an extraordinarily important military endeavour, but insufficient by themselves to force Putin to the negotiating table or to win the war.\"Dr Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow in military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said more deep strikes would certainly damage Russia's energy and military infrastructure, as well as using up its air defence missiles. But he warned the tactic could be counterproductive. \"It could reinforce the argument the Russian leadership makes that an independent Ukraine poses a massive military threat,\" he said.More from InDepthThere's also - still - a diplomatic route.Some analysts argue that if Putin is offered a way out of the war, he may choose it.The theory goes like this: a deal is agreed that allows both sides to claim victory. Say, a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition. Compromises all round. But the deal would require the US to engage hard with Russia, setting up negotiating teams, using its power to drive through agreement.\"The United States… needs to deploy its formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia,\" Thomas Graham argues. \"One cannot overstate the role the United States – and Trump personally – plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader.\"China's leverageThe wild card is China. President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens to. When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use, the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. Russia's war machine is also hugely dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes.So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue, then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. For now, the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow. So the question is whether President Xi would be willing to apply any leverage off his own bat.ShutterstockPresident Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens toAt the moment China seems happy for the US to be distracted, for transatlantic allies to be divided, and for the rest of the world to view China as a source of stability. But if Russia's invasion escalated, if global markets were disrupted, if the US applied secondary sanctions on China in punishment for its consumption of cheap Russian energy, then the thinking in Beijing might change.For now though, Putin believes he is sitting pretty, with time on his side. The longer this conflict goes on, analysts say, the more Ukrainian morale will fall, the more divided its allies will become, and the more territory Russia will gain in Donetsk. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin said last week.\"Nothing will change his position,\" Fiona Hill told me. \"Unless he exits stage left. Putin is betting right now that he can keep this going for long enough that circumstances play out to his advantage.\"Top picture credit: Reuters BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "31 minutes agoJoe PikePolitics investigations correspondentThe chief executive of Oxfam GB has been forced out by the charity's board after an independent review found \"serious issues\" with her behaviour and decision making.Dr Begum had faced accusations of bullying, which her allies at the charity described as \"absurd\".The organisation's trustees decided Dr Halima Begum's position was \"untenable\" because of an \"irretrievable breakdown in its trust and confidence\" in her ability to do the job.About 70 members of staff had signed a letter calling for Oxfam to investigate Dr Begum's conduct, with several employees said to have resigned after falling out with her, the Times reported.Dr Begum had been in the role for almost two years. The BBC has contacted her for comment.In a statement, Oxfam confirmed the review was commissioned by its board of trustees to examine \"concerns raised about the leadership, conduct and approach\" of Dr Begum.It said the review was carried out by legal firm Howlett Brown between November and December 2025.The investigation drew on testimony from 32 current and former Oxfam colleagues, as well as documentary evidence, the charity said.Findings showed \"serious issues in the CEO's leadership behaviour and her decision making, including breaches of organisational processes and values, and inappropriate interference into safeguarding and integrity investigations\", it added.The decision to discharge Dr Begum from her role was passed last week and she has already left the organisation, Oxfam said.The role of acting chief executive will be taken up by Jan Oldfield, Oxfam's chief supporter officer for more than four years, it added.Acting co-chairs of Oxfam GB, Nana Afadzinu and Dame Annie Hudson, said their priority going forward was to provide \"stability\" for staff and \"rebuild confidence\" across the organisation\".\"The Board has taken immediate steps to strengthen oversight and reinforce organisational processes, and work is already underway to address the recommendations in the report,\" they added.The boss of Liberty, Akiko Hart, wrote a post on LinkedIn in defence of Dr Begum, who she called a \"mentor and friend\".\"I would urge everyone watching to hold off from immediate judgement and see what facts and evidence emerge,\" she wrote.\"I would invite people to reflect on the timing of this announcement, at the tail end of a painful restructure which was approved by the Board, and a few weeks after the resignation of the chair (not currently in the reporting).\"Dr Begum's departure comes after a difficult year for Oxfam.Earlier this month, financial figures released by the charity showed profits from its shops had dropped by two thirds over the past three years.The Oxford-based charity also made 250 of its 2,100 UK staff redundant earlier this year to save £10.2m from its wage bill.At the time, Dr Begum said the decline was due to the charity's work taking place \"against a backdrop of deep uncertainty, rising inflation and a cost-of-living crisis\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentThe new chief of MI6, Blaise Metreweli, will warn of \"the acute threat posed by Russia\" when she makes her first public speech later. She will highlight so-called hybrid warfare, which includes incidents such as cyber attacks and drones suspected of being launched near critical infrastructure by Russian proxies.Ms Metreweli will describe this as \"an acute threat posed by an aggressive, expansionist and revisionist Russia\" and warn that \"the front line is everywhere\".Referring to the war in Ukraine, she will insist that Britain will be keeping up the pressure on President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine's behalf.Ms Metreweli, who took over as head of the Secret Intelligence Service in the autumn, is the first woman to head Britain's overseas spy agency. She took over from Sir Richard Moore on 1 October.Monday's speech will point to the recent sanctioning of Russian entities accused of conducting information warfare, as well as two China-based companies sanctioned for their \"indiscriminate cyber activities against the UK and its allies\".Western sanctions have certainly damaged Russia's economy, driving its exports eastwards towards China and India. But they have singularly failed to change President Putin's determination to wage war on Ukraine until it gives in to his demands for territory and ultimately, loyalty to Moscow.It is also clear from Ms Metreweli's speech that a special area of interest for the new spy chief is technology.Having joined MI6 in 1999, she has arrived at the top job via Q Branch. Named after the fictional MI6 division in Ian Fleming's spy books, this is the real life, in-house, top secret part of the Secret Intelligence Service that designs the sorts of gadgets and gizmos that enable agents to communicate with their handlers, without being detected and caught.In her speech later she is expected to call on all her intelligence officers to master technology, \"not just in our labs, but in the field, in our tradecraft.. We must be as comfortable with lines of [computer] code as we are with human sources, as fluent in Python as we are in multiple languages\".Python, a programming language, may surprise some as an example to pick, since it has been around for more than three decades. But her point will not be lost on the men and women who have chosen to work in the shadowy world of espionage.In an age where data is key, where spies can no longer rely on false identities when biometric scanning can unmask them in seconds at borders and checkpoints, MI6 needs to prove that it can still be relevant.Elsewhere, the Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Richard Knighton, will on Monday call for a \"whole of society approach\" to building national resilience, in the face of growing threats and uncertainty.In a speech to the Royal United Services Institute in London, Sir Richard is expected to say that defence and resilience need to be a higher priority for everyone, not just those in the military.It is the latest in a string of warnings that the UK needs to be more ready than it is now to meet a growing volume of threats.Sir Richard is expected to say that the situation is more dangerous than he has known during his entire career.Russia has made it clear that it wishes to challenge, limit, divide and ultimately destroy Nato, he will say. Britain's response needs to be about more than simply strengthening the armed forces. Deterrence, he will say, involves harnessing the UK's power, from its universities to industry, the rail network and the NHS.\"A new era for defence doesn't just mean our military and government stepping up - as we are - it means our whole nation stepping up,\" he will say.Addressing a skills gap highlighted in a recent report by the Royal Academy of Engineering, Sir Richard will talk about the need to work with industry and young people and will announce £50m for new defence technical excellence colleges.In recent weeks, both France and Germany have outlined plans for voluntary national service.Last year, the then-Conservative government set out its own compulsory proposals, which Labour dismissed as a gimmick.But the debate about how Britain as a whole should respond to an increasingly uncertain world is gathering pace.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPeter HoskinsBusiness reporterThe US firm behind the Roomba smart vacuum cleaner, iRobot, has filed for bankruptcy protection after facing competition from Chinese rivals and being hit by tariffs.Under the so-called pre-packaged Chapter 11 process, the main manufacturer of its devices, Shenzhen-based Picea Robotics, will take ownership of the firm.The tough commercial landscape had forced iRobot to cut its prices and make major investments in new technology, according to documents filed on Sunday.US import duties of 46% on goods from Vietnam, where most of iRobot's devices for the American market are made, increased its costs by $23m (£17.2m) this year, the firm said.The loss-making company was valued at $3.56bn in 2021 after the pandemic helped to drive strong demand for its products. It is now valued at around $140m.On Friday, iRobot's shares fell by more than 13% on the technology-heavy Nasdaq trading platform in New York.iRobot said the bankruptcy filing was not expected to disrupt its app, supply chains or product support.Founded in 1990 by three members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Lab, iRobot initially focused on defence and space technology before launching the Roomba in 2002.The Roomba holds about 42% of the US market share and 65% of the Japanese market share for robotic vacuum cleaners, according to the company.Last year, a planned $1.7bn takeover deal by online retail giant Amazon was derailed by the European Union's competition watchdog.Trade tariffs imposed by US Donald Trump on goods entering America from overseas has added to costs to many businesses, including iRobot, which rely on imports for product manufacturing. Trump has argued that the import taxes will boost American jobs and industry. Picea is a manufacturer of robotic vacuum cleaners, with research and development and production facilities in China and Vietnam.It has more than 7,000 employees worldwide and has sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners.",

    "body": "Family pray for 'hero' who wrestled gun from Bondi shooter 1 hour agoEmily AtkinsonWatch: Eyewitness captures moment man tackles and disarms Bondi shooterThe parents of a \"hero\" bystander who wrestled a gun from one of the Bondi Beach attackers have said they are praying he recovers from his wounds.Video verified by the BBC showed Ahmed al Ahmed, 43, running at the gunman and seizing his weapon, before turning the gun round on him and forcing his retreat. His cousin said Mr Ahmed had since undergone surgery for gunshot wounds to his arm and hand, while his mother told local media: \"We pray that God saves him.\"The fruit shop owner and father of two has been hailed as a hero for intervening in the shooting, which killed 15 people and left dozens injured at an event to celebrate Hanukkah on Sunday.Police have declared it a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.Mr Ahmed's cousin, Mustafa, told 7News Australia late on Sunday:  \"He is a hero, 100% he is a hero. He has two shots, one in his arm and one in his hand.\"In an update early on Monday, Mustafa said: \"I hope he will be fine. I saw him last night. He was alright but we're waiting to see what the doctor (says).\"His parents told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he had been shot four or five times.His father said Mr Ahmed \"wasn't thinking about the background of the people he's saving, the people dying in the street\".\"He doesn't discriminate between one nationality and another. Especially here in Australia, there's no difference between one citizen and another.\"They said they had been separated from their son since 2006 when he came to Australia. They had travelled to Sydney from Syria a couple of months ago.Chris Minns/FacebookChris Minns met Mr Ahmed after the attack and said it had been an \"honour\" to thank himNew South Wales Premier Chris Minns shared a picture of himself and Mr Ahmed late on Monday and described him as a \"real-life hero\".\"His incredible bravery no doubt saved countless lives when he disarmed a terrorist at enormous personal risk,\" he wrote on Facebook.He said it had been an honour to spend time with Mr Ahmed and \"to pass on the thanks of people across NSW\".\"There is no doubt that more lives would have been lost if not for Ahmed's selfless courage.\"Meanwhile, a US billionaire donated A$99,999 (US$ 65,000; £49,000) to Mr Ahmed, calling him a \"brave hero\".William Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, made the top donation to a GoFundMe for Mr Ahmed, which had raised more than $1m by late Monday.Mr Ahmed managed to wrestle the gun from the attacker in the struggle The footage of Mr Ahmed's intervention was shared widely online.It shows one of the gunmen standing behind a palm tree near a small pedestrian bridge, aiming and shooting his gun towards a target out of sight.Mr Ahmed, who was hiding behind a parked car, is seen leaping out at the attacker and tackling him.He manages to wrestle the gun from the attacker, pushes him to the ground and points the gun towards him. The attacker begins to retreat back to the bridge.Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the shooters.The same attacker is later seen on the bridge picking up another weapon and firing again.Another gunman also continues firing from the bridge. It is unclear who or what they are aiming at.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday: \"We have seen Australians today run towards danger in order to help others.\"These Australians are heroes, and their bravery has saved lives.\"Speaking at a White House Christmas reception, US President Donald Trump also praised Mr Ahmed, saying he had \"great respect\" for him. \"It's been a very, very brave person, actually, who went and attacked frontally one of the shooters, and saved a lot of lives,\" he said. Police say that the two shooters involved were a father and son aged 50 and 24. They have been named by local media as Sajid Akram and son Naveed Akram.Sajid Akram died at the scene while his son remains in hospital in critical condition.",

    "body": "17 minutes agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterThe Spanish government has fined property rentals giant Airbnb €64m (£56m) for advertising unlicensed apartments.It also said that some of the properties advertised in the popular tourist destination were banned from being rented.The fine, which cannot be appealed against, means Airbnb has to withdraw the adverts promoting unlicensed properties. The BBC has contacted Airbnb for comment. Spain, one of the top most visited countries in the world, has a buoyant tourism economy but that has fuelled concerns about unaffordable housing, as high demand from visitors raises the price of housing, pushing local people out of the market.\"There are thousands of families who are living on the edge due to housing, while a few get rich with business models that expel people from their homes,\" said Spain's consumer rights minister Pablo Bustinduy in a statement.Like many countries, Spain's government is also concerned about how short-term holiday lets can change a neighbourhood, fuelled by a transient population of holiday-goers.The country has been fighting a battle with thousands of Airbnb listings, banning them and clamping down on how many properties the firm can advertise. In May, there were demonstrations against the firm ahead of the busy summer season.Spain's government said 65,122 adverts on Airbnb breached consumer rules, including promotion of properties that were not licensed to be rented, and properties whose licence number did not match with those on official registers.Writing on social network Bluesky, Mr Bustinduy said: \"We'll prove it as many times as necessary: no company, no matter how big or powerful, is above the law. Even less so when it comes to housing.\"Globally, several popular tourist cities place heavy restriction on Airbnb, including Barcelona, New York, Berlin, Paris and even San Francisco, where Airbnb was founded.The tech firm started up in 2007 but became hugely popular around 2014, as tourists looked for cheap accommodation without the tax costs imposed on hotels.Users swelled as anybody could become a \"host\" and make some extra cash from renting out their spare room - though many major cities have since placed limits on these types of rentals, as complaints of noisy house parties and absent hosts became an issue.",

We really can't tell with those sort of things.\"But we need to, absolutely, I'm convinced, get there, get tested, get checked.\"I think we, as men, have got to start saying, we've got to be seen as human beings who may die of this thing.\"Sir Cliff said he wants to work with the King to improve cancer screening for men, after the King spoke last week about his own cancer treatment and emphasised the importance of checks to catch cancer at an early stage.Sir Cliff is known for decades of hits including The Young Ones, We Don't Talk Anymore and Summer Holiday.The musician described the lack of a national screening programme as \"absolutely ridiculous\".\"We all deserve to have the same ability to have a test and then start the treatments really early,\" he said.\"It seems to me - I've only been for one year now in touch with cancer, but every time I've talked with anybody, this has come up, and so I think our government must listen to us.\"Last month, the National Screening Committee – which advises governments across the UK – said a screening programme for prostate cancer for all men in the UK is not justified.They say only men with specific genetic mutations that lead to more aggressive tumours should be eligible.A three-month consultation began at the end of November before the committee meets again and gives its final advice to ministers in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, who will each have to make their own decision on prostate screening.",

    "body": "Flash floods have killed at least 37 people in Morocco's coastal Safi region, according to state-owned television.Cars and mounds of rubbish were seen sweeping through the main port city of Safi after torrential rain hit on Sunday.Dozens of people have been receiving treatment in hospital for their injuries, say local authorities, and at least 70 homes have been inundated in the old city centre.Local reports say access to and from the city is blocked on certain roads because of damage and debris.Residents on Sunday described it as a dark day, with one telling the AFP news agency: \"I've lost all my clothes. Only my neighbour gave me some to cover myself. I have nothing left. I've lost everything.\"Another survivor said he wanted to see government trucks at the scene to pump out the water.Moroccan authorities say search and rescue missions are still under way.Experts say the climate crisis is in part responsible for the extreme weather fluctuations seen in the North African state.It has suffered seven years of drought in a row, depleting its reservoirs. Last year was officially the hottest ever on record.This latest, sudden downpour is expected to continue on Tuesday together with snowfall across the Atlas mountains, Morocco's weather service warns.",

    "body": "49 minutes agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterOfcom is investigating BT and Three over mobile outages it said had caused \"UK-wide disruption\", including to emergency services.Thousands of Three customers reported they were unable to make calls in June, while BT and EE customers were hit by a similar outage in July.  The regulator said it would examine whether the mobile networks did not do enough to prevent the problems.Three said in a statement it was engaging with Ofcom. A BT Group spokesperson apologised to customers who had been affected.\"We will co-operate fully with Ofcom throughout the investigation and apologise again for any issues caused by this incident,\" they said.Meanwhile, Three said it had \"experienced disruption to voice services following an exceptional spike in network traffic triggered by a third-party software configuration change\".\"Since the outage, we have engaged openly with Ofcom and will continue to cooperate fully with their investigation,\" it said.According to Ofcom, firms must take proper action to identify risks and prepare for \"anything that compromises the availability, performance or functionality of their network or service\".It said providers must also prevent \"adverse effects arising from any such compromises\" - saying where this happens, they must take steps to mitigate them.\"The importance of connectivity cannot be underestimated,\" said telecoms analyst Paolo Pescatore.\"We all demand a robust and reliable connection at home and out and about.\" He said outages can occur despite \"significant efforts\" to prevent them - but said there must be \"a straightforward process to identify the issue and to learn lessons so it does not happen again\".The incidents at the heart of Ofcom's investigation saw thousands of customers across BT and Three networks report problems with their mobile service.At the time, Three told customers complaining of issues making and receiving calls on 25 June it was experiencing \"an issue affecting voice services\".This was not isolated to its own network - it also caused problems for customers on networks that piggyback off of Three, such as ID Mobile.A month later, EE and BT customers complained of similar issues.A government spokesperson said at the time \"communications providers have statutory obligations to ensure their networks and services are appropriately resilient\".Operators have previously faced scrutiny over outages or issues affecting peoples' ability to make calls or contact emergency services. BT was fined £17.5m in July 2024 for a \"catastrophic failure\" of its emergency call handling service which led to thousands of 999 calls not being connected.Three was ordered to pay £1.9m in 2017 after Ofcom found it could have prevented an issue that caused a loss of service for customers a year prior.It has since merged with Vodafone to form the UK's biggest mobile network, with 27 million customers.",

    "body": "12 hours agoYasmin RufoGetty ImagesAt first glance, my emails are polite and warm, after all \"I'm just checking\" in on a deadline but \"no worries either way\". However, a closer look reveals my messages are punctuated by unnecessary apologies, smiley faces, exclamation marks and even kisses.I like to think I'm being friendly and approachable, but according to experts, these linguistic habits may be quietly undermining how seriously I'm taken at work.Careers coach Hannah Salton and etiquette coach William Hanson explain why so many of us write like this and the impact it could be having on how we're perceived, and even promoted at work. Is your punctuation extra?\"Thanks very much!\" I've replied to many an email - my punctuation may be extra but a full stop feels blunt.People use exclamation marks to show \"positivity and enthusiasm,\" says Hannah.Women use them three times more often than men, a recent study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found.She thinks that’s likely down to the idea that \"women are often judged more harshly than men when they are direct and are called bossy and other gendered negative words\". And while a single exclamation mark isn't the problem the cumulative effect can be, warns Hannah. “If it looks fake or like it's covering up insecurity it could impact credibility,” she explains.Would you kiss them in real life?Written communication is notoriously easy to misread, which is why many of us insert an emoji as a picture of our warmth or humour.But etiquette coach William Hanson warns this can backfire. \"One emoji can mean different things to different people or something entirely unintended,\" he says.\"It would be better if people used words and a good command of English,\" he advises.Emojis can have an \"infantile connotation\" which could lead to people perceiving you as younger, less senior, capable or responsible, he says.\"I would not put an emoji in an email,\" he says. \"You can be friendly in your writing and remain professional at the same time.\" And when it comes to signing off with a kiss, he says: \"I would never put a kiss on the end of an email unless I would kiss them on the cheek in real life.\" Softening language can dilute authority\"Just checking that you're following me and this all makes sense?\"Emails containing reassurance checkers can be self-deprecating, Hannah says, adding that over time, that tone can subtly shape how someone is perceived.\"As a manager, it's a difficult balance of being liked and respected and if you're not direct, there's a risk of creating an impression of being less capable,\" she says.\"There are definitely times where communicating in an overly apologetic or overly measured way can make you come across as less impactful.\" \"A lot of it is unconscious,\" Hannah says. \"No one reads an email and thinks 'oh, they don't back themselves', it's more subtle than that.\"But if you're consistently communicating in a people-pleasing way, that can build up an impression of someone who doesn't back themselves, or who is potentially less competent.\"What to cut out of your emailsHere are some of the things you might want to consider losing to appear more professional, our experts suggest:Qualifying words such as \"just\" (\"just checking\", \"just wondering\")Pre-emptive apologies like \"sorry to bother you\" or \"I'm sure you're really busy but…\"Reassurance checkers such as \"does that make sense?\", \"hope that's ok\" or \"no worries either way\"Exclamation marksEmojisKisses or overly warm sign-offsHannah and William stress it's not about stripping all warmth or personality from professional communication. \"Personal style is important,\" Hannah says. \"Showcasing personality at work is not a bad thing. You don't want to feel like you have to filter everything you write and remove any personality from it.\"But at the same time you shouldn't use certain words and symbols \"as a tool to be liked\". A practical way to spot and reduce these habits without losing personality is to pay attention to the emails you receive and notice how different styles make you feel - what sounds clear, confident or reassuring, and what feels excessive, she says.Salton says AI tools can also be useful for reviewing drafts and removing excess filler or qualifier words.",

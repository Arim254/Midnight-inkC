After weeks of insulting each other during the mayoral campaign, Republicans and Democrats are still reacting to what turned out to be a very amicable and friendly meeting.\nTrump has promised to help Mamdani make New York City a success, and “great again”, but what does this actually mean, and will the US president do it? We also look at how Mamdani will be navigating the wider politics of being a mayor, particularly with midterm elections in 2026. In New York state, can Mamdani persuade his Democratic governor to put up taxes for the wealthiest? And how will he balance maintaining good relations with both Trump and Demoratic socialists in New York? \nMeanwhile, with Trump’s ally Elise Stefanik running for governor, how will the Republican campaign deal with the president’s new attitude towards Mamdani? \nSarah and Anthony are joined by Nick Reisman, POLITICO’s Albany Bureau Chief and New York politics expert.  \nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\n- Nick Reisman, Albany Bureau Chief for Politico \nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Adriana Urbano.

    "body": "18 minutes agoEsyllt CarrBusiness reporterPolice officers investigating the Post Office Horizon IT scandal are now considering corporate manslaughter charges.In an update, shared with victims in the past few days, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said the investigation was currently focused on eight suspects, with five interviews conducted under caution.It said there were now 53 persons of interest, most of whom were likely to be raised to suspect status at a later stage in the probe.The NPCC said while the investigation continued to focus on offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice, they were also considering charges of corporate manslaughter.The Horizon IT system, which began operating in 1999, falsely created shortfalls in Post Office branches for which sub-postmasters were held liable.The scandal has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.More than 900 people were prosecuted and some went to prison. Some died while waiting for justice.The criminal investigation into the scandal, Operation Olympos, began in 2020. A year ago, a team of about 100 officers was launched in four regional hubs, scaling up its activity after the end of the public phase of the inquiry into the scandal.Officers are now appealing to any former sub-postmasters who may have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the Post Office to come forward, after it was confirmed that the NDAs would no longer be enforced.The NPCC said: \"The primary and sole focus remains the offences of Perverting the Course of Justice and Perjury and this has not changed.\"However, as was done with fraud offences previously, advice is being sought from the CPS around the offences of Corporate and Gross Negligent manslaughter.\"The chair of the public inquiry, Sir Wyn Williams, published the first part of his final report on 8 July and the second volume is expected next year.The police officer leading the investigation previously told the BBC that any criminal trials may not take place before 2028.",

    "body": "Weather warnings issued as heavy rain hits the UK with flooding expectedImage source, PA MediaBySimon King Lead Weather PresenterUpdated 1 hour agoHeavy rain is expected to bring flooding and disruption across large parts of the UK on Monday.An amber Met Office severe weather warning for rain is in force across south Wales, while multiple yellow warnings are in force for many western areas of the UK.Nearly a month's worth of rain could fall onto already very saturated ground after above average rainfall throughout November across England and Wales.There will also be some gusty winds, especially around coastal areas.Winter - meteorologically speaking - has started on a very wet note with rain across much of the UK.That trend is likely to continue for most of Monday and turn particularly heavy at times.Rainfall totals will build quite widely but with very saturated ground there are numerous yellow Met Office warnings in force.A more severe amber Met Office warning is in force for south Wales until 21:00 GMT.Between 20 and 40mm (0.8 and 1.6in) of rain is expected to fall widely here, with some south-western facing hills seeing nearer to 120mm (4.7in).The average rainfall for south Wales and south-west England for the whole of December is 152mm (6in)Extensive flooding is possible along with disruption on the road and rail network, loss of power and communities potentially cut off. The Met Office has also warned that fast flowing or deep floodwater is possible, causing a danger to life.Image caption, Numerous Met Office weather warnings in force across the UK including a more severe amber warning in South WalesImage source, GettyImage caption, Heavy rain is likely for much of the UK on Monday.Additionally, yellow Met Office weather warnings are in force for:South-west Scotland until 21:00 on MondayNorth-west England and parts of the West Midlands until 23:59 on MondayMost of Wales and south-west England until 21:00 on MondayAgain, between 20 and 40mm of rain is forecast to fall quite widely but some areas, such as the higher ground of the Cumbrian Fells and Eyri, could see between 80 and 120mm (3 and 4.7in).This too could bring some localised flooding and transport disruption.Parts of East Yorkshire were flooded on Monday morning with fire crews needing to pump water away from properties.Flood warnings have been issued by the Environment Agency (EA) and Natural Resources Wales (NRW)An EA spokesperson has said \"We urge people not to drive though flood water – it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm (1ft) of flowing water is enough to float your car.\"Strong winds will also accompany the heavy rain, with gales possible around coasts and over high ground.Record wet NovemberNovember has been very wet overall, especially across England and Wales.Data released from the Met Office Hadley Centre shows that it has been the wettest month of 2025 so far, recording rainfall that was 31% above average.In parts of eastern England, some weather stations have recorded their highest November rainfall on record.Bridlington, Yorkshire for example has had nearly three times the normal rainfall with 180mm recorded compared to an average of 66mm - a new record for November.Other parts of East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire have received more than double their normal rainfall with the wettest November on record.Autumn has been the only season this year to record above-average rainfall. The UK as a whole saw 20% more than the long-term meteorological average, with Northern Ireland and Wales seeing significantly more.Autumn has continued the run of above-average temperatures in 2025. But with a mean temperature of 0.4C above seasonal average, no records have been broken.",

    "body": "A Russian missile attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has killed four people and injured 40, authorities have said. Unconfirmed reports say a ballistic missile was used in the strike, which took place on Monday morning. Videos shared online showed a large explosion occur on the side of a motorway, and local media said an office block, cars and shops were hit or badly damaged. Dnipro, which lies around 100km (62 miles) from the front line, has frequently come under Russian attack since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.The attack came a day before US special envoy Steve Witkoff is due to meet President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Witkoff has visited the Russian president several times this year, but has never been to Kyiv. On Sunday, a Ukrainian delegation met Witkoff, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in Florida. Zelensky said on Monday that the talks had been \"very constructive\" but that there were some \"tough issues\" to be worked through - echoing Rubio's comments that the meeting had been \"productive\" but that there was \"more work to be done\".The Florida meeting was the latest step in weeks of intense \"shuttle diplomacy\" which saw Ukrainian and Russian delegations separately engage with US officials to discuss a peace plan. Despite efforts, however, substantial differences remain between Moscow and Kyiv's positions. Russia has refused to back down from its core demand that Ukraine retreats from the areas of the Donbas region it still holds, which Kyiv maintains it will never do. \"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Vladimir Putin said. In response, Zelensky said that Russia \"scorned\" efforts \"to truly end the war\".Matters surrounding Ukraine's future security are also a source of contention. Kyiv and its European partners are keen for Ukraine to be given security guarantees - such as Nato membership - that would protect it from being attacked again. But Russia vehemently opposes this and Donald Trump too has ruled out allowing Ukraine to join the military alliance.Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived in Paris to rally support from French President Emmanuel Macron, and will head to Ireland on Tuesday. In recent weeks, concern has grown in Kyiv and among Europeans that the US was becoming more amenable to Russia's demands than Ukraine's, and that Europe was being excluded from the negotiating table. Zelensky has also been weakened politically at home by a corruption scandal. His chief of staff Andriy Yermak, who had also led the Ukrainian delegation at peace talks, resigned on Friday after anti-corruption investigators raided his home - although he has not been accused of wrongdoing. Two cabinet ministers have also been fired.On Sunday Trump told reporters on Air Force One that Ukraine had \"some difficult little problems\", referring to the scandal, and repeated his view that both Russia and Ukraine wanted to end the war.Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or injured, as well as thousands of civilians, and at least seven million people have become refugees, since Russia invaded on 24 February 2022.The conflict between the two ex-Soviet states stretches back to 2014 when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown and Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting armed uprisings in eastern Ukraine.",

    "body": "3 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterVirgin Media has been fined £23.8m for leaving thousands of customers without access to lifesaving telecare alarms during the digital switchover.Communications watchdog Ofcom fined the telecoms giant after ruling it failed to protect vulnerable users of the devices, typically elderly and disabled people, during the transition from analogue to digital.The industry is currently changing landline services from analogue to digital, with Ofcom describing the copper-based network as \"beyond its intended lifespan and increasingly unreliable\".Virgin Media said it had not got everything right in the transition but added it has launched \"a comprehensive package of improvements\" for customers.Ofcom has raised concerns about telecare users being left disconnected during the transition, warning \"any disruption to their device's connection could have material impacts on their safety\".Telecare systems typically work by having an emergency button which automatically calls the emergency services or carers when pressed via a user's landline.The regulator's investigation found during its digital switchover, Virgin Media failed to properly identify telecare customers, leaving those affected without proper support.The company's approach meant thousands were left with devices which were not connected to alarm monitoring centres.It also found that the firm's approach to telecare customers, disconnecting users who did not engage in the transition, left vulnerable customers \"at a direct risk of harm\". Ofcom and Virgin Media have not given an exact number for how many customers were affected or for how long people were left at risk.The firm reported itself to Ofcom over a series of serious incidents during its migration of telecare customers in November and December 2023.Ofcom said the £23.8m penalty reflected the vulnerability of the customers affected, the significant length of time they were left at risk, the seriousness of the breach and the seriousness of the potential harm caused.It is the third biggest penalty Ofcom has issued, after fining Royal Mail £50m in 2018 for breaching competition law, and fining BT £42m in 2017 for delays in installing high-speed lines.Ofcom's enforcement director Ian Strawhorne said: \"It's unacceptable that vulnerable customers were put at direct risk of harm and left without appropriate support by Virgin Media, during what should have been a safe and straightforward upgrade to their landline services.\"Today's fine makes clear to companies that, if they fail to protect their vulnerable customers, they can expect to face similar enforcement action.\"Virgin Media said the majority of migrations from landline to digital had been completed \"without issue\".A spokesperson added: \"We recognise that we didn't get everything right and have since addressed the migration issues identified by Ofcom.\"Our customers' safety is always our top priority and, following an end-to-end review which began in 2023, we have already introduced a comprehensive package of improvements and enhanced support for vulnerable customers including improved communications, additional in-home support and extensive post-migration checks, as well as working with the industry and government on a joint national awareness campaign.\"",

    "body": "33 minutes agoSimon Jack,Business editorandRachel Clun,Business reporterGetty ImagesThe UK and the US have agreed a deal to keep tariffs on UK pharmaceutical shipments into America at zero.Under the agreement the UK will pay more for medicines through the NHS in return for a guarantee that US import taxes on pharmaceuticals made in the UK will remain at zero for three years.The deal comes after US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs to as high as 100% on branded drug imports.Pharmaceuticals are one of the UK's biggest exports to the US, which is also the biggest market by far for big UK drugmakers including GSK and AstraZeneca.Earlier this year, US president Donald Trump announced massive increases to taxes on goods imported to the country, which he argued would create jobs and boost American manufacturing.The White House exempted pharmaceuticals from that round of tariffs, and later signed a deal with the UK to remove some trade barriers between the countries and reduce levies on most goods exported to the US to 10%. But pharmaceuticals remained a big unknown.The White House has repeatedly threatened to raise tariffs on medicines, citing concerns about the country's reliance on medicines made overseas.  Trump has also argued that US consumers effectively subsidise medicines for other developed countries by paying premium prices for those drugs, pushing for other countries to pay more. White House spokesman Kush Desai said the agreement with the UK was a \"historic step towards ensuring that other developed countries finally pay their fair share\".Under the terms set out on Monday, the UK will increase the price threshold at which it deems new treatments to be too expensive by 25%.The UK will also increase the overall amount the NHS spends on medicines, with a target to increase that spending from 0.3% of GDP to 0.6% of GDP over the next 10 years.The amount drug companies must pay back to the NHS to ensure the health system does not overspend its allocated budget will be capped at 15% - last year, drug companies had to pay back more than 20%.In exchange, UK medicine exports will be protected from tariff increases for the next three years.Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said the deal \"guarantees that UK pharmaceutical exports – worth at least £5bn a year - will enter the US tariff free, protecting jobs, boosting investment and paving the way for the UK to become a global hub for life sciences.\"In the 12 months to the end of September, the UK exported £11.1bn worth of medicines to the US, making up 17.4% of all goods exports in that period, according to the Department for Business and Trade.The pressure from the US had intensified a long-running row between the industry and UK government over spending levels and approval rates.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in August that he was not prepared to let drug companies \"rip off\" the UK, after talks between the government and pharmaceutical firms over the cost of medicines broke down.But subsequently Science Minister Sir Patrick Vallance told the BBC he accepted that the NHS needed to spend more on medicines after seeing its spending on drugs shrink as a percentage of its budget over the last 10 years.Meanwhile, several large pharma investments in the UK have been paused or cancelled over the last 18 months while both GSK and AstraZeneca have recently announced multi-billion-dollar investments in the US.In mid-September, British pharmaceutical giant GSK pledged to invest $30bn (£22bn) in research and manufacturing in the US over the next five years.A week before GSK's US investment announcement, US pharmaceutical company Merck - which is called MSD in Europe – revealed it was scrapping its planned £1bn expansion of its UK operations.Shortly after, AstraZeneca also announced it was pausing a planned £200m investment in a Cambridge research facility. In July, AstraZeneca said it would invest $50bn on medicine manufacturing and research and development in the US.William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said he was pleased to see that the protections from US tariffs that UK officials had promised earlier this year had been delivered. \"This deal is a real win. It will promote exports, boost investment, and enhance UK competitiveness as a production and innovation base for world-leading medicines and treatments,\" he said. The White House had launched a formal investigation into pharmaceutical imports and their effect on national security in April, taking the first step towards tariffs.In September in a Truth Social post, Trump threatened to raise tariffs on branded drugs - a small subset of the medicine that the US imports - to 100%, but the White House did not put the plan into effect, citing negotiations with manufacturers.In announcing the new agreement, the UK government said it was the only country in the world to have secured a zero percent tariff rate for pharmaceutical shipments.European officials have previously said they believed their exports would be protected by terms agreed over the summer, which would cap tariffs at 15%.US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr said Americans \"should not pay the world's highest drug costs for medicines they helped fund\".\"This agreement with the United Kingdom strengthens the global environment for innovative medicines and brings long-overdue balance to U.S.–U.K. pharmaceutical trade,\" he said in a statement.",

    "body": "41 minutes agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentKing Charles and Queen Camilla will host the first German state visit to the UK in 27 years - with a state banquet and ceremonial events in Windsor on Wednesday.Such state visits are about projecting soft power and building relationships, and German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier's three-day visit will see a mix of pageantry, politics and culture.Events for the president will range from speaking in Parliament to meeting German Premier League footballers to visiting the David Bowie Centre in the Victoria and Albert Museum's new wing in east London.In a message of reconciliation, there will be a visit to the ruins of Coventry Cathedral, bombed during the Second World War.This mirrors a visit to Hamburg during the UK state visit to Germany in 2023, when King Charles laid a wreath remembering the civilian casualties of wartime Allied bombing raids.The state visit by President Steinmeier and his wife Elke Budenbender, will begin on Wednesday with the traditional formal welcomes and military parades.There will be a carriage ride on the way to Windsor Castle - which didn't take place during the recent US state visit by President Trump, who moved in and out by helicopter, reducing security risks but also any opportunity for protests.A highlight of such visits is the spectacular state banquet in St George's Hall, where the King and president will make speeches, with celebrity guests enjoying a showcase dinner.When in Germany, the King had spoken about the importance of supporting Ukraine, so there will be interest in whether he might raise the subject again, against a background of talks about ending the war.Also in Windsor, President Steinmeier will lay flowers at the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II in St George's Chapel.Sir Keir Starmer will host a meeting with President Steinmeier at Downing Street, along with UK and German business leaders, emphasising the importance of economic ties.It follows the \"Kensington Treaty\" signed this summer between the UK and Germany, which included closer co-operation on defence and plans for easier travel between the two countries, including a direct rail link.Events will show the cultural links between the countries, including a sleigh designed in 1845 by the German-born Prince Albert, who was married to Queen Victoria.Ms Budenbender will visit the Judith Kerr Primary School, in south-east London, to mark the connection to its namesake, Judith Kerr, the German-born author of the children's book The Tiger Who Came to Tea.Oxford University will award an honorary degree to President Steinmeier, on a trip where he will learn about medical research at the university.A visit by President Steinmeier to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will include meeting German footballers in the Premier League.And at the V&A East Storehouse, which has put the museum's archive on show, the visitors will see the David Bowie Centre, which contains items related to the pop star, such as stage outfits and musical instruments.Bowie had strong associations with Berlin, having lived and worked in the city in the 1970s.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorGetty ImagesFewer than one in 10 people who could benefit from obesity jabs like Wegovy are able to get them, warns the World Health Organization as it releases its first guidance on the drugs.With more than one billion people worldwide now obese, it is calling for more widespread and fairer access to GLP-1 medication. According to projections, more than two billion will be obese by 2030 unless action is taken. High costs, limited production capacity, and supply-chain constraints are major barriers to universal access to the injections that can help people shift significant weight, says WHO. It has already added them to its \"essential\" medicines list that countries are advised to provide. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"Our new guidance recognises that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care.\"While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms.\"WHO says these drugs, sometime called skinny jabs, represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity, from a \"lifestyle condition\" to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease.It says the drugs can be taken long-term -  for six months or more - but must be prescribed along with advice on diet and exercise, so that people can keep the weight off. Too few people around the world can access them, says WHO. \"Our greatest concern is equitable access,\" said Tedros. Skinny jab shortageEven under the current best projected scenario, the production of GLP-1 therapies could only cover around 100 million people - less than 10% of those who need them, according to the WHO.The guideline calls on countries and companies to expand access, through strategies such as voluntary licensing - where a pharmaceutical company grants permission for others to make affordable non-brand versions of its patented drug.A patent on semaglutide - the core ingredient of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy - is due to expire in several countries in 2026, meaning other drug-makers will soon be free to produce and sell cheap versions in places like India, Canada, China, Brazil and Turkey. WHO says countries must also create healthier environments to promote good health and prevent obesity.How obesity jabs workGLP-1 drugs mimick a natural hormone to slow digestion, curb appetite and increase feelings of fullness so people eat less.In the UK, the injections are prescription only medicines, which means they can only be prescribed by a healthcare professional for a person who clinically needs it.Some are available on the NHS, but more are sold privately. There is a black market and to be safe people should avoid buying from unregulated sellers such as beauty salons or via social media. People typically start to lose weight within a few weeks of starting on the weekly injections.Research suggests people may put most of the weight back on within a year of stopping the medication though, as their normal food cravings return.Being overweight or obese increases your risk for developing health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers.Obesity affects people in every country and was associated with 3.7 million deaths worldwide in 2024, according to the WHO.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentBBCSmith's vocals were allegedly copied in the creation of Haven's viral hit, I Run Brit Award-winning singer Jorja Smith's record label has said it wants a share of the royalties for a song it claims was created using an artificial intelligence \"clone\" of the singer's voice.I Run by British dance act Haven went viral on TiKTok in October thanks, in part, to smooth soul vocals by an uncredited female singer.It was heading for the charts in the UK and the US but was banned by streaming services after record industry bodies issued takedown notices, alleging the track violated copyright by impersonating another artist.Although I Run has now been re-released with new vocals, Smith's label FAMM said it believes the track was made with AI trained on her work, and is seeking compensation.\"This isn't just about Jorja. It's bigger than one artist or one song,\" FAMM wrote in a statement on Instagram.The label said it believes \"both versions of the track infringe on Jorja's rights and unfairly take advantage of the work of all the songwriters with whom she collaborates\".Smith is known for songs like Be Honest and Little Things, and was named best British female at the Brit Awards in 2019.Suggesting that her fans had been misled by Haven's track, the label added: \"We cannot allow this to become the new normal\".The team behind the song have admitted using AI during its creation. Producer and songwriter Harrison Walker said the original vocals were actually his own, but were heavily manipulated using music-generation software Suno - sometimes called the \"ChatGPT for music\".Meanwhile, the second producer Waypoint, real name Jacob Donaghue, confirmed on social media that AI was used to \"give our original vocal a female tone\".Haven / InstagramProducer Waypoint confirmed the use of AI in a social media postDonaghue and Walker maintain that they wrote and produced the song - and even shared videos of their original computer files with Billboard magazine.\"It shouldn't be any secret that I used AI-assisted vocal processing to transform solely my voice for I Run,\" Walker explained.\"As a songwriter and producer I enjoy using new tools, techniques and staying on the cutting edge of what's happening.\"To set the record straight, the artists behind HAVEN. are real and human, and all we want to do is make great music for other humans.\"Suno has admitted that its software was trained on copyrighted works, claiming that doing so was legal under the \"fair use\" laws - which allows copyrighted material to be quoted for purposes such as criticism, news reporting and research. However, it is not known whether Smith's recordings formed part of that training data. According to Haven, they simply prompted the software to use \"soulful vocal samples\" while creating their song.Jorja Smith has won two Brit Awards, including best female artist in 2019While their original version of I Run was suspended by both the Official Charts Company in the UK and the Billboard Charts in America, the replacement entered the UK Top 40 last week.FAMM framed the original song's existence as a test case for the music industry's relationship with AI.The label said it had \"a duty to speak up\" and \"encourage public discourse\", because AI is proliferating at an \"alarming rate and substantially outpacing regulation\". \"AI material should be clearly labelled as such so that the public may choose whether they consume AI material or not,\" the statement continued.'Collateral damage'Smith shared FAMM's statement on her own Instagram page.It warned that artists and other creators were becoming \"collateral damage in the race by governments and corporations towards AI dominance\".It also said the label would share any royalties with the writers behind Smith's music.\"If we are successful in establishing that AI helped to write the lyrics and melody in I Run and are awarded a share of the song, we would seek to allocate each of Jorja's co-writers with a pro-rata share,\" it said.\"This allocation would be based on the [percentage] of Jorja's catalogue that they have contributed to, as, ultimately, if AI helped to write I Run, it would have been trained on Jorja's catalogue of songs.\"Rise of AI musicThe rise of AI music has been a source of fascination and consternation for the music industry.In June, the band Velvet Sundown racked up millions of streams on Spotify before revealing that they used AI to assist in creating their dusty, roots-rock sound. Last month, an AI-generated \"artist\" known as Breaking Rust topped the US country digital song sales chart - a niche countdown, but one that shows audiences aren't averse to consuming computer-generated music.Suno was sued for copyright infringement by all three of the world's major record labels last year, but the cases have now been settled.Warner Music subsequently signed a partnership with the company, which will allow users to create AI-generated songs using the voices, names and likenesses of the Warner acts who opt in to the service.It is unclear how many artists will agree to these uses.Last week, musicians including Sir Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn and Kate Bush released a vinyl album full of silent songs, or recordings of empty studios, in protest at planned changes to copyright law, which they say would make it easier for AI companies to train models using copyrighted work without a licence.The record had previously been uploaded to streaming services in February.",

    "body": "16 minutes agoCharlotte Scarr,in BangladeshandBecky Morton,political reporter Labour MP and former minister Tulip Siddiq has described her two year prison sentence in Bangladesh as \"deeply unfair\" after a court convicted her in her absence on corruption charges.She was found guilty of influencing her aunt, Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to secure a plot of land for her family in the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, a claim she strongly denies.Siddiq, who is based in London and has rejected the charges, is unlikely to serve the jail term.The Labour MP said the process had been \"flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end\".\"I'm absolutely baffled by the whole thing - I've still had no contact whatsoever from the Bangladeshi authorities despite them spreading malicious allegations about me for a year-and-a-half now,\" she said.\"There's been absolutely no summons sent to me, there's no charge sheet, I've had no correspondence from them - I'm not difficult to find, I'm a parliamentarian.\"She said she had engaged lawyers in the UK and Bangladesh.\"I feel like I'm in some sort of Kafkaesque nightmare,\" she added.\"The only reason I know I'm being convicted is because I read it in the newspapers. So this is trial by media, which is deeply unfair.\"Since Hasina's regime was overturned, prosecutors in Bangladesh have launched a number of wide-ranging legal cases against the former leader, her past associates and family members. The trial involving Siddiq - who quit as a Treasury minister in January over controversy around her ties to her aunt - has been playing out in Dhaka since August.Siddiq continues to face a number of outstanding charges. Court documents included claims that Siddiq \"forced and influenced her aunt and the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina using her special power to secure [a plot of land] for her mother Rehana Siddiq, sister Azmina Siddiq and brother Radwan Siddiq\".A prosecutor for Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) previously said Siddiq was tried as a Bangladeshi citizen as authorities had obtained her Bangladeshi passport, ID and tax number.Siddiq's lawyers have disputed she is a Bangladeshi citizen, telling the Financial Times she has \"never had\" an ID card or voter ID, and \"has not held a passport since she was a child\".She was sentenced by Judge Rabiul Alam to two years in prison and a 100,000 Bangladeshi Taka fine ($821; £620). If she fails to pay, six months will be added to the sentence.When the trial began, the MP said prosecutors had \"peddled false and vexatious allegations that have been briefed to the media but never formally put to me by investigators\".A statement on her behalf continued: \"I have been clear from the outset that I have done nothing wrong and will respond to any credible evidence that is presented to me. Continuing to smear my name to score political points is both baseless and damaging.\"A Labour spokesperson said the party could not recognise the judgement.\"As has been reported, highly regarded senior legal professionals have highlighted that Tulip Siddiq has not had access to a fair legal process in this case and has never been informed of the details of the charges against her,\" the spokesperson said.\"This is despite repeated requests made to the Bangladeshi authorities through her legal team. \"Anyone facing any charge should always be afforded the right to make legal representations when allegations are made against them.\"It is understood Siddiq is not subject to investigation or party disciplinary proceedings and retains her Labour Party membership and the Labour whip in the House of Commons.Last week, a group of senior lawyers raised concerns with Bangladesh's representative in the UK over how the trial had been conducted. Signatories to that statement included ex-Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, and Lady Cherie Blair, a human rights lawyer and wife of former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair.In a letter first reported by the Guardian, they said Siddiq had not been able to secure proper legal representation during the trial, adding: \"Such a process is artificial and a contrived and unfair way of pursuing a prosecution.\"The verdict comes two weeks after Hasina was sentenced to death in a separate trial over her role in a brutal crackdown against the protests which ultimately forced her from office in July 2024.She was found guilty of crimes against humanity over the deaths of an estimated 1,400 people at the hands of the police. That trial was held in Hasina's absence, as she has been in exile in India since being ousted. She denied the charges.Siddiq, whose mother is the former prime minister's sister, continues to face a number of outstanding charges in Bangladesh, including two ongoing trials in relation to the allegations at the centre of Monday's verdict.She is also being investigated over the alleged transfer of a flat located in a lucrative area of Dhaka to her sister.Siddiq and her family have also been investigated in relation to allegations of embezzlement around a £3.9bn deal in 2013 connected to a Russian-funded nuclear power plant deal.Siddiq has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in relation to the allegations, which originated with claims made by Bobby Hajjaj, a political opponent of Hasina.Bangladeshi authorities have said they estimate that around $234bn (£174bn) was appropriated through corruption during Hasina's reign.Responding to the latest verdict, the Awami League, the political party which Hasina leads, described it as \"entirely predictable\" and \"firmly denied\" the allegations against the former prime minister and her family members.\"The process fails to pass any reasonable test of judicial fairness - a point that has been made forcefully by both local and international legal experts,\" the party said.Hasina also accused Bangladesh's judiciary of being controlled by an \"unelected government run by the Awami League's political opponents\", namely the interim government headed up by Dr Muhammad Yunus.Prior to Siddiq's resignation from the British government, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's independent ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus said he had not found \"evidence of improprieties\" following an investigation.However, he said it was \"regrettable\" Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of her ties to Hasina.While Siddiq continued to insist she was not guilty of any wrongdoing, she quit her junior ministerial role in order not to be a \"distraction\" for the government. The UK does not have an extradition treaty in place with Bangladesh. It is categorised as a 2B country, meaning clear evidence needs to be presented to lawyers and judges to authorise any extradition.Siddiq was not compelled to return to Dhaka for the trial despite authorities there issuing an arrest warrant.

    "body": "Andy Murray says he \"probably didn't get the results I would have liked\" for Novak Djokovic during his time coaching his former rival.Murray, who ended his playing career at the 2024 Paris Olympics, joined Djokovic's coaching team last November but they parted company after just six months.In his first coaching role, the 38-year-old Murray partnered with 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic at the 2025 Australian Open and three other tournaments.In an interview with The Tennis Podcast, Murray said: \"You're working with not only one of the best tennis players but one of the best athletes of all time, so my expectation was that it was going to be extremely challenging.\"Novak, like myself, is a challenging character in terms of the way he goes about his tennis, [it] is extremely demanding. \"I look back on it and I'm glad that I did it. It's an amazing experience that I've had.\"Djokovic overcame Carlos Alcaraz to reach the semi-finals at the Australian Open, but was forced to retire injured from his semi-final against Alexander Zverev.On his return to action, Djokovic suffered first-round losses in Qatar and at Indian Wells before losing the Miami Open final to Czech teenager Jakub Mensik.\"It was unfortunate what happened in Australia with the injury, but I watched him play ridiculous tennis in that tournament,\" Murray said.\"After the injury, it was certainly a difficult few months for him, but also I think for the team and all of us. I was disappointed. Probably didn't get the results I would have liked for him. But I learned a lot about what coaching is.\"On his first day in the job, Murray was asked to join Djokovic on a run and suffered through calf cramps so as to not disappoint his fellow former world number one - a moment he described as \"embarrassing\".Reflecting on his own playing career, Murray said he \"would have taken more breaks\" to enjoy his successes, including after his two Olympic triumphs.Tennis' top players have voiced concerns about the sport's calendar this year. Murray, hindered by injuries during the latter years of his career, voted against increasing the number of two-week ATP 1,000 tournaments two years ago and said the increased time on the road would negatively impact players.\"I don't think there's anything that suggests players are getting injured more than before. But I do think players are more tired and mentally more fatigued than they were before because they're spending more days away on the road,\" said Murray.\"When you're more fatigued, you're more sensitive to pain and discomfort. My feeling is that's what players are feeling now, just being away for longer.\"I don't think the matches are so much more demanding than they were 10, 15 years ago. But it's the amount of time that players are away on the road that's actually an issue.\"",

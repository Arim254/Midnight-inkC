    "body": "4 hours agoKaty AustinTransport correspondentBBCWhen Jane Kingsbury, 80, last had her eyes tested, she says her optician told her that her eyesight was OK. But Jane, from Cambridge, says she is giving up driving at night because the feeling of being \"dazzled\" by other vehicles has left her feeling unsafe. \"I am worried about the glare from oncoming lights,\" she says.And when Jane mentioned this at a discussion group she attends, others felt the same. \"Over 90% of us did not want to drive in the dark,\" says Jane. \"So we have changed the time of our meetings from 7.30pm to 1.30pm [for much of the year] so that we can drive home before dark.\"Jane and her friends aren't alone. In a debate at Westminster last October, MPs voiced widespread concerns about bright headlights. Some described social isolation among constituents who had become too scared to drive in the dark.The RAC motoring organisation, which has campaigned on headlight dazzle, has repeatedly asked its members for their views. Most recently, more than half of respondents to a survey of 1,745 UK drivers in January this year felt the problem had worsened in the past 12 months. A third of those who said they were affected by dazzle said they felt less safe when driving at night.Getty ImagesHeadlight glare is an issue for all road users - not just motoristsIt's not only older drivers who feel this way. Emily McGuire from Essex told the BBC: \"I am in my 30s and sometimes I can't tell if [other vehicles'] main beam is on or off and once they have passed, I can't see properly for a good few minutes, it's terrible.\"She owns a smaller car and feels that she can't avoid the lights on higher, bigger cars: \"I suffer with migraines when a car approaches me with extremely bright lights, I have to look down or in the other direction… I also have to slow right down when it's really dark and I'm on a country lane.\"And experts say the problem is getting worse. Denise Voon, clinical advisor at the College of Optometrists - which also campaigns on the issue - says: \"I am a practising optometrist and I've noticed that maybe 15 years ago, you rarely had people coming in complaining about headlight glare. But now it's becoming more and more prevalent.\"It's an issue that has even reached the United Nations - it will mandate all new cars to automatically adjust their headlight levels.But this will only affect new cars. And so the questions many are asking are: what, if anything, can be done about all the cars currently out there causing headlight discomfort - and why did nobody spot that this might be a problem?The impact of changing headlightsExperts believe a number of factors can cause headlight dazzle.One is the angle of headlights. If misaligned, they are more likely to cause glare. Misalignment can cause a vehicle to fail its MoT test.Then there's the fact that headlights have got brighter, to help drivers see better.Headlights have moved a long way from the \"kind of brown glow\" produced by filament bulbs decades ago, according to Dale Harrow, professor of Intelligent Mobility and Car Design at the Royal College of Art in London. They have become more complex and \"a design object in their own right,\" he says.Glass casings have given way to plastic and significantly, the light source has changed too, with most people now using LEDs instead of halogen bulbs, he says - the quality has improved and lights are now \"brighter, but also a lot clearer\".Getty ImagesCar headlights have come a long way since the heyday of the Jaguar E TypeWhile this \"has to be a good thing\" when it comes to helping the driver see clearly, Harrow says, it has also resulted in \"unplanned drawbacks\" - including dazzling other road users.Another problem is the illegal retrofitting of LED bulbs, especially when fitted into units designed for halogen. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency has said it has stepped up a crackdown on retrofit bulbs, with sellers facing potential fines of up to £1,000.\"Recent advances in headlight technology have improved visibility but all headlights – whether LED or not – must still be aimed correctly and checked at the MOT test,\" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).How bright lights affect our eyesOur eyes adapt in the dark to become a lot more sensitive to light, says Denise Voon. As a result, being suddenly hit by very bright lights can temporarily make it very hard to see, even causing pain.Retinal cells at the back of the eyes which detect the light can get bleached, and take a while to recover. That's when people notice an imprint remaining in their vision after looking away.Although headlight glare does affect younger people, age is thought to be a factor. Older people are more prone to conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma, for example.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThere is widespread concern that glare is getting worse - but the statistics are unclearVoon says there are a number of reasons why LEDs may be particularly problematic. Firstly, they are two to three times as bright as traditional halogens, and their \"colour temperature\" is bluer and whiter, which mimics natural daylight.Also, LED lights \"are a lot more directional, so you've got this much brighter, whiter light in a very directional point hitting your eye compared to the more diffuse halogen ones\".It's not clear if it is the brightness, colour, temperature or the direction of the lights - or some combination of all of these - that causes most problems, she says: \"But what we know is that's one of the differences.\"What the data says - and doesn'tDespite widespread concerns that the problem is getting worse, there isn't evidence that brighter lights are causing more accidents.Statistics from the Department for Transport (DfT) show that headlight dazzle was recorded as a contributory factor in 216 collisions in 2023. Four of those collisions were fatal.Although the overall number of collisions rose very slightly compared to the previous year, it was far below the 330 recorded in 2014. The figure was also lower than any of the intervening years except 2020, when the pandemic meant fewer drivers on the roads.But the fact that since 2024 \"vision affected by dazzling headlights\" is no longer listed in the DfT's published statistics as a contributory factor in its own right, makes comparisons or identification of a trend harder.Equally, these statistics don't tell us whether some people are choosing not to drive at night and nor do they account for other changes in driver behaviour.Still, a government-commissioned report by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), published last year, found that drivers \"perceived glare from vehicle headlamps to be an important and widespread issue when driving at night\".It also concluded that headlamps were perceived as \"too bright\", and that \"whiter\" headlamps and those on larger vehicles were \"generally perceived to be especially problematic for causing glare\".So far so obvious, you may think, based on what campaigners have been saying for some time. But the study went further.Researchers took out a car at night, rigged with equipment to measure light intensity and an observer in the vehicle could press a button if they felt glare might interfere with their driving.The study drew a link between higher levels of luminance - meaning the intensity of light - and the likelihood of experiencing glare. It also suggested that 40,000 candela per sq m - a measure of luminance - may be an \"important threshold for the experience of glare being more likely\".Also, when the research car was travelling uphill or around a right-hand bend, glare was more likely, researchers said - a driver's eyes are more likely to fall within the \"throw\" of headlamps from oncoming vehicles.Echoing the concerns of experts, researchers also found \"some tentative indication that larger body shapes such as SUVs and models with light-emitting diode (LED) headlamps may be more likely to be associated with glare\". However, further research was recommended in this area.The government has since agreed to conduct such further research. But this has not started yet, and it's unlikely to begin for at least a couple of months.An unidentified problemBut all this raises the question of why nobody anticipated widespread complaints about glare - in spite of all the research and development work that's been carried out by carmakers around the world. \"It seems more priority has been put on giving drivers the best possible view of the road at night and less on the consequences for oncoming traffic,\" says Simon Williams, the RAC's head of policy.Manufacturers reject this. \"Safety is every car maker's top priority and providing good visibility to drivers in darkened conditions is essential,\" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. \"All headlights must meet international standards so drivers can see as clearly as possible but without dazzling other drivers.\"In October, I had the opportunity to speak to Thomas Broberg, senior advisor for safety at Volvo's Car Safety Centre in Gothenburg, Sweden. He explained how vehicles have to meet the standards of countries in which the manufacturer wants to sell them - vehicle manufacturing being an international business.LightRocket via Getty ImagesVolvo says avoiding glare is part of its design processThere are regulations around the headlights themselves, he says, covering their shape, intensity and glare. Also, headlights are tested on the road by different authorities and \"as a global car company, we need to comply with all of them\".Broberg said it was a \"concern\" that people are complaining about glare, but insisted that avoiding glare was part of the design process. He also pushed back against the suggestion that SUVs end up dazzling people more. \"The angle of the light is actually regulated,\" he says. \"So if you have a higher vehicle, then you need to have a lower [beam] angle.\"He argues that road geometry, and poor aiming of headlights in cars that don't have automatic levelling systems, are more likely culprits.What is already being done?In theory, technological innovations should help, particularly auto-dimming - although not everyone finds that they dip early enough.Off the back of the TRL report, the government has promised to look further into design factors that may be contributing to glare. The idea would be to use the findings to propose changes to international regulations at the United Nations.The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has a World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. Following an agreement by this forum, new vehicles are meant to have mandatory automatic headlight levelling by September 2027. The effect of this technology is to correct the aim of headlights if the vehicle's load changes.But this would not change the headlight settings on the millions of cars on our roads already.More from InDepthThe TRL report also points out that \"many instances of glare are likely to remain even with stronger regulation\", because real-world situations of \"road geometry\" - the shape of the road, with ups, downs and corners - are not realistically under DfT's control.There are some basic things drivers can do to reduce the impact bright lights have on them. For example, keep their windscreen clean, inside and out.The College of Optometrists reminds motorists to always wear glasses if they have them, and make sure they are clean. It also advises staying up to date with vision tests, which can also pick up problems with eye health.More practical advice when confronted with bright oncoming headlights is to briefly look to the side of the road, keeping your eyes open - and of course, be considerate of other drivers when you're behind the wheel yourself.For Emily and others affected by glare, this guidance will have to make do for the time being. She says: \"It's tough but we cope and carry on until something is done about it.\"BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "26 minutes agoHarry Farley,Political correspondentandClaire KeenanGetty ImagesPubs across the UK will be able to stay open late for any home nation knockout match during the men's World Cup this summer. The government announced the changes that will allow pubs in England, Scotland – and if they qualify – Wales or Northern Ireland, to stay open until 01:00 or 02:00.  The government had previously said the extended hours could only apply for the finals. The World Cup kicks off next June in the US, Canada and Mexico, which include time zones at least five hours behind the UK.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said fans will be able to enjoy another round as extra time will be given to games with a 22:00 kick-off.\"With later kick-offs at this year's World Cup, we don't want to blow the final whistle before the winning goal,\" she said. \"So we're showing red tape the red card and taking pub hours to extra time so fans can get another round in without missing a single kick.\"The home secretary has the legislative powers to extend pub opening hours on occasions of \"exceptional international, national or local significance\".The decision follows a six-week public consultation, launched by the government, on extending pub licensing hours to allow fans to come together and support teams. The British Beer and Pub Association told The Sun the latest announcement was \"a win for pubs, jobs and community spirit\".England and Scotland have already qualified for the competition running from 11 June to 19 July. Meanwhile, Wales and Northern Ireland have the chance of reaching the tournament when they compete in the play-offs, where a total of 16 teams will battle it out for four slots at the competition.So far, England has been drawn to play Croatia, Ghana and Panama in Group L, and Scotland will play Brazil, Morocco and Haiti. Scotland's men are playing at the World Cup for the first time since 1998.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlex TaylorBBC News reporterGetty ImagesIt's a heated debate in many households - is there a right way stack to the dishwasher?It turns out some of us may be doing it wrong so here are five rules to ensure gleaming dishes - and an end to the dishwasher debate.1. Don't pre-rinseGetty ImagesIf you're rinsing your plates before putting them in the dishwasher you're doing it wrong, says Andrew Laughlin, principal researcher at consumer group Which?Modern dishwashers use a turbidity sensor to detect how dirty the water, and therefore the dish, is. If you rinse everything beforehand, the machine thinks the items are clean and lowers its temperature and intensity, reducing its efficiency.\"Instead, it's far better to scrape leftovers into your food waste bin and regularly clean the dishwasher filter,\" says Andrew.Lynsey Crombie, author of The 15 Minute Clean, agrees: \"Modern dishwashers are built to detect dirt so if your plates are too clean going in, they can actually wash less effectively,\" she says.\"Remove leftover food into the bin, but don't stand there pre-washing. You're wasting water and time.\"2. Stack correctlyGetty ImagesAndrew's rule for stacking the dishwasher is - if you eat from it, put it in the lower rack, if you drink from it, place it in the upper rack.Positioning dirty surfaces towards the jets is important too. \"Face everything towards the centre of the machine for the best performance,\" he says.Lastly, make sure no items are touching so that the water can flow and wash effectively.Lynsey says you should angle bowls downwards so they don't collect water and mix up your cutlery so spoons don't nest together.But the biggest mistake many of us make is overloading the dishwasher, she says.\"If water can't circulate properly, nothing will come out clean no matter how expensive your tablet is.\"3. Place the dirtiest items in the centreGetty ImagesThere's nothing more frustrating than loading the dishwasher, only to find some things aren't clean when the cycle is finished.Andrew says the \"worst offenders\" include cereal, scrambled eggs, or starchy food with protein-heavy residues. To fix this, he recommends putting the really dirty items in the middle, where the spray intensity is highest.This will make the wash more efficient and save you time and money by avoiding putting the same things back in again for another wash.4. Use tablets and saltGetty ImagesDishwashers need a helping hand to reach their peak performance.Andrew says it's \"absolutely\" vital to use tablets as these help to break down the dirt and the food waste and start the cleaning process. They contain enzymes to break down proteins and starches, and surfactants so water spreads and cleans better.Special dishwasher salt, meanwhile, helps to \"soften the water preventing lime scale build up and those horrid white marks on glasses.\" Lynsey says even if your tablet says \"all-in-one\", she still recommends topping up salt \"because it protects the machine long-term\".\"Think of it as maintenance, not an extra,\" she says.Rinse aid dispensers are also worth considering, explains Andrew. These \"disperse the water on the surface of the dishes, helping them to dry at the end of the cycle and to run efficiently.\"5. Avoid certain itemsGetty ImagesIt's equally important to remember what to keep out of your dishwasher, adds Andrew.Non-stick cookware, sharp knives, and wooden items should stay out.\"High temperatures and water pressure could damage them,\" he says.Lynsey says you should avoid anything with adhesive labels as these can clog the filter.But what about whose turn it is to empty the dishwasher?

    "body": "5 hours agoThe Daily Telegraph leads with Donald Trump's change in stance after a fresh attack on the Chagos Islands deal. The US President has demanded Sir Keir \"not give away\" Diego Garcia to Mauritius and added the military base was crucial for possible airstrikes on Iran, the paper reports. Trump accusing Sir Keir of surrendering to \"wokeism\" is the focus of the Times, as the president pulls US support from the Chagos Islands deal. It is the latest in a series of reversals from Trump, who \"appeared to give his blessing\" to the deal only weeks ago. The US State Department had also given its support on Tuesday.Former military leaders and ex-ministers have warned Britain faces a \"1936 moment\" and that Sir Keir must commit to \"doubling defence spending\", the Daily Mail reports. It describes the intervention by the group as \"unprecedented\" - with a demand that defence spending increase to 5% of GDP. The Financial Times leads with the expected early departure of the European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. According to someone familiar with Lagarde's thinking, Europe's top central banker wants to leave her eight-year term as president \"before the French presidential election in April next year\". Epstein \"trafficking\" allegations are the focus of the i Paper, as Surrey Police urge people to come forward with any information. The paper says Met Police are looking into \"Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's former bodyguards\" and what they \"may have witnessed while protecting him during his friendship with the convicted paedophile\". The former prince has always strenuously denied any offence.Tony Martin, the farmer who shot dead a teenager intruder at his home in 1999, has left his entire \"£2.5m fortune\" to a \"pub landlady, the Daily Mirror says. Martin, who died aged 80 last year, has gifted his estate to \"pal Jacqui Wadsley, 52, who ran his local\" pub and \"helped him after his release from prison\", the paper says. In an exclusive, a grooming gang survivor has told the Daily Express her request to meet with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been ignored. Ellie Reynolds, 25, has accused the PM \"for breaking trust and allegedly ignoring their claims of 'corruption'\" over the UK's grooming gangs inquiry, which is expected to begin later in the year. A Home Office spokesperson has previously said the inquiry would have \"full powers to compel evidence and hold local investigations\".The government could block tech giants from the UK if \"revenge porn\" and deepfake sexual abuse images are not deleted from the internet within 48 hours, the Guardian reports. Sir Keir has said the government must confront this \"national emergency\". The Metro features a drill rapper on the run who managed to escape custody twice in a week and released a rap video apparently teasing police online. Daniel Boakye, 21, who goes by the rap name DSAVV, escaped Lewisham Hospital in south-east London on Sunday after being taken there for medical treatment. The rapper had been jailed for six years in 2023 \"for stealing phones at knifepoint to get passcodes\".  The song posted online features the lyrics: \"I just broke out of jail.\" A top think tank has called on Rachel Reeves to stop the \"dysfunctional\" policymaking causing Britain's economy to weaken, the Independent reports. The Institute for Fiscal Studies drew comparisons to Reeves' \"self-imposed rules on debt\" to a driver only focused on the speedometer \"while ignoring ... whether or not the brakes are working\", the paper says. The Daily Star's lead headline \"If you could turn Beck time?\" concerns Brooklyn Beckham removing a tattoo tribute to his father, David. The paper claims the former football star's son has kept a \"£220k watch ... his dad bought him for his 21st\". And pubs across the UK are celebrating an \"extra-time victory\" after minister agree to allow them to \"stay open until 01:00 or 02:00 for any home nation matches beyond the group stages\" for World Cup games this summer, the Sun reports.

    "body": "Cornish village expected to be confirmed to have had 50 days of rainByMatt TaylorLead Weather PresenterFor the small Cornish village of Cardinham the rain so far this year really has been relentless.The Met Office is expected to confirm later that it has officially rained there every day for the last fifty days.The last dry day residents experienced was 30 December 2025. They have already received more than their normal rainfall for February.The one ray of light? This is still well short of the previous longest wet spell in Cardinham of seventy two days recorded in 2000.Elsewhere in the UK, the persistent rain over recent weeks has resulted in ongoing flooding with no significant let up expected until the middle of next month at the earliest.Few have escaped the near relentless rainThe wet conditions haven't just been confined to Cardinham. Exeter, Liscombe, Camborne and Okehampton all in the south-west have experienced between 43 and 49 days of continuous rain. Katesbridge, in Northern Ireland has now clocked up 40 days of wet weather, already seeing over two and a half times its February average rainfall. At Ryhill, West Yorkshire it had rained every day for the previous 36, prior to Wednesday.Northern Ireland experienced its wettest January in 149 years, and at Aboyne in Aberdeenshire over half the average rainfall for the entire year has already been recorded.Image caption, A wet walk through woods in Cardinham Why has it been so wet?The main reason for the relentlessness of the rain is linked to a \"stuck\" weather pattern that developed across Europe shortly after the New Year.A large area of high pressure became established across northern and eastern parts of the continent, with cold air become strongly established underneath it. At the same time surges of Arctic air in the USA and Canada helped to fire up a strong Atlantic jet stream that directed rain-bearing areas of low pressure towards western Europe. The area of high pressure stopped the progress of the lows, meaning the same areas - namely the UK, Spain and Portugal - have been hit again and again by spells of wet weather.However, this blocked system has meant that some areas of the UK have escaped the worst of the rain. Parts of north-west England and western Scotland have been experiencing 'below-average' rainfall, with some of the Highlands having experienced a stretch of nearly three weeks without seeing any rain.This soggy start to the year reflects long-term trends that show winters in the UK are getting warmer and wetter due to climate change.A warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture meaning that when rain comes it is likely to be heavier and more intense.When will it stop raining?This weekend some parts of the UK may experience their first burst of spring 'warmth', with temperatures of 15 or 16C possible in a few spots. However, it doesn't mean that sunshine and dry weather is back.Rain will still feature across the UK during the weekend despite south-westerly winds dragging in milder conditions.The Met Office have said that there is no sign of prolonged dry weather until the middle of March at the very least, with our weather remaining very \"changeable\".Despite this, the blocked weather pattern that has been the reason for all our problems so far this year has finally changed. It means that low pressure systems will sit in different areas and also progress across the UK more than they have done. The result will be a different distribution of rainfall across the country, with some western hills likely to experience the wetter conditions. There should also be a few more drier and brighter days, but with rivers still very high and the ground saturated in large parts of the country any further rain could still bring the risk of more flooding.After the unusually dry conditions through a large part of 2025, and the resulting drought in a number of areas, the turn around to flood has been fairly rapid.",

I'm not sure about the iguanas, where are we going with that one?\" she said during her cross to the breakfast television show Today on Wednesday, apparently in response to comments from the studio hosts.With glazed eyes she then stumbled through the rest of her sports report, mixing up her words as well as the UK and the US, while studio host Karl Stefanovic could be heard laughing in the background.\"Look the cold weather is a thing, right,\" Stevanovic said unprompted afterwards. \"You can't actually move your lips.\"Social media clips of her report prompted mixed reactions from Australians. \"Good on her, nothing wrong with this. You can tell she's having an absolute ball over there,\" said one person on X, while another commented: \"If it's not a health issue, she should be sacked on the spot - very unprofessional.\"Mason, a prominent sports reporter best known for her National Rugby League coverage, appeared again on the Today show on Thursday morning.After she delivered her live report, she told viewers she wanted to \"take a moment, if that's OK, just to apologise\" for her previous appearance.She thanked viewers for messages of concern and continued: \"I'm OK, probably just a little embarrassed. \"Look, I totally misjudged the situation, I shouldn't have had a drink, especially in these conditions, it's cold, we've got altitude, and not having had dinner probably didn't help as well. But I want to take full responsibility, it's not the standard I set myself.\"So in saying that, I'm genuinely really sorry and I'm thanking everyone for those messages I've received as well.\"The Today show host Jenny Azzopardi responded saying \"we know how hard you work, Danika\" while Stefanovic called her a \"legend\".Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday he was was \"pro-Danika\".\"Good on her. She's over in Italy and she would have been tired,\" he said adding: \"It's the time difference, it would have been having an impact. Nothing to see here.\"",

    "body": "Do not give away Diego Garcia, Trump tells UK in fresh attack on Chagos deal7 hours agoJaroslav LukivGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos deal\"Do not give away Diego Garcia,\" US President Donald Trump has said as he criticised the UK's plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back an important military base.Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media. In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was \"crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe\".\"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,\" it said in a statement.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia... in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.\"When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies.\"Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands dealIn a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said Trump's latest comments was \"an utter humiliation\" for Starmer.\"It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether,\" she said.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump's latest change in position showed that the UK needed to pursue closer ties with Europe.\"Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail,\" Davey wrote in a post on X.\"Britain can't rely on the US while Trump is in the White House. It's time to strengthen our ties with allies we can depend on, starting with our neighbours in Europe.\"In response to the US president's latest post, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage - an outspoken critic of the UK handover plan - praised Trump's criticism of London's handling of the issue.\"Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history,\" he wrote on X. \"President Trump is right to say the Prime Minister is making a big mistake. Starmer must cancel this deal.\"Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBranwen JeffreysEducation EditorPALeaked details suggest special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) support is facing its biggest shake-up in a generation, potentially provoking a political backlash.The reforms will be a complete system redesign, with children with Education Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) to be reassessed as they move from primary up to secondary school from 2029.The BBC understands this will sit alongside an extension of legal rights to include all children with SEND through school-led Individual Support Plans (ISP).Paul Whiteman, the General Secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, told the BBC \"the current system fails children and fails schools\".The radical plans could be unveiled in full as early as Monday, when MPs return to parliament, and there is likely to be dismay at a leak during recess and half term.In England, there are around 482,000 school children with ECHPs, which set out in detail their individual legal rights to support.Once those up to the age of 25 and those not in school are taken into account the full number of people with an EHCP in England rises to almost 639,000.Many parents seek to get an EHCP in place before the end of primary school, often after a lengthy and frustrating process involving going to tribunals to challenge local authorities.Parents often pay for their own assessments and legal costs, and there has been a marked increase in those seeking an EHCP in the last year as anxiety about reforms has grown.Under the new system, the BBC understands children moving through each phase of education, so from primary to secondary, then potentially from secondary to college will be moved to the new system.This means they will be reassessed.As the government seeks to control rapidly rising costs, this will mean a smaller proportion retain these plans which involve health and social care as well as education needs.Every child with identified special educational needs, including those who do not currently have an EHCP, will have an ISP drawn up by the school, which will have some kind of legal status.This could involve a further 1.28 million children being given a promise of support although the exact nature of the legal rights attached to an ISP are not yet clear.It's understood there will be more emphasis on outcomes for children alongside the support they can expect.The government is likely to argue this will mean more children get access to earlier support without a lengthy assessment process, potentially reducing the need for more intensive support later.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has also signalled there needed to be a clearer set of criteria for when children access which level of support.On the basis of initial details leaked, three layers of support are expected. They will be labelled Targeted, Targeted Plus and Specialist to reflect different needs.While every child with SEND will have an ISP drawn up by their school, some will have more complex plans, which will meet national standards called Specialist Provision Packages.These will be determined by an expert panel. An EHCP will guarantee legal rights to education as set out in these national packages, which suggests they will ultimately be reserved for children with the most complex needs.In meetings with parents over recent months, ministers have reaffirmed their intention to push for more children's SEND needs to be met in mainstream schools.More training for teachers has been promised alongside an ambition for an inclusion unit in every secondary school.Whiteman said the the National Association of Headteachers was looking forward to seeing the full details of the proposals, and the \"devil would be in the detail\" of how the changes were funded and managed. He added that as they currently understood them, the government's plans \"have the potential to ensure that children get the education they deserve\" and might lift some of the pressure from schools and families. One element of the rising costs for SEND provision has been the increased used of the independent sector to provide specialist school places.Earlier the New Statesman political magazine reported the government will also impose a price cap on what they can charge as part of these wider reforms, which is likely to be set at £60,000 a year.The government has already announced it will take SEND spending into central government after 2028.The leaked details do not make clear how the government plans to plug a financial shortfall which the Office for Budget Responsibility says will be around £6bn by that point, and is forecast to increase without significant change.These changes may face stiff resistance from SEND campaign groups worried they represent a watering down of legal rights for children.As with any complex plans it is hard to assess the full implications until the details are published and laid before Parliament.The plans come at a time when the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's own political capital with Labour MPs has been weakened, raising the prospect of back bench rebellions if their post bags are flooded with letters of protest.A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Our Schools White Paper will be an expansion of children's rights – transforming children's lives for the better and ending the one-size-fits-all school system that has held too many children back from the outcomes they deserve.\"It's about creating a better system for all families, where support is needs-led, embedded in every community and wrapped around children at the earliest stage so they can thrive at a school closer to home.The spokesperson added that the full plans would be released \"shortly\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoDanielle KayeandOsmond ChiaDepopDepop, the second-hand clothing app that has skyrocketed in popularity among Gen Z shoppers, is being sold to eBay for $1.2bn (£890m).Etsy, the online platform, is offloading Depop just five years after it bought the business - which was founded in the UK - for $1.6bn.eBay is hoping that the deal will help the online auction firm, which is more than 30 years-old, \"reach a younger demographic across the expanding re-commerce landscape\".Apps that allow people to buy and sell used or \"pre-loved\" garments and footwear have grown in use in recent years as young consumers seek sustainable, low-cost alternatives to traditional retailers.The all-cash deal is expected to be completed by the middle of this year and will see  Depop retain its name and branding.It will help boost eBay's used clothes sales, which is one of eBay's \"fastest-growing\" categories, said chief executive officer Jamie Ianonne.The announcement came as eBay published its 2025 financial results which showed revenues rose to $11.1bn, up 8% compared to a year earlier.Etsy's share price rose more than 15% in after-hours trading, while eBay's was rose by almost 6.5%.According to Etsy, nearly 90% of Depop's seven million active buyers are under the age of 34.The second-hand fashion platform also has more than three million active sellers.Depop has become \"one of the fastest-growing fashion resale marketplaces in the US\", said Kruti Patel Goyal, chief executive of Etsy. \"I am confident that Depop is well-positioned for its next phase of growth as part of eBay,\" she added.Etsy bought Depop in 2021 as part of a series of major purchases as it tried to compete with online retail giants like Amazon.But Etsy has since pulled back from many of those deals.In 2023, it sold of Elo7 - often referred to as Brazil's version of Etsy - at a loss after paying $217m for it two years earlier.Last year, Etsy said it would sell Reverb, a music equipment resale site that it bought in 2019, in order to prioritise its core business.The Etsy platform, known for its focus on handcrafted and niche goods, thrived during the Covid-19 pandemic as more people shopped online.But the firm has struggled in recent years, faced with shrinking demand and tough competition in the crafts market.Chinese giants like Temu and Shein, which offer cheaper goods and fast delivery, have become increasingly popular.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: Eight of the nine missing skiers located deceased, officials sayRescue teams combing through the backcountry of California's Lake Tahoe region say they have found the bodies of eight skiers who went missing in an avalanche on Tuesday.The search for a final missing skier continues but that person is presumed dead, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.Officials said one of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts \"challenging emotionally\". Fifteen skiers were reported missing on Tuesday after a \"football-field\" sized avalanche came barrelling down in the Castle Peak area around 11:30 local time (19:30 GMT). Six have been rescued.Watch: California hit by heavy snow as avalanche leaves skiers missing\"I want to offer my condolences to the family in this very trying time,\" Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said on Wednesday.The bodies of the eight dead skiers are still trapped in the snow and can't yet be recovered due to \"pretty horrific\" conditions, officials said.Since the avalanche, another 3ft (90cm) of snow has fallen on the area, Tahoe National Forest supervisor Chris Feutrier said.\"The hazard remains high,\" he said.Once the bodies are recovered, they will be transported to the Placer County morgue.Families of the deceased have been notified. Authorities have not yet released any of their names.Officials say the victims are seven women and two men.Sheriff Woo said the rescue operation was a joint effort involving two teams and roughly 50 crew members who had to traverse \"extreme weather conditions\" using specialised equipment.At 17:30 local time on Tuesday, search teams arrived to an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and \"could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche\", Sheriff Moon said. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tour. The entire ski group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.The avalanche on Tuesday occurred as they were making their way back at the end of a three-day trip. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that state authorities were \"co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort\" with local emergency teams.Conditions on Wednesday remained dangerous, multiple officials said, with Woo describing the climate as \"treacherous\".\"Avoid the backcountry,\" he said. \"Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home.\" The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a destructive potential scale of D1 to D5, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center, which would mean it was over half a mile in length and would have a deposit of around 6.5ft. The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported over 30in of snowfall since Tuesday.The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.",

    "body": "Reeves' borrowing rules 'need a rethink', claims IFS2 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterPA MediaChancellor Rachel ReevesChancellor Rachel Reeves is \"fixated\" on borrowing rules which are contributing to \"dysfunctional policymaking\", according to a leading think tank.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the UK's approach \"needs a rethink\" to move away from constraints that \"require some measure of borrowing or debt to be below a particular threshold in a specified year\".Like other chancellors, Reeves set her so-called fiscal rules when Labour came to power, which determine how much \"headroom\" the government has for its tax and spending plans.The Treasury said: \"The government's non-negotiable fiscal rules help to keep interest rates low while also prioritising investment to support long-term growth.\"But Ben Zaranko, associate director at IFS, said the current framework was judging economic sustainability by a system that is \"boiled down to to a single number\". In the Autumn Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that the amount of headroom the government has against its borrowing rules will be £22bn in five years' time. This was more than earlier forecasts of £9.9bn.But research from the IFS, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, suggests that instead of \"pass–fail fiscal rules\", the UK \"would be better served by a new framework based around a set of 'fiscal traffic lights'\".These would be used to monitor performance against high-level objectives and principles set out at the start of each parliament.Zaranko said: \"Moving to a broader set of fiscal indicators, assessed according to a traffic light system, would provide a better picture of the government's overall fiscal position, and reduce the incentive for governments to contort policy in pursuit of a particular 'headroom' number.\"The IFS report said that the current framework is not delivering sustainable public finances and aggressive \"gaming\" of rolling targets and frequent changes to the rules have undermined their credibility.IFS director Helen Miller urged a debate on public finances sooner rather than later, ahead of the next general election, because the current fiscal framework \"isn't delivering\". \"A broad traffic light assessment of the public finances would make governments' multiple objectives – and the associated trade-offs faced – much more transparent and explicit,\" she said.The Treasury said: \"In the Budget, we doubled the fiscal headroom, and we are cutting borrowing more than any other G7 country with borrowing forecast to be the lowest in six years as share of GDP.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesThe White House has warned Iran would be \"very wise\" to make a deal with the US, amid reports that President Donald Trump is weighing fresh military action against the Islamic Republic.Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing that Trump was still hoping for a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear programme. Her comments come as the US moves a second battleship into the region, and one day after progress was reported at US-Iran talks in Switzerland.US media reported on Wednesday that Trump had discussed attack options with advisers, and that a US strike could take place as early as Saturday. Last summer the US military conducted strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.The BBC's US partner CBS reports that top national security officials had told Trump the military was ready for potential strikes on Iran as soon as Saturday.Trump had not yet made a final decision about whether to attack and the conversations were described as fluid and ongoing, sources told the network.Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday there were \"many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran\".She referred to US strikes in June, adding: \"Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration.\" Her remarks came a day after Iran and the US said they had made headway in talks taking place in Geneva about Tehran's nuclear programme.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Asked about the Geneva negotiations, the White House press secretary said that Washington and Tehran were still \"far apart\" on some key issues.\"I think you heard from the administration and the state department yesterday that there was a little bit of progress made, but we're still very far apart on some issues,\" Leavitt said. \"I believe the Iranians are expected to come back to us with some more detail in the next couple of weeks, and so the president will continue to watch how this plays out.\"Leavitt declined to say whether Israel would be involved in the US decision.The US has been ramping up its military presence in the waters near Iran, and as satellite images show the Islamic Republic fortifying sensitive military sites.BBC Verify has confirmed the location of US aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln - equipped with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets - near Iran.The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East, expected to arrive in the region within the next three weeks.All US military forces deployed to the region were expected to be in place by mid-March, a US official and a senior military official told CBS.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted on X on Tuesday an AI-generated image of the Ford at the bottom of the ocean.\"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" Khamenei's post said.\"However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.\"Khamenei also accused the US of attempting to predetermine the outcome of negotiations and said that would be a \"wrong and foolish thing to do\".Iran has responded to the US build-up with its own show of force. On Monday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran.The Strait is considered a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states.",

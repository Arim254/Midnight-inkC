    "body": "Media caption, Highlights: Dundee United 2-1 CelticByBBC Scotland's chief sports writerAt this point, it's not just Wilfried Nancy's Celtic team that's a hard watch, it's Nancy himself. So many explanations and justifications, so many verbal contortions as he attempts to talk through his latest defeat. It's become painful, quickly.\"I think I am in a good direction with the players,\" he said after his fourth defeat in a row in his new job, a 2-1 loss at struggling Dundee United. \"Today you saw we had a good performance,\" he stated. \"We are improving,\" he insisted. \"We were close to winning... keep the faith.\"All around him now there are football atheists. There really can't be many believers left. As Nancy spoke, it was hard to avoid wincing and wincing and wincing again. As he made his way through his post-match assessment, the temptation was to shout, 'Stop... stop talking... stop explaining because when you're explaining, you're losing, again'.The bottom line in all of this is that between his nightmarish beginning with Celtic and his low-key ending with Columbus Crew, Nancy has won just three of his past 16 games as a manager. The defeats by United, St Mirren, Roma and Hearts now joined the ones that went before in America - Cincinnati (twice), Chicago Fire, New York City and New England Revolution.Nancy finished seventh in the regular season in MLS, won 14 of 34 games, ranking joint sixth in the league for goals scored and eighth for goals conceded. After being manager of the season the year before, it was all very blah. His credentials for the Celtic job were, at best, thin, despite the excited rhetoric of some observers in America, who painted him as a special one and his capture as a coup.Is Nancy already doomed? And who's to blame?Media caption, 'Keep the faith' urges Nancy after fourth defeatThere are questions here. Many of them. Is he already doomed? If not, how long has he got? Celtic host Aberdeen on Sunday. Can he survive if he loses again? How many is too many? Five? Six? Seven?And, given his humdrum season with Columbus Crew, how did Nancy get this job in the first place? Arguably, that's the biggest question of all. He'd been a manager at Montreal and Columbus for a total of four years - then he's given the Celtic job?\"We have been aware of Wilfried and his quality of work for some time,\" said Michael Nicholson, Celtic's chief executive. \"He was our number one candidate when we began the process of appointing a new manager…\"What, exactly, was that process? Who else did Celtic talk to? How rigorous was their search? We don't know. The number one candidate?What we do know is that Nancy had Kwame Ampadu as his assistant in Columbus and that Ampadu and Celtic's director of football operations, Paul Tisdale, worked together at Exeter City more than a dozen years ago.On the back of a CV that shows spells at Bath, Exeter, MK Dons, Bristol Rovers, Colchester United and Stevenage, Tisdale has become a very significant figure at Celtic, one of the most influential characters in the place. How? Again, we're in the dark. Tisdale does not do interviews so there has been no chance to ask him anything.If he suggested to the Celtic board that Nancy was their man, on what basis did he form that conclusion? 'In three months, it's gone belly-up at Celtic, which is incredible' Scottish Football Podcast18/12/25How thoroughly were Nancy's credentials interrogated? From this remove - four games played, four games lost, three goals scored and 10 goals conceded - not thoroughly enough.From there to here was always going to be a mighty leap for Nancy, but nobody knew it was going to be Grand Canyonesque in a footballing sense.It's understandable that sections of the fans have turned on him - he seems like a good man in the wrong movie, which makes this crash in slow motion all the harder to observe - but what of the people who appointed him? What of Tisdale? He is as much to blame for the sorry mess that Celtic are in as Nancy is. More so, even. Tisdale has powerful sway over the recruitment work that Celtic do and yet, in the main, he escapes the heat of the fans who have been fixated on principal shareholder Dermot Desmond and members of the board. One of that board is leaving soon, of course. Peter Lawwell, a titan of the club for two decades, will depart at the end of the year, citing abuse and threats from a sinister element in the support that have impacted his family.Lawwell is a big enough operator to take stick on the chin, as he has done for years. When his family are drawn into it then it's another matter entirely. Celtic are in a dark place right now. Instead of more threats from zealots and incendiary statements from members of the Desmond family, it needs some healing, some understanding and some class. It needs dignity to break out where now there's just dysfunction. On the pitch and off Wednesday was a grim day for the club.'Incredible not to pick O'Neill's brain'Nancy must be wondering what the hell he's walked into and it's not hard to have some sympathy for him. He asked for context in the aftermath of Tannadice and, in his defence, there is some. Not a lot, but a little.It wasn't Nancy's fault that Johnny Kenny missed an easy chance or that Daizen Maeda spurned a sitter. The blame for having the inexperienced Kenny leading the Celtic line is not on Nancy. It lies with others way above him - the ones who orchestrated the club's slapstick transfer window in the summer.The new manager is missing key players in Alistair Johnston, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Jota, but there is no evidence that he would get the best out of them even if they weren't injured. He hasn't got the best out of the players he's had in four games now. Nothing like it. Amid a fog of tactical and selectorial confusion most of them have gone backwards.Once again, Celtic faded when it became a fight in that second half at Tannadice. Once again, an opponent spotted weakness and exploited it. Once again, Nancy was out-coached.Nancy talks about performance in the manner of a man who has time. He doesn't. The one unalienable truth about his job is that winning is everything, no matter how it happens. Martin O'Neill would have spelled that out to him had Nancy spent more than 15 minutes picking the brains of a guy who knows Celtic's past and Celtic's present better than anybody.It sounds like Nancy passed on the opportunity to mine the interim manager for information, which is incredible given he's a man at a new club in a new league in a new continent. For how much longer, it's hard to tell. Logic would say that Nancy is already on borrowed time, but logic doesn't seem to be pervasive at the club at the moment.Strange things are happening on the pitch and off. And at the weekend, Aberdeen are coming, sniffing points and smelling blood. There is no fear factor now. For the rest, against the diminished champions, opportunity knocks.Get in touchSend us your views on Celtic",

    "body": "Canada's population dropped by 76,068 between July and October - a contraction  driven mainly by limits on immigration, the federal statistics agency has said. The decrease was due mainly to a drop in non-permanent residents, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday, and comes after Ottawa set a goal to restrict temporary residents to 5% of the 41.6 million population by 2027. It's a sharp change from 2022, when the population grew by more than a million people for the first time, fuelled in part by efforts to recruit immigrants to ease labour shortages.\"We needed to bring our immigration level to a more sustainable level,\" Canada's finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, told reporters. Champagne, speaking from Berlin during a visit to Europe, said the government's goal is to \"take back control over our immigration system and find a better balance between our capacity to welcome people and the number of people who want to come to the country\". The population drop is the  \"sharpest, and only second, quarter-over-quarter decline on record dating back to the 1940s\", said Bank of Montreal senior economist Robert Kavcic in an analysis.\"A major population adjustment is well underway, and it remains one of the biggest economic stories in Canada,\" he added. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made efforts to attract more immigrants to the country, including a plan to welcome half a million immigrants a year by 2025.By 2023, the vast majority of Canada's population growth - about 97% - was driven by immigration, according to federal data.But the increase in newcomers was blamed for putting pressure on the cost of housing, stress on social services and youth unemployment rates.Trudeau last year announced a sharp cut in the number of immigrants Canada allows into the country in an effort to pause population growth, saying his  government \"didn't get the balance quite right\" when it boosted immigration post-pandemic to address labour shortages.Prime Minister Mark Carney has continued in that vein, with Ottawa seeking to significantly cut targets for new temporary residents from 673,650 to 385,000 next year, and 370,000 in 2027 and 2028. According to Statistics Canada's preliminary numbers released on Wednesday, the country's population shrank by 0.2% in the third quarter of 2025 - the first decline since the Covid pandemic in 2020.It was driven by a drop of non-permanent residents - primarily international students as well as temporary foreign workers - in the third quarter of 2025, the largest seen since comparable records began in 1971. In October there were more than 2.8 million non-permanent residents in Canada, about 6.8% of the total population.The provinces of Ontario and British Columbia saw the biggest drops in population. Only Alberta and the territory of Nunavut saw their populations grow. ",

    "body": "1 hour agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentPA MediaDiane Abbott is among those warning the prime minister Nearly 40 Labour MPs have warned the prime minister they are not prepared to support proposals to limit jury trials.In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, the MPs, largely but not wholly from the left of the party, say the plans are \"not a silver bullet\" to reducing the backlog in trials.\"To limit a fundamental right for what will make a marginal difference to the backlog, if any, is madness and will cause more problems than it solves,\" they write.Sir Keir has previously answered concerns from MPs about the plans by telling them that jury trials already make up only a small proportion of trials in the criminal courts system.In the Commons last week, he told Karl Turner - who organised the letter - that \"juries will remain a cornerstone of our justice system for the most serious cases\".The 39 MPs include prominent figures such as Diane Abbott, former whip and leading member of the Tribune group of Labour Vicky Foxcroft and Dan Carden, who leads the Blue Labour group of backbenchers.They suggest a number of other ways to reduce the courts backlog, including increasing sitting days, hiring more barristers as part-time judges called Recorders and asking the Crown Prosecution Service to consider bringing some cases in the backlog on a lower charge.The Justice Secretary, David Lammy, announced the measure on 3 December. It scraps jury trials in England and Wales for crimes that carry a likely sentence of less than three years, removing the right for defendants to ask for a jury trial where a case can be dealt with by either magistrates or a new form of judge-only Crown Court.The measure came after retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Brian Leveson was asked by the Lord Chancellor to come up with a series of proposals to reduce the backlog in the courts.The process started in December 2024. In July of this year, Sir Brian said \"fundamental\" reforms were needed to \"reduce the risk of total system collapse\". His proposals also included more out-of-court settlements like cautions.Announcing the jury trial measure, Lammy said it was necessary as current projections have Crown Court case loads reaching 100,000 by 2028, from the current backlog of almost 78,000.This means that a suspect being charged with an offence today may not reach trial until 2030. Among the impacts of this are that six out of 10 victims of rape are said to be withdrawing from prosecutions because of delays.",

Temperatures for many parts of the UK may be a degree or two below the average for this time of year, hitting the 6-9C mark.The drop will be a result of an influx of cold air from eastern Europe.And if there are some small changes to that, there is a slight chance that even colder air from Scandinavia might come this way, and the possibility that any showers falling in eastern areas might turn to sleet or even snow.Why is is going to feel so cold?The change in fortunes is down to a high pressure system which is going to build close to the north of the UK and a low pressure one forming around France or Spain. Although they will not be directly over the UK, the precise position of the centres of these highs and lows will determine the direction of the wind. In turn, that will influence how cold the air will be and therefore the chances of snow falling.Image caption,  A change in wind direction will bring colder weather just in time for Christmas As well as becoming much colder generally in time for Christmas it will probably be quite cloudy with showers developing over the North Sea and affecting eastern areas. The best of any sunshine would be in the north and west but there will be also be a risk of some morning frost and fog. Could it be a white Christmas?Currently the forecast is for east-southeasterly winds but there is a very small chance that we get east-northeasterlies instead.This small change in wind direction could then pull in much colder air from Scandinavia resulting in showers over eastern areas that could turn to sleet or snow in places. Although a white Christmas is still unlikely for most of us, it can't completely be ruled out just yet. Either way, very wet weather is off the Christmas menu this year. This spell of quieter spell of weather will be very much welcomed in areas which have recently seen heavy rain such as Cumbria and south Wales.Our experience of Christmas past should tell us that it's rare to see snow actually fall on Christmas day - and getting rarer.",

    "body": "4 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterReutersBP has appointed a new chief executive, making Meg O'Neill the first woman to run a major global oil firm.The London-based energy giant said its current boss Murray Auchincloss would step down less than two years after he replaced Bernard Looney, who was found to have committed \"serious misconduct\" in failing to disclose relationships with colleagues.BP executive vice president Carol Howle will serve as interim chief executive until Ms O'Neill, who has led Australian energy firm Woodside Energy since 2021, takes up her new role on 1 April.Ms O'Neill said she looks forward to helping BP \"do our part to meet the world's energy needs\".Mr Auchincloss, who took over from Mr Looney in September 2024, said he had told BP's chairman in September that he was open to stepping down \"were an appropriate leader identified\".\"I am confident that BP is now well positioned for significant growth and I look forward to watching the company's future progress,\" he said after Ms O'Neill's appointment was announced. He will serve in an advisory role until December 2026.Ms O'Neill said she would prioritise re-establishing the oil giant's market leadership, as well as advancing safety and driving innovation and sustainability.BP praised Ms O'Neill's time as chief executive of Woodside Energy, pointing to the firm's takeover of BHP Petroleum International in 2022.It said she had grown the business into the largest energy company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.Before joining Woodside, Ms O'Neill spent 23 years in technical, operational and leadership positions at Texas-based energy firm ExxonMobil.Mr Looney was dismissed without notice, and forfeited up to £32.4m ($43.3m) in salary and benefits, after admitting that he was not \"fully transparent\" about his past personal relationships.BP's board said they had been \"knowingly misled\" by Mr Looney.At the time, Mr Looney said in a statement that he was \"disappointed with the way this situation has been handled\".Ms O'Neill's appointment comes as BP is cutting its renewable energy investments and instead focusing on increasing oil and gas production.In February, the energy giant said it would shift its strategy following pressure from some investors who were frustrated that its profits and share price had lagged behind rivals.Rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's call to \"drill baby drill\" has encouraged firms to invest in fossil fuels.",

    "body": "2 hours agoHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to unveil the agenda for the next phase of his government in the immediate aftermath of May's crucial elections.The King's Speech has been pencilled in for May 12 or 13 next year, the BBC has been told, just days after elections across Britain on 7 May.The elections in May cover the Scottish parliament and the Welsh Senedd as well as thousands of council seats in England and a handful of directly elected mayoralties.Labour is braced for a bad night at the polls, which many Labour MPs believe could precipitate a challenge to Sir Keir's leadership.One government source told the BBC: \"It will be much harder for somebody to challenge the PM and say we need to go in a different direction when the King is about to come to parliament to announce what we're doing for the next year.\"Others dispute that there is any connection between the threat to Sir Keir's leadership and the date selected for the King's Speech, pointing out that in some recent years - most recently 2022 - the speech has taken place in May, when local elections are always held. The speech also took place very soon after local elections in 2021 and in 2016.The King's Speech is part of the state opening of Parliament, a ceremonial event marking the start of a parliamentary session, which typically lasts for a year but can run for much longer. The current session is on the long side, having begun after the general election in July 2024.The speech is written by the government but read by the Monarch from a throne in the House of Lords. It sets out the government's agenda for the coming session, specifying what pieces of legislation the government intends to pass.Cabinet ministers began the process of formally \"bidding\" for legislation they want to be included in the King's Speech around early October. Most ministers now know which bills Sir Keir wants to include in his post-May agenda, a source said.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThere is a mix of stories on the front pages of Thursday's papers. Leading the Metro, the prime minister says the UK will sue former Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich unless he gives victims of the war in Ukraine the £2.5bn he made from the sale of the club. The Russian billionaire pledged in 2022 to donate the funds to benefit victims of the war, but there has been a delay in releasing the money, which is currently frozen in a British bank account, due to a standoff over how exactly it should be used.\"Abramovich clings on to $2.5bn\" is the Times' take. The paper says the Russian billionaire believes he has \"a watertight legal case\" to ensure the funds from the sale of Chelsea Football Club are donated on his terms. Alongside, police are vowing to crack down on chants for intifada, an Arabic word for uprising, by pro-Palestinian supporters, saying they will \"act decisively\" over use of the slogan, the Times reports.The UK's deal to rejoin the EU student exchange programme, Erasmus, could cost more than £8bn, according to the Daily Telegraph. The paper says the ongoing membership is set to be a lot pricier than the government previously announced because of Brussels' plans to increase funding for the scheme from 2028. Elsewhere, the Matt cartoon eyes the doctors' strike in the week before Christmas, showing a nurse telling a patient: \"Only four more sleeps till you get a visit from a resident doctor.\" The Daily Mail also stays with the Erasmus deal, quoting critics of the PM who accuse him of \"throwing billions away\" on the scheme. Sir Keir's ministers defended the decision, saying it would \"provide priceless benefits\" to students hoping to study abroad.The Financial Times leads with the continued bidding war between Paramount and Netflix to acquire Warner Bros Discovery. The paper reports Warner Bro Discovery's board is urging shareholders to reject Paramount's $108bn offer, calling it \"inferior\" to the terms agreed with Netflix. In the top picture spot, panda diplomacy is \"bearing the brunt\" of the political rift between China and Japan. For the first time in more than half a century, a panda at the Toyko zoo due to be returned to China in January will not be replaced by a new furry resident, the paper says. The UK military has begun \"advanced preparations\" to send a peacekeeping force to Ukraine, the i Paper reports. Officials are hopeful that a peace deal is \"closer than ever\" and the Ministry of Defence has begun its \"notice to move\" process to deploy troops if called upon, the paper says.The Daily Express shifts its focus to the doctors' strike. The paper features Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch calling on the PM to \"show some backbone\" and ban doctors from striking. She also accuses the government of \"failing patients\" as the NHS struggles to cope with the walkouts, the paper says.The Guardian also marks the doctors' strike with their front page picture of resident doctors picketing outside St Thomas' hospital in London. Also prominent is the paper's story on Belgian politicians and senior finance executives being subject to a \"campaign of intimidation\" allegedly orchestrated by Russian intelligence.The Daily Mirror spotlights the news that scientists who helped find the first drug to fight Covid have now joined the search for treatment of the super flu that is bearing down on the NHS. The paper quotes one of the leaders of the Recovery trial as saying: \"We have got more treatments for Covid than flu.\"Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola's restaurant is shutting down, says the Sun. The team behind the venue blames the closure on \"exceptionally challenging\" trading conditions and increased costs, according to the paper.Finally, the Daily Star splashes with plans by German darts fans to take over the World Championships next year as the event moves to a bigger arena at Alexandra Palace. \"Herr we throw\" is the headline.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has asked a federal court to vacate or amend her 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.Maxwell, a former British socialite, claims that \"substantial new evidence\" has emerged from civil cases, investigative reports and other documents demonstrating that she did not receive a fair trial, according to a court filing in New York. The appeal follows several failed attempts from Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021, to try to reduce her prison sentence. It comes as the justice department faces a 19 December deadline to release files related to federal investigations into Epstein. Maxwell filed the petition pro se - without an attorney - on Wednesday. The Southern District of New York, where Maxwell made the request, declined to comment on the petition. Maxwell was convicted for her role in luring underage girls for her former boyfriend, the disgraced financier Epstein, to abuse. Epstein died in prison in 2019.In the new court filing, Maxwell argues that several new pieces of evidence mean that \"no reasonable juror would have convicted her\". In one example she cites, a juror supposedly hid a history of sexual abuse during the jury selection process that could have hurt their ability to be unbiased during her trial. Federal judges in New York and Florida recently cleared the way for grand jury material related to investigations into Maxwell and Epstein to be publicly released  so that the justice department can meet the deadline that Congress has set in the Epstein Transparency Act, passed last month. Maxwell was moved from a Florida prison to a new minimum-security facility in Texas in August, after she was interviewed by Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche about her ties to Epstein.She has appealed her case numerous times and lost. In October, the US Supreme Court said it would not hear an appeal from Maxwell. ",

    "body": "43 minutes agoBernd Debusmann Jr,Washington andAnthony Zurcher,North America correspondentUS President Donald Trump has announced a $1,776 (£1,329) \"warrior dividend\" payment to 1.45m US servicemembers - paid for, in part, by his tariffs.In a televised address to the nation on Wednesday night, Trump said that \"checks are already on the way\" and should arrive before Christmas.In the address, Trump touted his record on the economy and immigration, while at the same time railing against Democrats.With a forceful delivery, he seemed determined to convince Americans that the country was doing well - and things would only get better, including claiming that prices are falling, at a time when polls show that many Americans are unhappy about the cost of housing, childcare and healthcare.In the brief, 18-minute address, Trump said that the \"warrior dividend\", which totals to $2.57bn (£1.9bn) will be distributed \"in honour of our nation's founding in 1776\". Trump added that the funds were drawn from his sweeping tariffs, as well as the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" that he signed into law on 4 July. \"Nobody deserves it more than our military,\" he said. The president offered little new information in the speech, and some of his assertions were either exaggerated or unfounded. Much of Trump's speech focused on his economic record and the administration's efforts to bring down prices - which he blamed on former US President Joe Biden and the Democrats. Trump mentioned the former president seven times in the speech.\"Now, under our leadership, they [prices] are all coming down and coming down fast,\" he said. \"Democrat politicians also sent the cost of groceries soaring, but we are solving that too.\" While fuel and egg prices have indeed fallen, many other food items are more expensive. Economic data from September shows the US inflation rate hit 3% for the first time since January, while consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since April due to concerns over the cost of living, jobs and the wider economy.Trump has previously acknowledged that concerns over rising prices have contributed to a lacklustre Republican performance in the November elections, with the Democrats having success in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, as well as more recently in Miami and Georgia. He has also acknowledged that incumbent presidents and their parties often fare poorly in midterm elections, which will take place next year. The White House has since been wrestling with how to address voter concerns about the economy, while at the same time pushing back on repeated Democratic criticism over rising prices.The political dilemma faced by the Trump administration has been highlighted by recent polling. One poll, from Politico, showed that about half of overall voters - and 4 in 10 people who voted for Trump in 2024 - felt the cost of living was the worst it has been in their lives.Another poll released in November by CBS News/YouGov suggested that Trump's approval on economic issues has dropped 15 points since March, with 36% of Americans approving his handling of the issue. More broadly, other polls show that Trump is at or near the lowest approval ratings of his second term, with concerns about the economy playing a significant role. While the president offered little in the way of empathy over prices, he did point to Republican efforts – such as tax reform legislation passed earlier this year – that will benefit many Americans in the coming year.When he ran for re-election last year, Trump promised immediate results. And after 11 months in office, many Americans say they still haven't seen substantive change, and the president's speech might be unlikely to change their minds. Trump, in part, focused his remarks on the promise of improvements during 250th birthday celebrations for American's founding next year. \"When the world looks at us next year, let them see a nation that is loyal to its citizens, faithful to its workers, confident to its identity, certainly to its destiny, and the envy of the entire globe,\" he said.\"We are respected again, like we have never been respected before,\" he added.

    "body": "6 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaThe Conservatives have promised to cut funding for green energy projects to boost defence spending and ensure the country is ready for war.Leader Kemi Badenoch said if her party won power it would reallocate £17bn to invest in the UK's military because \"defence of the realm must be the first priority of any government\".Alongside investment from the private sector, the Tories said their proposals for a new Sovereign Defence Fund would mobilise up to £50bn.Labour accused the Tories of \"fantasy figures\" and of leaving the armed forces \"hollowed out and underfunded\" when they were in government.\"Look at their record: their time in office starved our forces of funding, drove down morale and left Britain less safe. They did it before, and they'd do it again,\" a party spokesperson said.\"With Labour, the UK armed forces will see a record £270bn investment in this Parliament through our historic defence spending uplift.\"The government has promised to increase defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2027 and 3.5% by 2035.However, the Tories are calling for the government to move faster and commit to 3% by the end of the decade.The Conservatives say the fund would invest in UK defence start-ups and reduce reliance on hostile states in supply chains, while allowing the armed forces to obtain new technologies like drones.Under the party's plans, £6bn would be reallocated from the government's research and development budget to the Ministry of Defence.Meanwhile, the National Wealth Fund, which was launched by the government last year, would become the National Defence and Resilience Bank. The fund was set up to invest in projects which support economic growth and the push for clean energy but in March its remit was expanded to also consider investments in sectors which support the UK's defence and security.The Conservatives said £11bn from the fund allocated to \"costly eco-projects\" would be redistributed to defence, with the remainder used for national resilience like water and transport.Badenoch said: \"The next Conservative government will move funding from [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband's vanity Net Zero projects and use it to back our military to accelerate their war readiness.\"We must ensure our armed forces are equipped and ready to defend our country.\"The Conservative leader added: \"In the face of growing threats we should be investing more in defence, yet all we see from this Labour government is heel dragging and vague promises.\"A recent report by MPs warned the UK was \"nowhere near\" where it needs to be to defend itself and the country's allies at a time of growing threats.The Commons Defence Committee said the UK was too reliant on the US and was not spending enough on its own security.Earlier this week the head of the military said more people needed to be \"ready to fight for their country\", as the UK faces the risk of confrontation with Russia.Chief of the Defence Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton also said the pace of private investment in the defence industry was \"painfully slow\" and more young people needed to take up careers in the sector.Earlier this year the government launched UK Defence Innovation, an organisation with an annual budget of at least £400m, to invest in new technologies and boost jobs.However, a defence investment plan, which had been expected in the autumn, has been delayed.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesPolicymakers at the Bank of England are expected to cut interest rates - bringing the Bank rate down to its lowest level since February 2023.Analysts are widely predicting a fall from 4% to 3.75%, although they do not expect a unanimous decision among the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).This would be the sixth cut in interest rates from August last year.The Bank rate heavily influences the cost of borrowing by consumers, but also the returns given to savers.The MPC has a target to keep inflation - which charts the rising cost of living - to 2%. The Bank rate is the committee's primary tool for achieving its ambition.The latest inflation data, published on Wednesday, showed a bigger drop to Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation than analysts had been expecting.The rate of CPI fell to 3.2% in November, from 3.6% in October, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.While inflation remains above the Bank's target, the latest fall in the rate and signs of rising unemployment and a relatively stagnant economy are likely to push the committee towards an interest rate cut.At the previous meeting in November, the four members of the MPC who voted for a cut were only just outvoted by the five who wanted to keep rates on hold.At the time, the Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, said he would \"prefer to wait and see\" whether inflation continued to drop back.James Smith, developed market economist for ING, said the sharp drop in the November rate of inflation \"green lights\" a rate cut.He said the \"latest drop in inflation fits into a broader body of evidence suggesting that price pressures are cooling\".He is forecasting another two cuts to interest rates in February and April next year, although not all analysts agree with this suggestion.Impact on borrowing and savingsAbout 500,000 homeowners have a mortgage that \"tracks\" the Bank of England's rate. If a 0.25 percentage point cut does come, it is likely to mean a typical reduction of £29 in their monthly repayments.For the additional 500,000 homeowners on standard variable rates, there would typically be a £14 a month fall, assuming there is a cut in the Bank rate and lenders pass on the cut to their customers.The vast majority of mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. Rates on these deals have been falling recently, owing to the expectation among lenders of a Bank rate cut in December.As of 17 December, the average two-year fixed residential mortgage rate was 4.82%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts. A five-year rate was 4.90%.Mortgage rate cuts should also reduce some financial pressure on landlords, and perhaps ease the likelihood of rent rises for tenants.However, savers are likely to see a further fall in returns as a result of any Bank rate falls. The current average rate on an easy-access savings account is 2.56%, according to Moneyfacts.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBBCMurray Dowey was 16 when he took his own lifeA Scottish couple whose teenage son took his own life after being blackmailed on Instagram are suing the platform's owner Meta, in what's thought to be the first UK case of its kind.Murray Dowey, from Dunblane, was 16 when he became a victim of sextortion in December 2023.His parents have now launched legal action against Meta in a US court seeking punitive damages claiming that Instagram was not safe.Meta, which also owns Facebook, has been contacted for comment. It previously said it had made changes to the platform to protect children.Murray died in his home in Dunblane in December 2023 after he was targeted by scammers posing as a young girl. He was tricked into sending intimate images of himself and told they would be exposed to his family if he did not pay.Lawyers for his parents are now claiming Meta \"knew of safety features that would prevent sextortion\" prior to his death and instead \"prioritised profit\".Previously the company has said it had made real changes to Instagram, such as introducing teen accounts with built-in protections and giving parents the power to control their children's online experiences.Speaking to BBC news, his Murray's mother Ros said: \"The worst thing that could possibly happen to us has happened. \"There's nothing that Meta can do that is worse than what's happened so we're up for the fight. \"We'll take it as far as we can.\"The lawsuit, filed by the Social Media Victims Law Center (SMVLC) on behalf of Mark and Ros Dowey, is believed to be the first UK case of its kind.Murray's parents, Mark and Ros Dowey, are taking the legal actionMurray's parents are named alongside a woman, Tricia Maciejewski, from Pennsylvania. Her son, Levi Maciejewski, took his own life at 13 years old.Sextortion has become big business in Nigeria involving thousands of young men nicknamed \"yahoo boys\".Guides on how to get involved in the crime are openly for sale online, as a BBC News investigation revealed earlier this year.",

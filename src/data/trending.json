    "body": "Do Liverpool fans think Slot is under pressure?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arne Slot was added to the banner above - created by the Irish Kop website - before the 2025-26 seasonByEmily SalleyBBC Sport journalist and Ellie ThomasonBBC Sport Senior JournalistArne Slot has already cemented his place in Liverpool history.The 47-year-old Reds manager is one of the iconic faces on a banner displayed on the Kop before every home game, alongside Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Kenny Dalglish, Rafael Benitez and Jurgen Klopp - Liverpool managers who have won either a top-flight title or European Cup.After winning the Premier League in his first season, and spending almost £450m on a new-look squad in the summer, it seemed as though Slot was going to carry on in the same fashion this season.They started their title defence with five straight wins - albeit leaving it late at times - but have now gone over a month without a Premier League victory.They sit seventh in the table, seven points behind leaders Arsenal, and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, losing 3-0 at home to Crystal Palace.After six defeats in their past seven games, BBC Sport spoke to Liverpool fans to find out what's going on this season and how they feel towards the manager.'We are losing patience'Slot's squad selection for Wednesday's EFL Cup defeat by Crystal Palace sparked huge debate.He made 10 changes from Liverpool's last outing, handing out two debuts and naming three teenagers in his starting line-up, plus a further five among his substitutes.The likes of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Dominik Szoboszlai, Cody Gakpo, Florian Wirtz, Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike were all absent as the Reds made a tame exit in a competition they have won twice in the past four seasons.Liverpool fan Abigail Rudkin told BBC Sport she is disappointed by Slot's decision-making.\"Walking to the game last night, me and my dad got the team sheet and we were like 'he's sacrificed this',\" she said. \"I understand we are losing games at the moment but you need to try and get a winning mentality back.\"We are losing patience. I think there are two different sides of the fanbase at the minute. \"There are those on social media that are calling on him to lose his job, and there are the people I see at the ground, like me, who are losing patience going to these games and not enjoying it as much with losing the games, but they also want to stay patient with him because we are very grateful to him for what we've had from last season when we thought it would all fall apart without Jurgen Klopp.\"Jordan Chamberlain from Empire of the Kop said he will forgive Slot's team selection on Wednesday if Liverpool beat Aston Villa on Saturday.\"This is the one that matters,\" he said. \"Then Real Madrid and Manchester City. If we get three negative results in the next week, then Slot's job will be genuinely under threat.\"But to suggest he should lose his job on the back of a match [against Palace, in which] he fielded players many fans haven't heard of is ludicrous. \"Slot's been very poor and has made some horrible tactical choices this season that have restricted his best players and left us wide open. We've also had some bad luck and missed too many chances. It's football. He deserves time to turn it around and I back him to do so.\"Fellow fan Ryan agreed it's \"way too soon\" to be talking about getting rid of Slot, but said players need to take responsibility and shoulder some of the blame too.\"We don't turn into a bad team overnight,\" he said. \"But Slot doesn't help himself with some of his decisions - and that is what he can control.\"Liverpool operate differently and I can't see us cutting Slot and his staff so soon. However, results are what count, ultimately, and if things don't improve - and quickly - then we all know how the road ends.\"The players have to step up too, by the way - it shouldn't all be on the manager. Some have been way, way below an acceptable standard for Liverpool.\"'More than footballing reasons behind slump'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jota had two years remaining on his Liverpool contract when he diedLiverpool fan Josh Sexton - who contributes to The Anfield Wrap - told BBC Sport there are a multitude of reasons why this season's form has been suffering.\"Key players are out of form, a few players are struggling for fitness, or suffering from injury issues, and there is a lack of continuity from last season,\" he said.\"A lot of those continuity issues stem from the business done in the summer, most of which was necessary for one reason or another and I don't think many Liverpool fans would look back and say that they regret the departures of any players besides possibly Luis Diaz and the profile of the player that Trent Alexander-Arnold is - the emotion attached to that exit causes this supporter to not miss the man himself as such.\"The variable within all of this is that one player we lost in the summer was lost in the most tragic of circumstances very unexpectedly, and there are more reasons than just footballing ones why that loss is absolutely immeasurable.\"Sexton said the emotions of Mohamed Salah after Liverpool's first game against Bournemouth showed how Diogo Jota's death has impacted not only the players who were his team-mates, but also the new arrivals, who have come into a dressing room that has been hit hard by the loss of a close friend.\"The tributes from within the club and from the supporters serve as a constant celebration of the magnificent human being that we were lucky enough to call one of our own, but of course they can also stir up feelings of grief and loss which can't be easy to perform through at an elite level,\" he added.\"And yet that is exactly what Liverpool have to do with the target on their back as Premier League champions, and I've not noticed any drop in heads or performance per se when those vocal tributes have been paid (the song the fans sing in Jota's memory actually started later than 20 minutes against Manchester United as Cody Gakpo went through on goal and hit the post).\"It will no doubt be having a general impact, but we'd all do well to remember everybody has their own grieving process and give each other the leeway to carry on despite such an unspeakable tragedy.\"'Always going to be a tough season'Earlier this month Liverpool captain Van Dijk addressed the fact that the club was mourning the death of Jota, who died in a car crash in July.\"It was always going to be a tough season,\" he said after a 2-1 defeat by Chelsea on 4 October.\"Nobody said that it was going to be plain sailing whatsoever.\"It was always going to be ups and downs for multiple reasons that we shouldn't forget, and all we have to do is stick together.\"Speaking on Radio 5 Live on Wednesday night, former Liverpool full-back Stephen Warnock said: \"You've got a team that's mourning in that changing room. How do the new players integrate into that? It's a horrible situation.\"It has to have an effect. They are human beings.\"One thing I notice every time I come to Anfield or watch Liverpool play is the Diogo Jota song after 20 minutes goes up and there is a 5-10 min spell where the tempo drops completely.\"The players are hearing that song and your mind will wander in that moment to one of their friends and close colleagues. In the changing room his locker is still there, so you're sat with a constant reminder of that person you've lost and that can't be easy. \"Some people will be able to put that to one side but for some it will weigh really heavy on their shoulders.\"Just a lull, or time for change?Media caption, Fans react as Liverpool lose againWe asked if it is too soon to talk about Slot's job being under threat, or if change should not be ruled out.Here are some of your comments:Paschal: Just a lull Liverpool are going through. Slot will turn it around. Just a matter of putting the players in positions they are comfortable and happy to play in. Time to put Joe Gomez at right-back and give him a chance. Let the new players have time to settle in. Patience is needed - it will come right.James: If Slot can't turn things around quickly then his position does need consideration. You can't make the financial commitment Liverpool have made and not see results. People continually mention transition and bedding in, but top, top players should hit the ground running - likewise managers.Karl: He should be given more time. We aren't a knee-jerk reaction team. Everyone is still dealing with the loss of Diogo Jota, and then adding so many new players into the mix. He is still the right man for the job.Barry: Lose the next three and I honestly feel something has to done before we fall too far behind for even a top-four spot.Paul: To suggest Slot is in trouble would be akin to saying last season never happened! We are not, and never have been, a 'sacking club'. We leave desperation to others. The guy has earned a year at least to sort this new team out. The talent is clearly there, but they haven't clicked yet. Time, ladies and gentlemen, please.Terry: Not sure Slot is the right man to get us out of trouble. We spent so much money on players and he doesn't seem to know how to play them. I think he's under pressure now, he needs to win games soon or he's gone.",

    "body": "3 hours agoFriday's papers are dominated by the news that Prince Andrew is being stripped of his \"prince\" title and will leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge. It follows weeks of intense scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Sun dubs him \"the Andrew formerly known as Prince\" and says the move is \"the price to be paid for 14 years of damage to the Royal Family's reputation\". Andrew has denied all allegations made against him.The Daily Star echoes the Sun with \"the Royal formerly known as Prince\". He will now go by Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. \"We can think of a few other names...\" writes the Star.The Guardian notes that the decision follows \"anxiety\" in the royal household over Andrew's friendship with Epstein and allegations of sexual assault by one of Epstein's most prominent accusers, Virginia Giuffre.The Daily Telegraph says the decision was made late on Thursday after almost two weeks of negotiations with the wider family. An unnamed royal source tells the paper that it was clear there had been \"serious lapses of judgement\" from Andrew and \"the necessity of further action was never in doubt\".The Times says the royal has been \"banished\" to a \"lonely life\" in Sandringham, where he will be privately funded by the King. A palace source tells the paper that his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is allowed to live there with him but is unlikely to join him.Alongside a photo of Andrew, the Daily Mirror invites its readers to \"Meet Mr Windsor\" after he has \"finally\" been stripped of his title.The Independent says Andrew has been \"humiliated\" after the King's \"bombshell decree\".Andrew tops the Daily Express too, which says the King has removed the \"style, titles and honours\" from his brother.The i paper describes it as a \"historic move to save the monarchy\". The i also looks ahead to next month's Budget, reporting that there will be \"stealth\" tax increases.Andrew is pictured on the front page of the Daily Mail, but the paper's lead story is the chancellor's admission she failed to obtain the correct licence while renting out her London home. The paper says it is \"humiliation\" for Rachel Reeves as she \"changes her story\". Reeves initially said she first became aware of it on Wednesday, but has since said she had found correspondence confirming that the letting agent had told her husband a licence would be required.\"Reeves house gaffe haunts Starmer\" is Metro's headline, captioning a photo of the property in question: \"Doom with a view\".And the Financial Times leads with the US-China trade \"détente\" after President Donald Trump described his meeting with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping as \"12 out of 10\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "23 minutes agoBecky Morton,Political reporter, Jack Fenwick,Political correspondent and Harry Farley,Political correspondentPA MediaThe government's independent ethics adviser suggested a formal investigation was not necessaryThe letting agent which rented out Chancellor Rachel Reeves' family home has apologised for an \"oversight\" which led to a failure to obtain the correct licence.Gareth Martin, owner of Harvey & Wheeler, said the company's previous property manager had offered to apply for a \"selective\" rental licence on behalf of their client - but this never happened as the manager resigned before the tenancy began.He added: \"We deeply regret the issue caused to our clients as they would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for.\"Reeves apologised for the \"inadvertent mistake\" but said she accepted \"full responsibility\". Sir Keir Starmer said he saw \"no need for any further action\".Downing Street spent much of Thursday defending the chancellor, with a spokesman insisting the prime minister had \"full confidence\" in her.Reeves put her four-bedroom south London home up for rent in July 2024, when Labour won the general election and she moved into 11 Downing Street.The house falls in area where Southwark Council requires private landlords to obtain a selective licence at a cost of £945. Reeves or her letting agent could face an unlimited fine if the council takes the matter to court.The chancellor said she first became aware that her property did not have the correct licence on Wednesday when the Daily Mail, who first reported the story, contacted her. She wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday to explain she was not aware it was \"necessary\", but in a second letter on Thursday she said she had found correspondence confirming that the letting agent had told her husband a licence would be required and that the agency would apply for this on their behalf.\"They have also confirmed today they did not take the application forward, in part due to a member of staff leaving the organisation,\" she wrote.\"Nevertheless, as I said yesterday, I accept it was our responsibility to secure the licence. I also take responsibility for not finding this information yesterday and bringing it to your attention.Reeves has published the emails, which confirm the letting agent agreed to apply for the licence once the new tenant moved in.In a statement, Mr Martin, the agency's owner, said: \"We alert all our clients to the need for a licence.\"In an effort to be helpful our previous property manager offered to apply for a licence on these clients' behalf, as shown in the correspondence.\"That property manager suddenly resigned on the Friday before the tenancy began on the following Monday.\"Unfortunately, the lack of application was not picked up by us as we do not normally apply for licences on behalf of our clients; the onus is on them to apply. We have apologised to the owners for this oversight.\"At the time the tenancy began, all the relevant certificates were in place and if the licence had been applied for, we have no doubt it would have been granted.\"After reviewing the emails, the prime minister's ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus said on Thursday night that he \"remains of the view that this was an unfortunate but inadvertent error\".While he did not rule on whether the ministerial code had been broken, Sir Laurie said he found \"no evidence of bad faith\".In a fresh statement, Sir Keir agreed with his ethics adviser, but added: \"It would clearly have been better if you and your husband had conducted a full trawl through all email correspondence with the estate agency before writing to me yesterday.\"The Conservatives have said the prime minister needs to \"grow a backbone and start a proper investigation\".Speaking on LBC, party leader Kemi Badenoch said \"maybe it is the letting agents' fault but it's this the funny thing with Labour, it's always somebody else's fault.\"\"Keir Starmer said law makers shouldn't be lawbreakers, and he was very happy to chase every fixed penalty notice that occurred under the Conservatives,\" she said.\"What Rachel Reeves looks like she has done is a criminal offence. \"They didn't say it was about the seriousness of the offence. They said if the law has been broken, the law has been broken. I'm only holding them to their standards.\"\"They spent five years pretending they were the most perfect people and now they had resignation after scandal after resignation, so let the ethics advisor investigate.\"The revelations come at a politically awkward time for Reeves, who is preparing for a Budget at the end of the month amidst speculation the government is planning to break a manifesto commitment not to raise income tax.Reeves' economic responsibility was a hallmark of Labour's pre-election argument that they could be trusted with the nation's finances.But since then, questions about her personal judgement were raised after she accepted free concert tickets as well as thousands of pounds in donations for clothing.Her political judgement was criticised after she imposed – and then reversed – cuts to the winter fuel allowance.Errors in her CV further undermined her standing.Now this adds to a growing list of charges at the chancellor's door, and it is yet another day when the government completely lost control of the news agenda.",

    "body": "Buckingham Palace has announced that Prince Andrew is to lose his prince title and will be leaving his Royal Lodge home in Windsor.Andrew Mountbatten Windsor - as he is now to be known -  gave up his other royal titles earlier this month, including the Duke of York, after more questions and allegations about his private life.The palace said the former prince has agreed to leave Royal Lodge as his links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein continue to cause controversy.The decision was made due to serious lapses in Andrew's judgement, it is understood, and he continues to deny the accusations against him. It is also understood that he did not object to the King's decision to remove his titles.His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew.Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation. These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.",

    "body": "Five people have been charged in connection with the 2023 overdose death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds. New York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city. Authorities link the network to the overdose deaths of Leandro De Niro-Rodriguez,  Akira Stein - daughter of Blondie co-founder Chris Stein - and a third unnamed victim.The five are each charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute.\"Through their alleged actions, these defendants left behind a trail of irreversible loss that cut short the lives of three teenagers who held boundless potential and who had already made profound, immeasurable impacts on those who knew them,\" said Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ricky Patel in a statement on Thursday. Prosecutors allege the five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.They allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths. Stein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas. The unnamed victim, who died 13 June, allegedly purchased pills through an intermediary from Mr McIver.Authorities say De Niro-Rodriguez, who died 2 July, got pills from a dealer who allegedly obtained them from Mr McIver, Mr Epperson, and Mr Barreto.Separatedly in 2023, a woman was arrested for allegedly selling De Niro-Rodriguez three counterfeit oxycodone pills containing fentanyl - the drugs believed to have led to his death - and tablets of Xanax.In a statement after the death of his grandson, Academy-Award winner De Niro said he was \"deeply distressed\" by the passing of his \"beloved grandson\", who was the only child of his daughter Drena.In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, Chris Stein noted the arrests in his daughter's case and thanked officials \"for this hope of some justice for her\".If found guilty, the charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.

    "body": "4 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe government has been urged to get a grip on long A&E waits with campaigners saying it is the rot eating away at the heart of the NHS.The plea by Age UK comes as it publishes a report detailing \"heartbreaking\" stories of how older people are suffering, spending hours in corridors and side-rooms.It highlights cases of people being left in their own excrement, having blood transfusions and even dying in these make-shift treatment areas.And it said older people were much more likely to experience long waits, with data showing one in three over 90s faced 12-hour waits at A&E in England last year.The government said the situation was unacceptable, but added it was taking action.The Age UK report said while 12-hour waits were once virtually unheard of, they had now become the norm in too many places.It highlighted the case of an 86-year-old who was left in a disused corridor for 36 hours.Another man, who had soiled himself, was left in his own excrement for 20 hours, while others suffered the indignity of having to use bedpans in corridors.Susan, 79, from south London, is one of those who has experienced a long wait, according to the Age UK report.She said it took 22 hours for a bed to be found for her after she arrived at hospital having had a heart attack.She spent a large part of her wait on a couch in a curtained-off area near A&E where there was no privacy. She believes she heard two people dying on couches nearby.Regarding one of the deaths, she said: \"I was next to a man who was clearly unwell. He was alone for some time, then his wife was brought in. They whispered as they had little privacy. Then, after a long silence, she was led away, crying. I'm certain he died. And he died right next to me.\"The report pointed to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from NHS England which showed there were more than 1.7 million 12-hour waits in 2024-25 at major hospitals – around one in 10 of those who attended A&Es.Two thirds of them were experienced by people aged over 60.The report said as well as being horrible, long waits were risky.Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said it was a \"crisis hiding in plain sight\" and that the government should take immediate action.\"No-one should have to spend their final days in a hospital corridor where it's impossible for staff to provide good, compassionate care.\"As we head into winter, we fear that an already difficult situation will get worse.\"Long waits are like a rot eating away at the heart of the NHS, undermining public trust.\"Age UK said a major cause of the problem was the lack of available support in the community, which meant hospitals could not discharge patients who are medically-fit to leave wards. That results in a shortage of beds available for new patients.It called for a renewed effort and drive to tackle this.RCN general secretary Prof Nicola Ranger said the problems were a \"moral stain\" on the health service.\"No elderly or vulnerable person should be forced to endure these conditions. \"Overstretched and understaffed nursing teams work hard every day to deliver the best care, but they face an impossible task.\"Health minister Karin Smyth said: \"No one should receive care in a corridor - it's unacceptable, undignified and we are determined to end it.\"She said the government was investing more money in the NHS and detailed data on corridor care would soon be published to hold the system to account.\"To tackle a problem you've got to be honest about it,\" she added.",

    "body": "8 hours agoTom McArthurBBCChancellor Rachel Reeves has released a string of emails, as pressure builds over her breaking housing rules.The chancellor rented out her south London family home when she moved into Downing Street - but it emerged this week she did not have the correct rental licence from her local council.The house falls in an area where Southwark Council requires private landlords to obtain a selective licence at a one-off cost of £945.She has apologised and initially said she was not aware a licence was necessary.But on Thursday, Reeves said her husband had found emails that showed the letting agent had told them a licence was needed - and that the agent would apply on their behalf.She has published the two chains of emails dated between 17 July and 13 August 2024, in which Nicholas Joicey, Reeves' husband, and the Harvey & Wheeler letting agents correspond about the necessary steps to rent out the property.Here are selected parts of the emailsOn 17 July, the letting agent tells Reeves's husband that electrical tests need to be carried out on their property, before adding: \"Once we have that to hand we will need to apply for a licence under the Selective Licensing Scheme via Southwark Council.\"One email from the letting agent also appeared to confirm the company was taking charge of applying for the licence.In an email dated 22 July, the letting agent tells Reeves's husband \"I can arrange the Selective Licence once the tenants move in - would you like me to arrange this for you as well after move in?\"Four days later, on 26 July, Reeves's husband asks how much the the selective licence and some other things will cost, adding: \"Subject to this, I would be grateful if you could arrange these.\"The letting agent responds the same day to advise that the cost is £900 and offers to arrange for the electric test needed to get the licence too.On 13 August, Reeves's husband belatedly gets back and says \"yes please, do go ahead\" and arrange for the licence.In a response the same day, the letting agent says \"I will do the Selective Licence\".Letting agents Harvey & Wheeler said the property manager responsible for applying for the licence on her behalf had \"suddenly resigned\" before the tenancy began.In a statement, owner Gareth Martin said: \"Unfortunately, the lack of application was not picked up by us as we do not normally apply for licences on behalf of our clients; the onus is on them to apply.\"We have apologised to the owners for this oversight.\"At the time the tenancy began, all the relevant certificates were in place and if the licence had been applied for, we have no doubt it would have been granted.\"Our clients would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for. Although it is not our responsibility to apply, we did offer to help with this.\"We deeply regret the issue caused to our clients as they would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for.\"A spokesperson for the Conservatives said that - regardless of assurances received from the estate agent - Reeves and her husband were \"responsible\" for ensuring a renting licence had been granted.They have called for Sir Keir Starmer to conduct a \"proper investigation\" into the incident.In her updated statement on Thursday, Reeves said: \"As I said to you today, I am sorry about this matter and accept full responsibility for it.\"You rightly expect the highest standards from ministers serving in your government and I have therefore shared the correspondence between my husband and the agency with the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards, and I am happy to answer any further questions required.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoDavid GrittenJerusalemIsraeli prime minister's officeIsraeli soldiers salute the coffins, which were handed over by Hamas via the Red Cross in GazaIsrael has confirmed the identities of two deceased hostages that it received from Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza.The bodies were identified as those of Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, the Israeli prime minister's office said on Thursday. Hamas had earlier said it recovered their bodies.\"The Government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Cooper and Sahar families and all the families of the fallen hostages,\" it said in a statement.On Tuesday, the Israeli government accused Hamas of violating the Gaza ceasefire deal after the group handed over a coffin containing human remains that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza.It said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, a hostage whose body had been recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023.The Israeli military also released footage filmed by a drone that showed Hamas members removing a body bag containing the remains from a building in Gaza City, reburying it, and then staging the discovery in front of Red Cross staff.The Red Cross said its staff were unaware that the body bag had been moved before their arrival and that the staged recovery was \"unacceptable\".Hamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".EPAOn Tuesday, Hamas fighters removed a body bag from a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Khan YounisHours later, the Israeli government accused Hamas of another ceasefire violation, saying the group's fighters had killed an Israeli soldier in an attack in an area of southern Gaza.Hamas claimed it was not involved in the incident in the Rafah area, but Israel's prime minister ordered a wave of air strikes across Gaza on Tuesday night in response. The Israeli military said it attacked \"dozens of terror targets and terrorists\".Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 104 Palestinians were killed, including 46 children and 20 women, making it the deadliest day since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.US President Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire agreement, which his administration brokered along with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey, but he added that Israel should \"hit back\" when its soldiers were targeted.Under the deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Eleven of the 13 dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, in which more than 68,600 people have been killed, including more than 200 since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "Hundreds of energy-intensive businesses to see bills cut by £420m from next year4 hours agoSimon Jack,Business editor  and Michael Sheils McNamee,Business reporterPA MediaBills for some of the country's most intensive business energy users will be cut by £420m from next year, the government has said. Speaking to the BBC, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said about 500 businesses in industries including steel, glass and cement would benefit from a 90% discount on their electricity network charges - up from 60%. Unite's secretary general Sharon Graham said she welcomed help with costs, but  the amount saved would be \"quite small\" with profits in the energy sector \"obscene\" and in need of an overhaul.It comes less than a month from the Budget, with the government facing questions about how it can unleash growth, while keeping its commitments on employment rights. Last year, the UK's energy costs were the highest in the G7 group of developed nations. For the same year, the International Energy Agency reported that UK industrial energy costs were almost double the average across its members.Speaking to the BBC at Encirc Glass in Chester, Peter Kyle said the funding was aimed at \"levelling the playing field\" with international competitors, and that the bill reduction would be paid for through existing government tax revenue.  \"The savings we have made for it, we have targeted to make businesses like this more competitive, so therefore creating more jobs, more wealth, more revenue for our country,\" he said. The scheme is applicable across England, Wales, and Scotland, and some of the companies which will benefit from the change include Tata Steel at Port Talbot,  and INEOS in the Scottish town of Grangemouth. The reduction is on network costs, which are what businesses pay to access the UK's electricity network, and make up about 20% of a company's energy bill - meaning a 90% reduction works out at about 18% of the overall energy bill. Reacting, UK Steel said the uplift in compensation was \"greatly welcomed\" - but that it would only mean a cut of 14 million for the beleaguered industry and firms wouldn't see the benefit until payments were made in arrears in 2027.\"It is frustrating that the steel industry must face yet another year of uncompetitive electricity prices,\" said UK Steel's director general Gareth Stace.  'It's complete toffee'Speaking to the BBC at Unite's head office in London, its secretary general Sharon Graham said employers told her they were competitive on \"every single measure\", with the exception of industrial energy costs.Research carried out by Unite, which has more than 1.1 million members, found that £30bn in profit was made in the UK's energy sector in 2024 -  with industrial energy bills made up of about 29% energy company profits. Its research also looked at the breakdown for domestic bills.   Roughly a third of what a household pays on energy bills in a year - about £500 - goes towards energy company profits, Graham said, urging the government to nationalise the industry. This is a suggestion opponents criticise for its potentially enormous cost.\"You know, this argument that keeps coming up, 'oh, it will take us down the road of Liz Truss' - is just complete toffee,\" said Ms Graham.\"The reality is, what Liz Truss did is that she borrowed for tax cuts for the rich, and she didn't have a plan that she put before the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility].\"'More holes than Swiss cheese'While the action on energy bills will provide some relief for heavy industry, there are broader concerns in the business community about the impact of the Employment Rights Bill. One of Labour's flagship policies, it is currently making its way through Parliament and would give workers certain rights from their first day of work.These would include protection against unfair dismissal and the right to guaranteed hours - which businesses say could potentially make it riskier to hire someone. The Federation of Small Business has said nine out of 10 of its members are worried about the bill, with two thirds saying they would recruit less staff in response to it. Even the Resolution Foundation, the progressive think tank seen as having deep ties within the government, has cautioned the bill would \"inhibit hiring\" with \"little obvious gain to workers\".Peter Kyle said he did not see improved rights of workers as being \"in contention with\" the interests of business. He said it would be implemented in a way that would contribute \"towards the ability for businesses to make money by increasing productivity, by having workers that have security and rights that are fit for the age that we live in\".However, he added he was \"listening very closely\" to employers and workers \"to make sure there's a probationary period that gets that balance right\".For Sharon Graham, the legislation as it stands is \"a burnt out shell\". \"I think I said at one point it had more holes than Swiss cheese,\" she said.\"The reason that I said that, is that what looks good when you first look at it - and I've been a negotiator for 35 years, so I do look under the bonnet - fire and rehire [is] banned.\"But then what you realise that is, in most circumstances, if an employer said there was financial difficulty, if a council says there's financial difficulty, then they can fire and rehire you.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoEmily HoltBBCWe've all looked at our bank account and wondered why we don't have as much money as we thought we did, and suddenly, the bills, shopping and socialising begin to add up.For many of us, our relationship with money is strained and dealing with financial matters leaves us feeling overwhelmed or stressed.If you're struggling to get on top of your finances, here are four ways to help you manage your money better. 1. Look at when you spend moneyGetty ImagesSitting down and thinking about what actually drives you to spend money can help you stop destructive patterns, says  journalist and author Anniki Sommerville.When she previously worked in a very stressful corporate role, she bought new clothes everytime she achieved something difficult or challenging.\"I felt like I deserved to reward myself.\"I had this pattern of spending, which was like 'you've done a really good presentation, now you deserve to buy yourself something.'\"Abigail Foster, a chartered accountant and author, says the easiest way to discover these kinds of habits is looking through your bank statements, to see when you spend the most.\"Is it late at night? Is it the weekends? I have friends that have really bad habits of when they're bored on the train, they start buying things.\"Understanding these instincts, enables us to put in steps to prevent them. \"You can be better equipped to make an alternative decision and go, 'Do you know what? I can just take a deep breath and not purchase something.'\"2. Spend an hour a week on your financesGetty ImagesAnniki says when she was younger, she often felt scared to check her bank balance and avoided dealing with money as much as possible.This kind of behaviour is often linked to our education, says Claer Barrett, consumer editor at the Financial Times.\"How we felt about maths in school, maybe that burning feeling of shame of not knowing the answer or putting your hand up to answer a question and getting it wrong, that can often make us feel like, I can't do maths. So therefore, I can't do money.\"\"We should be really pushing on that door and trying to understand more about our financial situation.\"Abigail says the only way to do this is to force yourself to tackle it head on, setting aside a set amount of time each week to look at your bank account and all your outgoings.\"It's a minimum of an hour a week. \"Just go through your finances and kind of be hit with it. It sounds a lot, but it can be really calming for your nervous system.\"Doing this will often throw up outgoings that you've forgotten, such as a subscription for a gym you haven't been to in six months or a random app you've forgotten you've subscribed to, she says.3. Don't let jargon put you off - ask questionsGetty ImagesOften the terms associated with money can be offputting. Claer says don't let words like investing, scare you, instead take time to learn about them. \"Whether we're talking about stocks and shares, or investing in a pension. We need to give ourselves every advantage financially,\" she says. \"So being shy or feeling shameful, not asking these interrogating questions is the worst thing we can do.\"She suggests making a list of things you are unsure about, whether that's consolidating pensions or asking for a pay rise at work, and slowly working through them. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're just starting. \"We're all a work in progress. I've got my financial to do list at the back of my diary. There are some things that have been on it for more than a year.\"That's just life, but as long as I can try and do something every week towards making my financial situation a better place, that's moving forward.\"4. Set up a freedom fund Getty ImagesMany of us are already too stretched keeping up with the costs of everday living to even think about saving.  But for those who can afford to, Abigail suggests setting up a  \"freedom fund\" to give you options when life gets difficult.She recommends setting up an easy access account only in your name and not joint, and to put a portion of your income away every month.Unlike an emergency fund pot for things like unexpected car and house repairs, a freedom fund is money designed to \"make you happier.\"\"So when a job no longer serves you, you can think 'I've got some money sat away so I can go and look for something else.'\"Or if you want to leave a partner, that freedom fund can give you the ability to walk out.\"Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "5 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterReutersPrince Andrew is to lose his 'prince' title and leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, following weeks of intense scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement on Thursday night, Buckingham Palace said the King's brother will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.Andrew gave up his other royal titles earlier this month, including the Duke of York, after facing more questions about his private life.In a posthumous memoir published earlier this month, Virginia Giuffre repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions. Andrew has always denied the claims.Reacting to the latest developments, Ms Giuffre's family said she \"brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage\". Giuffre took her own life earlier this year.In its statement, the Palace said the King \"has today initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew\".As well as the title, the Palace said \"formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease\" on Royal Lodge.He will be moved into private accommodation in Sandringham Estate, which is understood to be privately funded by King Charles.\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement continued.The Palace also expressed its support for victims of \"any and all forms of abuse\".ShutterstockPrince Andrew has lived at Royal Lodge since 2004 but will now move outAndrew's two adult daughters, Eugenie and Beatrice, will retain their titles as princesses and Andrew is still eighth in line for the throne.It is understood that Sarah Ferguson, his ex-wife, will also move out of Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements.Until this month, she kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York - but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew voluntarily gave up the usage of the Duke of York title.It is understood that the government was consulted on the decision to strip Andrew of his prince title, and made clear it supported the decision.Reacting to the news on BBC Question Time, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said it sent a \"very powerful message to the victims of grooming and sex offences\".\"This is a huge development and a big step for the King to take. I have to say, just, you know, as an initial response, I really support the step that he's taken.\"Getty ImagesSarah Ferguson, pictured here with Andrew, will also move out of Royal LodgeThe stripping of Andrew's titles caps off weeks of mounting pressure on the Royal Family.The scandal over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was reignited by sexual abuse allegations in Ms Giuffre's memoir.While Andrew has always strenuously denied abusing Ms Giuffre, earlier this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.Details about Andrew's living arrangements have also come under the spotlight, with fresh questions being asked in recent days about how he is able to fund his lifestyle despite not being a working royal.Andrew has lived at Royal Lodge since 2004, after signing a 75-year lease deal the previous year with his landlord, the Crown Estate, which operates as an independent property company.The Grade II-listed Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate boasts a gardener's cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.Last week, more details emerged about how he could afford his mansion, after the lease agreement was revealed.The arrangement means he has only ever paid a token annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate, a lease document seen by BBC News confirms.The deal meant that instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments upfront, including for renovations.In effect, those payments - which totalled more than £8m and were detailed in a National Audit Office report - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the 75-year lease, based on paying in advance a notional rent of £260,000 per year.In a separate development, it emerged this week that Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge as part of his daughter Beatrice's birthday celebrations in 2006 - two months after a US arrest warrant had been issued for Epstein for the sexual assault of a minor. Andrew did not respond to a request for comment.For the Palace, Thursday's announcement is an attempt to draw a line under the scandals surrounding the former Prince Andrew - now simply Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.",

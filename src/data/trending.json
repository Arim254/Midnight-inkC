    "body": "The Duchess of Sussex has shared a family photo taken with the Duke of Sussex and their two children alongside a Christmas message.In the photo shared on Instagram, Prince Archie is seen hugging his father, while Meghan is bending down and holding hands with Princess Lilibet. They are standing on a small, wooden bridge in a woodland.\"Happy Holidays! From our family to yours,\" her message reads.Separately, the duke and duchess have also released a Christmas card and end-of-year video highlighting their charitable endeavours.Six-year-old Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, four, also feature in the nearly two-minute long video, helping their parents bake cookies ahead of Thanksgiving with a local charity.The video depicts work the duke and duchess have done under their Archewell Foundation, which has now changed its name to Archewell Philanthropies. Announcing the rebrand on the Archewell website on Friday, Prince Harry and Meghan said the charity allowed the couple and their children to \"expand upon their global philanthropic endeavours as a family\". The charity was established in 2020 after the couple stepped down from royal duties and moved to the US.Meanwhile, the couple's Christmas card message reads: \"On behalf of the Office of Prince Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Archewell, we wish you a very happy holiday season and a joyful new year.\"It comes a day after the Prince and Princess of Wales released a new family portrait which featured on their Christmas card this year.The image shows Prince William and Catherine surrounded by daffodils, alongside their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.Earlier this month, King Charles III and Queen Camilla released their own Christmas card with a photo of them in Rome, Italy.",

    "body": "12 hours agoPaul Glynn,Culture reporterandIan Youngs,Culture reporterBest-selling children's author and comedian David Walliams has denied allegations of inappropriate behaviour after being dropped by his publisher HarperCollins UK.A spokesperson for HarperCollins said it had decided not to release any new titles by Walliams \"after careful consideration, and under the leadership of its new CEO\".The Telegraph says it follows an investigation into allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards young women. HarperCollins did not confirm the reasons for its decision.A spokesperson for Walliams said he had \"never been informed of any allegations raised against him\" by his publisher.\"He was not party to any investigation or given any opportunity to answer questions. David strongly denies that he has behaved inappropriately and is taking legal advice,\" the spokesperson added.The publisher said it took employee wellbeing \"extremely seriously\" with \"processes in place for reporting and investigating concerns\". \"To respect the privacy of individuals we do not comment on internal matters,\" the company said.Walliams is one of the UK's most successful children's authors, having sold more than 60 million copies worldwide in 55 languages.HarperCollins published his first children's book, The Boy in the Dress, in 2008. Some of his books, including Gangsta Granny and Billionaire Boy, have also been adapted into television films.He has published more than 40 books in total, including a Christmas book titled Santa & Son, which was published by HarperCollins in October.He first rose to fame on TV sketch series Little Britain and has also won National Television Awards for his work as a judge on Britain's Got Talent.He was made an OBE in 2017 for his services to charity and the arts.But he has faced controversies including being criticised after appearing to make two Nazi salutes during a recording of BBC comedy panel show Would I Lie To You? this summer.In 2022, he apologised and admitted making \"disrespectful comments\" about two Britain's Got Talent contestants during a break in filming.He left the programme that year and sued the production company over the leaking of the remarks, reaching a settlement with them in 2023. HarperCollins UK appointed Kate Elton as its new chief executive in October.",

    "body": "12 hours agoCachella SmithEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe Trevi Fountain is one of Rome's key attractions with around nine million visitors this yearTourists in Italy's capital Rome will soon have to pay a €2 (£1.75; $2.34) entrance fee if they want to see its famed Trevi Fountain up close.The new barrier for visitors to view the Baroque monument will come into force from 1 February 2026.While the coins tossed into the fountain are donated to charity, the fees collected will go to the city authority to pay for upkeep and managing visitors. The city expects to raise €6.5m a year from the fountain alone.Announcing the move on Friday, Rome's Mayor Roberto ‌Gualtieri was quote by news agency Reuters as saying that \"two euros isn't very much ... and it will lead to less chaotic tourist flows\".The Trevi levy is part of a new tariff system for certain museums and monuments in the Italian capital.Access to a number of sites that currently charge for entry will become free for Rome's residents, such as the Sacred Area of Largo Argentina.At the same time, tourists and non-residents will have to pay to see the Trevi fountain and five other attractions including the Napoleonic Museum.Children under the age of five, and those with disabilities and an accompanying person, will be exempt from the fees.Tourists will still be able to view the Trevi Fountain - built by Italian architect Nicola Salvi in the 18th Century - for free from a distance.The site currently sees an average of 30,000 visitors per day, according to the City of Rome.Following restoration work which took place last year, Gualtieri introduced a queuing system to prevent large crowds massing around the landmark.Access is capped at 400 people at the same time.",

    "body": "9 hours agoHafsa KhalilandIan Youngs,Culture reporterTimothée Chalamet has finally quashed rumours that he is cult anonymous rapper EsDeeKid - by performing alongside him in a new video.Speculation has run riot that the Oscar-nominated US actor has been leading a double life as the masked rapper, who only ever reveals his eyes.Some followers spotted an apparent resemblance with Chalamet's eyes, and when the BBC questioned the star about the connection earlier this week, he responded: \"No comment... You'll see, all in due time.\"Now, the actor - who adopted the hip-hop moniker Lil Timmy Tim in high school - has scotched the conspiracies by posting a video of himself rapping alongside EsDeeKid on a remix of the musician's top 40 hit 4Raws.In the music video, Chalamet appeared to refer to the rumours by starting with only his eyes on show, like the drill artist, before pulling down the bandana from his face and dropping the bars: \"It's Timothée Chalamet chillin', tryin' to stack $100 million.\"He then referenced his partner Kylie Jenner with the line: \"Girl got $1 billion.\"The clip was filmed at Andover Minimarket Off Licence in north London, and was reposted by EsDeeKid.The speculation has been seized upon by fans in recent weeks, and both sides stayed silent as EsDeeKid reached the UK top 10 and Chalamet promoted his new film.BBC Radio One's Greg James also quizzed Chalamet in an interview this week about his connection to EsDeeKid, where he responded: \"All will be revealed in due time.\" James updated his caption on social media overnight noting \"all was revealed\". Chalamet even gave his movie, Marty Supreme, several shout-outs in the new collaboration, building on an already savvy marketing campaign for the film.But it was always far-fetched that the two people could be one and the same, and that Chalamet could have pulled off rapping with EsDeeKid's Liverpudlian accent.Their collaboration quickly went viral, with British rapper Central Cee replying \"Naaa\" with crying and laughing emojis, Tinie Tempah posting \"Hahha this is sickkk\" and US star Shaboozey declaring \"This going #1\".

We all love you dearly.

It has meant an awful lot to us all.\"In a separate statement, her father said: \"How sad it's going to be not hearing 'Dad, how long left?' on our long journeys back and forth at weekends.\"How I'll long to hear you asking me to test you with maths, 'numbers' as you called it, to entertain you when you get bored with the iPad. How sad it's going to be not making your buttery crackers, grapes and a yoghurt for your breakfast.\"Mr Thorpe said his daughter always found it so easy to show affection to others and ensure those around her were happy \"and never bored\".\"You were such a brave, kind-hearted and a beautiful innocent soul,\" he added. \"You always put a smile on people's faces with your wacky ways and just outright madness.\"Your other little family down here in Portsmouth will forever miss you.\"Dozens of bouquets of flowers have been left near to where Aria diedDozens of bouquets of flowers have been left in tribute to Aria in the residential street of Lime Close where she died.A post-mortem examination had found her preliminary cause of death was a single stab wound, Avon and Somerset Police said.The 15-year-old suspect, who was arrested in nearby Worle a short time after Aria died on Monday evening, has been set a provisional trial date of 15 June 2026.More on this story",

    "body": "7 hours agoThe Times leads with a new tranche of documents released by the US Department of Justice relating to the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, including \"a previously unseen photograph of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lying across the laps of five women\". The photo appears to show the former prince, Ghislaine Maxwell, and the redacted faces of six people. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and says he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\". Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.The Prince of Wales \"joins the SAS\" as a \"patron of [the] elite unit's charity\", which \"supports soldiers, veterans and families\", reports the Daily Mirror citing an unnamed royal source. Also featured on the front page is the black-and-white photo of Andrew \"draped across women's laps... as Maxwell looks on\", according to the paper.The Daily Telegraph leads with publisher HarperCollins UK dropping best-selling author and comedian David Walliams. The paper says it investigated allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards young women. The publisher does not specify the reason for dismissing Walliams. A spokesperson for Walliams says he has \"never been informed of any allegations raised against him\" by his publisher. \"He was not party to any investigation or given any opportunity to answer questions. David strongly denies that he has behaved inappropriately and is taking legal advice,\" the spokesperson adds.The Walliams story also leads the Daily Star's front page. A spokesperson for HarperCollins says it has decided not to release any new titles by Walliams \"after careful consideration, and under the leadership of its new CEO\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves is accused of ruining Christmas for retailers, reports the Daily Mail. It says customers \"surprisingly shunned\" Black Friday sales, as retailers say \"December has been disastrous, with the 'bleak' outlook stretching into January\". Critics cited by the paper blame the government's \"£30bn Budget tax raid\". The i Paper leads with its interview of Reeves, who does not \"rule out tax rises in 2026\". The paper quotes the chancellor saying she hopes \"further changes to tax are less necessary\", while noting \"the world is incredibly volatile at the moment\". Her remarks follow the government's \"£66bn in tax hikes\" laid out in the November Budget, which the paper reports led to accusations of \"breaking the Labour manifesto pledge not to increase income tax, NI (national insurance), or VAT (value-added tax)\".The Financial Times leads with the EU's €90bn (£79bn) loan to Ukraine, calling it a \"lifeline for hard-up Kyiv\". It notes the bloc's \"plan to use frozen Russian assets collapsed\" following objections from Belgium, warning it would be legally and financial liable.The Independent leads with the latest in Ukraine, combining the EU's €90bn (£79bn) loan and strike on a Russian oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea in its headline. Russian President Vladimir Putin's response is also included, \"as he accuses Western allies of 'dirty tricks'\" over the European loan and \"vows revenge for (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky's drone attack\".A \"robot surgery revolution\" is splashed on the Daily Express's front page. It says the new technology could \"cut patients' recovery time and free up beds\".Warnings to the government that it could \"risk a 'lost generation'\" due to \"rising inactivity among young people\" leads The Guardian. Former health secretary Alan Milburn tells the paper the government must tackle some \"uncomfortable truths\" about the labour market, as he leads an inquiry that will include a review into the \"future of the youth minimum wage\".And finally, the Sun reports TV chef James Martin has announced he is engaged to his personal trainer partner Kim Johnson. The paper writes he got \"down on one knead\".Most of the papers went to print before the files on Jeffrey Epstein were released, but later editions have the story on their front pages. Several feature the black and white image of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as the Daily Mirror puts it, \"draped across women's laps\". \"How can Andrew stay silent now?\" asks the Daily Mail. The Times, meanwhile, highlights photos of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at Ascot, as guests of the then prince, writing it \"will deal fresh embarrassment to the Royal Family\". The paper says the files are a reminder of how Epstein spent \"years rubbing shoulders with the elite\".The Daily Telegraph focuses on Bill Clinton, who it says \"faces renewed questions over the extent of his relationship\" with the late sex offender. But the report also acknowledges that Donald Trump has \"sought to draw attention to\" the relationship between Epstein and the former president, as \"scrutiny intensifies over his own links to the paedophile\". Politico says the files have prompted the Trump administration to pounce on his supporters' \"favourite boogeyman\". Clinton denies any wrongdoing and his spokesperson is quoted as saying that the US government is trying to \"shield\" itself.The Guardian reports that an inquiry into rising inactivity among young people will examine the future of the youth minimum wage. The former health secretary, Alan Milburn, who is leading the probe, tells the paper that unless the government tackles \"uncomfortable truths\" about the labour market, there is a risk of creating a \"lost generation\" of young people.In an interview with the i Weekend, Chancellor Rachel Reeves refuses to rule out tax rises next year. She tells the paper that the world is \"incredibly volatile at the moment\", and says it would be \"wrong to start writing future Budgets\".Finally, according to the Financial Times, growers of real Christmas trees in the US are among the winners in President Trump's tariff war with China. It says people are turning to what the paper calls the \"real deal\" because Chinese artificial trees have been hit with big import taxes.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoJaroslav LukivUS Air Force/ReutersThe US says its military has carried out a \"massive strike\" against the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria, in response to a deadly attack on American forces in the country.The US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.It said the operation \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.President Donald Trump said \"we are striking very strongly\" against IS strongholds, following the 13 December IS ambush in the city of Palmyra in which two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed.In a statement on X, Centcom, which directs American military operations in Europe, Africa and the Indo-Pacific, said Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched at 16:00 Eastern Time (21:00 GMT) on Friday.Centcom commander Admiral Brad Cooper said that the US \"will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists who seek to harm Americans and our partners across the region\".US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the operation \"is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance. \"If you target Americans - anywhere in the world - you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,\" the US defence secretary added.US Air Force/ReutersThe US Army identified the two soldiers killed in the attack as Sgt Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, and Sgt William Nathaniel Howard, 29Posting on Truth Social, President Trump said the US \"is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible\".He said the Syrian government was \"fully in support\".Meanwhile, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OBHR) said IS positions near the cities of Raqqa and Deir ez Zor were targeted.It said that a prominent IS leader and a number of fighters were killed.IS has not publicly commented. The BBC was unable to verify the targets immediately.Centcom earlier said that the deadly attack in Palmyra was carried out by an IS gunman, who was \"engaged and killed\".Another three US soldiers were injured in the ambush, with a Pentagon official saying that it happened \"in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"At the same time, the SOHR said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security forces.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.ReutersA US airman attaches a munitions system to an F-15 fighter jet taking part in Operation Hawkeye StrikeIn 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks.The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.Syria has recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.In November, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former jihadist leader whose coalition forces toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2024 - met Trump at the White House, describing his visit as part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.",

The White House Chief of Staff, referred to by the president as the “most powerful woman in the world”, is the gatekeeper to the Oval Office and a crucial figure in delivering Trump’s national agenda. \nShe also rarely speaks to the media, making her an elusive figure in the president’s top team despite her significant influence. But in a series of interviews for Vanity Fair, she refers to Donald Trump as having an “alcoholic’s personality”, describes JD Vance as a “conspiracy theorist” and Elon Musk as an “odd, odd duck”. The White House has described the articles as a “framed hit piece” and accused Vanity Fair of taking statements out of context.\nIn today’s podcast, Justin and Anthony go through some of the most revealing lines from the interviews, and speak to the journalist who sat down with Susie Wiles - Chris Whipple - to find out why he thinks Wiles wanted to speak with him, and how he responds to White House criticism of the interviews.\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\nChris Whipple, Journalist and author of several White House books, including Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History \nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

    "body": "7 hours agoRitu AgarwalLucknowMaroof CulmenBiryani in Lucknow is cooked on a low, slow heat, with the pot's lid tightly sealed with doughMouth-watering kebabs, fragrant biryani and whipped cloud-like desserts.The northern Indian city of Lucknow has always been a food lovers' paradise, with locals and visitors swearing by its cuisine.Last month, Unesco recognised it as a Creative City of Gastronomy - adding it to a select list of global cities and kindling hopes that it will spotlight Lucknow's sublime food. With this designation, it joins a global network of 408 cities across more than 100 countries committed to promoting \"creativity as a driver of sustainable urban development\".The recognition \"is a testament to its deep-rooted culinary traditions and vibrant food ecosystem\", Tim Curtis, director and representative, Unesco Regional Office for South Asia, said.\"It honours the city's rich cultural legacy while opening new avenues for international collaboration,\" he added.Lucknow is only the second Indian city - after Hyderabad which was selected in 2019 - to find a place in this coveted list of 70 cities globally.The accolade for my home city doesn't surprise residents or food lovers - many echo celebrity chef Ranveer Brar's take: \"Better late than never. It should have come before.\"With the Unesco recognition, my beloved, chaotic, eclectic city - the capital of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh - is finally in the spotlight for what has always defined its soul: a passion for food.Madhavi Kuckreja, founder of Sanatkada Trust which is spearheading a project on the Kitchens of Lucknow, told the BBC that what gives the city's food its distinct flavour is the slow pace and the time taken to cook a dish.\"'What will be cooked, how will it be cooked?' is a continued conversation from waking up until going to bed in most homes. And you are actually judged by the quality of food that comes out of your kitchen,\" she says.But this focus on food is not new and many of the dishes that have come to define the city's cuisine have been around for hundreds of years.Maroof CulmenLucknow is famous for its melt-in-the-mouth kebabsThe City of Nawabs - as it's popularly called after its 18th and 19th Century wealthy Muslim rulers - is known for its melt-in-the-mouth kebabs and a distinctive take on biryani that were created, evolved and taken to sublime levels in their kitchens.These royal kitchens were centres of culinary innovations, blending the Persian and local Indian styles to create what became the cuisine of Awadh - as the region was then called.It was during this time that Lucknow's most famous kebabs were fashioned. The story goes that the mutton galouti kebabs that have defined the city amongst visitors were created to feed an ageing nawab who had lost his teeth. His cooks minced the meat with papaya, saffron and spices and made it so fine and silky that it needed no chewing.But perhaps the biggest contribution of the cooks of Awadh was the slow-cook Dum pukht technique where food is cooked on a low, slow heat, with the pot's lid tightly sealed with dough.It was popularised during the 18th Century reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah - the region was in the grip of a famine and he initiated a work-for-food programme. Large cauldrons with rice, vegetables, meat and spices were sealed to make a one-dish meal.The story goes that the Nawab caught a whiff of the aromas emanating from the pots, demanded a taste and the Dum technique was officially adopted in his kitchens.This technique was revived and commercially popularised in modern India by the late chef Imtiaz Qureshi, recognised as an Awadhi cuisine maestro and the force behind present-day iconic Delhi restaurants Bukhara and Dum Pukht, which are included in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list. Besides the obvious kebabs and biryani, the cooks also built up a repertoire of dishes that included kormas (curries), sheermal (saffron flat bread) and shahi tukda (bread pudding).But Lucknow is not just about kebabs and biryani - the region is also a vegetarian's paradise.Maroof CulmenThe city offers unique seasonal delights, such as Makkhan Malai, a unique cloud-like dessert, in the winterThe local Baniya community's traditionally strictly vegetarian cuisine not only celebrates seasonal produce but also gives the city its highly curated Indian desserts and sweets and unique street food, like chaat - spicy, tangy fried snacks.Almost at every corner, there are little shops and kiosks, the little-known hidden gems that are popular with the locals.In the city centre of Hazratganj, huge crowds start milling around from 5am at Sharmaji Tea Stall to get a steaming cup of milky masala chai, served in clay glasses, along with pillowy soft buns lathered with hand-churned white butter.Morning walkers, political strategists and journalists gather around this nondescript shabby shack, which has been operating since 1949 and is now a legacy tourist attraction.For breakfast, one can head to Netram - a no-frills joint operating in the old city area of Aminabad. Nearly 150 years after it was set up in 1880, the place is still much sought-after for its hot kachoris (fried bread stuffed with lentils) and jalebis (crispy sweet made of deep-fried fermented batter and soaked in sugar syrup).Its sixth-generation owners - father Anmol Agarwal and sons Anoop and Pranshu - continue to safeguard the process and craftsmanship behind every recipe. An automobile engineer by education, Pranshu is passionate about his legacy. \"This runs in my blood. There is nothing else I would rather do,\" he says.Getty ImagesThe Sharmaji Tea Stall is famous for its milky masala chaiThe city also offers unique seasonal delights, such as makkhan malai, a unique cloud-like dessert, in the winter. The process of making it is scientific and complicated. The cook hand-churns the milk and then leaves it out at night, exposed to the dew that gives it its incredible frothy texture.On cold mornings, street vendors can be seen lined up in old city areas like Aminabad and Chowk. Many, however, say that their children do not want to learn the art.Chef Brar, who is also from Lucknow and has been an unequivocal advocate for its food, has often said that the city's rich food legacy places it right on top of the pile of the Indian street food experience. But the real value from the Unesco recognition, he says, will occur only if Lucknow can now create awareness about its lesser-known eateries.Ms Kukreja says every dish in Lucknow tells a story - shaped by generational food businesses, from humble street carts to bustling restaurants, and guarded family recipes.The international acclaim, she hopes, will encourage more people around the world to learn these stories and visit the city to savour the culinary delights of Lucknow.",

    "body": "18 hours agoIsaac AsheEast MidlandsIan BullockA Canada goose became wedged in Lynne Sewell's front porch door in CountesthorpeA woman said she was left \"terrified\" after a goose crashed through her front door as she watched television.Lynne Sewell said she initially thought a loud bang was someone trying to kick the door in - before she went to have a gander and found the bird wedged in the door at her home in Countesthorpe, Leicestershire, on Wednesday.\"I was scared by the loud bang to start with, and it was enormous,\" she said.Wildlife rescuers, who believe the in-flight Canada goose may have become tired and misjudged its landing, said it suffered just a few cuts and was set to make a swift return to the wild.Lynne, who was watching Manchester City take on Brentford with her friend Ian Bullock, said she initially thought it was human vandals behind the bang and did not expect fowl play.She said: \"I thought it was probably someone trying to kick the door or something. \"My friend went out first because I was scared - and he shouted 'there's a bird with its head through the glass'.\"Ian BullockGoose bump: The bird was stunned and spent the night in Lynne's porchAfter a short time, the goose managed to finish its breaking and entering and drop into the porch.\"We didn't know if it was alive or dead,\" said Lynne. \"I was so scared. I was scared by the loud bang to start with, and it was enormous.\"Ian, who suspected a traffic accident had happened outside at first, tried to call the RSPCA and police but without any offer of support late at night, the pair decided to wait and see if the goose survived until the morning.Lynne said: \"We opened the door a bit and pushed a little small blanket in there for it, just in case, and a bowl of water, some porridge oats, because we didn't know what else to give him.\"I was thinking about it all night in bed, wondering what to expect the next morning.\"'Wrapped him up'Ian then managed to arrange for Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital in Kibworth Harcourt to collect the goose.He said: \"In the morning, I came downstairs, looked out, and yes, he was still alive.\"A lady called Amy came and wrapped him up and took him off.\"We spent around an hour getting all the glass out and the porch smelt a bit, but you can imagine.\"Ian BullockAmy Blower, from Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital, collected the stricken fowlAmy Blower, team leader at Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital, said it was \"a shock\" to hear about the crash landing and believed the bird might have been tired and misjudged its descent.\"It's very unusual to be in the middle of a housing estate and flying that late at night.\"Surprisingly, he's just come off with a few minor scrapes and wounds from the glass he's smashed through.\"He had a small laceration to his beak and one just on the left side of his body - but other than that, he was pretty much absolutely fine,\" she said.The goose is expected to be released back into the wild after a course of pain medication and antibiotics.Lynne said she had now boarded up her front door and was arranging a repair through her insurance company.She said: \"I really don't know how it could have gone through that glass and survived.\"The chances of that happening, it's just not what you expect, is it?\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "8 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentGetty ImagesFlu should always be taken seriously. It is a virus that kills thousands of people every winter and puts intense strain on hospitals.However, I can't remember a flu season that has played out quite like this. There have been claims it is both a \"superflu\" and \"unprecedented\" across the media and even from NHS England - while experts say this year's flu is not out of the ordinary with accusations of \"crying wolf\".So what's really going on and is anything truly different this year?As I reported in early November, there were concerns the flu season had the potential to be the worst for a decade.Scientists who track the multitude of flu viruses around the world noticed seven fresh mutations appear in a strain of influenza – a type called H3N2 – in June.This newly mutated virus rapidly became the dominant form of H3N2 and was named subclade-K.The flu season took off a month early in the UK hinting the virus may have the potential to spread more widely than normal and it was too late to adjust this year's flu vaccine to match the new mutations.That was the concern, but the reality has been more in line with a normal flu than a super flu.Getty ImagesH3N2 strain of influenza The K-flu virus has not gained a dramatic ability to rip through the population.\"It was basically spreading at a very similar speed to previous years, it was towards the upper end, but it wasn't an outlier,\" says Prof Christophe Fraser, who is analysing the spread of the virus at the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford.His team's latest analyses, still to be published, suggest the mutations did give the virus a slight edge at slipping past our immunity – in the region of 5-10% more than usual. It is not clear if that applies to everyone or is concentrated just in children and young adults who have caught less flu in the past and who have been most affected so far. H3N2 viruses always tend to be more severe for the elderly and there is no clear evidence the virus is worse than expected this year. A rapid analysis of the seasonal flu vaccine also suggested it was performing in line with previous years despite fears of a mismatch.Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said: \"The things that we saw that were unusual this season are the early start to the season, we also saw this change to the virus, with more evolution than we typically see.\"But overall, in terms of the impact on the NHS and the impact on people's health, we're seeing a broadly typical flu season.\"There are suggestions that flu may already be peaking, although this comes with significant uncertainty. There are questions about what happens over Christmas when everyone meets up and it's easier for the virus to infect older people who are more at risk. There are also signs a different strain of flu - H1N1 - is picking up in Europe and may lead to an increase in cases here too.But a \"broadly typical flu season\" is probably not the sense you'd get from watching or reading the news.Statistical artistry was used to compare an early flu season to one that started much later allowing claims of flu cases being \"an incredible 10 times higher\" than in 2023. It was technically true, but is like saying your train to Glasgow got you there in record time… but the journey time was identical, you just booked an earlier train. NHS England was not the first organisation to start calling it superflu, but Prof Meghana Pandit, national medical director at NHS England, did label it an \"unprecedented wave of super flu\". It has been suggested by the British Medical Association that flu has been used to scaremonger while resident doctors were deciding whether to continue their strike action.Superflu isn't a scientific description and the BBC Health Team has not found any expert who thinks it is an accurate one.\"I don't think it's a helpful term, there isn't a particularly unusual set of symptoms, there's no indication of it being associated with exceptional severity, exceptionally rapid spread or exceptional health impact,\" says Prof Fraser.One of the UK's top flu scientists, Prof Nicola Lewis, the director of the World Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, said the virus was \"not particularly unusual\" and that she saw \"no evidence\" the virus was \"particularly different\" and superflu \"wouldn't be my description\".The former deputy chief medical officer for England through the pandemic, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, posted: \"I'm very unclear what is meant by the rather silly term of 'superflu'.\"Crying wolf?Persuading people to get the flu vaccine saves lives and last winter the jabs were estimated to have kept around 100,000 people out of hospital.  However, experts have started to question whether the escalation in language used since the Covid pandemic could harm trust in official health advice. Previous winters came with warnings of a tripledemic of flu, Covid and RSV; then it was upgraded to a quademic adding in norovirus; this year it's superflu.Dr Simon Williams, who researches psychology and public health at Swansea University, says there are issues with the \"current language around every winter being 'the worst' in some way or another\" and risks a \"cry wolf\" effect that damages trust and means people become \"numb\" to the advice.He said there was a danger of \"over-using the narrative that viruses will overwhelm the NHS\" when \"ultimately the NHS hasn't got overwhelmed to the point of not being able to carry out emergency and basic functions\".Instead he argues a \"fine balance\" is needed between raising awareness and \"not falling into the trap of fear-messaging or being overly alarmist, which can backfire\".Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at Nottingham University, agrees saying: \"I think it is a concern to use words like super flu, when we may one day experience a real super flu.\"We have to be very, very careful about how we communicate these things to the public, because there is a risk that we can cry wolf.\"",

    "body": "Anxious waits for arrivals are nothing new at Christmas as people track special deliveries.But for one Shropshire woman, the package two years ago was more precious than something due in the post. It was the child she adopted - the sister of the boy she had made part of her family the year before.\"[We were] on tenterhooks as to whether she would be here for Christmas,\" remembered Sarah, 44.She was not disappointed. In that December of 2023 she formally became a mum of two. Adopting siblings, she said, was \"the best decision I ever made\". It was, then, the best of times and the busiest of times. Christmas, she recalled, \"is carnage in the best possible way with small children\". And it was a journey to get there. It began when Sarah found out she would be unlikely to have a healthy pregnancy. Her story took a huge stride forward when she adopted her son in July 2022.Sarah described how she had read the then 17-month-old's profile prior to adoption and \"knew he was mine\". She said she \"got butterflies\".She then found out that her son's birth mother was pregnant, and decided to put herself forward as a potential parent for this new baby, should that be needed.The girl, the half sister of Sarah's son, was born on Christmas Day 2022, and the family became a trio the following December.They are about to celebrate their third Christmas together, but Sarah insists on trying to make \"every day special\".She said: \"If I see in a shop a toy or something that I think they'd like, I'll buy it, because it doesn't have to wait until one single day a year.\"Especially with adopted children, a lot of them have trauma in some way, shape or form.\"They can push you away because they feel unsafe. But if you can show them that you aren't going anywhere and you're there forever – if it means that once a month they get a treat – then so be it.\"And to be honest,\" she said, \"as long as the children are happy and content and have got somewhere safe, especially at Christmas, that's what matters.\"",

    "body": "Are these AI prompts damaging your thinking skills?6 hours agoGeorge Sandemanyacobchuk/GettyMIT researchers used electroencephalography to record brain activity while people used generative AIWhat was the last thing you asked an AI chatbot to do for you?Maybe you asked it for an essay structure to help answer a tricky question, provide an insightful analysis of a chunky data set, or to check if your cover letter matches the job description.Some experts worry that outsourcing these kinds of tasks means your brain is working less - and could even be harming your critical thinking and problem-solving skills.Earlier this year, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) published a study showing that people who used ChatGPT to write essays showed less activity in brain networks associated with cognitive processing while undertaking the exercise.These people also couldn't quote from their essays as easily as those in the study who didn't use an AI chatbot. The researchers said their study demonstrated \"the pressing matter of exploring a possible decrease in learning skills\".All 54 participants were recruited from MIT and nearby universities. Their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG), which involves electrodes being placed on the scalp.Some of the prompts used by the participants included asking AI to summarise essay questions, track down sources as well as refine grammar and style. It was also used to generate and articulate ideas - but some users felt AI wasn't very good at this.'AI makes it too easy to find answers'Separately, Carnegie Mellon University and Microsoft, which operates Copilot, found people's problem-solving skills could diminish if they became too reliant on AI.They surveyed 319 white-collar workers who used AI tools for their jobs at least once per week about how they apply critical thinking when using them.They looked at 900 examples of tasks given to AI, ranging from analysing data for new insights to checking whether a piece of work satisfies particular rules.The study found that higher confidence in the tool's ability to perform a task was related to \"less critical thinking effort\".\"While GenAI can improve worker efficiency, it can inhibit critical engagement with work and can potentially lead to long-term overreliance on the tool and diminished skill for independent problem-solving.\"Schoolchildren in the UK were similarly surveyed for a study published in October by Oxford University Press (OUP). It found six in 10 felt AI had negatively impacted their skills in relation to schoolwork.So, with the massive explosion of AI use, are our cognitive skills at risk of decline?Klaus Vedfelt/GettyA survey by OUP found six in 10 schoolchildren felt AI had negatively impacted their skillsNot necessarily, says Dr Alexandra Tomescu, a generative AI specialist at OUP who worked on the school survey.\"Our research tells us that nine in 10 students say AI has helped them develop at least one skill related to schoolwork - be it problem-solving, creativity or revision.\"But at the same time, about a quarter state that AI use made it too easy to do work for them… So [it's] quite a nuanced picture.\"She adds that many pupils want more guidance on how to use AI. ChatGPT, which has more than 800 million weekly active users according to boss Sam Altman, has published a set of 100 prompts for students designed to help them get the most out of the technology.But Prof Wayne Holmes, who researches critical studies of artificial intelligence and education at University College London (UCL), says this isn't enough.He wants much more academic research to be done about the effects of AI tools on learning before pupils and students are encouraged to use them.He tells us: \"Today there is no independent evidence at scale for the effectiveness of these tools in education, or for their safety, or even for the idea they have a positive impact.\"Better results but worse learning?Prof Holmes points to research about cognitive atrophy, where someone's abilities and skills become worse after using AI. He says this has been a problem for radiologists who use AI tools to help them interpret X-rays before they diagnose patients.A study by Harvard Medical School published last year found AI assistance did improve the performance of some clinicians but damaged others for reasons researchers don't fully understand.The authors called for more work to be done on how humans interact with AI so we can figure out ways of using AI tools that \"boost human performance rather than hurt it\".Prof Holmes fears that students, whether in school or university, could become too reliant on AI to do their work for them and not develop the fundamental skills an education provides.A student's essay might receive better marks thanks to help from AI but the issue is whether they end up understanding less.As Prof Holmes puts it: \"Their outputs are better but actually their learning is worse.\"Jayna Devani, who leads international education at OpenAI - the company that owns ChatGPT - and helped secure a deal with the University of Oxford, says the firm are \"very aware of this debate right now\".The University of Oxford began providing students and staff with ChatGPT for free in SeptemberShe tells the BBC: \"We definitely don't think students should be using ChatGPT to outsource work\".In her view, it's best used as a tutor rather than just a provider of answers.The example she gives is of a student having a back and forth with ChatGPT using the study mode setting.You enter the question you're having difficulty answering and the chatbot can break down its components and help you understand it.The example she gives is of a student doing an assignment late at night about a topic they don't quite understand.\"[If] you have an upcoming presentation to give and… it's midnight, you're not going to email your [university] tutor and ask for help,\" she says.\"I think the potential is truly there for ChatGPT to accelerate learning when it's used in a targeted way.\"But Prof Holmes insists that any student who uses AI tools should be aware of how its reasoning works and how the companies providing them handle data. He stresses that results should always be checked.\"It is not just the latest iteration of the calculator,\" he says, describing AI's far-reaching capabilities and implications.\"I never say to my students, you shouldn't use AI… But what I do try to say is look, we need to understand all these different things about it so that you can make informed decisions.\"More on this story",

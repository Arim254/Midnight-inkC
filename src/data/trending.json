    "body": "33 minutes agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterReform UK has received a record £9m donation from cryptocurrency investor and aviation entrepreneur Christopher Harborne, new figures from the Electoral Commission show.It is the largest ever single donation by a living person to a British political party.Mr Harborne, who is British but lives in Thailand, has previously given large sums to the Conservatives under Boris Johnson's leadership, as well as Reform's predecessor the Brexit Party in 2019 and 2020.While the next general election is not due until 2029, the donation comes ahead of local elections next May.Reform UK has been consistently leading in national opinion polls since the spring.Mr Harborne's donation breaks the previous record for a living person, which was £8m from supermarket tycoon Lord David Sainsbury to the Liberal Democrats in 2019.His cousin Lord John Sainsbury left £10m to the Conservatives in his will in 2022.Two of Mr Harborne's businesses - AML Global and Sherriff Group - are linked to private aircraft and aviation.Reform leader Nigel Farage has been a supporter of cryptocurrency, announcing in May that his party would be the first in the UK to accept donations in Bitcoin.According to the Electoral Commission's latest figures, Reform UK received donations totalling more than £10.2m between July and September.This was more than the Conservatives, who received £4.6m in donations, followed by Labour on £2.1m and the Liberal Democrats on £1m.Aside from Mr Harborne's donation, the next biggest during the three-month period was £1m given by games programmer and tech entrepreneur Jeremy Elliott San to the Conservatives.Labour's biggest donor was the Unite union with 362,625, while the Liberal Democrats received its largest sum - £50,000 - from Neale Powell-Cook, who owns a food supply company. It is the first quarter since last year's general election that Reform has received more in donations than the Conservatives.However, overall the Tories have still received more donations since July 2024 - around £14.4m compared with £13.5m for Reform.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the Tories had been \"out-raising\" other parties throughout this year, while Mr Harborne's donation to Reform was a \"one-off\".\"If you look at the breadth and depth of our donors, and the trend, I'm really, really pleased with the announcement today that shows that we've had our best performing quarter since I became leader,\" she told broadcasters.Liberal Democrat spokesperson Lisa Smart said the latest figures showed \"some eye-watering donations\".\"Our elections are not being fought on an even footing if they can be bought by a small handful of individuals,\" she added.Political parties are required to report all donations above £11,180 to the Electoral Commission. Opposition parties also receive public funds to support their parliamentary duties, with allocations based on their performance at the previous election.Between July and September, Reform received £227,835 in public funds - far less than the £2.3m received by the Conservatives and the £1m for the Liberal Democrats.",

    "body": "1 hour agoTom Singleton,Technology reporterandLaura Cress,Technology reporterOfcom has told the BBC it has never heard from a porn company it has fined £1m for failing to comply with the UK Online Safety Act.It said it had been emailing AVS Group Ltd since it launched its investigation in July, but had not had a response at any point - so the firm had been fined an extra £50,000.The Act makes it a legal requirement for websites that host pornographic material to put in place what the regulator determines to be \"highly effective age assurance\" to prevent children from being able to easily access explicit content.Ofcom said AVS must now implement highly effective age assurance within 72 hours or face an additional penalty of £1,000 a day.In addition to the AVS fine, Ofcom also announced that one \"major social media company\" was going through compliance remediation with its enforcement team.The regulator has not named the platform but says there may be formal action if it does not see sufficient improvement soon.Ofcom said the fine showed the \"tide on online safety\" was beginning to turn.\"This year has seen important changes for people, with new measures across many sites and apps now better protecting children from harmful content,\" said Oliver Griffiths, Ofcom's online safety group director.\"But we need to see much more from tech companies next year and we'll use our full powers if they fall short,\" he added.Ofcom has already started issuing fines to some companies for not implementing proper age verification, including deepfake \"nudify\" applications. However, online message board 4Chan has so far refused to comply with a £20,000 fine issued by Ofcom over the summer.The Online Safety Act is being implemented in phases, and is intended to prevent past practices which Ofcom described as online platforms being \"unregulated, unaccountable and often unwilling to prioritise people's safety over profits\".Tougher age checks for porn websites were introduced in July, though some people have pointed out these could be easily avoided with a virtual private network (VPN), which reroutes internet traffic.In October, Pornhub's parent company told BBC News it had seen a 77% drop in UK visitors since the age checks had come in. Baroness Beeban Kidron, founder of 5Rights Foundation, told the Today programme the fines were \"nothing\" to tech firms.\"Business disruption is everything,\" she said.\"Unless we're prepared to use the law, they're not really doing what Parliament asked them to do.\"We need a whole different attitude about the level of intensity and robustness from the regulator to say - we've got the law and we're using it.\"The BBC has contacted a company called TubeCorporate, the adult content publishing platform behind AVS group Ltd sites, for a response. The address which the firm uses is in the central American country Belize, and appears to be the registered address of a large number of companies: although they do not have physical offices there.Also introduced this year were tougher guidelines on ensuring the internet was safer for women and girls, with Ofcom vowing to name and shame platforms that did not comply. Critics say the Act needs to be toughened to make the internet safer, particularly for women and girls.",

    "body": "23 minutes agoRachel Clun,business reporterandKevin Peachey,cost of living correspondentHousehold energy bills will rise to help fund a £28bn investment in the UK's energy network.Energy regulator Ofgem has approved the funding in a five-year plan to improve electricity and gas grids. The money will go towards maintaining gas networks and strengthening the electricity transmission network.The work is estimated to add £108 to energy bills by 2031.But Ofgem said people would end up saving about £80 more than they otherwise would, as the investment will help lower the reliance on imported gas and make wholesale energy cheaper, leading to a net energy bill rise of about £30 a year.Companies that run energy networks - including power lines, cables and gas pipes - are separate from suppliers.This plan sets the framework for how they deliver a safe and secure supply, and the cost controls they face for five years, from next year.Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the investment \"will keep Britain's energy network among the safest, most secure and resilient in the world\".Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Brearley said the UK needed to move away from its dependence on gas.\"Gas has a really big part to play in our energy system for some time but we need to diversify our risk,\" he said.Diversifying risk means \"we'll be much better at electricity prices in the future and that will protect people's bills\".Of the £108 Ofgem says will be added to energy bills, £48 will be for gas and £60 for electricity.But the regulator said the investment would deliver about £80 worth of savings, including £50 in savings alone from the energy grid expansion.Mr Brearley said the £108 added to bills by 2031 \"will go up over the five years, so it's not all happening at once\".\"It's about 2-3% on bills in April and increases roughly in a straight line from there.\"A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"Upgrading our gas and electricity networks after years of underinvestment is essential to keep the lights on and ensure energy security for our country.\"Energy bills remain relatively high, and are set to go up slightly in January after Ofgem separately announced a small rise to its price cap, which will increase a typical household's bill by £3 a year.Ofgem's investment announcement also comes after a government pledge in the Budget to remove certain costs, which will cut about £150 from a typical annual energy bill. Ofgem chief Jonathan Brearley says the UK needs to move away from the dependence on gasThe investments approved by Ofgem include £17.8bn for the gas network. That includes funding for cyber security and gas pipe replacement.The £10.3bn in electricity funding will go towards projects including replacing ageing  infrastructure, investing in new transmission lines and reinforcing the electricity grid so power can be moved around the network.The regulator also said the investment will also remove inefficiencies in the system such as offshore wind farms being paid billions a year to switch off as the grid cannot take their power.At the moment, when it is very windy, the electricity grid cannot cope with the amount of energy generated by the UK's offshore windfarms as there are not enough cables to transmit it.Speaking ahead of Ofgem's announcement, Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power told the BBC's Today programme the removal of constraints in the system was important.\"This will be the biggest wave of investment in our electricity infrastructure since it was built by our grandfathers back in the 1950s and it will give us a system that is fit for purpose for the country for the 21st Century,\" he said.National Gas owns and operates Britain's gas transmission network, and will receive funding through the Ofgem plan.Its chief executive Jon Butterworth welcomed the investment, saying it confirmed \"the critical role that the gas transmission system plays in Britain's energy security now and for decades to come\".\"In the coming weeks, we will undertake a more detailed review of Ofgem's decision to ensure it enables us to deliver a safe, resilient network that secures Britain's energy, maintains our industrial competitiveness and supports the country's clean energy ambitions.\"Energy UK chief executive Dhara Vyas said the increased investment was critical, but the added cost for businesses and households needed to be considered by the government.\"Last week's Budget intervention was welcome recognition of the need to ease the burden on these customers and the government needs to continue looking at funding essential future investment in the fairest way possible and providing greater certainty and visibility on future costs,\" she said.Greenpeace UK's senior climate adviser, Charlie Kronick, said the energy grid was \"no longer fit for purpose\" and needed immediate, vital upgrades.\"This money must be spent effectively, however, with robust safeguards and strong regulation to protect bill-payers, and ensure these upgrades deliver genuine value for money, offering fair but not excessive returns,\" he said.Campaign group End Fuel Poverty Coalition echoed the concerns from Greenpeace, saying network and transmission companies should not be handed a blank cheque.\"These vast sums of essentially public money must come with proper scrutiny and guarantees for consumers,\" the coalition's co-ordinator Simon Francis said.",

    "body": "10 hours agoAlex TaylorBBC News reporterGetty ImagesIt's that time of year when winter viruses take hold, and a cacophony of coughs fill households, offices and public transport.Often people turn to cough medicine for a fix. But does this work, or are homemade remedies like honey and lemon just as good?Jacky Smith, a professor in respiratory medicine at the University of Manchester,  spoke to Radio 4's Sliced Bread to unblock fact from fiction.Own brand products can do the jobGetty ImagesMost coughs come from colds, and cold viruses usually need to work their way through you naturally. Cough medicines can't treat the underlying virus but they can soothe your throat and reduce the tickly sensations that make you cough.If it's a dry cough then choosing balsams or sickly-sweet syrup-based soothing agents like glycerol, can help \"coat your throat\" and protect against the dryness, says Prof Smith.But paying more for these isn't worth it with cheaper supermarket-own brands just as effective as the big names, she says.The one thing to look out for on the label though is sugar content which as you'd expect with sweet syrups is often very high. Sugar-free cough medicines could be a better option if that's a concern.Cough medicines often also advertise that they contain certain \"active ingredients\". These can include dextromethorphan, which claims to suppress your cough reflex - although Prof Smith says the impact is minimal.Dosing is always important she adds, but especially with dextromethorphan which can be addictive. \"You certainly wouldn't want to exceed the doses advised on the label,\" she says.Levomenthol - an ingredient found in some cough syrups for chesty coughs - meanwhile, offers a \"cooling sensation\" at the back of the throat, which limits the tickle by masking the sense of irritation.Drink water and wait it outGetty ImagesIf it's a chesty cough then many find themselves battling what can feel like oceans of phlegm and a tight chest.This can come from secondary infections like bronchitis, which inflame the airways, or the extra build-up of phlegm in your nose and sinuses.It's natural to turn to an over-the-counter syrup, but Prof Smith's advice is to remain sceptical of their impact.The ingredient guaifenesin, for instance, is claimed to loosen phlegm, but this lacks conclusive proof.And while sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine might help you sleep at night, they don't treat the cough itself.There's similarly little evidence that plant extracts, like thyme and squill, have any impact.Instead, Prof Smith says the best approach is for people to \"wait it out\", drink water to stay hydrated and take lozenges that encourage swallowing and \"inhibit a cough\" for a period of time.What about honey and lemon?A warm homemade mixture of honey and lemon can have just the same soothing effect for dry coughs as many over-the-counter options.A Cochrane review  – an independent review of evidence - suggested that for children over one year with coughs and colds, the use of honey and lemon could \"be of some benefit,\" adds Prof Smith.Cough it outIt's also worth remembering that coughing is necessary. It's how our body gets rid of the mucus.If it's a mucus-y cough, spitting out the excess can ease the airways.\"I will cough up whatever I need to,\" says Prof Smith. \"I won't try and suppress it, get it out.\" If you do, make sure you use a tissue. But should you swallow, no harm is done and the stomach can still break it down.You should only worry about the colour of what you're coughing up if it's dark brown as \"there may be some blood in it\".Most chesty coughs generally settle after a few weeks without needing antibiotics, but if it lingers beyond three weeks, Prof Smith urges people to go to their GP.More to explore",

    "body": "41 minutes agoTinshui YeungUK MOD CrownHMS Glasgow is the first Type 26 frigate to be built for the Royal NavyThe UK and Norway have signed a defence pact that will see them operate a combined fleet to hunt Russian submarines in the North Atlantic.The deal is designed to protect undersea cables - which British officials say are increasingly under threat from Moscow - with a 30% rise in Russian vessels spotted in UK waters over the past two years, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).Under the agreement, the navies from the two Nato member states will operate a fleet of British-built Type-26 frigates.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the agreement \"historic\", saying that it strengthens the UK's ability to protect its critical infrastructure.The announcement comes as Sir Keir welcomes his Norwegian counterpart, Jonas Støre, to RAF Lossiemouth in northern Scotland on Thursday.The two leaders will hear from maritime patrol crews who have been tracking Russian vessels, including the spy ship Yantar, which was recently accused of pointing lasers to disrupt RAF pilots.Russia describes Yantar, which is operated by the country's Ministry of Defence, as an oceanic research vessel. Western nations have often tracked it in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables.Britain is heavily reliant on its network of undersea cables that carry data. There are also vital oil and gas pipelines connecting Britain to North Sea neighbours such as Norway.BBC Verify look at reports of a Russian spy ship entering UK waters and shining lasers at RAF planeThe Lunna House agreement - named after the Shetland Isles base used by the Norwegian resistance during the World War Two - is backed by a £10 billion UK-Norway warship deal signed in September.Norwegian Defence Minister Tore O Sandvik, who signed the deal with UK Defence Secretary John Healey, said the two countries would \"defend themselves together.\"At least 13 anti-submarine ships from the UK and Norway - at least five of them Norwegian - will operate jointly in northern Europe.The warships will monitor Russian naval movements in the waters between Greenland, Iceland and the UK, defending seabed cables and pipelines critical to British communications, electricity and gas networks.The agreement also extends to joint war gaming, and the use of UK-built Sting Ray torpedoes. Royal Marines will also receive training in Norway to fight in sub-zero conditions.The two countries will also collaborate to develop \"motherships\" for uncrewed mine hunting and undersea warfare systems, and the Royal Navy will adopt advanced Norwegian Naval Strike Missiles, which can take out enemy ships at ranges of more than 160km (100 miles).Healey said: \"In this new era of threat and with increasing Russian activity in the North Atlantic, our strength comes from hard power and strong alliances.\"The UK and its Nato allies have become increasingly concerned about the risk Moscow poses to underwater cables and pipelines, amid heightened tensions following the invasion of Ukraine.The Ministry of Defence has also come under criticism from a committee of MPs for being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack.Attacks on undersea infrastructure could cause \"catastrophic disruption\" to the financial and communications systems Britons rely on, the National Security Strategy Committee warned in a September report.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLeigh Boobyer,BBC WalesandJohn Maguire,SwanseaFamily handoutKyle Sieniawski, 14, is believed to be the youngest person in the UK to have died with motor neurone diseaseThe family of a teenage boy who died after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) has warned the rare, degenerative condition can hit \"anybody at any age, at any time\".Kyle Sieniawski, 14, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, died on 27 November, after being diagnosed less than a year ago with MND. The disease typically affects people aged over 50, and Kyle is believed to be the youngest person to have died with MND in the UK.Former rugby league star Kevin Sinfield, who is currently running seven ultramarathons in seven days for MND awareness, told Kyle's family the \"community\" will be there for them, and Kyle \"will always be remembered\".Kyle's mum, Melanie Sieniawski, told BBC Breakfast: \"It can affect anybody at any age, at any time. \"They need [to do] as much fundraising and awareness as they can - to get a cure as soon as possible.\"His father, Mark, said the family wanted to keep raising awareness. \"To be honest what Melanie and I went through was horrific\", he said, describing his son's condition as \"horrendous to watch\".Family handoutKevin Sinfield met Kyle's family in Swansea during his ultramarathon fundraising challenge for MNDIn January, aged 13, Kyle was diagnosed with MND after he began losing mobility in his arm. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was subsequently left unable to use any of his limbs. Following his diagnosis, Kyle's family said they were \"desperate\" to bring him home from hospital but were unable to do so because their property could not be adapted to meet his needs.His parents and brother, Liam, spent more than nine months living with him at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff.He relied on a breathing mask and feeding tube, and was moved into intensive care last month after developing an infection.Kyle 'was a fighter'Kyle's family described him as \"brilliant\" and a \"troublemaker\", adding \"his personality shone right through\".Mr Sieniawski said the teenager \"was a fighter\", and had received visits from many others affected by MND while in hospital.\"They all thought he was brilliant,\" he said.\"He touched so many people, to be honest. He was amazing. \"He had banter and laughter with everybody. We had so many strangers come to visit him. They all thought he was amazing.\"Family handoutKyle died less than a year after he was diagnosed with MNDEx-Leeds Rhinos rugby player Sinfield met Kyle's family at Gorsynm Rugby Club, Swansea, midway through his latest MND fundraising challenge on Wednesday.The 45-year-old took on the challenge in honour of his friend and former teammate Rob Burrow, who died with MND in June last year.Sinfield began the 7 in 7: Together challenge in Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk, on 1 December, and is undertaking seven ultramarathons across UK to Ireland, before concluding the challenge in Leeds on Sunday.He is running at least 45km (27.9 miles) each day of his challenge, in bursts of 7km (4.3 miles).In south Wales, he took time out to meet Kyle's family on the third of his ultramarathons, with hundreds of wellwishers joining him for part of the route through Swansea.\"We'll run a bit faster and harder this leg,\"  he told Kyle's family.The player-turned-rugby coach hopes to raise £777,777 - in honour of the number seven shirt worn by Burrows - to add to the more than £10m he has raised since 2020.Family handout'His personality shone right through,\" said Kyle's parents, paying tribute to their sonFollowing their son's death last week, Kyle's family said in a statement: \"Kyle fought with everything he had, but in the end it all became too much for him and he very sadly passed away.\"\"We're just completely heartbroken.\"Kyle... we'll miss you so very much buddy and we love you more than words could ever possibly say.\"What is MND?MND affects nerves found in the brain and spinal cord, which tell your muscles what to do.This leads the muscles to weaken and stiffen over time and ultimately impacts how you walk, talk, eat and breathe.It is a relatively rare condition, and is most commonly diagnosed in people over 50.A person's lifetime risk of developing MND is one in 300; about 5,000 adults in the UK will have the disease at any one time.More top stories",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick Triggle and Yang TianHealth Secretary Wes Streeting is launching an independent review into rising demand for mental health, ADHD and autism services in England. It will look at both whether there is evidence of over-diagnosis and what gaps in support exist.The government said it was already investing in expanding services, but there are long waits for therapy in many areas.NHS figures show rates of mental health problems and ADHD have increased significantly over the past two decades and the government believes there are people being referred on to waiting lists who do not need treatment.Previously, Streeting warned mental health conditions were being over-diagnosed and too many people \"written off\".Announcing the new review, he said: \"We must look at this through a strictly clinical lens to get an evidence-based understanding... That's the only way we can ensure everyone gets timely access to accurate diagnosis and effective support.\"It comes as ministers are seeking to tackle a growing welfare bill although the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has stressed this review is running separately.While some benefits require people to demonstrate how a health condition is affecting their ability to work, a formal diagnosis is not strictly necessary for many.Earlier this year, the government was forced to climb down on planned cuts to disability benefits, including for those with mental health conditions, after facing a major backlash from more than 100 of Labour's own backbenchers. But on Monday, the prime minister promised a renewed push on reforming the welfare system, which he said had \"trapped people in poverty\" and written \"young people off as too ill to work\".Led by clinical psychologist Prof Peter Fonagy, the new review's findings will be published in the summer.Prof Fonagy said the aim was to \"test assumptions rigorously and listen closely to those most affected, so that our recommendations are both honest and genuinely useful\".NHS figures show that the number of adults aged 16 to 64 reporting mental health problems reached 22.6% in 2023-24, up from 17.6% in 2007.Rates are higher among the young and the unemployed.Meanwhile, 14% of adults are reporting ADHD symptoms, up from 8% in 2007, although experts believe only around 5% or just under have clinically-diagnosable levels of ADHD.As of March, around four million working-age adults in England and Wales claimed either disability or incapacity benefit - up from almost three million in 2019, according to research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The DHSC said the increased pressure on the NHS meant that \"for too long, people with acute needs have faced long waits, had to navigate overstretched services, experienced inequalities in care and felt abandoned when support was needed most\".The review will look at how NHS services are working and what support people could be given earlier.Government sources said they wanted to establish a baseline for diagnosis and what good quality care looked like. It is thought one of the factors in long waits was that people who did not necessarily need treatment were ending up being referred on to waiting lists when practical support, such as help with social or financial issues or a short burst of talking therapy, could provide the solution.  Investment is already being made in increasing support in schools and expanding talking therapy services. London GP Prof Sir Sam Everington, who is president of the Royal College of GPs, said his workload with mental health patients has \"sharply increased\" in the last few years\"There's a lot of pressure from social media for people to have a diagnosis.\"So you give everyone a medical badge of anxiety or depression or medical diagnosis, when a lot of this is just the ups and downs of everyday life.\"I think the message we give all the time is, actually, we've got the answer to somebody's problem and there's a pill, there's a silver bullet that actually is going to resolve all this. Well, it's not\".Mental health charity Mind welcomed the government's announcement and signalled their willingness to contribute to the review.\"This is a huge opportunity to really understand what is driving increasing levels of mental illness, especially among our young people,\" chief executive Dr Sarah Hughes said.The National Autistic Society said: \"We need urgent action because, while we are currently seeing the number of people seeking an assessment levelling out, the average waiting time is rocketing.\"",

    "body": "A 3.3-magnitude earthquake rattled homes in north-west England on Wednesday night, the British Geological Survey (BGS) reported.The tremor, which struck shortly after 23:23, was felt across Lancashire and the southern Lake District, including the towns of Kendal and Ulverston, within 12 miles (19 km) of the epicentre which is believed to be Silverdale in Lancashire.Nikki Maddox, who runs the Blossom Bird coffee shop in Silverdale said she thought her roof was caving in when the tremors started.\"I had just climbed into bed and I heard this enormous rumble. It shook the whole house, it was very, very terrifying,\" she said.Ms Maddox, who lives above the shop with her son, said the earthquake lasted about 20 seconds and the noise was \"deafening\".\"It lasted long enough for me to think 'oh no, the roof is caving in this is going to be expensive,' she said.\"We're about two floors up and the movement and the noise that came from the ground up was incredible, it was terrifying.\"It was deafening, my bed is against the wall and I could feel the wall shaking.\"Katrina Simmons, who lives in Carnforth, 4.8 miles (7.7km) from the suspected epicentre, said she got \"a hell of a scare\" when she was woken in the night by the tremors.\"The shaking woke me up, I thought someone had driven into the house,\" she said.\"It was about 25 to 12 and I jumped straight out of bed. I live on my own so it gave me a hell of a scare,\" the Spar shop assistant added.\"It was only when I went on Facebook this morning I realised it was an earthquake.\"A customer this morning said all the emergency services were on standby at Aldi, at that time they thought it might have been an explosion. Someone said they could hear a helicopter circling.\"The quake occurred just off the coast of Silverdale at a depth of 1.86 miles, data suggested. There were no immediate reports of damage.Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said \"many residents felt or heard a loud bang\" in the area of Carnforth. Lancaster police also said it had received reports of a \"loud explosion\" in the area. Ms Simmons' colleague, Clare Hailes, from North Lancaster, said the force of the tremor set the shop's alarm off.\"I know the general manager got a call in the middle of the night because it set the alarms off,\" she said.\"Customers have been talking about it all morning. They thought a lorry had crashed into a building or there had been a quarry explosion. No-one was expecting it to be an earthquake.\"Lancashire Police said there had been a \"minor earthquake in the area, near to the Lancashire and Cumbria border, measuring 3.3 magnitude\".It added: \"There have been no reports of anyone injured or damage caused but we have officers in the area, together with colleagues from the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service and the North West Ambulance Service.\"The Volcano Discovery website said it had received more than 1,000 reports about the earthquake, with some as far away as Blackpool.One Carnforth resident posted on the site: \"Heard a rumbling sound which intensified in to a loud bang. Thought my roof was collapsing or something! Very scary.\"Another, in Silverdale, posted: \"Loud rumble and rattling of fixtures in house, as though something had collapsed or the chimney had fallen off. Significant enough to go outside to check.\"BGS detects about 300 earthquakes every year in the UK, but only about a tenth of these are felt or heard by people.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "37 minutes agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe number of flu patients in hospital has hit a record high in England for this time of year with NHS leaders warning the county is facing an unprecedented flu season.NHS figures show there were an average of 1,700 patients in hospital with flu last week - that is more than 50% higher than the same time last year.It comes as flu hit a month earlier than normal this year, with experts warning there appears to be a more severe strain of the virus circulating.NHS bosses are asking patients not to clog up A&E with everyday niggles as new figures show thousands turned to hospitals for minor ailments such as hiccups and ingrowing toenails last winter.There were more than 200,000 A&E attendances in England from November to February for conditions that could have been dealt with elsewhere, according to NHS England.This represents more than 2% of all attendances during that four-month period, taking up vital resources at under-pressure A&Es, health bosses said.Patients with such minor conditions are being advised to seek help elsewhere, including from pharmacists, GPs and NHS 111 – either via the phone or online – as some of them can be managed at home.NHS England urgent and emergency care director Prof Julian Redhead said alongside the high number of flu cases in hospital the NHS was having to plan for more doctor strikes in the lead up to Christmas.British Medical Association members are taking part in a five-day walkout from 17 December in their long-running pay dispute.Prof Redhead said: \"Today's numbers confirm our deepest concerns - the health service is bracing for an unprecedented flu wave this winter. Cases are incredibly high for this time of year and there is no peak in sight yet.\"He said staff could be stretched \"close to breaking point\" in the coming weeks.The number of people in hospital with flu is the highest at this point of winter since records began in 2010. It means nearly 2% of beds are occupied by flu patients.But that is still some way below the peak of last winter when there were more than 5,000 cases in hospital.Prof Redhead said because of the demands being place on the NHS it was vital patients used services sensibly.NHS England published A&E attendance figures showing between 1 November 2024 and 28 February 2025 there were:6,382 visits for nasal congestion 83,705 visits for earache 96,998 visits for sore throats3,890 visits for ingrowing nails8,669 for itching skin384 for hiccupsThe attendances were to either major A&E units or minor injury units run by hospitals.Although research shows one of the factors driving unnecessary A&E visits is difficulty accessing GP services, with latest figures showing more than a fifth of patients cannot get through to their GP on the day they try.NHS England said patients can get prescription-only medication – traditionally dispensed by GPs – at pharmacies for a range of common conditions, including a sore throat, sinusitis and earache.It is also releasing a video entitled '24 Hours Not In A&E' as part of a social media campaign to help avoid unnecessary visits to A&E departments and GPs.GP Dr Ellie Cannon, who appears in NHS England's social media video, said patients should remember they can contact their GP through their websites rather than relying on phone lines.\"Knowing where to get the care you need can make all the difference,\" she said.\"It's common for people to default to the 8am scramble for a GP appointment, or go to A&E, as it's what feels most familiar – but there are many far more convenient and quicker ways to handle your health concern while you get on with your day.\"She said contacting GPs through their websites could be quicker and easier alongside using pharmacies and NHS 111.GP practices in England were ordered to offer online booking from October and figures released this week show more than 98% now do. Those systems allow patients to ask questions as well as request appointments.But the change has provoked opposition from the British Medical Association which has warned it could put patients at risk because GPs could become overwhelmed assessing online queries.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "2 hours agoLewis AdamsandKathryn ArmstrongPA MediaFacial recognition technology could be used more often by UK police forces, according to new plans announced by the Home Office.A 10-week publication consultation on how to regulate the technology and protect people's privacy has been launched, which could pave the way for new laws.Facial recognition has been used by some police forces since 2017 to find wanted suspects and vulnerable people, as well as monitoring live events. Policing and crime minister, Sarah Jones, believes a wider roll-out could mark \"the biggest breakthrough\" in catching criminals since DNA analysis. But rights groups are worried the technology is too invasive. One of the proposals the government is seeking opinions on is the creation of a regulator overseeing police use of biometrics and facial recognition.Any new laws informed by the consultation would take about two years to be passed by Parliament, the Home Office said. They would primarily affect policing in England and Wales, but would also be relevant to certain powers in Scotland and Northern Ireland. PA MediaSarah Jones said expanding the technology's use would put more criminals behind barsThere are currently three different types of facial recognition technology available to police:Retrospective: Used to search images from crime scenes against pictures taken of people on arrestLive: Using live video footage of people passing cameras and comparing their faces to wanted listsOperator-initiated: A mobile application that allows officers to check someone's identity without having to arrest themAccording to the Home Office, the Metropolitan Police has made 1,300 arrests using the technology since 2023, including rapists and violent offenders.The government invested £12.6m in facial recognition in 2024, of which £2.8m was spent on live recognition.A further £6.6m has been invested this year supporting the adoption, evaluation, and roll-out of facial recognition technology. This includes £3.9m for the development of a new, national facial matching service, which is currently in the testing phase.It aims to give police a new way to carry out retrospective searching and have another national database of custody images.It is expected that the new database could hold millions of images, similar to the numbers on the police national database.The Home Office believes facial recognition technology could also help to identify and arrest prisoners released by mistake, and would only be used in time-limited, focused deployments.\"Facial recognition is the biggest breakthrough for catching criminals since DNA matching,\" Jones said.\"We will expand its use so that forces can put more criminals behind bars and tackle crime in their communities.\"What do young people think about police using facial recognition vans?Big Brother Watch's Silkie Carlo said the consultation was overdue and called for a pause in using facial recognition while it was ongoing.She believes the country is \"hurtling towards an authoritarian surveillance state\" and would be \"turned into an open prison\". National Police Chiefs' Council lead for facial recognition, Lindsey Chiswick, said live facial recognition was already subject to strong safeguards, but stressed \"public trust is vital\".\"We want to build on that by listening to people's views,\" she said.Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy at Liberty, told the BBC's Breakfast programme: \"We do really welcome the fact that there is going to be a debate on how facial recognition technology is regulated and used across police forces.\"But we're obviously disappointed that this comes alongside a government commitment to ramp up its use before we've understood its dangers.\"\"What we want to see are strict safeguards that say where and when police can use this technology,\" said Ms Ehrlich.A new fleet of mobile vans was rolled out by 10 forces in November, expanding a pilot programme already led by the Met, South Wales Police and Essex Police.The UK's equality regulator has previously criticised the Met's use of live facial recognition technology (LFR), saying the way it is being deployed is breaching human rights law - something the Met has denied.

    "body": "57 minutes agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterElections for newly-created mayors will be delayed in four more areas of England, the BBC has confirmed, pushing back regional devolution plans.New mayors were expected to be elected in Greater Essex, Norfolk & Suffolk, Hampshire & the Solent, and Sussex & Brighton in May next year, but will now have to wait until May 2028.The government is arguing that more time is needed to reorganise local government in these areas, but stressed more homes, better high streets and support for business were \"all on the way\".But opposition parties are calling for the elections to go ahead as planned, with shadow local government secretary Sir James Cleverly accusing Labour of \"subverting democracy\".The new mayors are part of a simplification of local government, aimed at reducing the number of councils, by merging district and county authorities to create unitary authorities.Groups of unitary authorities will be headed up by new mayors, who will be handed more funding and extra powers to run their area, intended to hand greater power to local communities.However, the body representing district councils warned at the time that the plans could spark \"turmoil\" and argued \"mega-councils\" could undermine local decision-making.Earlier this year, 18 councils requested a delay to their planned May elections due to incomplete reorganisation into eight unitary authorities - and critics are concerned the announcement of delays to mayoral elections could lead to further elections being cancelled.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said it is a \"scandal\" that local elections are being delayed.The \"excuse that it's about local government reorganisations doesn't wash\", she told broadcasters on a visit to a school in London, adding the government has had \"plenty of time to do this\" and people \"need their democracy\".Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice called the move a \"deliberate, dictatorial cancelling of democracy\". \"There is just a fear of how successful Reform are doing, they've been talking about these mayoral elections for years and years, they've been getting ready,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat local government spokesperson Zoe Franklin said the party would work to see the vote next May does go ahead, adding, \"democracy delayed is democracy denied\".And the Conservative candidate for Hampshire and the Solent called the decision to delay them a \"disgrace and an affront to democracy\".\"It is clear Labour are afraid to face the British public at the ballot box,\" Donna Jones said.Green Party deputy leader and mayoral candidate for Sussex & Brighton, Rachel Millward, said people had the right to vote for mayors the government has promised them. \"Labour's whole devolution agenda has fallen into utter chaos,\" she said.\"They're running scared of the voters and failing to solve the real problems in local government.\"Back in February, then Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner announced \"ambitious\" plans for six new areas of regional devolution, where councils would join forces to create combined authorities, led by new mayors.The new Devolution Priority Programme areas were intended to provide \"sweeping\" powers for councils to fast-track growth in regions outside London and, at the time, the government said the new positions would be created \"at pace\", within a year.Now, all six of those new devolution priority programme (DPP) areas have announced they will delay their mayoral elections, originally planned for May 2026.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) announced the first mayoral election in Cumbria had been pushed back a year in July, with councils saying combining the mayoral with planned local elections in 2027 would \"save significant resources\".Cheshire & Warrington followed suit in September, pushing back its first mayoral election from to May 2027 to fit in with full council elections being held at the same time.An MCHLG spokesperson said unitary authorities are now in place in Cumbria and Cheshire and Warrington, which they said would \"create simpler, more effective structures that can better support mayors' powers\".This will allow them to hold their inaugural mayoral elections in May 2027 and ministers are working with both areas to bring forward the legislation to create their mayoral authorities.The remaining four areas were still on track to establish \"stronger\" unitary authorities in 2028, they said, before the inaugural mayoral elections are held in May 2028. Devolution Minister Miatta Fahnbulleh stressed that work was continuing behind the scenes to ensure that almost £200m each year could be shared by the six areas over the next 30 years for local priorities in areas like transport, planning and skills.An urgent question on the issue was lodged at parliament by Conservative MP and shadow local government minister David Simmonds, who said the minister had caused \"a huge waste of public money for elections we are all ready for\".In light of the mayoral delay, Simmonds asked whether council elections planned for next May could also be delayed.\"Elections are happening in 2026, we are cracking on with it,\" Fahnbulleh replied, insisting \"we have been absolutely consistent\" on local elections.On mayoral elections, she said it was \"absolutely right\" for the government to \"take stock\" of how far along in the process of reorganisation areas were but, \"huge progress\" had already been made on establishing the new authorities.The MCHLG has announced that all six areas will get an additional £1m in the coming months, to help with the costs of establishing the new mayoral authorities, and will share  £3m each as a minimum over the next three financial years.",

    "body": "12 hours agoKaty AustinTransport correspondent BBCClaire Corkery is calling for a change in attitudes towards speeding after her parents were killedClaire Corkery was out celebrating a friend's engagement when a call from a police officer changed her life forever.Her parents, Sue and Tom, were walking on a country road when they and the dog they were looking after were hit by a speeding driver and killed.Last week, Scott Gunn, who had reached 87mph in his BMW X5 shortly before the crash, was found guilty of death by dangerous driving and jailed for 16 years.Claire is calling for \"cultural change\" around speeding, which is the most common factor recorded in fatal collisions in Great Britain, according to official data.Claire CorkeryClaire says her mum Sue was a \"very warm person\" and her dad Tom a \"very clever man\"It was a normal Saturday in January 2024 when Claire spotted a missed call and a message from a police officer. When she called back, he said it was about her mum and dad, and he needed to speak to her in person.\"I think I knew they were both dead,\" she said.\"I had them both on [the app] Find my Friends and I couldn't see where they were. I tried to call them but it went to voicemail.\"She met the police officer at her house, where he delivered the worst possible news.Claire was told there had been ice on the road, and thought it must have been a tragic accident.Sue was a former children's nurse whom Claire describes as a \"very warm person\". Tom was an accountant, a \"very clever man\", who liked to help other people. He was about to retire. More than 300 people attended the couple's funeral.The police investigation revealed Gunn had driven the BMW he had recently bought at 87mph shortly before the crash, on the 60mph limit Thurnham Lane, in the village of Bearsted in Kent.He had denied causing death by dangerous driving, but was found guilty following a trial.Kent PoliceIn November, Scott Gunn was convicted of causing death by dangerous drivingFor Claire, the sentence brought \"a sense of relief\". However, she also feels \"a pain that's always there\".\"Weddings, birthdays, celebrations, these are joyous moments. But when you have these moments and you've lost someone, the joy becomes bittersweet.\"Earlier this year Claire became a mum. \"It was really hard going through the pregnancy without my mum and dad,\" she said. \"I feel we've been robbed. My parents would have been fantastic grandparents. They were so loving and so generous with their time.\"Speed most common factor in road deathsLast year, 1,600 fatalities were reported in road collisions in England, Scotland and Wales. This represented a slight fall of 1% compared with 2023.Speed was the most common factor recorded in fatal collisions, according to official statistics published by the Department for Transport.The data also indicates that although more casualties occur on roads in urban areas, collisions in rural areas are more likely to result in death.In 2024, the majority of road fatalities, 60%, occurred in rural areas - despite those roads taking 45% of traffic. Motorways accounted for just 6% of deaths.'Worst examples for some time'Nicholas Lyes, from the road safety charity I AM Roadsmart, described the death of Claire's parents as \"an example of serious speeding and dangerous driving, probably one of the worst examples that I've seen for quite some time\". He said investment is needed to make rural roads safer.On road safety in general, Mr Lyes said: \"I feel that we've had something of a lost decade.  We've seen the number of road traffic collisions and particularly serious [incidents], effectively plateaued. So we're not seeing any great improvement on the numbers.\"He argues a \"perceived lack of enforcement\" could have a part to play on this, but adds \"what we really need to see is an updated road safety strategy\".The government is expected to publish a new road safety strategy by the end of the year. A Department for Transport spokesperson said it was \"committed to reducing deaths and injuries on our roads, and our forthcoming Road Safety Strategy, the first in over a decade, will set out further measures to keep people safe.\"'Cultural change'Claire's anger at the driver who killed her parents is palpable as she speaks to the BBC in her new house in south-west London.\"The fact anyone could be so selfish just shocks me today,\" she said.She would like her story to make people to think carefully about how they drive.\"We need to see a cultural change in how we approach speeding and road safety in general,\" she said.\"When we talk about speeding we kind of dismiss it, people say 'oh god, a speeding fine'. They kind of shrug their shoulders and it's almost like it's socially acceptable. But it shouldn't be.\"A few seconds is all it takes. My life is completely changed because of it.\"Speeding, even for a few seconds, it's not worth it. Get to your destination five minutes later,\" she said.\"If you are caught speeding and you go on a speed awareness course, or get your three points on your licence, take it really seriously and learn from that. And if you can't learn from it, then you shouldn't be driving.\"Chief Inspector Craig West of Kent Police's Roads Policing Unit urged motorists to observe the Highway Code, particularly in poor weather conditions.\"We remind road users that stopping distances double in wet weather and can be up to 10 times greater in snow and ice. Please drive responsibly, especially as the winter weather sets in,\" he said.",

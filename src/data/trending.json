    "body": "When Aston Martin's new Formula 1 car first appeared in testing at the end of January, it drew admiring glances up and down the pit lane.In its all-black temporary colour, the car not only looked menacing, but also noticeably different from all its rivals. It included the sort of innovations that have become famous from design legend Adrian Newey, installed as managing technical partner at Aston Martin since March last year.But reality bit hard as soon as the car started to run. It was already late, and it managed just four laps on its first day in Barcelona before conking out at the entrance to the pit lane.Aston Martin's fortunes have barely improved since.The car was the slowest in the field by the end of pre-season testing last week, and had done the fewest miles.Team owner Lawrence Stroll looked like the bottom had fallen out of his world as he stalked the paddock in Bahrain, his face betraying a combination of anger and despair.The few times the car was out on track amid myriad reliability problems, it looked a handful for the drivers. Publicly, Aston Martin and Honda were saying little. Privately, no-one was trying to hide the reality. They were in trouble, they knew it, and whatever was wrong - and it was a lot - would take time to fix.It all looked so promisingNo Formula 1 team looked towards the 2026 season with greater expectations than Aston Martin.On paper, Stroll had put together a dream combination, one that seemed guaranteed to produce success.The signing of Newey in September 2024 seemed to be the final piece of the jigsaw the Canadian billionaire was creating to turn his team into championship contenders.In the previous years, Stroll had already inked a deal to become the factory engine partner of Honda, who won four consecutive drivers' titles with Red Bull and Max Verstappen from 2021-24, and two constructors' championships.He had funded a sparkling new factory, including a state-of-the-art wind tunnel and driver-in-the-loop simulator.He had put together an enviable sponsorship portfolio of boundless resources, including the full financial might of the state of Saudi Arabia, through its national oil company.And in the cockpit was another legend, Fernando Alonso. Ageing, certainly, now he is in his mid-40s, but still without question a major force behind the wheel.The past few years have not been easy for Aston Martin. A major step forward at the start of 2023, when Alonso first joined the team, led to six podiums in the first eight races and what could have been a win in Monaco, lost only to a wrong tyre choice during a late shower of rain.But in the second half of that season the team slipped back, as they failed to keep up with the development rate of their rivals. The same happened in 2024, from a lower starting point, and in 2025 they were simply uncompetitive, slipping to seventh in the championship from fifth the previous two years.Newey's arrival was supposed to herald the start of the turnaround, especially as historically he has aced regulation changes, producing design philosophies that were followed by rivals - in 1998 with McLaren, and again in 2009 and 2022 with Red Bull.The biggest rule change in F1 history for 2026 gave him the chance to do it again, this time for Aston Martin.But the first car produced under his leadership has fallen far short of expectations, and a glance at the context makes this less of a surprise than it appears on the surface.In F1, success comes from stability, and that is the last thing Aston Martin have had in the past few years. There has been major leadership churn, and right at the top, too.This has included new recruits, such as chief technical officer Enrico Cardile, who finally arrived in July after a year on gardening leave from Ferrari.But also casualties. The most recent was Andy Cowell, the architect of the success of the Mercedes engine in the hybrid era. He was installed as chief executive officer only in October 2024, but just over a year later, after a clash with Newey, was demoted to a different role.Cowell is now spending much of his time in Japan, trying to help Honda sort itself out.Aston Martin were already playing down expectations when they had their official team launch in early February, emphasising the project would need time to become successful.Newey has explained that his starting in March left them some months behind other teams in terms of development.The new 2026 aerodynamic regulations were finally officially published on 2 January 2025, two months before Newey officially started work at Aston Martin.In reality, teams have been working on their 2026 cars for much longer than that. The basics of the cars' layouts in the rules had been known for some time, and the teams had all been in working groups refining the detail with governing body the FIA, so knew where they were going.The word is that when Newey arrived in March 2025, he effectively ordered a redesign of the car on the basis of his ideas. So the current car is several months, at least, behind all its rivals in terms of development. With that sort of deficit, even he cannot work miracles.Newey has described the Aston Martin as \"one of the more extreme interpretations\" of this year's new rules.Right now, in its under-developed form, there is no question it is uncompetitive - slow and unpredictable. It may yet turn out that it can be developed into a good car, but until Honda sorts itself out, it will be hard to tell.Honda's plight has brought back painful memories of a decade ago. When it returned to F1 in 2015 with McLaren, it was underprepared, and spent three difficult seasons with engines that were underpowered and unreliable. The similarities with now are unmistakable.Why it is so unprepared this time is less understandable.Honda officially pulled out of F1 at the end of 2021, when Max Verstappen took a Red Bull powered by their engine to his first world title.It announced its return to F1 with Aston Martin in May 2023.The argument given to explain now being so far behind is that Honda's F1 engine project was essentially disbanded and the engineers involved reallocated to other areas of the company in the 15 months between the two dates.However, it's not like Honda went away. Both Red Bull teams continued to use its engines until the end of last year.Although there was a development freeze, the engine was still being upgraded each year because F1's regulations allowed modifications for reliability reasons. Every manufacturer in F1 uses this loophole to produce performance upgrades in the name of improved reliability.If Honda had not been doing this, it would have fallen behind progressively from 2022 to 2025, which it did not.On top of that, Honda representatives were involved in meetings about the new engine rules all the way through - hence their U-turn on involvement in early 2023.Still, the argument is that without a fully dedicated F1 engine department, Honda lacked a team designing and building a new engine to the revised rules for this year, and had to build one up again more or less from scratch.But so did Red Bull. In 2020, when they announced their decision to build their own engine factory, they had nothing. The original plan was to go into partnership with Porsche, but that deal foundered by late summer 2022.Considering Red Bull had to build a powertrains factory from literally nothing in this period, and recruit an entirely new staff, their timeline is not that dissimilar from Honda's.So why is Honda so far away from where it wants to be? No answer to that has been provided.A new car and engine partnership with Honda that struggles for reliability and performance and has Alonso as one of the drivers. If that sounds familiar, it's because it is.In 2015, Alonso joined McLaren from Ferrari wooed by the promise of Honda's potential. That potential was eventually realised - but not until 2020-21, by which time Honda and McLaren had long since split and Honda had joined forces with Red Bull.Alonso's career, meanwhile, became a kind of living purgatory. One of the greatest drivers the sport has ever known reduced to fighting for scraps, making up his own targets for motivation, rather than what he should have been gunning for - wins and titles in F1.He last won a race in May 2013, and he is now 44. But his performances have continued on a high level, and the respect he has from his peers on the grid is higher than ever. For his talent, and his ability to keep up his motivation in the face of everything.The Newey-Honda-Aston Martin combination on paper promised Alonso something positive, a last hope of a return to success with which to bring his storied career to a close. Either this year, when his current contract runs out, or perhaps after one more, if glory seemed tangible.Instead, he has found himself transported back in time 10 years.Alonso has waited an entire career to work with Newey, the excellence of whose cars - and some terrible luck - have denied the Spaniard at least two further world titles that he should have won.Alonso won't doubt Newey can sort this out. Who would? But after his experiences with Honda last time, can he really convince himself it can turn this around in the limited time he surely still has available?In public, Alonso is staying hopeful, just as he did with McLaren and Honda, bar one or two public slips when it all got too much.\"Everything can be fixed, for sure,\" he says. \"Short and medium term. I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\"We will try to fix everything we can before Australia and after that we try to fix as many things as possible in the first couple of races. Because [otherwise] it's too late in the championship. But no, I'm optimistic. I think there is a solution in place.\"Alonso's partner Melissa Jimenez is expecting their first child in late March.The emergence of the unfolding catastrophe that is Aston Martin-Honda is so recent he has not yet been asked about his thoughts on his future. But he will already be considering what to do.Does he roll the dice one last time, try to summon the energy and commitment to go again after what will doubtless be a very trying year? Or call it quits?",

There is absolutely no truth whatsoever in any such suggestion.\"We have asked the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] for the evidence relied upon to justify the arrest. \"Peter Mandelson's overriding priority is to cooperate with the police investigation, as he has done throughout this process, and to clear his name.\"Lord Mandelson was arrested on Monday afternoon and taken to Wandsworth police station in London for interview.He was at the police station for nine hours before being released on bail in the early hours of Tuesday morning.The force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.The arrest on Monday followed search warrants at two addresses in Wiltshire and Camden.The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.On Monday, Lord Mandelson was seen being led away from his London home by plain clothes officers who put him in the back of an unmarked car.The BBC understands his arrest was carried out by officers from the Met's central specialist crime division.Consultations between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service are ongoing.The Met said Lord Mandelson has been bailed to the end of May.The former Labour spin doctor has been a high profile figure in British politics for decades.He began working for Labour in the 1980s, playing a key role in the New Labour movement and Sir Tony Blair's landslide election victory in 1997.Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.An email from 2009 appears to show that Lord Mandelson passed on an assessment by an adviser to the then prime minister Gordon Brown about policy measures, including an \"asset sales plan\".He also appeared to discuss a tax on bankers' bonuses and confirm an imminent bailout package for the Euro on the day before it was announced in 2010.",

Trybus, a software consultant and developer, denies the charges. He said that Baird had been diagnosed as possibly having PTSD, having witnessed and suffered from armed car-jacking incidents in South Africa.The prosecutor said: \"Other things that Tarryn Baird said about the nature of the relationship were that the defendant had told her parents she was addicted to drugs and alcohol, and that this would prevent them believing her if she told them about the domestic abuse.\"He described this as \"classic domestic abuse perpetrator behaviour\".The trial continues.More on this story",

    "body": "On Tuesday, temperatures in High Beach in Essex and Frittenden in Kent reached 16.6C.In Kinloss, in Moray, 13.7C was recorded. In Wales and Northern Ireland, temperatures fell a little short of those recorded at the weekend but still reached 15.2C and 13.4C in Hawarden and Helen's Bay respectively. The mercury could rise a little further still on Wednesday in south-east England with a small chance of 18C (64F) in the best of the sunshine. Northern Ireland may also be a little warmer than on Tuesday,  following a wet start.In the north and west of the UK there will be more cloud and some rain, but temperatures even here will still be above average.To put this warmer weather into context - the last time the temperature reached 18C was 13 November 2025, and the record for February is 21.2C (70.2F) on 26 February 2019 at Kew Gardens.Wednesday is likely to be the peak of the warmth this week, with temperatures back to near average on the last day on February and a possible frost for many on Friday night.",

    "body": "3 hours agoGetty ImagesA Fabergé egg - not the one pictured - was among items in the victim's stolen handbagA man has admitted stealing a handbag containing a Fabergé egg and watch thought to be worth more than £2m.Enzo Conticello, 29, of no fixed address, stole from the victim in Soho, central London, on 7 November 2024, Southwark Crown Court heard.The handbag also contained a laptop and credit cards, which Conticello subsequently used to purchase cigarettes and other goods at supermarkets in the Soho area. The court heard the Fabergé egg had not been located.Conticello admitted theft and three charges of fraud by misrepresentation. He was remanded into custody to next appear at the same court on 6 March.Fabergé is a world-renowned jeweller founded in Russia more than two centuries ago, famous for its eggs made of gems and precious metals.Addressing Conticello, also known as Hakin Boudjenoune, after he pleaded guilty, Judge Martin Griffiths said: \"I expect it was probably quite a surprise to you when you discovered that egg.\"What you did with it, I don't quite know, but I expect we're going to find out.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "1 hour agoLynette HorsburghNorth WestBBCAdam Mitula has been suspended by Reform UKA Reform UK activist who had been campaigning ahead of Thursday's Gorton and Denton by-election has been suspended over racist and antisemitic comments he made on social media.For several days Reform UK refused to say whether Adam Mitula, an interim campaign manager in the Tameside area, had been suspended from the party but Mitula confirmed it on Monday.It comes after evidence was published appearing to show he posted a highly offensive racial slur aimed at black people, and also made what appeared to be a derogatory remark about Jewish women.He also appears to have agreed with a Holocaust denier that the number of Jewish people murdered by the Nazis had been exaggerated. Mitula said his comments have been taken out of context.Disciplinary processHe claimed he was defending the Jewish community.The allegations against Mitula were based on information gathered by the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate, apparently from his X account, which he has now deleted.Mitula said: \"I'm confirming my suspension as a Reform member pending investigation. \"The comments in question were taken out of context, and actually defended the Jewish community.\"He added later he had \"no comment\" to make on the racial slur he used in relation to black people.Reform UK said: \"With regard to Adam Mitula, our disciplinary process is confidential and we do not provide a running commentary on any potential cases that are being considered.\"There are more than 76,000 potential voters in the Gorton and Denton by-election spread across Denton in Tameside, and Gorton, Levenshulme and Burnage in Manchester.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDanielle HerbertandAngela Ferguson,BBC WalesReutersSnoop Dogg is in Swansea to watch the game against Preston North End laterStaff at a business in Swansea have said it was \"absolutely nuts\" to have American rapper Snoop Dogg perform a full hour private set of \"back to back classics\" in their canteen.The hip hop star and Swansea City FC co-owner did the invitation-only gig at the canteen at the Au Vodka headquarters in the city, ahead of attending his first home game at the club's stadium later.The canteen, where staff were playing ping pong and pool just 24 hours earlier, was transformed into a nightclub with more than 400 guests.Au Vodka co-owner, Jackson Quinn said: \"We will all remember this until we are looking back on this in our 80s saying 'I can't believe Snoop played in our office'.\"Quinn said it was \"absolutely nuts\" as the global star was only meant to do a DJ set originally but his performance turned into \"an hour of back to back classics\", amid cheers from the crowd.Au Vodka co-owner, Charlie Morgan said the gig was \"really last minute but almost every member of their staff was there\", as well as friends, family and local influencers.Au VodkaNot quite 'another day at the office', as Snoop Dogg performs a DJ setThe appearance came about through the pairs' business partner and DJ, Charlie Sloth who has access to \"the hip hop rap world\", they said.Among the guests at the event were Welsh boxer Joe Cordina and former Swans striker Lee Trundle.Speaking on the impact of Snoop Dogg's investment in Swansea City and on local businesses in Swansea, Quinn said:  \"It's amazing for putting Swansea on the map. That's something we actively aim to do all the time.\"He's a global name and maybe one of the most famous people in the world.Morgan and Sloth said they would both be attending the game tonight and wre \"hopeful for a win\".ReutersSnoop Dogg arriving at the Swansea City ground ahead of his first home gameSnoop Dogg has asked fans to serenade him by twirling towels on his first visit to the club.The American rapper, who is a minority owner of the Sky Bet Championship club alongside American television host Martha Stewart and Croatia international Luka Modric, will make his first appearance at the Swansea.com Stadium at the Championship clash with Preston North End on Tuesday evening.He has requested a sold-out crowd to be in their seats ahead of kick-off to twirl the complimentary towels – a staple action for supporters in American sport.A post on Swansea's official X account read: \"@SnoopDogg is asking the Jack Army to join him in a pre-match towel twirl this evening.\"Fans are encouraged to be in their seats 20 minutes before kick-off, and to twirl the towels as Snoop walks on the pitch.\"The post was accompanied by a short video of the 54-year-old showing how he would like fans to do it.His visit was announced last week and he said on the club's official website: \"I know it has been a long time coming, but I cannot wait to finally make my first visit to Swansea.\"From the moment we talked about me becoming an owner, I have been looking forward to the chance to be with you all at the Swansea.com Stadium.\"I have heard so many great things about the atmosphere, especially when we play under the lights.\"ReutersSwansea City co-owner Snoop Dogg on the pitch with a football before the matchSnoop added: \"When I watched the Wrexham game, where we showed we are the capital of Welsh football, the noise in the stadium sounded incredible even from over 5,000 miles away. I can't wait to be a part of it.\"Tom Gorringe, chief executive of Swansea City, said Snoop had been at the training ground on Monday and he and his group were \"really excited\" about being here.\"It's not just a gimmick, he buys into what the club means and what it means to the wider city,\" he told BBC Wales.He said there had been a huge amount of commercial interest.\"We're operating at a level we haven't done probably ever before, even in the Premier League days, in terms of our commercial swing and the brands we're speaking to.\" The rapper hit headlines at the Winter Olympics, where he was an honorary coach for Team USA as well as a special correspondent for broadcaster NBC, when he asked British curlers Bruce Mouat and Jennifer Dodds for a photo.Snoop Dogg, known for hits like Gin and Juice, has had a successful three-decade music career, having topped the UK charts and received 16 Grammy nominations.More top stories",

    "body": "4 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesGPs in England will have to guarantee same-day appointments for any patient with urgent health needs, under a new clause being added to their contract.The government said the changes would ensure everyone who needs to be seen quickly would be.Spending on GP services will increase by nearly £500 million - a 3.6% boost in cash terms - to help pay for the commitment, which the government said will be used to help recruit more  doctors.But the British Medical Association said the government was at risk of creating unrealistic expectations given how stretched GP services already were.GPs already set aside a chunk of their daily appointments to try to ensure patients who need an immediate appointment can get one.But, currently, there is no requirement to measure how many patients who need a same-day appointment get one.From April it will become a contractual requirement to monitor this and achieve it in 90% of cases. The 10% leeway is being built in to reflect that some patients may not be able to make a same-day appointment or may call too late in the day to be realistically given one. Urgent cases are being defined as any patient whose symptoms suggest they need treatment to start the same day or where there is a risk of deterioration if they aren't assessed, such as a child with a high fever and a rash, or a frail older person who has suddenly become confused.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"We are fixing the front door to the NHS. Many more patients with urgent needs will be able to get an appointment the day they contact their practice.\"But he told the BBC: \"Where practices are struggling and falling short we're not going in there to beat people over the heads, we're going in there to support and to share excellent practice from those who are doing really well with same-day urgent access, making sure that we roll that out.\"It marks the latest in a series of changes to the way primary care services work. Last year the government ordered GPs to introduce online booking for non-urgent cases, which it said would solve the so-called \"8am scramble\" to get through on the phone.The boost in funding, which is in line with the wider increase in the NHS budget that was announced in last year's spending review, will bring spending on GP services close to £14 billion.'Unreaslistic'This is not the first time a Labour government has tried to set a target for immediate access. In 2000, a 48-hour target was set, but by the 2005 election campaign it was causing controversy, with patients complaining that they could not book an appointment in advance because so many were being held back for quick bookings.The BMA's GPs committee chair, Dr Katie Bramall, said the government was at risk of creating \"unrealistic expectations\", pointing out GP services were already stretched.While the number of GPs working in the NHS has been increasing over the last year or so, the number of patients per GP is still a fifth higher than it was eight years ago.And Office for National Statistics surveys shows only one in five patients believe services have got better in the past year. The majority say they have neither improved or got worse.Dr Bramall said the BMA had not had an opportunity to negotiate with the government about the changes.Its GPs committee is due to meet on Thursday to decide whether it should challenge the imposition of the contract.Chris McCann, of the patient watchdog Healthwatch England, said: \"The new contract will be welcome news for people who have struggled to access GP services.\"Plans to recruit more doctors should make it easier for patients to get appointments and ensure urgent cases are handled more quickly.\"People consistently tell us that GP services are becoming harder to use and that simply getting through the door for care can be a challenge.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoBrandon DrenonSavannah Guthrie offers $1m reward for information on missing motherUS news anchor Savannah Guthrie has announced her family is offering a $1m reward for information leading to the return of her mother on day 24 of the search for the 84-year-old.Fighting back tears, the NBC host said in an Instagram video that they are \"aching\" for Nancy Guthrie, who is suspected to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona.\"We still believe in a miracle, we still believe that she can come home - hope against hope,\" said the presenter.\"We also know that she may be lost, she may already be gone, she may have already gone home to the Lord that she loves.\"In the video released on Tuesday morning, Savannah Guthrie said her family would also donate $500,000 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.She continued: \"Please, if you hear this message, if you've been waiting and you haven't been sure, let this be your sign to please come forward. \"Tell what you know, and help us bring our beloved mom home, so that we can either celebrate a glorious, miraculous homecoming or celebrate the beautiful, brave and courageous and noble life that she has lived.\"ReutersIn a post on X, the FBI's Phoenix office said anyone with \"firsthand knowledge\" of Guthrie's whereabouts should contact the FBI tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI.Until now, the reward has been $200,000 - $100,000 offered by the FBI and another $100,000 through Tucson Crime Stoppers.Guthrie was reported missing around midday on 1 February after she did not show up for church services.The Pima County Sheriff's Office has said they believe she was \"taken from the home against her will, possibly in the middle of the night and that includes possible kidnapping or abduction\".The family has made several public pleas for her safe return, and asked for proof that she is alive. Nancy Guthrie has difficulty walking, has a pacemaker and needs daily medication for a heart condition, authorities have said.Investigators have released images of the prime suspect - a man captured on Nancy Guthrie's Nest doorbell camera. Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homeThis same suspect appears to have been at Nancy Guthrie's front door on another occasion before she went missing, a law enforcement source told the BBC's US partner CBS.Purported ransom notes demanding about $6m in cryptocurrency have been sent to media outlets, including one note whose deadline expired on 9 February. At least one note was a fake, allegedly sent by a 42-year-old California man, who has been charged. Massive interest in the case has turned Tuscon - a relatively quiet city popular with retirees - into a global media hub. Dozens of curious observers and amateur sleuths have descended on the area. Detectives have received close to 40,000 tips from the public.DNA evidence was recovered from a glove - similar to one worn by the suspect recorded on doorbell camera footage  - that was found not far from her home, but it yielded no matches in a FBI database, authorities said.Investigators have ruled out all members of the Guthrie family as possible suspects, with Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos previously saying that to \"suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoCachella SmithandGeorge WrightPA MediaDavid Lammy has outlined a number of new measures in order to reduce the backlogThe crown court backlog in England and Wales will continue to rise and may be at the same level at the next general election despite a new package of reforms, Justice Secretary David Lammy has told the BBC.The measures being introduced to Parliament on Wednesday include lifting the cap on court sitting days, ramping up the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and introducing so-called \"Blitz courts\" which will list similar cases together.The government has previously announced plans to scrap jury trials for some offences, prompting criticism from opposition MPs and legal groups.The backlog currently is at 80,000 cases, but the Ministry of Justice has warned not acting now could mean it reaches more than 200,000 by 2035.In a speech on Tuesday, Lammy said: \"The court backlog has clearly become far too large and delays have become far too long.\"Today, we are calling time on that system - and consigning it to the past.\"\"I want to see the backlog coming down by the next election, but [...] I'll be honest with you, it is not down substantially until we get into the 2030s,\" Lammy told Newscast.\"It's not until it [comes into] the statute books at the end of next year, beginning of 2027, that we can get on and see the reforms.\"It's for that reason that it takes some time for this to kick in.\"Plans to scrap the sitting day cap have been largely welcomed.The Criminal Bar Association described it as a \"significant\" first step but said further action was needed on recruitment and retention of criminal barristers and solicitors.The MoJ also wants to see greater use of AI for tasks such as transcribing hearings, and \"Blitz courts\" - which will list similar cases together in a bid to streamline court resources and expertise.Lammy first announced in December that jury trials in England and Wales for crimes that carry a likely sentence of less than three years will be scrapped.It followed a recommendation in Sir Brian Leveson's review of the court system that the right to a jury trial was scaled back.But Shadow Justice Secretary Nick Timothy said on Tuesday: \"There is no hiding the fact that Lammy is rushing ahead with his plans to abolish jury trials. Labour have no mandate to do this and there is no need for it either.\"Lammy still has not explained how he will improve court efficiency around issues like recruitment and retention, courtroom productivity, and case management.\"Jess Brown-Fuller, the Liberal Democrats' justice spokesperson, said her party also did not support judge-only trials, while the Law Society of England and Wales said the proposals \"go too far\".\"The backlogs in our courts need to be tackled urgently and additional investment and resources and a commitment to Sir Brian Leveson's recommendations are welcome,\" immediate past president Richard Atkinson said.\"However, the government's proposals go too far in eroding the longstanding right to be judged by a jury of our own peers.\"The government has agreed a £2.7bn funding for courts and tribunals for the next year, up from £2.5bn last year.It follows the publication of the final stage of Sir Brian Leveson's review earlier in February.Sir Brian warned of a court system \"on the brink of collapse\" and issued 130 efficiency recommendations, some of which will be brought in to Parliament through the new Bill.Among his concerns was a \"crumbling\" court estate – which \"suffers from chronic underinvestment, with a £1.3 billion maintenance backlog\".Lammy said on Tuesday that court maintenance funding would be boosted to almost £150m for the next financial year.",

    "body": "7 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, News OnlineEPAThe prison break happened as a wave of violence rocked Puerto Vallarta and towns and cities in 19 other statesPolice in Mexico are searching a number of inmates sprung from a prison in Puerto Vallarta during a wave of attacks launched by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) on Sunday. Puerto Vallarta, a beach resort on Mexico's Pacific coast, was among the towns where the CJGN blockaded roads and torched cars in retaliation for the killing by security forces of their leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as \"El Mencho\".During the unrest, armed men rammed one of the prison gates with a car, paving the way for 23 prisoners to escape, an official said.More than 70 people – including 25 National Guard members – were killed in the operation to capture El Mencho and the violence which followed.Juan Pablo Hernández, security secretary for the state of Jalisco, said that his office was working with other states to capture the fugitives. Officials have not yet released details of the identities of the prisoners who escaped. Cartel members torched several vehicles across Puerto Vallarta on Sunday.Tourists and locals were urged to seek shelter and not venture out and footage they recorded showed black plumes of smoke rising above the popular beach resort.A number of airlines temporarily halted their flights and at least two major cruise liners said their ships would skip planned stops in Puerto Vallarta.The Mexican government said on Monday that most of the road blocks erected by cartel members had been cleared. But El Universal newspaper reports that in the state of Morelia, where drug lord El Mencho was born, armed men continued to spread fear on Monday, torching cars and vandalising shops and public buildings. BBC's Will Grant on the atmosphere in Mexico following unrestEl Mencho was Mexico's most wanted man. Under his leadership, the CJGN became a powerful transnational criminal organisation which spread from its stronghold in the state of Jalisco into many other Mexican states, where it engages in  drug production and trafficking.It often resorts to extreme violence and has been behind a number of high-profile attacks on the security forces and government officials. The Trump administration had described El Mencho as a \"top target for the Mexican and United States government as one of the top traffickers of fentanyl into our homeland\" and had offered a $15m (£11.1m) reward for information leading to his capture.The drug lord was captured by Mexican security forces in the town of Tapalpa, in Jalisco state, on Sunday.Mexico's defence minister said they were able to locate him by following one of his \"romantic partners\".He died shortly after being captured due to injuries in the firefight which broke out between his security guards and Mexico's special forces sent to arrest him.",

    "body": "Image caption, Why is the UK so cold now?Call it a cold snap or just typical British weather. One thing is certain, the weather outside is frightful, freezing, and just really cold.BBC Bitesize spoke to Dr Sylvia Knight, Head of Education at the Royal Meteorologist Society to answer all your cold weather questions.How cold does it have to be for snow?Image caption, The cold never bothered him anywayTo get snow, there has to be enough water vapour in the air to make clouds, and it must be cold enough (0°C) that snowflakes will form and not melt as they fall through the atmosphere to the ground.In the UK, we commonly get snow when the wind is blowing from the north or north east (for example, from the Arctic or Siberia). This air is then warmed from below as it approaches the UK, and rises further when it hits the coasts, hills and mountains.Once the air gets high enough, it cools again until it reaches the point where there is more condensation happening than evaporation - this makes clouds.As the UK is surrounded by sea, there is always plenty of moisture in the air for cloud to form.“It’s never too cold to snow in the UK,” says Dr Sylvia Knight, Head of Education at the Royal Meteorologist Society, “but it can be elsewhere in the world.”“It can be too cold for snow in the centre of large land masses, such as Eurasia, Antarctica or North America, where the wind has not encountered enough water that can easily evaporate.”Water vapour might be picked up over the oceans, such as the North Atlantic or Arctic ocean.“The rate of evaporation from lakes and rivers, which may be frozen, is far slower than from oceans,” Dr Sylvia says. “The oceans change temperature far more slowly than the land does, and so are a source of water vapour all year round compared to places where there is a lot of frozen water.”So, it's not too cold to snow in other places - it’s just too dry!How to tell between a common cold and the flu?Image caption, Should you starve a fever, feed a cold?While their symptoms are similar and they are both communicable viruses, colds and flu are quite different.Flu is characterised by a sudden fever, aches, pains and nausea, and avoiding rest can worsen symptoms and slow down recovery.Colds may make you feel lousy, but don’t always stop you from your day-to-day tasks and the symptoms should start to go away in the second week.You shouldn’t do is take antibiotics for either, as antibiotics fight against bacterial infections, they don’t treat viruses. It’s best to keep your fluids up for either, avoid sneezing on your hands, and eat if you can stomach it!Why don't gloves work on touch screens?Image caption, Woolly gloves are the enemyYou’re out playing in the snow and you need to check the Bitesize website - but oh no! Your woolly gloves act like a barrier between you and your phone screen. You can always get touch screen gloves - but how do they work?A capacitor is a device that has the ability to store electric charge.  Most phones and tablets have capacitive touchscreens - screens that have an insulator that is coated in a conductive material.Capacitors work by detecting anything that can store an electric charge. This includes you (think about when you rub your feet on the carpet and then get a static shock).When your finger comes into contact with a touchscreen, you create an electrical circuit between your body’s electrical field and the conductors in the screen. This ‘tells’ the conductors exactly where you’re touching.Touch screen gloves have conductive wire woven into the fingertips (usually copper yarn), which completes the circuit and allows the touch screen to detect your electrical field. Now you can stay warm and revise!Is it okay to wear a coat inside?Image caption, Staying warm this WinterSome people say you must take your coat off indoors, or you won’t feel the benefit when you go back outside. But is this true?When you wear a coat, you insulate yourself. This makes it harder for infrared radiation (heat) to escape from your body and be lost to the atmosphere. However, that coat also insulates you from heat coming in.“If you put a coat on when you’ve been inside for a while, you may get a bit warm, but you’ll be fine when you go outside and start slowly losing some of that extra warmth to the atmosphere,” says Dr Sylvia.However, she says you should take your coat off indoors for another reason. If you’ve been outside for a long time with your coat on, and are chilly when you come in, then the coat is also cold and will need to warm up. You’ll warm up far quicker without it on.How to stay safe while driving in icy conditions in the UK?Image caption, This icy barrier is no match for methanolUsing a de-icer is an important way to safe of the road. But how does it work?There are many different solutions of windscreen fluid, but the key ingredient to typical de-icer is methanol. This can be in bottle form so you can de-ice a windscreen manually, or in the washer system of the car itself.Methanol is a type of alcohol and is incredibly toxic to humans. It is diluted with water before it goes into the washer system, but it should definitely stay on the outside of the car and never be ingested.Methanol freezes way below sub-zero temperatures, and, when mixed with water, creates a solution which lowers the freezing point of moisture already on the windscreen. Using only water to de-ice the windscreen is counterproductive as there will just be more moisture on the screen to freeze again.Some cars have a washer system that heats the fluid before squirting it out. The methanol stops the warm water from freezing again on the windscreen. However, pouring boiling water over the windscreen can shatter the glass in cold conditions.Some people use vinegar or rubbing alcohol as an alternative to methanol solution, as they both have lower freezing point than water and are effective glass cleaners.The de-icer will always be more effective if you give the driver a hand in scraping their windows and windscreen first!Image caption, This gritter is the real winter soldierGrit saves the day, you might complain about getting stuck behind the winter service vehicles, but the school run would be an even bigger nightmare without them.While it’s called grit, most gritters actually use halite, also known as rock salt. But halite doesn’t actually melt snow the way heat does.Grit lowers the freezing point of moisture on the road surface, preventing snow from sticking in the first place.The moisture on the road mixes with the salt and creates a saline solution preventing snow or ice from building up.Technically you could use table salt to clear your driveway, but you’d have to get the timing and conditions right before too much ice builds up. Salting your drive before it’s too icy can help prevent slips and falls, but throwing salt at a pile of snow won’t work so well.Table salt is not exactly the same as halite - it’s refined for eating, so is treated to remove any impurities. Rock salt is already mined whole and does not undergo this process.This article was published in December 2019 and updated in November 2025",

    "body": "26 minutes agoChris MasonPolitical editorThe UK and its European neighbours confront two case studies, simultaneously, in how the continent is attempting, with varying degrees of success, to bind the United States into its future.Firstly, there is Ukraine and then there is Greenland.And all this at a time of deep scepticism in Washington about Europe: its importance, its outlook and its willingness to pull its weight to defend itself.The futures of Ukraine and Greenland, both in the headlines at the same time, are the latest example of the mesmerising, head-spinning unpredictability of President Trump.Privately, senior figures in London have a knowing look when the wild uncertainty of the White House crops up in conversation.Every day is a rollercoaster, with little sense of where tomorrow or next week's twist might take them, take us.This week's developments are particularly hard to read because outwardly they point in different directions.Seven European leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, issued a joint public statement emphasising, albeit in diplomatic language, their shared view that Washington's designs on Greenland are as absurd as they are counterproductive.We are on the same side, is the thrust of their message, and this is a waste of your energy because Greenland's future is for Greenlanders to decide.But boy they know too they should take President Trump seriously.And then there is Ukraine. European diplomats believe they have persuaded America to commit to being a significant part of securing a long term peace in Ukraine – something Europe has long regarded as a prerequisite to a sustainable settlement for Kyiv, but which Washington has long resisted.Now, sources tell me, they are cautiously optimistic they have the White House on board: the presence of President Trump's envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, in Paris, at the gathering of what is known as the Coalition of the Willing was unprecedented and seen as a key indicator of a shift from Washington.The accompanying document alongside the talks, while lacking in detail, spells out the anticipated role of America, and crucially, the UK and others.The first component of what is described as \"robust security guarantees for a solid and lasting peace in Ukraine\" is a \"US led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism\".I am told this would make use of America's advanced capabilities in what is described in military circles as \"ISR\" – intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. This means drones and satellites among other things. In other words: the advanced tools of modern warfare.Precisely what America's involvement could amount to, particularly if Ukraine was targeted by Russia again, isn't clear but Ukraine and European capitals do see this latest development as a significant step forward.Of course, a huge caveat remains: can peace be secured in the first place and would Ukraine be willing to give up on any of its territory? These are two massive and not yet answered questions.Then, for the UK and others, there is the prospect of troops on the ground in Ukraine. That is a profound commitment, provoking its own big, unanswered questions: how many and for how long? Can this maintain popular support? And with what consequences for the military and for defence budgets?Make no mistake this is a promise with implicit longevity attached: beyond this prime minister, beyond this government, beyond this American president.That is what the reality of European security is expected to look like in the years, decades ahead.\"A secure Ukraine is a secure Europe and a secure Europe is a secure UK,\" is how one Whitehall figure put it to me.Expect that to be a key part of the message in the months to come.Into the longer term, the UK and its neighbours will ponder how reliable or otherwise America will be: is the Trumpian era a blip or a waymarker towards an ongoing, unpredictable future?Oh, and what will the White House be saying on Greenland and Ukraine next week, next month, next year?",

    "body": "5 hours agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentCampaigners for assisted dying will ask the House of Lords to sit late or start early in order to pass the legislation in time.Concern is growing among supporters of the bill that it won't pass all its parliamentary hurdles in the allotted days.A motion in the Lords asks peers to agree that \"further time should be provided for consideration of the bill\".Extending the usual Friday debates is one likely option but that would anger some Jewish peers because the weekly religious Shabbat ceremony begins at sunset.Lord Shinkwin, who is disabled, has also previously said that because of his travel arrangements, sitting later on a Friday would be a \"a feeble fig leaf for discrimination against me\".If the House of Lords agrees to the motion, private negotiations between peers would then begin over when and how much extra time would be granted.Any decision would require agreement from the different sides in the Lords.Sources close to those opposed to the bill have suggested they would not agree to extra time.Members of the House of Lords have proposed more than 1,000 amendments to the bill – which experts believe is a record number for a bill proposed by a backbench MP.Supporters believe this is a delaying tactic. They argue peers, who are not elected, should respect the will of the House of Commons which passed the bill last year.Critics deny they are deliberately stalling the bill. They believe the bill does not protect vulnerable people and needs significant changes before becoming law.It must complete all its parliamentary stages before the next King's Speech, which the BBC revealed is expected in early May.If it does not pass all its hurdles before then, the bill will fall.However those behind the bill believe rarely used powers to limit the Lords' ability to block legislation could bring the bill back for a second time.The Parliament Acts mean that a bill can become law without the approval of peers, if it is rejected by the House of Lords in two consecutive parliamentary sessions.However, this would rely on either the government offering its own parliamentary time for the bill, or an MP willing to bring an identical bill being drawn near the top of a ballot for Private Members Bills at the start of the new session.The effect would be to delay the bill's passage into law until 2027.A source close to Kim Leadbeater – the backbench MP who introduced the bill – said: \"This issue has to be resolved. The time has come for Parliament to decide its view. It is far better for that to be now than we have to go through it all again.\"Thursday's motion, tabled by the bill's lead backer Lord Charlie Falconer, says that \"in order to allow the House to complete its scrutiny of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and return it to the Commons in reasonable time before the end of the current parliamentary session, further time should be provided for consideration of the Bill.\"Supporters believe it will put pressure on peers to speed up their debates. But many, including the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, remain implacably opposed.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

Named as the first storm of the year by French forecasters, the centre of Storm Goretti is due to pass either through the English Channel or over the English Channel coastal counties, according to BBC Weather.The storm is still expected mainly impact England and Wales - with the biggest chance of significant snow through Wales and the Midlands, where there will be 5 to 10cm.Goretti will likely undergo \"explosive cyclogenesis\" on Thursday -  sometimes called a \"weather bomb\".The term is used where the central pressure drops by 1mb an hour over a 24 hour period. Explosive cyclogenesis is generally a sign of a storm that could bring strong winds.What’s the best way to de-ice your car windscreen?The cold weather looks set to continue until at least the end of the week and there will be the chance of further snow in places.The greatest likelihood of significant snow will be through Wales and the Midlands where there will be 5-10cm, and perhaps in excess of 20cm, especially into the hills.Tuesday saw widespread disruption with hundreds of school closures and disruption on train services including the Eurostar and London North Eastern Railway (LNER).In Scotland, snow ploughs were used to clear some train tracks but ScotRail services experienced significant disruption.Aberdeenshire council declared a major incident and warned of \"a prolonged period of significant impacts\".The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued amber cold health alerts for England which will run until Sunday.Further weather warnings are in place for later in the week including a yellow snow warning for parts of Wales and England on Thursday.The wintry conditions have triggered the government's cold weather payments across 451 postcodes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Under the scheme, households on certain benefits receive £25 automatically if the temperature is their local area is recorded or forecast as 0C or below for seven consecutive days.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has celebrated the commitment as a \"huge step forward\".The Times echoes the Metro with \"boots on the ground in Ukraine\" in its main headline. The paper carries quotes from PM Keir Starmer saying an end to the conflict with Russia is \"closer than ever\". A photo of a dancing President Trump is splashed across the front page. The president claims deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro copied his moves before he was seized, the paper notes. The Guardian says European leaders have \"dramatically rallied together\" in support of Denmark over Greenland, as the Trump administration underlines its interest in acquiring the Arctic territory. The paper also says British and French troops posted to Ukraine after any future peace deal would be \"unlikely to engage directly with Russian forces should Moscow relaunch an invasion\".The Independent also leads with the possibility of British troops in Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, noting that US envoy Jared Kushner said Trump \"strongly, strongly, strongly\" supports the deal.The Sun leads with \"one for the road\" with the government set to propose tighter drink-driving limits in England and Wales, to bring them in line with Scotland. Lowering the threshold from its current 35mcg of alcohol per 100ml of breath to 22mcg would be the first change to the limit since 1967, the paper notes.\"Drink-drive changes to kill off rural pubs\" declares the Daily Telegraph. It says Labour is planning to cut the alcohol limit \"after raising taxes and minimum wage\". Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for the West Midlands Police Chief to resign following the banning of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a Birmingham football match.The Daily Mirror takes a different tack to the Telegraph, calling government plans to tighten alcohol limits part of a \"drive to safety\". The changes will \"cut crashes and save lives\", it says. Also on the Mirror's front, ex-Little Mix star Jesy Nelson's call for expanded testing of babies for a rare muscle condition has been praised by Health Secretary Wes Streeting.Following a car crash in which one teen died and another survived, police mixed up the fates of the two boys telling the wrong family about the death in a \"blunder to defy belief\", the Daily Mail writes.

Ofcom has said it is having \"urgent talks\" with the platform on the basis of \"serious concerns\".For the Daily Star \"Kaleb's true grit\" leads as Jeremy Clarkson's \"pal\" is \"on snow patrol\". The paper also hints at a \"secret Traitor exclusive\". The \"major snow storm blast\" approaching Britain also tops the Daily Express. Storm Goretti is a rare \"multi-hazard\" event of that will lash the nation with wind, snow and rain. Also on the front, there is \"fury over PM's plan to unpick our Brexit\", the paper declares.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "1 hour agoJude SheerinWashingtonWatch: What Trump and Vance have said about GreenlandUS President Donald Trump has been discussing \"a range of options\" to acquire Greenland, including use of the military, the White House said.The White House told the BBC that acquiring Greenland - a semi-autonomous region of fellow Nato member Denmark – was a \"national security priority\".The statement came hours after European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark, which has been pushing back against Trump's ambitions for the Arctic island.Trump repeated over the weekend that the US \"needed\" Greenland for security reasons, prompting Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to warn that any attack by the US would spell the end of Nato.The White House said on Tuesday: \"The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the Commander-in-Chief's disposal.\"Nato is a trans-Atlantic military group where allies are expected to go to each other's aid in case of external attacks.On Tuesday, six European allies expressed support for Denmark.\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Denmark said in a joint statement.Stressing they were as keen as the US in Arctic security, the European signatories of the joint statement said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen welcomed the statement and called for \"respectful dialogue\".\"The dialogue must take place with respect for the fact that Greenland's status is rooted in international law and the principle of territorial integrity,\" Nielsen said.The issue of Greenland's future resurfaced in the wake of the US military intervention in Venezuela, during which elite troops went in to seize the country's President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York.A day after that raid, Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's senior aides - posted a map on social media of Greenland in the colours of the American flag, alongside the word \"SOON\".On Monday, her husband, Stephen Miller, said it was \"the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US\".Asked repeatedly in an interview with CNN whether America would rule out using force to annex it, Miller responded: \"Nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland.\"An unnamed US senior official told Reuters news agency that the American options included the outright purchase of Greenland or forming a Compact of Free Association with the territory.In response, a state department spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday that the US \"is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland\".\"Our common adversaries have been increasingly active in the Arctic. That is a concern that the United States, the Kingdom of Denmark, and NATO Allies share,\" the spokesperson said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also told lawmakers at a classified briefing on Capitol Hill on Monday that the Trump administration did not plan to invade Greenland, but mentioned buying it from Denmark, the Wall Street Journal reports.Greenland and Denmark previously said they had asked to meet Rubio quickly to discuss the American claims on the island.Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said speaking with America's top diplomat should resolve \"certain misunderstandings\".Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, emphasised the national security aspect when he spoke to the BBC on Tuesday.\"I think they're just in talks right now,\" he said. \"My hope is that Europe would understand that a strong America is good - it's good for Western civilisation.\"Republican Senator Schmitt to the BBC: It's \"important\" US moves forward with acquiring GreenlandTrump floated his idea of acquiring Greenland as a strategic US hub in the Arctic during his first presidential term, saying in 2019: \"Essentially it's a large real estate deal.\"There is growing interest from Russia and China in the island, which has untapped rare earth deposits, as melting ice raises the possibility of new trade routes.In March, Trump said America would \"go as far as we have to go\" to get control of the territory.During a congressional hearing last summer, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth was asked if the Pentagon had plans to take Greenland by force if necessary, and he said they \"have plans for any contingency\". Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands.While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US, which already has a military base on the island.Morgan Angaju, 27, an Inuit living in Ilulissat in the west region of the country, told the BBC it had been \"terrifying to listen to the leader of the free world laughing at Denmark and Greenland and just talking about us like we're something to claim\".\"We are already claimed by the Greenlandic people. Kalaallit Nunaat means the land of the Greenlandic people,\" Morgan said.He added that he was worried about what happens next - wondering whether Greenland's prime minister may suffer the same fate as Maduro - or even about the US \"invading our country\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoJaroslav LukivandWyre Davies,KyivThe UK and France have signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is made with Russia, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced.After talks with Ukraine's allies in Paris, he said the UK and France would \"establish military hubs across Ukraine\" to deter future invasion, while French President Emmanuel Macron later said thousands of troops may be deployed.Allies also largely agreed robust security guarantees for Ukraine and proposed that the US would take the lead in monitoring a truce. But the key issue of territory is still being discussed.Russia has repeatedly warned that any foreign troops in Ukraine would be a \"legitimate target\". Moscow has not yet commented on the announcements made in the French capital.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.Heads of state and top officials from the \"Coalition of the Willing\" took part in Tuesday's talks in Paris.Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, Starmer said: \"We signed a declaration of intent on the deployment of forces to Ukraine in the event of a peace deal.\"This is a vital part of our commitment to stand with Ukraine for the long-term.\"It paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French, and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil, securing Ukraine's skies and seas, and regenerating Ukraine's armed forces for the future.\" The UK prime minister added London would participate in any US-led verification of a potential ceasefire. Top US negotiator Steve Witkoff said \"durable security guarantees and robust prosperity commitments are essential to a lasting peace\" in Ukraine - referring to a key demand made by Kyiv.Witkoff said the allies \"largely finished\" their work on agreeing security protocols \"so that people of Ukraine know that when this [war] ends, it ends forever\".Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's special envoy and son-in-law, said that after a deal Ukrainians needed to know that \"real backstops\" were in place to ensure war would \"not happen again\".Meanwhile, President Macron said Ukraine's allies had made \"considerable progress\" at the talks. He said \"robust\" security guarantees for Kyiv had been agreed in the event of a potential ceasefire.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a \"huge step forward\" had been made in Paris, but added that he would only consider efforts to be \"enough\" if they resulted in the end of the war.What Ukraine calls security \"guarantees\" and what American officials have described as security \"protocols\" may leave some wiggle room for Trump in the event of coming to Kyiv's defence after a future Russian attack - but there is no doubt Zelensky feels he and his European allies have secured an important concession from Washington.We heard few, if any, new details about where a future ceasefire line would be drawn and what territory, currently occupied by Russian forces, Ukraine would agree to surrender. That prospect is still something many Ukrainians would find hard to swallow, especially as Russia continues to strike against cities and critical infrastructure across Ukraine on a daily basis.But as the snows fall and bitter winds sweep in from the east, Zelensky knows the only alternative to a ceasefire and subsequent peace deal, is another costly, attritional winter of warfare with the inevitable loss of life that will hit Ukraine far harder than Russia.Ukraine's president clearly hopes that guarantees of American monitoring, a multinational force on Ukrainian soil and more weapons support for his armed forces, will convince a sometimes-sceptical population that he is right to sue for peace, bolstered by a growing international coalition.But, in concluding the Paris press conference, Zelensky acknowledged Tuesday's \"milestone\" did not necessarily guarantee peace. Real progress still needs Russian support, and Moscow has been notably silent in recent days about diplomatic efforts to end the war.Putin is known to oppose the prospect of a European-led international force in any disputed areas and will be reluctant to halt his troops', albeit slow, advance if Moscow's war objectives have not been realised. But pressure is undoubtedly growing on both sides to make compromises and end the war.Last week, Zelensky said a peace deal was \"90% ready\". Agreeing on the remaining 10% would \"determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe\".Territory and security guarantees have been at the forefront of unresolved issues for negotiators.Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war.Zelensky has so far ruled out ceding any territory, but has suggested that Ukraine could withdraw its troops to an agreed point - but only if Russia does the same.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas.The original US-led 28-point peace plan widely leaked to the media last year was seen by Kyiv and its European allies as being heavily skewed in Russia's favour.This triggered weeks of intensive high-level diplomacy - with Ukraine, the US and European leaders trying to amend the draft.Last month, Kyiv sent the US an updated 20-point plan - as well as separate documents outlining potential security guarantees and provisions for Ukraine's reconstruction, Zelensky said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKaty Austin,Transport correspondentandEmer Moreau,Business reporterGetty ImagesLearner drivers could have to practise for up to six months before they are allowed to sit their practical testLearner drivers in England and Wales could face a minimum period of up to six months between sitting their theory and practical tests, the BBC can reveal.The government will unveil the measure, which will be subject to consultation, as part of its wider road safety strategy launched on Wednesday.The strategy will include proposals for a lower drink-driving limit in England and Wales, to bring them in line with Scotland. The shake-up of driving laws is aimed at reducing the number of people killed or badly injured on Britain's roads by 65% over the next decade, and by 70% for children under 16.Around a fifth of all deaths or serious injuries from crashes involved a young car driver in 2024.The government believes a minimum period between sitting the theory test and the practical test would help learner drivers develop their skills, including driving in different conditions.The Department for Transport will consult on three or six months for the minimum learning period.It would include any informal learning they may do with parents or guardians as well as formal lessons with a driving instructor.Evidence from other countries suggests minimum learning periods could reduce collisions by up to 32%. Currently, learner drivers can take lessons from 17 and book a practical test as soon as they have passed a theory exam. The majority of driving tests in Britain are taken by under-25s. In 2024-25, about 55% of tests were taken by drivers aged 17-24.Learner drivers currently face a waiting time of around six months to take their practical tests anyway, due to a backlog from the Covid pandemic. The backlog is expected to last until late 2027.The proposed changes could see an end to teenagers passing their tests days after turning 17, meaning the youngest drivers would be at least 17 and a half.Graduated driving licencesThere have been vociferous campaigns for \"graduated driving licences\" (GDLs) to be introduced in the UK. Different countries have varying types of GDLs, such as not allowing newly qualified drivers to carry passengers or not letting them drive at night.Proponents of GDLs include some parents of young people who have died on the roads.Sharron Huddleston started campaigning for GDLs to be introduced eight years ago after her daughter Caitlin was killed in a crash aged 18.Sharron's daughter Caitlin was killed in a car being driven by a novice driverSharron supports the proposed minimum learning period but said: \"We need the post-test safety precautions as well.\"The driver, Skye Mitchell, who was also killed, had passed her test four months earlier. Sharron believes Caitlin \"would still be here\" if the UK had graduated driving licences which forbade newly qualified, young drivers from carrying passengers their own age.\"All the girls [in the car] were 18,\" she said. \"This is the strongest element of a graduated driving licence that would save many young lives.\"The AA has welcomed the measures announced by the government, but said not introducing GDLs was \"a missed opportunity\".Its president Edmund King told the BBC that \"all the evidence, from Australia, from Canada, from other countries\" shows that limiting the number of same-age passengers in a car for six months \"will save lives\".He said of the learning period: \"That will help, but the question is: does it go far enough?\"The road safety strategy also contains plans to cut deaths by reducing speeding, drink and drug driving, not wearing seat belts and mobile phone use.As well as bringing the legal limit in line with Scotland, novice drivers would have an even lower limit, which is already the case in Northern Ireland.Technology, including built-in breathalysers that would prevent drunk drivers starting cars, will form a key plank of the strategy.The government is also proposing new powers to suspend driving licences for people suspected of drink or drug-driving offences.The BBC revealed in October that further research into headlight glare would be included in the strategy.Twenty-one-year-old Alisa Fielder from Surrey passed her test as a teenager but crashed a year ago as she was trying to overtake a lorry on a motorway. Nobody was injured, but her car was written off.\"I took too long checking the blind spot and all the cars in front had stopped,\" she said. \"If I had maybe taken some more lessons then I would know that you can't really take that long.\"Alisa did a driving assessment four years after getting her licence to see what skills she could improveShe didn't drive for a year after the crash. She has since done an informal assessment with charity IAM RoadSmart to boost her confidence and figure out what she needs to work on.\"I wasn't driving to the best standard and that's why I had a crash.\"Alisa said the process of becoming a better driver should continue after a person passes their test. \"Maybe more lessons that you're required to take with a professional.\"Local Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood said young people make up just 6% of all drivers, but are involved in nearly a quarter of fatal and serious collisions.\"Inexperience puts drivers, their passengers, and other road users at greater risk,\" she said.The proposed learning period \"is all about supporting young drivers to develop the confidence they need to stay safe and giving them more time to build their skills and gain experience in different driving conditions\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoChloe AslettYorkshireBBCThe incident occurred on the road between Dinnington and TodwickA police force has admitted mixing up the identities of an 18-year-old killed in a car crash with another teenager who survived the collision.South Yorkshire Police said officers had wrongly told relatives of Trevor Wynn, 17, that he had died in the crash near Rotherham in December.Meanwhile, the force incorrectly identified Joshua Johnson, 18, as having survived the collision, which also resulted in the death of a 17-year-old girl.Assistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) since identifying the error, adding that he was aware of \"the additional trauma this may cause\".Police were called to Todwick Road between Dinnington and Todwick in the early hours of 13 December after a silver Toyota Corolla crashed off the road.At the time the force said a 17-year-old girl, who was driving, and a 17-year-old boy had been pronounced dead at the scene, while an 18-year-old male had been taken to hospital with serious injuries.Wynn's family were subsequently told he had died while it was believed that Johnson was the male in hospital receiving treatment.However, in a statement issued on Tuesday, the force said \"concerns\" had been raised about the identities of those killed.A spokesperson said \"information came to light\" on Sunday which prompted \"further formal identification processes, including forensics, to be undertaken\" and resulted in the mistake being identified.South Yorkshire PoliceAssistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the IOPCMcFarlane said he had since offered to meet with both sets of parents to discuss the matter.He said: \"This has obviously come as a huge shock to everyone and we recognise the additional trauma this may cause. \"We are supporting Trevor and all the families through this and have engaged specialist agencies to help provide that support. \"I have also offered to meet with both sets of parents as I am sure they will have many questions, most of which we are not able to answer yet but we are absolutely committed to understanding how this happened so it cannot happen again.\"He said South Yorkshire Police would fully cooperate with any subsequent investigation by the police watchdog.Wynn was not named publicly by police at the time of the crash, but was widely identified on social media and in local news outlets as having died in the collision.The 17-year-old girl has not been formally named.An 18-year-old who was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and a 19-year-old arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in connection with the crash both remain on bail pending further enquiries.The IOPC said it was assessing the referral to determine whether an investigation was required.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "17 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaThe US military action in Venezuela was the right thing to do \"morally\", Kemi Badenoch has said.The Conservative leader told the BBC that while she did not understand the legal basis for Donald Trump's operation to remove President Nicolás Maduro from the country, he was overseeing a \"brutal regime\" and she was \"glad he's gone\".However, she added that the move did \"raise serious questions about the rules-based order\".The UK government has so far avoided criticising the US move or saying whether it breached international law, instead arguing that Maduro was an \"illegitimate president\".However, some Labour MPs and opposition parties including the Liberal Democrats, Green Party and SNP have called on the government to condemn Trump's actions and brand them illegal.Badenoch told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the US action was \"extraordinary\" but she understood why it was taken.\"Where the legal certainty is not yet clear, morally, I do think it was the right thing to do,\" she said.The Tory leader, who spent her childhood in Nigeria before moving back to the UK at the age of 16, added: \"I grew up under a military dictatorship, so I know what it's like to have someone like Maduro in charge.\"However, she said it was right to tell Trump not to intervene in Greenland because \"there is a big difference between democratic states\" and the \"gangster state in Venezuela\".\"What happens in Greenland is up to Denmark and the people of Greenland,\" she added.In recent days Trump has repeated his threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory which has a strategic location and is rich in minerals - arguing it is vital for US national security.The UK has issued a joint statement with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark insisting it is for Denmark and Greenland alone to decide on matters concerning the territory's future.Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Breakfast the UK's approach to Greenland was different to Venezuela as Denmark was a member of the Nato military alliance and it was not in the UK's national security interests to question the territory's future.Streeting also defended the prime minister's response to the developments in Venezuela, arguing he was acting in the UK's national interest, as well as the \"best interests of the people of Venezuela\".\"I appreciate there are others who have been more strident and have been more critical of the United States,\" he said.\"The prime minister has a different responsibility, and he is choosing his words carefully and wisely to try and influence how events unfold from here on.\"Critics of the government's approach, including Labour MP Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, have argued the US action risks emboldening Russia and China and that the UK should be clear the operation breached international law.In a statement in the House of Commons on Monday evening, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she had reminded her US counterpart Marco Rubio of his obligations under international law.However, she reiterated the prime minister's position that it is for the US to set out the legal basis for its actions.Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife were seized from Caracas on Saturday in an operation by US forces which also saw strikes on military bases in the country.The pair have been taken to New York where they have been charged with weapon and drug offences, accused of enriching themselves from a violent crime ring smuggling cocaine to the US.Maduro has long rejected the allegations as a pretext to force him from power and both have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.Trump has vowed to \"run the country\" until there is a \"proper\" transition of power, with Venezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as interim president.",

Sarah's body was found later that evening, with police still searching for Grace.As Humberside Police released more details, James Dick OBE - the King's representative for the county - said: \"I am investigating the most appropriate way to recognise Mark Ratcliffe's selfless act of bravery\".Phillip Norton/BBCPolice continue their efforts to try to locate Grace Keeling Dick, the lord-lieutenant for the East Riding of Yorkshire, added: \"It is a very tragic situation where three people have lost their lives.\"My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of those involved and also to the community of Withernsea, which is feeling such a tragic loss.\"His office would be \"contacting people involved in the awards process to understand which award is the most appropriate\", he added.Mark was from Withernsea while Sarah and Grace were from Nottinghamshire, police said.Paying tribute, Mark's family previously described him as a \"true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".On Tuesday, Ch Insp Tom Stevens gave further details of the circumstances of the deaths.He said: \"From trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses who were in the area at the time, it is understood that Grace and her friend were on the steps near to the rocks when Grace is believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave.\"Grace's mum, Sarah, and three other members of the public who were nearby at the time, including Mark, immediately entered the water in an effort to save Grace.\"'Finding Grace is priority' Stevens said that two of those three who also entered the water in an attempt to assist with the rescue managed to exit safely.He added: \"Our priority now is to find Grace, and we are doing everything we can to locate her. This includes extensive searches along the shoreline and drone searches from Withernsea to Easington directed by our specialist search teams.\"Stevens said its underwater search unit had also been deployed and officers had consulted with an oceanographer.Both families continue to be supported by officers, Stevens said.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "12 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesTechnology Secretary Liz Kendall has called on Elon Musk's X to urgently deal with its artificial intelligence chatbot Grok being used to create non-consensual sexualised images of women and girls.The BBC has seen multiple examples on X of people asking the bot to digitally undress people to make them appear in bikinis without their consent, as well as putting them in sexual situations.Kendall said the situation was \"absolutely appalling\", adding \"we cannot and will not allow the proliferation of these degrading images.\"In a statement, X said: \"We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the statement continued.On Monday, the regulator Ofcom said it had made \"urgent contact\" with Elon Musk's company xAI and said it was investigating concerns Grok has been producing \"undressed images\" of people.Kendall has endorsed the regulator’s actions.\"It is absolutely right that Ofcom is looking into this as a matter of urgency and it has my full backing to take any enforcement action it deems necessary,\" she said.'Dehumanising' imagesGrok is a free AI assistant - with some paid-for premium features - which responds to X users' prompts when they tag it in a post.It is often used to give reaction or more context to other posters' remarks.But people on X are also able to use it to edit an uploaded image through its AI image editing feature without the consent of the person depicted.Women who have stumbled across sexualised images of themselves made by Grok have described it as dehumanising.Dr Daisy Dixon is one of the many female X users who recently started to see people take everyday pictures she had posted of herself on the platform and ask Grok to undress her or sexualise her. She told the BBC the pictures left her feeling \"shocked\", \"humiliated\" and frightened for her safety.She added while she backed the call from the technology secretary for action and found it \"heartening\", she still felt frustrated with X's lack of accountability.Dr Daisy DixonDr Daisy Dixon has seen people on X use her pictures and ask Grok to undress her\"Myself and many other women on X continue to report the inappropriate AI images/videos we are being sent daily, but X continues to reply that there has been no violation of X rules,\" she said.\"I just hope Kendall's words turn into concrete enforcement soon – I don't want to open my X app anymore as I'm frightened about what I might see.\"In her statement Kendall said: \"Services and operators have a clear obligation to act appropriately. This is not about restricting freedom of speech but upholding the law.\"We have made intimate image abuse and cyberflashing priority offences under the Online Safety Act - including where images are AI-generated. This means platforms must prevent such content from appearing online and act swiftly to remove it if it does.\"The leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey urged the government to \"act very quickly\" to stop the generation of sexualised images by Grok, suggesting one course of action would be to \"reduce access\" to X.\"If the reports turn out to be true the National Crime Agency need to launch a criminal investigation,\" Sir Ed said.\"People like Elon Musk have to be held to account.\"Speaking to BBC Newshour, Thomas Regnier, spokesman for tech sovereignty at the European Commission, said they were taking the issue \"very seriously\".\"We don't want this in the European Union... it's appalling, it's disgusting.\"The Wild West is over in Europe,\" he said. \"All companies have the obligation to put their own house in order – and this starts by being responsible and removing illegal content that is being generated by your AI tool.\"",

After weeks of insulting each other during the mayoral campaign, Republicans and Democrats are still reacting to what turned out to be a very amicable and friendly meeting.\nTrump has promised to help Mamdani make New York City a success, and “great again”, but what does this actually mean, and will the US president do it? We also look at how Mamdani will be navigating the wider politics of being a mayor, particularly with midterm elections in 2026. In New York state, can Mamdani persuade his Democratic governor to put up taxes for the wealthiest? And how will he balance maintaining good relations with both Trump and Demoratic socialists in New York? \nMeanwhile, with Trump’s ally Elise Stefanik running for governor, how will the Republican campaign deal with the president’s new attitude towards Mamdani? \nSarah and Anthony are joined by Nick Reisman, POLITICO’s Albany Bureau Chief and New York politics expert.  \nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\n- Nick Reisman, Albany Bureau Chief for Politico \nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Adriana Urbano.

    "body": "3 hours agoOttilie MitchellPA MediaThe founder of The Independent newspaper, Sir Andreas Whittam Smith, has died aged 88, his family announced.The Daily Telegraph financial journalist oversaw the publication's birth in 1986 with colleagues Stephen Glover and Matthew Symonds.It was the first paper not to have a permanent allegiance to a political party - \"a thrilling moment in the history of Fleet Street\", according to the BBC's Amol Rajan, who served as editor of the paper starting in 2013.In a tribute to the man who he described as \"a radical and a pioneer\", Rajan wrote that Sir Andreas had \"profoundly transformed British journalism for the better, and forever.\"A family spokesperson announced Sir Andreas's death on 29 November, saying that he was \"surrounded by family until the end\" and that he would be \"dearly missed\".He is survived by his wife, two children and three grandsons.Sir Andreas worked at a range of British papers including the Financial Times, The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph before founding The Independent.The paper was \"the zeitgeist of print\", Rajan said in his tribute, and \"embodied Thatcher's Britain - though not her politics\".He recalled an advertising campaign with the slogan: \"The Independent. It is. Are you?\". The paper said it was \"of no party or faction\" and boasted \"a tinge of republicanism\".Religion played an important role in Sir Andreas's life. He served as First Estates Church Commissioner from 2002 to 2017, in charge of the committee that oversees the Church of England's multi-billion pound investment portfolio.The Independent notes that he was seen as a \"saintly\" and \"ecclesiastical\" figure on Fleet Street.He was also formerly the President of the British Board of Film Classification, requiring him to approve and rate films for release, including approving a remake of Lolita.Sir Andreas told the BBC in 2002 how he had been described as an \"urbane liberal\" by the Daily Mail for this controversial move \"and I was so pleased with the 'urbane'.\"\"That's the only thing I can set against the wretched bishop image.\"He was made a Commander of the British Empire in 2002 and knighted in 2015 for his public service, \"particularly to the Church of England\".",

    "body": "David Dimbleby: Can William's 'ordinary Joe' approach win back more support for the monarchy?7 hours agoDavid DimblebyPresenter, What's the Monarchy For?BBCI've spent much of my career commentating on royal occasions, and over the past two years I've been looking at the institution in close detail for a personal-view documentary series, interviewing former private secretaries and communications advisers, along with royal historians, friends of King Charles III and staunch anti-monarchists, trying to understand how it works and why it has had such a hold on Britain.Now, polls suggest public approval is in decline.When asked how important it was to continue having a monarchy, as part of the first British Social Attitudes survey back in 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\". In last year's survey, just 51% of people answered the same. The proportion of young people approving of the monarchy is lower still.That's not to say that people want an elected head of state instead - a majority don't. And finding an elected President who could unite Scotland England Wales and Northern Ireland would, I suspect, be a good deal harder than some republicans think.But the declining support marks a problem. Getty ImagesIn 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\" to continue having a monarchy, as part of a British Social Attitudes survey. In last year's survey, 51% of people answered the same\"The only way the monarchy works is by everybody either being apathetic or feeling very affectionate towards it,\" argues Anna Whitelock, a professor of the history of monarchy at City, University of London.\"If those bonds are broken, there really is no purpose or point of monarchy.\"Plenty of people might be quick to put the most recent threat to those bonds down to scandal. There is no love lost between Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, and the British public. Only 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of him in a YouGov poll in October (the same month he was stripped of his titles), followed by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, with ratings of 30% and 21% respectively.Yet no-one I spoke to while making these films pointed to any one individual as the sole reason for the current standing of the monarchy in the eyes of the public.AFP via Getty ImagesOnly 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of Andrew in a YouGov poll in October, the same month he was stripped of his titlesI suspect the real challenge facing the Royal Family is the fundamental question of what it stands for in the modern world - a world radically different to the one Elizabeth II reigned over when she ascended the throne in 1952.Even though there is evidence that suggests change is on the agenda, as the Prince of Wales acknowledged last month, what should he do, as heir to the throne - and what should King Charles do as reigning monarch - to win back more support for the institution?Winning the 'oxygen of public support'Three monarchs have been on the throne during my lifetime, and each understood that what matters is the impression they make on their subjects: their image.As the journalist and editor Ian Hislop put it when I interviewed him for my documentary series, What's The Monarchy For? \"They thrive on the oxygen of public support\".It is, ultimately, the key to their survival.They surround themselves with people who know this too. Lord Janvrin was the private secretary to the late queen until 2007. \"If you took public support for granted it would be a very bad day,\" he told me.Prof Whitelock takes this a step further. \"The Royal family is a brand,\" she explains. \"There is always a sense of needing to keep the brand popular.\"Getty ImagesThe Prince and Princess of Wales with their children at Westminster Abbey for the 'Together at Christmas' carol serviceOne of the boldest attempts the Royal Family has ever made to redefine its public image - and keep that brand popular - came back in 1969 when, for the first time, they invited cameras into the heart of family life.The film, titled Royal Family, which was broadcast on BBC and ITV, was an attempt to try to humanise them.The late queen was filmed in colour, buying a treat for a four-year-old Prince Edward in a shop, using money from her purse. \"What are you going to have? A lolly?\" she was filmed saying, briskly. \"An ice cream,\" Edward replied. As he settled in the front seat of the car, she suggested he might make a \"gooey mess\".Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThis documentary was, at the time, one of the boldest attempts the Royal Family had made to redefine its public imageThere was a picnic scene too, with Prince Philip and the Princess Royal seen barbecuing sausages.The public lapped it up. Across both transmissions it had almost twice as many viewers as the first moon landing when it broadcast.Yet a few years later, the late queen is reported to have ordered that it should never be seen again. Some reports have suggested there were copyright claims, though the Times also reported speculation that there were concerns, or even regrets about it being made.Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesA family portrait at Buckingham Palace in 1972Certainly Princess Anne didn't mince her words about the recording. \"I never liked the idea of the royal family film,\" she reportedly once said. \"I always thought it was a rotten idea.\"But it's a good example of how the Royal Family endeavour to present themselves as they want to be seen.'The degree of control I think is staggering'In September 2022, I was at Windsor to report on the final stages of Elizabeth II's funeral. The Palace issued instructions to the broadcasters about scenes that, once shown live, should never be shown again.A number were quite small things, for example, the crown being handled, somebody looking visibly upset, Prince George touching his nose, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh's handkerchiefs, and, at the lying in state, shots of the Royal Family mouthing the Lord's Prayer.These little excisions from reality - or \"perpetuity edits,\" a kind of George Orwell speak - see them remove from the world anything they don't like.On the one hand, they have the right to grieve in private; on the other, the late queen was our head of state and this is her public funeral. Do we have a right to see it all or do they have the right to control what we see?Getty Images\"The degree of control I think is staggering,\" argues Prof Whitelock. \"If Downing Street were trying to control what's being broadcast, that would be reported upon, but if the Palace is intervening in what's being shown about certain things, why is that not seen as something that should be reported?\"However, a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace has said: \"The events surrounding the funeral of Her Late Majesty were both State occasions and moments of profound personal sorrow for her loved ones. In striking the appropriate balance between those two factors, simple human decency pointed towards a sensitive and sympathetic approach so as not to intrude on elements of individual grief or personal religious observance.\"In particular, we do not believe it would have been fair or appropriate to focus on younger members of the family at a time of mourning.\"Prince William and the e-scooterRecently, Prince William joined forces with Canadian actor and comedian Eugene Levy for an episode of his travel comedy series that aired last month.Mr Levy appeared particularly amused to see his entrance - zipping around Windsor Castle on an e-scooter.\"It gets around quite nicely,\" the Prince explained, later adding: \"I'm always late so I thought this was a way to keep my meetings on time.\" He chatted on about which of Levy's films he had enjoyed. (\"All of the American Pies!\")A bright idea - the image getting across is that William is just an ordinary Joe.'Stress around family overwhelms me', Prince William saysThe social media posts that Prince William and his family share to their 17.1 million followers have a similar approach, with many showing them off-duty, with videos shot in woods, on sand dunes. One shows the Princess of Wales sharing her relief at having finished chemotherapy treatment, and reflecting on the importance \"of simply loving and being loved\".British \"adman\" Rory Sutherland, who has spent 37 years in the heart of the advertising world, currently as vice-chairman of Ogilvy, fully approves of the Waleses' approach to striking a more modern tone.\"I think he's walked the line, which is a very narrow line between modernity and kind of absurdity extremely well,\" he says of Prince William. \"It is a very delicate path to tread.\"It is, he adds, far less crude than one memorable attempt by the generation before him, when Prince Edward, Princess Anne and Andrew took part in It's a Royal Knockout charity tournament in 1987, presiding over teams of celebrities who wore costumes and did challenges like lobbing ham at each other.And it seems to be resonating. Prince William and Catherine have public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively - higher than all other family members in last month's YouGov survey.Getty ImagesPrince William and Catherine have strong public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively,  a YouGov poll suggestsProf Whitelock, though positive about Prince William and his fellow senior Royals' attempts to seem more accessible, is less sure about whether that is enough to modernise the institution as a whole.\"If the monarchy is really to modernise in a significant way, we need to see much more transparency, much more accountability,\" she argues.Tax, politics and royal lifestylesIn talking to people as research for my documentary, there seem to me to be other factors, which are potential stumbling blocks to fuller public support.First, the fact that the monarch is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax on his personal income, because the relevant laws do not apply to the Crown, and only does so voluntarily - and that he was not legally obliged to pay inheritance tax after the death of his mother.\"I think the best way to make those concessions is voluntarily rather than under duress. It's a better look certainly,\" says Rory Sutherland.A spokesperson for Kensington Palace has also said that the Prince of Wales voluntarily pays the top rate of income and capital gains tax on all his personal income, including receipts from the Duchy. No explanation was given, when asked for the documentary series, as to why the Prince of Wales has chosen not to follow his father's example of publishing his tax returns since inheriting the role.Getty ImagesKing Charles is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax but does so voluntarilySecond, the fact that the monarch has the right to be consulted on proposed legislation that may affect the Crown and can ask to be excluded from it. The question of whether the monarch takes up this right, or the extent to which it may or may not have an impact, are other matters - some have argued that the right in itself gives any monarch potential to influence.Then there is their lifestyle - particularly  when many people in the country face a cost of living crisis.Mr Sutherland does not believe the fact the royals live in palaces to be something the public particularly cares about. But he adds: \"I always thought that skiing holidays are a bit of a bad look.\"Of course there is the economic case of the sheer amount of money that the Royal Family brings to the UK thanks to tourism - but Mr Sutherland argues that while \"you can emphatically make an economic case\", it is not the right way to justify the royal's continued existence.How European monarchies workPrince William has been forthright in stating that he has change in mind.\"I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda… Not overly radical, but changes that I think need to happen,\" he told Mr Levy.He also said: \"There are points when you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\"So I like to question things, is what I'm really getting at.\"Getty Images'I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda,' Prince William has saidIt remains unclear exactly what he means by this. Whether it is simply fewer courtiers, a bit less ceremony, no more people calling him sir, or bowing. Or is it possible William envisages much more of a rethink?There has been some debate over the years about whether or not there is merit in a bigger shift: in making the British Royal Family more in line with the Dutch royal family, or the Scandinavian ones with a much more informal and modest style.Prof Whitelock for one believes certain parts of it could well appeal to the prince. \"I don't think the idea of dressing up in all the stuff for the coronation is something that appeals to him.\"But it comes with risks. \"Those who really support the monarchy like all that comes with it, so if we got to a point where we it looks like the Scandinavian monarchies that don't have big coronations… some people might say 'what's the point now'?\"If people are asked what defines Britain,\" she adds, \"I'm sure before too long you do get to the monarch.\"Getty ImagesThe Dutch royal family - King Willem-Alexander attended schools in the Netherlands but finished his secondary education at Atlantic College in WalesGraham Smith, chief executive of pressure group, Republic, is one of those (albeit in a UK minority) who argue that no amount of reform would be enough to win his approval.\"You should not have that family in that position of privilege and status,\" he tells me. \"They are just a bunch of very ordinary people, who just happen to be related to people who, hundreds of years ago, built big castles and won a few battles.\"Essentially, it's a ridiculous institution, which… has no justification.\"AFP via Getty ImagesMany people find having a Royal Family consoling and representative of the United KingdomI put to him that over half the country don't think it's ridiculous - many people find it consoling and representative of the United Kingdom, maybe something better than politicians. The newspapers are full of talk about monarchy too.\"Yes there is an audience,\" he says pointedly. \"But there's also an audience for the Kardashians and David Beckham.\"A masterclass in reinventionI still remember firsthand one of the Royal Family's low points. It was a Sunday in 1997 and I received the news that Diana, Princess of Wales had been killed in the crash in Paris. I was working at the BBC at the time and we were summoned to cover what had happened.We had no inkling at the time what the public response would be - but it was soon clear that something astonishing was happening.There was an outpouring of popular grief. The press started reporting that thousands of people in London were bringing flowers to Kensington Palace but that the Royal Family had remained up in Balmoral and were not responding.Getty ImagesLord Janvrin was in Balmoral with the late queen. \"A choice had to be made between looking after the two young princes and getting back to London.\"Yet the public criticism was sharp. It was a lesson in the cruel demands of monarchy on those who belong to it. And a lesson to never again get behind the story.Support for the monarchy had already been declining. The year after Diana's death, it dipped further, with just 63.5% of people saying it was important for Britain to have a monarchy, according to the British Attitudes Survey. It took time for the approval ratings to climb back to their previous levels – but eventually they did, reaching 75% by 2012.It shows that this institution can recover from disapproval.Getty ImagesThe present and the future of the monarchy: King Charles III and the Prince of Wales\"It is highly, highly culturally adaptive,\" says Mr Sutherland, \"and obviously an 18th century monarchy might look absurd to us today but at the time it was permanently effectively adapting to changed circumstances, which is one of the reasons it is still around and lots of monarchies aren't.\"No matter what changes Prince William makes - nor Prince George after him - the bigger question of what becomes of the monarchy in the distant future may not be theirs to decide.The monarchy's existence thrives on the \"oxygen of public support\", so it is the public themselves who will decide through that support whether having this kind of head of state continues to suit us as a country.David Dimbleby's documentary series, What's the Monarchy For? starts on Tuesday 2 December on BBC1 and BBC iPlayerMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Extensive flooding is possible along with disruption on the road and rail network, loss of power and communities potentially cut off.

    "body": "Four people have been arrested in South Korea for allegedly hacking over 120,000 video cameras in homes and businesses and using the footage to make sexually exploitative materials for an overseas website.Police announced the arrests on Sunday, saying the accused exploited the Internet Protocol (IP) cameras' vulnerabilities, such as simple passwords.A cheaper alternative to CCTV, IP cameras - otherwise known as home cameras - connect to a home internet network and are often installed for security or to monitor the safety of children and pets.Locations of the hacked cameras reportedly included private homes, karaoke rooms, a Pilates studio and a gynaecologist's clinic.A statement released by South Korea's National Police Agency revealed that the four suspects operated independently of one another, and did not conspire together.One of the suspects is accused of hacking 63,000 cameras and producing 545 sexually exploitative videos, which he then sold for 35 million won ($12,235; £9,250) worth of virtual assets. Another allegedly hacked 70,000 cameras and sold 648 videos for 18 million won worth of assets.The two suspects were responsible for approximately 62% of videos posted in the past year on a website that illegally distributed IP camera hacking footage.Police are now moving to block and shut down that website, and cooperating with foreign agencies to investigate its operator. They have also arrested three people who are suspected of having bought and viewed material through the site.\"IP camera hacking and illegal filming inflict immense suffering on victims and are therefore serious offences. We will eradicate them through vigorous investigations,\" said Park Woo-hyun, a cyber investigation chief at the National Police Agency.\"Viewing and possessing illegally filmed videos are also serious crimes, so we will actively investigate them.\"Authorities have personally visited or notified victims at 58 locations, informing them of the incident and providing guidance on changing passwords.They are also helping victims delete and block content, and working to identify others who may have been affected.\"Above all, it is crucial and effective for individual users who have installed IP cameras in homes or business premises to remain vigilant and immediately and regularly change their access passwords,\" the National Police Agency said in its statement.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJoel Gunter, Hannah O'Grady & Rory TinmanBBCTwo former heads of all UK Special Forces suppressed evidence of possible SAS war crimes, a former high-ranking officer has told a public inquiry in closed evidence sessions.The officer, who was among the most senior in special forces, said he had passed what he called \"explosive\" evidence suggesting \"criminal behaviour\" to the then-director special forces in 2011.The officer also told the inquiry that the subsequent director special forces, who took over in 2012, \"clearly knew there was a problem in Afghanistan\" and failed to act.It was \"not just one director that has known about this\", he said in his evidence, adding that UK Special Forces leadership was \"very much suppressing\" the allegations.The officer, known at the inquiry by the cipher N1466, confirmed that neither head of special forces had passed any of the troubling allegations on to the Royal Military Police (RMP), despite British law requiring commanders to inform the RMP of any possibility someone under their command may have committed a serious criminal offence.N1466's testimony is significant because he is the highest-ranking former special forces officer to allege that evidence of war crimes was suppressed by those leading the SAS.His testimony comes from summaries of closed-door hearings held by the Independent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan, which is examining allegations of special forces war crimes. The inquiry's rules mean the names of the former directors accused by the officer cannot be reported.The Afghan inquiry was launched in the wake of allegations of unlawful killings by the SAS, reported by BBC Panorama in 2022.The programme revealed that 54 detainees and unarmed men had been killed by the SAS in suspicious circumstances in just one six-month tour. The programme also found evidence that the director special forces in 2012, General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, had failed to report war crimes.At the outset of the inquiry, both Gen Carleton-Smith and Lt Gen Jonathan Page, the preceding director special forces, were named in proceedings in relation to claims they had failed to inform the RMP of the allegations.'Criminal behaviour'N1466 told the inquiry he had first become concerned back in February 2011, after noticing that SAS reports coming back from Afghanistan showed the regiment was killing people in suspicious circumstances and in unusually high numbers, with too few enemy weapons recovered from some operations to justify the number of deaths.N1466 said his suspicions began with a night raid on which nine Afghan men were killed and just three weapons were claimed to have been discovered. BBC Panorama visited the scene of that raid years later, in 2022, and found bullet holes inside the room where the men died clustered close to the ground.Weapons experts told the Panorama that the pattern suggested the victims had been shot while they were lying down, and that the firefight described by the SAS in their report was unlikely. The family said they were civilians, and had no weapons at their home.BBC Panorama visited the scene of a raid in 2022N1466 also told the inquiry he had been made aware of whistleblower testimony that SAS troopers had been heard bragging during a training course about killing all \"fighting-age\" males during operations, regardless of whether they posed a threat or not.Together with the operational reports, N1466 was left \"deeply troubled by what I strongly suspected was the unlawful killing of innocent people, including children,\" he testified.\"I will be clear, we are talking about war crimes,\" he said.In response, in April 2011, N1466 commissioned a review from another officer at special forces headquarters of recent SAS operations. The results looked \"startlingly bad\" for the SAS, he told the inquiry.The review formed part of the evidence he presented to the then-director special forces in 2011. He said he \"indicated quite clearly to him\" that \"there was a strong potential of criminal behaviour.\"N1466 testified that the director \"absolutely knew what was happening\" in Afghanistan with regard to the alleged war crimes, and \"absolutely knew what his responsibilities were\" when it came to reporting the allegations to military police.The director did not contact police, but instead ordered an internal review of the SAS squadron's tactics – a move N1466 described as a \"warning shot\" to the squadron to tone down the violence.The director had made \"a conscious decision that he is going to suppress this, cover it up and do a little fake exercise to make it look like he's done something,\" N1466 said.The subsequent \"tactics, techniques and procedures\" review was conducted by an SAS officer, who visited Afghanistan but spoke only to other members of the Regiment. The resulting report fully accepted the accounts of those suspected of carrying out the unlawful killings.Habibullah previously told BBC Panorama his two young sons were killed in a raid in 2011Bruce Houlder KC, who as a former director of service prosecutions was responsible for bringing charges and prosecuting those serving in the armed forces, told the BBC that the law \"imposed a very clear duty\" on commanding officers to report suspected crimes, \"including murder, which we are talking about here\".\"If this came to my knowledge I would have asked the service police to investigate the DSF for that failure to report in 2011,\" he said.N1466 eventually reported the evidence directly to the Royal Military Police in January 2015, nearly four years after he had first raised his concerns and only after the RMP had begun Operation Northmoor, an investigation into the SAS.He told the inquiry it was \"a matter of great regret\" that he had not gone sooner to the RMP, nor urged the director to refer the evidence to the RMP – a move which he said he viewed at the time as stepping out of line.\"When you look back on it, on those people who died unnecessarily from that point onwards – there were two toddlers shot in their bed next to their parents, you know – all that would not... necessarily have come to pass,\" he said.He was referring to an SAS raid in Nimruz province in August 2012 which was first uncovered by the BBC, on which two young parents were fatally shot while in bed with their infant sons, who were also shot and gravely wounded.The raid, which occurred after the new director special forces had taken over, was never reported to the military police.The director who took over in 2012 told the BBC that the allegations made by N1466 were refuted and that he would provide a comprehensive response to each of these matters in his evidence to the inquiry in due course. He said that none of his senior commanders expressed any concerns or produced any evidence of unlawful killings at any stage of his three years in charge and that there was no allegation or evidence he was aware of to refer to the RMP.The former officer who was director special forces in 2011 did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "Labour MP and former minister Tulip Siddiq has been sentenced to two years in prison in Bangladesh after being put on trial in her absence alongside 16 other people over corruption allegations.She was found guilty of influencing her aunt, Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to secure a plot of land for her family in the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, a claim she strongly denies.Siddiq, who is based in London and has rejected the charges, is unlikely to serve the sentence.The sitting MP for Hampstead and Highgate continues to face a number of outstanding charges in Bangladesh. Since Hasina's regime was overturned, prosecutors in Bangladesh have launched a number of wide-ranging legal cases against the former leader, her past associates and family members.The trial involving Siddiq - who quit as a Treasury minister in January over controversy around her ties to her aunt - has been playing out in Dhaka since August.Court documents included claims that Siddiq \"forced and influenced her aunt and the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina using her special power to secure [a plot of land] for her mother Rehana Siddiq, sister Azmina Siddiq and brother Radwan Siddiq\".A prosecutor for Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) previously said Siddiq was tried as a Bangladeshi citizen as authorities had obtained her Bangladeshi passport, ID and tax number.Siddiq's lawyers have disputed she is a Bangladeshi citizen, telling the Financial Times she has \"never had\" an ID card or voter ID, and \"has not held a passport since she was a child\".She was sentenced by Judge Rabiul Alam to two years in prison and a 100,000 Bangladeshi Taka fine ($821; £620). If she fails to pay, six months will be added to the sentence.When the trial began, the MP said prosecutors had \"peddled false and vexatious allegations that have been briefed to the media but never formally put to me by investigators\".A statement on her behalf continued: \"I have been clear from the outset that I have done nothing wrong and will respond to any credible evidence that is presented to me. Continuing to smear my name to score political points is both baseless and damaging.\"She has not commented publicly since the verdict was delivered. Asked if Ms Siddiq should stay in her job, the UK prime minister's Chief Secretary Darren Jones told BBC Breakfast: \"This is a private matter for Tulip to talk to. But my understanding is that a trial took place in Bangladesh that she was not part of.\"She tried to engage with questions from the Bangladeshi government but was not allowed to do so and has concluded that this is more of a political situation than a legal situation. She continues to deny any allegations that have been made against her.\"He added: \"This was a decision taken by a foreign country and a foreign court so I'm sure that Tulip's going to be getting on with the job of representing her constituents in Parliament.\"Last week, a group of senior lawyers raised concerns with Bangladesh's representative in the UK over how the trial had been conducted. Signatories to that statement included ex-Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, and Lady Cherie Blair, a human rights lawyer and wife of former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair.In a letter first reported by the Guardian, they said Siddiq had not been able to secure proper legal representation during the trial, adding: \"Such a process is artificial and a contrived and unfair way of pursuing a prosecution.\"The verdict comes two weeks after Hasina was sentenced to death in a separate trial over her role in a brutal crackdown against the protests which ultimately forced her from office in July 2024.She was found guilty of crimes against humanity over the deaths of an estimated 1,400 people at the hands of the police. That trial was held in Hasina's absence, as she has been in exile in India since being ousted. She denied the charges.Siddiq, whose mother is the former prime minister's sister, continues to face a number of outstanding charges in Bangladesh, including two ongoing trials in relation to the allegations at the centre of Monday's verdict.She is also being investigated over the alleged transfer of a flat located in a lucrative area of Dhaka to her sister.Siddiq and her family have also been investigated in relation to allegations of embezzlement around a £3.9bn deal in 2013 connected to a Russian-funded nuclear power plant deal.Siddiq has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in relation to the allegations, which originated with claims made by Bobby Hajjaj, a political opponent of Hasina.Bangladeshi authorities have said they estimate that around $234bn (£174bn) was appropriated through corruption during Hasina's reign.Responding to the latest verdict, the Awami League, the political party which Hasina leads, described it as \"entirely predictable\" and \"firmly denied\" the allegations against the former prime minister and her family members.\"The process fails to pass any reasonable test of judicial fairness - a point that has been made forcefully by both local and international legal experts,\" the party said.Hasina also accused Bangladesh's judiciary of being controlled by an \"unelected government run by the Awami League's political opponents\", namely the interim government headed up by Dr Muhammed Yunus.Prior to Siddiq's resignation from the British government, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's independent ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus said he had not found \"evidence of improprieties\" following an investigation.However, he said it was \"regrettable\" Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of her ties to Hasina.While Siddiq continued to insist she was not guilty of any wrongdoing, she quit her junior ministerial role in order not to be a \"distraction\" for the government. The UK does not have an extradition treaty in place with Bangladesh. It is categorised as a 2B country, meaning clear evidence needs to be presented to lawyers and judges to authorise any extradition.Siddiq was not compelled to return to Dhaka for the trial despite authorities there issuing an arrest warrant.

    "body": "9 hours agoPatrick JacksonReutersMarco Rubio (left) with Rustem Umerov in Florida US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says talks with Ukraine over a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war were productive, but there's \"more work to be done\". The talks, held in Florida, were attended by a Ukrainian delegation led by national security council secretary Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's new chief negotiator. Also at the meeting were President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Witkoff is due to visit Moscow for talks next week.  Umerov was brought in to replace the Ukrainian president's top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, after he quit following an anti-corruption raid on his home.Sunday's meeting is the latest step in two weeks of intense diplomatic activity.    It was sparked by the leaking of a 28-point US peace plan which shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago.\"It's not just about the terms that ends fighting,\" Rubio said at the meeting in Hallandale Beach, north of Miami. \"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity... I think we built on that today, but there's more work to be done.\"He also told the Ukrainian delegation that the aim of peace talks with Russia is to leave Ukraine \"sovereign, independent and prosperous\".Watch: Rubio says 'more needs to be done' after 'productive' Ukraine talksAs Sunday's talks began, Umerov said: \"We are discussing about the future of Ukraine, about the security of Ukraine, about no repetition of aggression of Ukraine, about prosperity of Ukraine, about how to rebuild Ukraine\". \"US is hearing us,\" he said, speaking in English. \"US is supporting us. US is working beside us.\"He later described the talks as \"productive and successful\" while Rubio said they had been \"very productive and useful\".Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said the talks were \"going along well\", and there was a good chance of a deal being made to end the conflict. Trump said earlier he would send Witkoff and possibly also Kushner to Moscow this week to meet President Vladimir Putin to discuss the peace plan which has been much revised. In a post on social media, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said: \"It is important that the talks have a constructive dynamic and that all issues were discussed openly and with a clear focus on ensuring Ukraine's sovereignty and national interests.\"He added he was grateful to the US and Trump for their efforts to try and end the war. One crucial unresolved issue is the fate of Ukrainian territory that Russia has either annexed or controls.The talks in Florida were \"not easy\", a source who is said to be close to the Ukrainian delegation told AFP news agency.\"But everyone is trying to be constructive and find a solution,\" the source added.  Zelensky is due to visit Paris on Monday for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, a strong ally.  Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or injured, as well as thousands of civilians, and at least seven million people have become refugees since Russia invaded on 24 February 2022.     The conflict between the two ex-Soviet states stretches back to 2014 when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown and Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting armed uprisings in eastern Ukraine.

    "body": "7 hours agoBBCMonday's papers are dominated by the fallout from last week's Budget. Metro headlines on the Chancellor saying she \"didn't lie\", after accusations that Rachel Reeves misled the public on the national economic outlook in the build-up to the Budget. The paper is splashed with a photo from the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg showing Reeves opposite Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch in a \"Budget face-off\".The Times leads on ministers who say Reeves also misled them over the \"hole in finances\". The Chancellor repeatedly highlighted a downgrade in the productivity forecast \"to justify tax rises\", it reports. Meanwhile, The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had told Reeves that the forecast had been offset by the tax take and had improved.The Chancellor is \"on the rack\" writes the Daily Mail, as Reform UK leader Nigel Farage calls for a \"sleaze probe\". The ethics watchdog has been \"urged to act\" on her \"Budget lies\", it says. The paper also asks if Sarah Ferguson, wife of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, is about to move into her daughter Princess Beatrice's \"granny annexe\".The i Paper also leads on Reeves's denial that she \"didn't lie\" about tax rises and the \"black hole\", referring to the funding gap she had indicated she needed to fill. Starmer is expected to tell the public \"our welfare state is trapping people - we must reform it\". One of the paper's columnists says Reeves \"may not be a liar, but she is losing trust\".The Daily Telegraph echoes the Mail with Reeves facing \"ethics probe over Budget lies\". It says Farage has written to the UK's independent ethics adviser asking for an investigation into whether she broke ministerial code. The paper also highlights a portion of the Budget it says was \"buried\" last week: teens with certain mental health conditions won't be required to attend school or training for their parents to claim benefits.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer saying thay that his \"bold\" economic plan will take \"years\" to deliver leads The Guardian. Writing in the paper, the PM has defended his Chancellor's decision to raise taxes by £26bn as Conservatives call for Reeves to resign. Also on the front page, the former director of UK special forces was involved in a coverup of concerns over unlawful killings in Afghanistan, an inquiry has heard. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson told the paper \"the government is fully committed to supporting the independent inquiry relating to Afghanistan\", adding that it would wait for the outcome before commenting further.The Independent calls Starmer's defence of Reeves \"defiant\" as she \"denies lies\". In a speech on Monday the prime minister will argue that she has provided economic stability by creating more fiscal headroom, referring to the money left over after the government meets its expected costs.\"If she had any decency, Reeves would be gone by now\" reads the headline of the Daily Express, quoting Badenoch. She called for the prime minister to \"grow a backbone and sack\" his Chancellor. The paper says over 40,000 people had signed the Conservative's \"sack Reeves now\" petition as of Sunday afternoon. The Financial Times verges away from UK finances, instead leading on the latest in the Russia-Ukraine war. Nato chiefs are weighing a \"more aggressive\" response to Russian hybrid warfare, it reports. The chair of its military committee tells the paper that the alliance are thinking of being \"more proactive instead of reactive\" to cyber attacks and airspace violations.The Sun headlines on its investigation into raids carried out by a group it calls the \"Gucci gang\". The \"mobsters\" have been targeting Premier League footballers and taking their luxury items, including £1m in watches and jewellery from Everton player Jack Grealish.The Daily Mirror's Christmas appeal fills its front page. The campaign will use \"pioneering assisted and sensory technology\" to aid children with \"life-limiting\" conditions.The Daily Star calls for former rugby league star Kevin Sinfield to be knighted after completing various feats of physical endurance in aid of motor neurone disease (MND) research.\"Chancellor on the rack\" says the front page of the Daily Mail, while the Daily Telegraph leads with Reform UK's call for her to face an ethics inquiry. Unnamed government ministers also pile on the pressure in the Times. One describes the handling of the Budget as a \"disaster\", and tells the paper that \"at no point\" was the cabinet told about the reality of the forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Another says that both Reeves and the prime minister look \"weak and incompetent\". According to the Financial Times, the pair have \"inextricably tied their political futures together\". \"Keir can't afford to lose her\", a Labour MP tells the paper, who adds: \"If she goes, he goes.\"The i newspaper says the prime minister will \"seek to shore up\" the \"under-fire\" chancellor later today when he gives a speech, which will include what the Sun describes as a \"panicked pledge to slash welfare\". Ahead of the address, Sir Keir writes in the Guardian that what he calls his \"big, bold long-term plan\" will \"renew Britain\". The paper describes his speech as an attempt to bolster his position and draw a line under the row. But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch writes in the Daily Express that if Reeves \"had any decency, she would be gone by now\".The Sun leads with revelations from what it calls \"underworld contacts\", who say that criminals who once targeted banks and cash vans are now looking to the homes of Premier League footballers. The paper says the gangs scour social media for players who share photos of luxury goods, before raiding their homes and selling the items to a Dublin-based group known as \"the Gucci Gang\".And the Daily Mirror says that Nigel Farage has recorded up to 2,000 videos for paying fans in the past twelve months, but spoke only 22 times in Parliament. The paper says he charges more than £70 for a personalised video on the website Cameo. A spokesman for the Reform UK leader says he has voted more times in the Commons than Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch put together.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "2 hours agoCatrin NyeBBC Panorama\"That is so much higher than I expected\" - watch the moment Catrin Nye is told about her forever chemical levelsAs I walked into the medical clinic for my blood test, all I could think about was how to avoid looking like a wimp on camera. I didn't really contemplate what the test would reveal.I am not great with needles - but as part of a BBC Panorama investigation into so-called forever chemicals, I was being tested to see what level of them I had in my blood. As a mum with two small children, I also wanted to know whether they may be having an impact on my family.Forever chemicals, or PFAS, are a group of about 10,000 chemicals. They have been used for decades, in anything from waterproof clothes, to cookware, electronics and medical equipment.They are persistent pollutants, meaning they don't degrade easily and instead build up in the environment.They exist in our homes, our water and in our food.Scientists have linked a small number of them to serious harms, such as infertility and cancer.Any level of PFAS above 2ng (nanograms) per millilitre of blood is considered to bring health risks, according to Dr Sabine Donnai, a specialist in preventative healthcare. She has never met anyone without at least some PFAS in their bloodstream.My result was 9.8ng per millilitre.Dr Donnai delivered the news very gently - but it still hit me hard.The forever chemicals in my blood would \"most likely\" have an impact on my health, she told me.I also learned that, sadly, my body would have rid itself of some of these chemicals during pregnancy, by passing it on to my babies.That was the moment this investigation stopped being just work and felt very personal.\"They [PFAS levels] would have been even higher before your pregnancies,\" Dr Donnai told me.\"You will have passed on to your children for sure.\"I was worried, but I also felt angry about how this could have happened without me having any knowledge, and very little control.I wanted to know more about these substances and the health issues they have been linked to.PFAS chemicals \"don't break down\", said Stephanie Metzger from the Royal Society of Chemistry.\"Once they get into our bodies, they stick around and build up little-by-little until they start to interfere with our systems.\"Some PFAS have been linked to thyroid problems, some to kidney and liver cancer, and some have been shown to affect fertility.\"Stephanie Metzger: PFAS chemicals \"don't break down\"As for me, it is \"unlikely\" I will be able to bring my levels to zero, said Dr Donnai. \"But you can reduce it over the next two or three years with a strategy.\"She suggested I increase my fibre intake - either by eating more oats, barley, beans, nuts and seeds, or by taking supplements of gel-forming fibre. Increased fibre in our diet is \"the strongest evidence to date that might help\", she said.If I did these things, menstruation would also help reduce my current PFAS levels over time, she added.She also told me to identify the biggest sources of exposure in my home - change my cookware, use a water filter, switch cleaning products, check my make-up and hair-colouring and be wary of \"waterproof\" labels.Similar advice was given to mum-to-be Pam Kavanagh, who we visited at home in Berkshire with Dr Federica Amati of Imperial College London.Pam was eager to know how to reduce the possible household risks of PFAS to her baby - and Dr Amati has studied how babies and children can be affected by forever chemicals.\"When we drink tap water, we are, depending on where you live, at varying levels of exposure to PFAS,\" Dr Amati said.Just buying a water filter can help to reduce exposure, she said - whether that is a jug with a filter in it, or a filter installed into the actual sink.Any non-stick frying pans with scratches on them should be thrown out, Dr Amati advised.Stainless steel or ceramic pans \"are far safer\", she said.Carpets can be treated with PFAS to make them more stain resistant, she added, suggesting that people vacuum their carpets every day.\"Making sure you ventilate the room by opening the windows every single day is a good idea [because] it really collects as house dust,\" she addedDr Federica Amati advises mum-to-be Pam Kavanagh about the possible risks posed by PFAS chemicals in the homeDr Amati then turned to children's clothing. Pam was left \"speechless\" to discover that waterproof or stain-resistant clothing can contain PFAS. Manufacturers are under no obligation to disclose this information.Some children's products are not PFAS-free, despite claiming to be, the BBC learned.We found PFAS in a children's coat we bought from the Mountain Warehouse website a few months ago, even though the site says that none of its children's products are made with forever chemicals.The jacket we tested came from a small batch of old stock, made more than three years ago, Mountain Warehouse told the BBC.Although the coat \"meets UK safety standards\", it added, the product has now been withdrawn from sale.The company said it was working \"to eliminate PFAS from all products as soon as possible\" and that \"children's clothing manufactured since 2023 is PFAS-free\".If fabrics containing PFAS come into \"prolonged contact with human skin\" there's the potential the chemicals can be absorbed across the skin, explained Prof Stuart Harrad at the University of Birmingham, who tested the coat for us.Firms ordered to reduce forever chemicals in drinking water sources for 6 million peopleOur greatest exposure to forever chemicals comes from food - particularly fish, meat, eggs, fruit and fruit products, according to the European Food Safety Authority.An innocent-looking strawberry could have PFAS exposure, I learned, because the chemicals can be added to pesticides \"to help them stick better to the fruit, so when it rains it doesn't wash off\", explained Prof David Megson of Manchester Metropolitan University.Of the assortment of picnic items we laid out, a bottle of wine could carry the greatest PFAS risk, Prof Megson told me.\"We concentrate hundreds of grapes into each bottle. As the wider pesticide breaks down, the PFAS bit is left behind,\" he said.Fruits such as grapes may have been exposed to PFAS chemicalsPFAS chemicals are so embedded in modern life that none of us can fully escape them. They have made our lives convenient and our products durable - but at a potential cost we are only now beginning to count.The European Commission is consulting on an outright ban on about 10,000 PFAS chemicals. The UK government says it is looking to ban or restrict some chemicals but has not committed to a blanket ban. It told us that it is \"working at pace with regulators to assess levels of PFAS in the environment, their sources and potential risks\" to inform its approach to \"policy and regulation\".PFAS chemicals have many essential uses, and safer substitutes are not yet available, argues the Chemical Industries Association. It says \"regulators and industry need to work together in setting transition periods\" to bring alternatives to market.When I first had the blood tests, I thought it would provide an interesting scene for our documentary.But once you know these chemicals are inside you, you can't unknow it. Having a plan to reduce my exposure is a small comfort. But I'll be honest, it is also another thing to worry about.",

    "body": "Spain midfielder Aitana Bonmati is set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines after breaking her leg in training.The 27-year-old fell awkwardly during a morning practice session at the national team's training base in Las Rozas, Madrid, on Sunday. Spain were preparing for the second leg of their Uefa Women's Nations League final against Germany at the Estadio Metropolitano on 2 December.Bonmati played 77 minutes of last Friday's first leg, which finished goalless, in Kaiserslautern.A statement from the Royal Spanish Football Federation said that \"following tests carried out by the medical services\" Bonmati was \"diagnosed with a fracture in her left fibula\".Bonmati will return to Barcelona to begin her rehabilitation and the injury setback is a disappointing end to what has otherwise been a stellar year for the player.She became the first player to win the women's Ballon d'Or three times, achieved a domestic treble with Barca and reached the Euro 2025 final with Spain.Bonmati was also named the Champions League's player of the season by Uefa.Ben Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "body": "11 hours agoImogen Foulkes,GenevaandTom BennettThe founder of the Swiss right-to-die organisation Dignitas has died by assisted suicide, the group says.Ludwig Minelli, 92, died on Saturday, days before his 93rd birthday.The group paid tribute to Minelli, saying he had led a \"life for freedom of choice, self-determination, and human rights\".Minelli founded Dignitas in 1998, and since then it has helped thousands of people to die. In recent decades, some countries have shifted their stance on assisted dying, with Australia, Canada and New Zealand introducing laws. The UK House of Lords is currently debating the assisted dying bill. Critics of the legalisation say it could see disabled and vulnerable people being coerced into ending their lives.Minelli began his career as a journalist, working as a correspondent for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, before studying law and taking an interest in human rights.Across his life, he campaigned passionately for the right to die, giving Dignitas the slogan \"dignity in life, dignity in death\". In a 2010 interview with the BBC, he said: \"I am persuaded that we have to struggle in order to implement the last human right in our societies. And the last human right is the right to make a decision on one's own end, and the possibility to have this end without risk and without pain.\"Minelli founded Dignitas after splitting from the older Swiss assisted dying organisation, Exit, because he felt its rules were too restrictive. The group became world famous because it offers assisted suicide to non-Swiss citizens who travel to Switzerland because assisted dying is not permitted in their own countries.Within Switzerland he was sometimes criticised for an alleged lack of transparency over the financial dealings of the organisation, and for offering assisted dying to those who were not terminally ill, but who wanted to end their lives.He faced numerous legal challenges, and made multiple successful appeals to the Swiss supreme courtIn a statement, Dignitas said his work had had a lasting influence, pointing to a 2011 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, in which it confirmed the right of a person capable of judgement to decide on the manner and the time of their own end of life.Euthanasia - when a lethal drug is administered by a physician to deliberately end a person's life to relieve suffering - is illegal in Switzerland.But assisted dying has been permitted under Swiss law since 1942, under strict conditions including a stipulation that there is no profit motive involved, and that the individual wishing to die is of sound mind.Dignitas said in a statement that it would continue to \"manage and develop the association in the spirit of its founder as a professional and combative international organisation for self-determination and freedom of choice in life and at the end of life\".If you've been affected by issues in this article, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",

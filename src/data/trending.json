Alongside Zohran Mamdani’s win in New York and the governor races in New Jersey and West Virginia, the party also won important - albeit less glamorous - races in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\nIn this episode, Justin, Anthony and Sarah unpack how and where the Democrats won, and what it means for the party and next year’s midterm elections.\nFor Republicans, the inquest has already begun into a bruising night for the party that has raised fears ahead of the 2026 midterms and the party’s congressional majority. Donald Trump is blaming poor results on the ongoing government shutdown and his name not being on the ballot.\nAnd we’re joined by Jim Messina, a Democrat strategist and former deputy chief of staff to Barack Obama. He gives his take on what he thinks lies behind Tuesday’s wins, what he thinks the party has learned since 2024 and whether he agrees with Prop 50 - the redistricting measures passed in California to redraw the state’s political lines to favour Democrats.\nHOSTS:\n* Sarah Smith, North America editor\n* Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n* Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nGUEST:\n* Jim Messina, Former deputy chief of staff to Barack Obama\nGET IN TOUCH:\n* Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n* Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n* Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n* Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "5 hours agoDharshini DavidDeputy economics editorThere is a buzz outside the Bank of England.City workers are taking advantage of the unusually mild weather to enjoy lunch outside, and there has been a shift in temperature too inside the Bank.The decision to hold rates at 4% was made by the narrowest of margins, and the interest rate panel thinks inflation has peaked.Governor Andrew Bailey said he wanted to see if forthcoming developments confirmed this view before cutting rates; weakness in the labour market could also play a part.The Bank also noted last year's Budget measures – such as an increase in employer National Insurance Contributions and minimum wages – contributed to price pressures over the last year.A key factor in future decisions will be the contents of the forthcoming Budget, which may ease price pressures with direct measures on bills, but also tax rises  taking money out of pockets.The chancellor has been keen to claim credit for creating the conditions for rate cuts by providing the right environment. But the Bank's report makes clear that last year's Budget measures have contributed to price pressures, and hiring hesitancy by adding to employer's costs.Ironically it is the impact on the labour market that may have contributed to views of the rate setters already looking to cut the cost of borrowing.While the Bank itself refused to speculate about the contents of this Budget, it noted signs that concerns elsewhere, among consumers and businesses, may be holding back the economy. With consumer spending remaining cautious, it expects the economy to grow by 1.2% in 2026, less than the 1.5% it predicts this year - that will not be welcomed in the Treasury.The interest rate panel will have plenty to evaluate in the Budget – the scale and shape of tax rises, help with energy bills and possibly other cost of living challenges, and increases in the National Living Wage.According to the Bank's research, labour costs remain a key uncertainty for employers and also for consumer prices.The rate setters will have to judge the impact of those policies – and the usual monthly evidence on inflation, jobs and so forth – by the next meeting in mid-December. By, in effect, holding the cast vote, it's the governor who may find himself deliberating whether to play Santa – or Scrooge.If not then, economists reckon a cut will come in February. And how many more to follow?The Bank says it sees rates continuing on a \"gradual downward path\". Some members remain nervous about lingering inflation pressures. Its research, for example, shows our expectations of inflation are shaped by recent experience, and in particular, the movements of food prices. We are still reeling from the exceptional pace  of price hikes in recent years and that can lead people and businesses to behave as if inflation is higher than it really is - through wage demands or price increases.Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of homeowners will still face rising costs when renewing their mortgages as rates remain higher than a few years ago: they've been slower to come down than they were to go up.Borrowers may expect more gifts in 2026, but they may arrive only gradually.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterReutersZepbound, Eli Lilly's weight-loss drug, and Wegovy, made by Novo NordiskUS President Donald Trump has announced deals that aim to lower the cost of popular weight-loss drugs, as pharmaceutical prices take centre stage in his administration's messaging around affordability.Speaking alongside drug executives at the White House, Trump unveiled agreements with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Consumers are set to pay between $245 and $350 per month for obesity drugs including Wegovy and Zepbound.Many GLP-1 drugs, used to treat diabetes and obesity, cost over $1,000 a month without insurance or discounts.The deals will expand Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's access to Medicare and Medicaid, the government's public healthcare plans for elderly and low-income Americans.Eli Lilly also said in a statement it would escape tariffs for three years as part of the agreement with the Trump administration.An estimated 10% of Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible for expanded access to GLP-1 drugs, and will only pay $50, according to senior administration officials.Those enrolled in Medicaid will see a rolling start date based on when states sign up to participate, the officials said.Trump has long pushed for \"most-favoured nations\" prices - a policy aimed at aligning drug prices in the US with lower ones abroad.The obesity drugs will be sold at discounted prices on the direct-to-consumer TrumpRx, a government-run website set to launch by January.On TrumpRx, Wegovy and Zepbound will start at $350 per month on average, and drop to $250 within two years, administration officials said. The Medicare prices of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound will be $245.Along with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, Eli Lilly's weight-loss pill, orforglipron, will be sold for $149 for the lowest dose, Eli Lilly said in a statement. The company's Zepbound medication will cost $299 for a starting dose.Those prices are dependent on Food and Drug Administration approval of the pills.\"Lilly is in a unique position to work with the US government to rebalance the global system, expand access and lower costs for Americans,\" David Ricks, Eli Lilly's chief executive, said in a statement.GLP-1 drugs are often not covered by private insurance. Federal law bans Medicare from covering the drugs when used for weight loss, though they usually are covered when used to treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Only 13 states provide coverage under Medicaid for weight loss purposes.Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, speaking at the White House, said the deals were products of months of negotiations with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. He called obesity \"the number one driver of chronic disease\" in the US.\"This will be a lifesaver to them,\" Kennedy said. \"It's not a panacea, it's not a silver bullet,\" he added, stressing the importance of dietary changes and physical exercise.Since July, Trump has been pressuring pharmaceutical firms to lower drug prices. He sent letters to 17 drug companies in the summer, giving them 60 days to respond to his demands for lower prices.Pfizer was the first major drug maker to reach a deal with Trump, slashing prices for some medicines by up to 85% on the TrumpRx site. Pfizer also agreed to lower prescription drug prices for Medicaid.AstraZeneca and EMD Serono have also reached deals with the administration in recent weeks.",

    "body": "COP30: World leaders take aim at Trump for climate inaction40 minutes agoEsme Stallard,Climate and science reporter, BBC News and Matt McGrath,Environment correspondent, BBC NewsPablo Porciuncula/AFPBrazilian President Lula warned of \"extremist forces\" when he addressed world leaders at the global climate summitPresident Trump was under attack on Thursday as world leaders lined up to criticise his stance on climate change ahead of the global COP30 summit.The US leader, who is absent from the gathering in the Amazonian city of Belém, was called a liar for his rejection of climate science and \"against humankind\" for his rollback of key climate policies.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the waning political consensus on the issue. He said climate change was once a unity issue but \"today however, sadly that consensus is gone\".Over the next two weeks countries will try and negotiate a new deal on climate change, with a particular focus on channelling more money to forest protection.Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit.And whilst President Donald Trump isn't attending this meeting in Belém, his views on climate change are certainly on the minds of many of the other leaders present.Speaking at the UN in September, the US president said that climate change was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\", and refuted the use of renewable energy. He said: \"The entire globalist concept, asking successful industrialised nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies, must be rejected completely and totally.\"Without naming the US leader, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil warned on Thursday of \"extremist forces that fabricate fake news and are condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming\".The leaders of Chile and Colombia went further, calling the US president a liar, and asking other countries to ignore US efforts to move away from climate action.Maisa Rojas, Chile's environment minister, told the BBC: \"The science is very clear. It is very important not to falsify the truth.\"But while Trump-bashing went down well with the audience, getting agreement on new steps to tackle warming is proving much harder.Only a few dozen leaders have turned up here in Belém, and a majority of countries have failed to submit new plans to cut carbon emissions, the root cause of rising temperatures.AFP via Getty ImagesOuteiro Port in Belém was recently expanded to accommodate cruise ships acting as \"floating hotels\" for COP30 delegatesDespite UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledging that global political support for the climate movement is waning, he told the gathering of those that were present: \"My message is that the UK is all-in.\"However, on Wednesday night, in a blow to the Brazilian hosts, the UK chose to opt out of its flagship $125bn (£95bn) fund to support the world's rainforests.President Lula hoped that $25bn could be raised for the Tropical Forests Forever Facility from public sources – mainly from developed countries like the UK – to support governments and communities protecting the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin.The protection of these ecosystems is crucial for tackling climate change - they cover just 6% of the world's land, yet store billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases and host half of the planet's species.The move by the UK has come as a surprise as it had been heavily involved in the fund's design, and launched a global commitment for countries to halt deforestation by 2030 when it hosted the COP summit in Glasgow in 2021.Lord Zach Goldsmith, who worked on the issue when he was former environment minister, told the BBC's PM programme: \"The assumption was that the UK would be a leading participant and at the last minute the UK has walked away. It has caused real frustration to put it mildly here in Brazil... the Brazilian government behind the scenes is furious.\"The decision also seems at odds with the stance of the Prince of Wales. Also addressing leaders on Thursday he declared the fund \"a visionary step toward valuing nature's role in climate stability\" and shortlisted it for his £1m Earthshot Prize.COP26: World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030ReutersResearchers at Imperial College believe climate change increased the extreme rainfall associated with Hurricane Melissa, which caused at least 30 deaths and widespread flooding in Haiti (pictured)Prince William tried to encourage leaders to overcome their differences and move forward with action. \"I have long believed in the power of urgent optimism: the conviction that, even in the face of daunting challenges, we have the ingenuity and determination to make a difference, and to do so now,\" he said.And he urged them to take action for the sake of their children and grandchildren.\"Let us rise to this moment with the clarity that history demands of us. Let us be the generation that turned the tide - not for applause, but for the quiet gratitude of those yet to be born,\" he said.From Monday, countries will spend two weeks negotiating further action on climate change - with crucial questions on how to raise finance previously pledged for those already affected by the worst impacts of climate change.The last few weeks have seen devastating extreme weather globally. Hurricane Melissa, which hit the Caribbean last week, is one of the strongest the island nations have ever experienced - resulting in the deaths of more than 75 people. Recent analysis from Imperial College has suggested that climate change increased the extreme rainfall associated with the Category 5 hurricane by 16%.Additional reporting by Ione Wells and Justin Rowlatt.",

    "body": "14 minutes agoLily Jamali,in San Francisco and Aoife Walsh,in WashingtonNancy Pelosi has announced her retirement from Congress, ending a decades-long career that saw the California Democrat become one of the most powerful figures in US politics.In a video message on Thursday, Pelosi said she will not be seeking re-election to Congress at the end of her term in January 2027.It marks the end of a storied political career: Pelosi, 85, became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House and led her party in the lower chamber of Congress from 2003 until 2023.\"We have made history, we have made progress,\" Pelosi said in her message. \"We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy, and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\"\"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,\" Pelosi added.Pelosi was first elected to Congress to represent San Francisco in 1987 aged 47, and quickly rose through the ranks. She was elected by her party to be speaker of the House in 2007, becoming the first woman to serve in that role. She served until 2011, when Democrats lost control of the lower chamber, before returning to the speaker's chair from 2019 to 2023.Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. After the vice-president, it is next in line to the presidency.In that role, Pelosi played a critical role in advancing - or thwarting - the agendas of multiple presidents during her long career on Capitol Hill.She is widely credited with marshalling the passage of former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation, as well as bills to address infrastructure and climate change during Joe Biden's presidency.Pelosi also directly challenged Donald Trump throughout his presidency, famously ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address behind his back.By then she was also a lightning rod for Republican anger - in their eyes, representing the coastal elites pushing a big-spending, radical platform.She led two impeachment efforts against Trump - the first in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. Trump was accused of pressing Ukraine to dig up damaging information on Biden, and of using military aid as leverage. He was later acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.The second was in 2021, when he was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. That effort ultimately failed and Trump was acquitted once again.On Thursday, when asked about Pelosi's retirement, Trump said she was \"an evil woman\".\"I'm glad she's retiring. I think she did the country a great service by retiring,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I think she was a tremendous liability for the country.\"After Trump's first term, Pelosi worked with Biden to shepherd much of his legislative agenda through her chamber despite the razor-thin margins.In less than two years, Democrats in the House pushed through a Covid relief bill, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion-dollar environment and social spending programme, and legislation protecting gay marriage.She was succeeded as Democratic leader in the House by New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries in 2022.Since leaving her speakership, she has remained a major political influence. Most recently, she played a key role in helping to pass Proposition 50 in California -  a state redistricting effort aimed at flipping five House seats to Democrats during the midterms in 2026.",

    "body": "43 minutes agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterGetty ImagesPauline Collins, the star of the film Shirley Valentine, for which she was Oscar nominated in 1990, has died at the age of 85.She died \"peacefully\" aged 85 in her London care home surrounded by her family having had Parkinson's disease for several years, her family said.Collins will be best remembered for her portrayal of disgruntled housewife Shirley in Lewis Gilbert's award-winning film, based on the acclaimed stage play by Willy Russell.Her critically acclaimed performance also won her the Golden Globe Award for best actress along with a Bafta. 'Witty presence'Collins' family said in a statement: \"Pauline was so many things to so many people, playing a variety of roles in her life. A bright, sparky, witty presence on stage and screen. Her illustrious career saw her play politicians, mothers and queens.\"She will always be remembered as the iconic, strong-willed, vivacious and wise Shirley Valentine - a role that she made all her own. We were familiar with all those parts of her because her magic was contained in each one of them.\"They added she was their \"loving mum, our wonderful grandma and great-grandma\", and actor John Alderton's \"life-long love\".\"Warm, funny, generous, thoughtful, wise, she was always there for us,\" they said, thanking her carers, who looked after her with \"dignity, compassion, and most of all love\".\"She could not have had a more peaceful goodbye. We hope you will remember her at the height of her powers; so joyful and full of energy; and give us the space and privacy to contemplate a life without her.\"Getty ImagesCollins starred opposite her husband John Alderton in Upstairs Downstairs, appearing from 1971 to 1973Her husband Alderton also issued a separate statement, describing his wife as \"a remarkable star\", having worked with her more than any other actor. \"What I saw was not only her brilliant range of diverse characters but her magic of bringing out the best in all of the people she worked with,\" he said. \"She wanted everyone to be special and she did this by never saying 'Look at me'. It's no wonder that she was voted the nation's sweetheart in the 1970s.\"He added she would always be remembered for Shirley Valentine, \"not only for her Oscar nomination or the film itself, but for clean-sweeping all seven awards when she portrayed her on Broadway in the stage play, in which she played every character herself\".Shirley Valentine is a middle-aged Liverpool housewife, who is tired of her insensitive husband, played by Bernard Hill, and her suburban existence.But her life changes when her best friend wins a holiday for two to Greece. Shirley goes, and falls for a local tavern owner - played by Tom Conti - who she goes on to have a passionate holiday fling with, reinvigorating her lust for life.Russell T Davies, who worked with the actress on a 2006 Doctor Who episode, Tooth and Claw, posted on Instagram: \"It was such an honour to have her on set, I was in awe... Oh she was salty and wonderful, and the finest of actors. \"As for Shirley Valentine, as writer Matthew Todd says today, \"Says more about UK life at that time than any history book ever could.\" A true star. And she'd laugh at that.\"Broadway roleCollins first played the title role of Shirley Valentine at the Vaudeville Theatre in London in 1988. She won that year's Olivier award for best actress.The following year she reprised the role on Broadway, New York, where she picked up numerous prizes including a prestigious Tony award.The film of the same name was released later that year.Her other films included 1991's City of Joy with Patrick Swayze, filmed in Calcutta, which brought her wider recognition globally.Born in Exmouth in 1940, Collins was raised near Liverpool and started out her career as a teacher.Her love of the stage led her to take up acting on a part-time basis, and in 1957 she had a cameo role as a nurse in the Emergency Ward 10 TV series.Her film debut came in Secrets of a Windmill Girl in 1966, playing a fictional dancer in a London striptease nightclub, the Windmill Theatre.After a number of stage roles, she used her Liverpool accent to land a leading role on The Liver Birds in 1969.She starred as Dawn in five episodes before she left to be replaced by Nerys Hughes, who played the role of Sandra.She also starred in five episodes of Doctor Who, but  told The Guardian in 2012 that after appearing in the show as Samantha Briggs in 1967, she was offered another 39 episodes but turned them down.\"I thought it was like a prison sentence. Maybe it would have given me a profile early in my career, but then I would have missed so many things,\" she said.PA MediaCollins last acted in The Time of Their Lives, a road trip comedy film co-starring Joan Collins in 2017It was through acting that she met her husband John Alderton. They married in 1969 and had three children, Nicholas, Kate, and Richard.Alderton and Collins starred alongside each other in a number of television and film roles, such as Upstairs, Downstairs, in which she played a maid in ITV's popular series.Her later roles included acclaimed roles in period dramas including a 2005 TV adaptation of Bleak House and 2015's Dickensian.She also played Cissy Robson in 2012 film Quartet alongside Dame Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Tom Courtenay and Billy Connolly and Sheridan Smith.",

I witnessed Stephen Crean unfortunately get injured and I didn't see him after that.\"Astrid is in no doubt how vital his actions were, saying he was a hero. \"I think undoubtedly, if Stephen wasn't there, I would have been seriously injured, as well as many other people in that buffet car,\" she said.\"My message to him would be that I'm so thankful for his actions because my life could have been so different. I'm so lucky to be here walking around unharmed.\"Mr Crean told the BBC on Monday how he had been stabbed on his hand, back and head as he \"tussled\" with the attacker and was determined not to let him past until he was sure everyone who had barricaded themselves in the buffet car was safe.He said: \"That door still wasn't shut behind me because I could still see [a passenger] struggling to close it. So until I knew it was I wasn't moving away from it.\"'Do you want to die?' - Train attack victim describes confrontation with alleged attackerKnife attack probed for links to train stabbingsThe 20 terrifying minutes endured by train attack passengersAstrid said she was pulling at the door of the buffet car to try and close it and other passengers were inside holding onto the door as others called the police.Everyone in the buffet car was in \"a state of shock\", she said as she praised Mr Crean's calm in the moment.\"A lot of people hypothesize what they would have done, or whether they would have been able to take on the attacker,\" said Astrid. \"But it's if you are brave enough in that moment and it's much easier said than done. \"The fact that Stephen had that courage when he only had a split second decision to make is so admirable.\"Astrid/BBCAstrid: \"Undoubtedly, if Stephen wasn't there, I would have been seriously injured.\"'So proud'The BBC told a tearful Mr Crean about Astrid's message to him. \"It makes you feel so proud. That's made my life. I'm just so happy now. That's the best thing ever, knowing that I've actually done something…It's good news that they're safe, and that's what I set out to do, to protect.\"Mr Crean now faces an operation on his fingers which were sliced by the attacker as he confronted him.An online fundraiser has raised more than £50,000 for him including donations from Nottingham Forest football club whose match he was returning from.The LNER train was travelling from Doncaster to London King's Cross and stopped at Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, shortly before 20:00 GMT on Saturday as the attack unfolded.The train driver Andrew Johnson and rail worker Samir Zitouni are among those who have been praised for their actions on the night.Anthony Williams, 32, has been charged with 11 counts of attempted murder, including that of Mr Crean, two counts of possession of a bladed article and one count of actual bodily harm.One of the attempted murder count relates to a separate incident.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSima KotechaSenior UK correspondentThe stern appearance of Wandsworth prison is enough to make grown people shudder.Based in leafy south-west London, the Victorian-era facility - with its gaunt brick walls and a dark intimidating entrance - is one of the largest in the UK.  The inside is just as intimidating. Having visited several years ago, I was struck by the smell of urine from the gutters that line the cell blocks.  I've been inside several prisons during my career but this was by far the worst.Like many prisons, it suffers from overcrowding and has almost double the number of inmates it was designed to house.The prison is not known for having robust security. Only a couple of years ago, Daniel Khalife, who was on remand awaiting trial for breaching the Official Secrets Act, escaped by strapping himself to the underside of a food delivery truck.The mistaken release of two prisoners in a week has once again drawn attention to the Category B jail. One serving prison officer from the jail described the security as a \"joke\".  They told me: \"It's crazy in there and mistakes are constantly happening. There is a real state of panic after this blunder and I'm thinking about whether I can take much more of this job when stuff like this happens and makes us look like idiots.\"An independent monitoring board report released last month said a third of staff are absent every day - while a 2024 inspectorate report said security remained a significant concern.The prison is renowned for being one of the worst in the country. It received an urgent notification in May 2024 following an unannounced visit by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Charlie Taylor.An \"urgent notification\" in prisons is a formal process where the chief inspector alerts the justice secretary about significant and urgent concerns. The urgent concerns included assaults on staff, overcrowding, and staff not being able to account for prisoners' whereabouts.In a letter to the then Justice Secretary Alex Chalk, Mr Taylor wrote: \"Inspectors found significant weaknesses in many aspects of security. Wings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day.\"We know very little at this stage about why or how Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, a sex offender, was mistakenly released.The Metropolitan Police was not told about the error for almost a week and it is unclear why this was the case.As for a second man, William Smith, the BBC understands his accidental release was due to a clerical error at court. He has since handed himself in.I hear from insiders that it is a possibility prison staff did not realise Khaddour-Cherif was even missing until a few days after his release.Sources tell me that the governor of HMP Wandsworth, Andy Davy, was not at the jail on the day Khaddour-Cherif was mistakenly freed. Ironically, that is because Davy had been tasked with carrying out the inquiry into how Hadush Kebatu was released by accident from Chelmsford prison in Essex. I understand that investigation is now complete.Almost two weeks ago, the Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, David Lammy, introduced additional checks after the accidental release of Kebatu to ensure mistakes like that do not happen again.  But these checks are proving to be a \"significant burden\" according to one senior prison staffer, who said \"they've only increased the paperwork\".  \"It's now taking a day in some cases to complete the checks to release someone and this isn't helpful when staffing is an issue,\" they said.I understand the early release scheme that was brought in last summer after prisons almost reached full capacity has also increased pressure on staff - and contributed to the increase in accidental releases.The emergency scheme allows some inmates to be released after serving 40% of their fixed term sentence, rather than the usual 50%.\"There are more comings and goings now, and that means we're dealing with more checks, more paperwork, more calculations of sentences, and this just means more mistakes are happening. It's inevitable,\" a prison officer said.More than 200 people were released by mistake over the last year - and the government says it is unacceptable. Some staff are incandescent, saying the prison system has been in crisis for a while now, but that the recent errors are why politicians are suddenly engaging.\"How bad does it have to get before they do something?,\" asked one staffer.  \"It's a shitstorm.\"",

    "body": "50 minutes agoLynette Horsburgh & Rachael LazaroNorth WestFamily photosBebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar were killed in the 29 July 2024 attackThe families of the three girls murdered in the Southport attacks have condemned the killer's parents for failing to take responsibility and \"staying silent\" when they knew how dangerous their son was.Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, were killed by Axel Rudakubana, then 17, in a knife attack in 2024.The girls' families said \"deeply distressing\" evidence from the killer's parents, heard at the Southport Inquiry, showed \"this tragedy was not inevitable. It was the result of neglect\".The killer's parents apologised to the families at the hearing, saying they were \"profoundly sorry\" for their \"failure\".Elsie's parents, Jenni and David Stancombe, said they believed the killer's parents, Alphonse Rudakubana and Laetitia Muzayire, \"should be held to account for what they allowed to happen\".\"They knew how dangerous he was, yet they stayed silent,\" they said.\"They failed not only as parents but as members of our society.\"The killer's parents \"knew his behaviour was escalating\" in the months, weeks, and days before the attack, they said, \"and still, they did nothing\".They accused them of showing \"no real remorse or acceptance of the devastation their son caused\".PA MediaThe girls' families said the evidence at the inquiry into the killings was \"deeply distressing\"Alex and Sergio Aguiar said the system had failed their beloved Alice, Bebe and Elsie. \"This tragedy was not inevitable,\" they said.\"It was the result of neglect - neglect by those who should have known better, and by a system that repeatedly ignored warning signs.\"The institutions and authorities whose role it is to safeguard children failed in their most essential function and because of those failures, we have lost everything.\"Bebe's parents, Lauren and Ben King, added: \"What we're struggling to comprehend is not just [the killer's parents'] failure then, but their failure now - to acknowledge, to take responsibility, to face up to what they allowed to happen.\"But this isn't just about the actions of one family. \"This is about the repeated failings of agencies and professionals who should have known better - who did know better - and still did nothing.\"'Desperately sorry'The statements followed Mr Rudakubana and Ms Muzayire giving evidence at the public inquiry into the killings.The couple who gave their evidence via videolink, which could be heard but not seen by the public and press, both apologised to the victims' families.Ms Muzayire, who moved to the UK from Rwanda with her husband in 2002, said her family had come to the inquiry with \"broken hearts\".\"There are no words that can ever be enough to express our grief and remorse for the children whose lives were taken or forever changed by our son's actions,\" she said.She said there were \"many things\" she and her husband wished they had done differently.  \"[For] our failure, we are profoundly sorry,\" she added.During his second day of evidence, Mr Rudakubana said he was \"desperately sorry\" for the families of the victims, and was \"so ashamed\" he \"lost the courage to save their little angels\".Nicholas Bowen KC, representing the bereaved families, told him: \"They have complete disdain for your excuses and the manner in which you have answered questions.\"Mr Bowen was then stopped by inquiry chairman Sir Adrian Fulford, who told him: \"That's not appropriate at all.\"The girls' parents issued their statements as the inquiry concluded its first phase. A second phase of the inquiry is expected to focus on the risk posed by young people with a fixation or obsession with acts of extreme violence.  Rudakubana, 18, is serving a minimum 52-year sentence for the murders.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "9 minutes agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterTwo peers are set to be suspended from the House of Lords for breaching rules, including providing parliamentary services in return for \"payment or reward\".Former Army chief Lord Richard Dannatt and businessman Lord David Evans of Watford face suspensions of four and five months respectively.The House of Lords' standards watchdog launched separate investigations into the two men following an undercover operation by the Guardian newspaper. Neither peer appealed the standard commissioner's findings or the sanctions, which will come into force once approved by the House of Lords.In the course of his investigation, the standards commissioner found that crossbench peer Lord Dannatt had breached the code of conduct by corresponding with ministers and government officials about three companies - UK Nitrogen, Teledyne UK and Blue International Holdings - in which he had a financial interest.The commissioner also identified four ways in which Labour peer Lord Evans had broken the rules, including by sponsoring events in Parliament for a company that was owned by his son, and in which he held one-third of the shares. Both men referred themselves to the commissioner after the Guardian reported comments they had made to the newspaper's undercover reporters.Lord Dannatt was filmed telling the journalists, posing as potential commercial clients, he could make introductions to people in government and could \"make a point of getting to know\" the best-placed ministers.The commissioner concluded that no lobbying had taken place and no payment had been received.However, he said Lord Dannatt had demonstrated \"a clear willingness to undertake activity that would have amounted to paid parliamentary services\" and had \"demonstrated insufficient regard for the need to act solely in the public interest in the course of his parliamentary activities\".For that reason, he said the peer had breached the section of the code of conduct which requires members to \"always act on their personal honour\".During the course of the investigation, the commissioner identified three further breaches, relating to Lord Dannatt contacting people in government about companies in which he had a financial interest.In these instances, the commissioner said the peer had breached the section of the code which states that peers \"must not seek to profit from membership of the House by accepting or agreeing to accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services\". He said Lord Dannatt's \"lack of understanding\" about the code and his belief that he was \"acting in the national interest\" were not mitigating factors, but acknowledged the peer's \"proactive expressions of remorse\" and \"willingness to learn\".In a statement, Lord Dannatt accepted three breaches of the code of conduct had been found by the commissioner but added \"for the record\" that the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists had investigated the two UK-based matters and \"concluded that I had not conducted consultant lobbying\".He said he \"deeply\" regretted the findings and said that the \"honourable course of action was not to waste the Conduct Committee's time by appealing against the findings but to accept the appropriate sanction\".Lord Dannatt said he had declared all relevant interests, as well as registering them with the Registrar of Lords' Interests, but he accepted his actions had been \"insufficient\" and that \"ignorance\" was no defence for any breach of the code of conduct. He added: \"I also understand that acting in the national interest in good faith, which was my motivation in the three matters, is not an excuse or justification for breaching the Code of Conduct.\"At nearly 75 no-one is too old to learn lessons and I hope that these activities will be placed in the context of my 56-years public service.\"Lord Evans was found to have failed to \"act on his personal honour\" by telling the Guardian journalists he could introduce them to MPs.He also sponsored events in Parliament for the company, Affinity, and asked members of the House of Lords if they would speak at the events. Tickets to the events were advertised for sale at a price greater than the actual cost per head, contravening House of Lords rules on holding events, the commissioner's report said. He noted that Lord Evans had believed his shares in Affinity had been transferred to his son in 2013 and therefore \"did not think he would benefit from sponsoring events for Affinity as a shareholder\". However, the commissioner concluded that, taking into the account the \"number and seriousness of the breaches\", a lengthy suspension from the Lords would be appropriate. ",

    "body": "An Australian senator has provoked anger for wearing a burka in parliament, after pushing for a ban on the Muslim garment.Pauline Hanson was condemned by fellow senators, with one accusing her of \"blatant racism\". Proceedings in the senate were halted as she refused to remove the item. The Queensland senator, of the anti-immigration One Nation party, was seeking to introduce a bill that would ban full face coverings in public – a policy she has long campaigned for.It is the second time she has worn the garment – which covers the face and body – in parliament, and said her actions were in protest at the senate rejecting her bill.Shortly after other lawmakers blocked her from introducing the bill on Monday, she returned wearing a black burka.\"This is a racist senator, displaying blatant racism,\" said Mehreen Faruqi, a Muslim  Greens senator from New South Wales.Fatima Payman, an independent senator from the state of Western Australia, called the stunt \"disgraceful\".Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who serves as leader of the government in the senate, condemned it as \"disrespectful\". \"We represent in our states, people of every faith, of every faith of all backgrounds. And we should do so decently,\" she said.She added Hanson was \"not worthy of a member of the Australian Senate\" and moved a motion to suspend Hanson for failing to remove the garment. In a post on Facebook, Hanson wrote \"If they don't want me wearing it - ban the burka.\"She previously wore a burka to parliament in 2017, also calling for a national ban at the time.In 2016, Hanson was criticised for her maiden speech to the Australian senate, in which she said the country was in danger of being \"swamped by Muslims\".It echoed her controversial 1996 speech in which she warned that the country was in danger of being \"swamped by Asians\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesJimmy Cliff's hits included Many Rivers To Cross, Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really WantJimmy Cliff, one of the most prominent and beloved proponents of reggae music, has died at the age of 81.A star since the 1960s, he helped to bring the sound of Jamaica to a global audience through hits such as Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want.His lead role as a gun-toting rebel in the 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come is a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema, and was attributed as the movie that brought reggae to America.Cliff's wife, Latifa Chambers, announced his death via a statement on Instagram.\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" she wrote.\"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. \"To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career.\"Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\" Her message was also signed by their children, Lilty and Aken.Getty ImagesBorn James Chambers in 1944, Cliff grew up as the eighth of nine children in abject poverty in the parish of St. James, Jamaica.Blessed with a sweet, mellifluous voice, he began singing at his local church at the age of six.He was inspired to write his own material when he heard ska pioneer Derrick Morgan on the radio - and asked his woodwork teacher how one might go about composing their own song. “He told me, ‘You just write it!’“ he told Mojo magazine. ”So I went ahead and… wrote a song called I Need A Fiancée, another called Sob Sob and I made a guitar out of bamboo to accompany myself.”By the time he was 14, he'd moved to Kingston and adopted the surname Cliff to express the heights he intended on reaching.He recorded a handful of singles before topping the Jamaican charts with his own composition, Hurricane Hattie. In 1965, he relocated to London to work with Island Records - later the home of Bob Marley - but the label's attempts to make his sound palatable to rock audiences were initially unsuccessful.He eventually struck gold with the 1969 single Wonderful World, Beautiful People - an upbeat, feelgood anthem; and the more politically-charged Vietnam, which Bob Dylan called \"the best protest song ever written\".Its lyric tells the story of a young soldier who writes from the war, promising his mother he'll be home soon; only for her to receive a telegram the next day, informing her of his death.Cliff reflected on the song in 1986, telling reggae archivist Roger Steffens: \"The essence of my music is struggle. What gives it the icing is the hope of love.\"Getty ImagesThe Harder They Come had to be subtitled in the US because of the character's thick Jamaican patoisThe musician became an international star with The Harder They Come, expressly written for the movie of the same name, in which he played Ivan Martin, a young man trying to break into Jamaica's corrupt music industry.\"The film opened the door for Jamaica,\" Cliff recalled. \"It said, 'This is where this music comes from.'\"BBC Sounds: Witness - Jimmy Cliff on The Harder They ComeBBC 6 Music: The First Time with Jimmy CliffCliff contributed four songs to the soundtrack, including the gospel hymn Many Rivers To Cross, which reflected his early days as a struggling artist in the UK.\"I was still in my teens,\" he later recalled. \"I came full of vigour: I'm going to make it, I'm going to be up there with the Beatles and the Stones.\"\"And it wasn't really going like that, I was touring clubs, not breaking through. I was struggling, with work, life, my identity. I couldn't find my place. Frustration fuelled the song.\"Instead, the film and its soundtrack won him international acclaim. Rolling Stone magazine even named it one of their top 500 albums of all time.During the 1980s, he collaborated with the Rolling Stones on their Dirty Work album, and he returned to the US charts in 1993 with his cover of I Can See Clearly Now, from the soundtrack for Cool Runnings, which followed the escapades of Jamaica's bobsled team.His other recordings included the Grammy Award-winning albums Cliff Hanger (1985) and Rebirth (2012), a nostalgic return to form.Cliff entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, calling it \"a great thrill and an honour\".Inducting him, Fugees star Wyclef Jean said he'd been inspired by Cliff's success as a young boy growing up in Haiti.\"When we saw Jimmy Cliff, we saw ourselves,\" he said.Cliff continued to tour late into his life, playing Glastonbury's legends slot in 2003; and winning over a new generation of fans at the 2010 Coachella Festival.His contributions to Jamaican music and culture were recognised in October 2003 when he was awarded the country's prestigious Order of Merit.But the singer said his connection to fans was more important than any of the other honours bestowed upon him.Speaking to US radio station NPR in 2012, he reflected: \"When someone comes up to me and says, 'I was a dropout in school and I heard your song You Can Get It If You Really Want, and that song made me go back to school, and now I am a teacher and I use your song with my students' - that, for me, is a big success.\"",

    "body": "Pioneering Australian chef Skye Gyngell has died aged 62.Gyngell rose to fame in the UK after her cafe at Petersham Nurseries in south-west London was awarded a coveted Michelin star, one of the highest culinary honours. She went on to helm Spring restaurant at Somerset House and Marle and Hearth at Heckfield Place in Hampshire.Gyngell's family said she died on Saturday in London, describing her as a \"culinary visionary who influenced generations of chefs and growers globally to think about food and its connection to the land\". Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver paid tribute to Gyngell - who was diagnosed with skin cancer last year - and thanked her for \"all you did to inspire young cooks\".During the 1980s, Gyngell pioneered the \"slow food movement\" before becoming a private chef for clients including Nigella Lawson, Madonna and Guy Ritchie.Lawson mourned her death, writing on Instagram, \"However ill you know someone to be, their death is always a shock. It's just awful that Skye is no longer in the world.\"Gyngell died just days after her mother, Ann Barr, who was a well-known interior designer.Her father, Bruce Gyngell, was the first person to appear on Australian television in 1956 with the line: \"Good evening, and welcome to television\". He died in 2000.Born in Sydney, Skye Gyngell was studying at Sydney University when she realised the culinary world was where she wanted to be. She moved to Paris at 19, where she trained and worked under acclaimed chefs including at the two Michelin-starred restaurant Dodin-Bouffant.Gyngell later moved to London and worked at the French House in Soho with Fergus and Margot Henderson.In 2004, Gyngell became head chef at Petersham Nurseries cafe in Richmond, where she  turned the dilapidated site into a thriving cafe, and in 2011, it was awarded a Michelin star.But the kudos was a double-edged sword for Gyngell, who left the cafe a year after the award, saying she was frustrated by customers who expected a traditional Michelin experience at her rustic cafe.Her later ventures included Spring at Somerset House, which was the first single-use plastic-free restaurant in London. Gyngell, who overcame drug and alcohol addiction in her younger years, was also known for her award-winning cookbooks and wrote columns for Vogue as its food editor.Last year, she found a lump in her neck and was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer.She underwent an operation which included the removal of her salivary glands, causing her to temporarily lose her sense of smell and taste.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Talks in Geneva between the US and Ukraine aimed at ending the war with Russia have concluded, with officials from both sides reporting \"progress\" and an intention to continue working. However, no details have emerged on how to bridge the considerable divide between Moscow and Kyiv over territorial issues and security guarantees for Ukraine.Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the \"important steps\" that had been made but warned that the \"main problem\" facing the peace talks was Vladimir Putin's demand for legal recognition of Russian-occupied territories in eastern Ukraine.\"This would break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" he said, highlighting concerns that Moscow could be rewarded for its aggression with land it seized by force.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump suggested on social media that \"something good just may be happening\", but with the caveat: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"The Geneva talks did not involve Russian representatives and the Kremlin said it hadn't received any information on the outcome of the discussions. Spokesman Dmitri Peskov noted Moscow was aware that \"adjustments\" were made to the plan that had been welcomed by Putin.A 28-point peace plan drafted by US and Russian officials was presented to Ukraine last week. Several of its elements seemed heavily geared towards Moscow's longstanding demands, sparking consternation in Kyiv and its European allies. Comments by Trump which suggested Ukraine had until Thursday to accept the deal or face serious cuts in US support contributed to creating a sense of urgency across Europe and talks between Ukraine and US officials were hastily convened.By Sunday evening US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said a \"tremendous\" amount of progress had been made at the talks. \"I honestly believe we'll get there,\" he said. But some European leaders have been more cautious. \"I am not sure if we are closer to peace,\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said discussions would be a \"lengthy, long-lasting process\" and that he did not expect any breakthroughs this week.Europeans were left scrambling for a seat at the table last week, after they were seemingly caught unawares when the US draft peace plan was presented. A counter-proposal - reportedly drafted by Britain, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's allowed army size and left the door open to Ukraine joining Nato. Rubio said he was not aware of the plan and on Monday Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov rubbished it as \"completely unconstructive\".Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas region. But Kyiv and its European partners are weary of any settlement which would jeopardise the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty - and Zelensky has repeatedly warned that giving up the Donbas would leave Ukraine vulnerable to Russian attacks in the future. Despite last week's frenzied diplomacy the next steps in the process are unclear. The expectation is that Zelensky will soon personally speak to Trump, after which a new draft peace plan will be eventually presented to Moscow. There were no plans for a meeting this week between Russian and US negotiators, the Kremlin said.British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was still work to do for a \"just and lasting peace\" in Ukraine. A virtual \"coalition of the willing\" meeting will take place on Tuesday to discuss developments, he added.",

    "body": "The government has announced a new national day \"to honour and remember\" victims and survivors of terrorism in the UK.The event will take place on 21 August in a different location across the country each year, with the first held in 2026, the Home Office has said.It comes after a campaign by families and survivors, including those affected by the Westminster Bridge and Manchester arena attacks.Security Minister Dan Jarvis said: \"We will stand together as a nation - honouring all those impacted by terrorism and the horrific experiences they have endured.\"Few details have been released about the first event next summer, but the government said it would keep working with victims and survivors to discuss the day's exact name and design a symbol.The Home Office said the day would focus on \"remembering and recognising those impacted by terrorism, encouraging victims and survivors to access specialist support, educating the public, and amplifying victims' and survivors' stories\".The chosen date coincides with the UN International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism, which began in 2017.Travis Frain, survivor of the Westminster Bridge attack, said he had \"fought tirelessly\" for the UK to adopt a national day of this kind to help \"educate the next generation\".He added that it was \"important that as a society we commemorate and remember those affected - for the impacts are often lifelong\".Figen and Stuart Murray, the parents of Martyn Hett who was killed in the Manchester arena attack in 2017, said the day would not only honour the lives lost, but also acknowledge the \"immense courage of survivors\".The 2017 Westminster Bridge attack, in which four people died when a man drove his car into crowds and then stabbed a police officer outside Parliament, and the bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester the same year, in which 22 people died and 116 were injured, are among the worst attacks in the UK in recent years.In October, two people were killed in an attack that the government said was \"an evil act of antisemitic terrorism\" on a synagogue in Manchester on the holy Jewish day of Yom Kippur.Ministers have previously been criticised over support provided to victims and survivors of terror attacks.In 2023, support network Survivors Against Terror published a report surveying more than 130 survivors of 11 attacks, which described the official compensation scheme for such incidents - the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) - as \"broken\".At the time, the government said the scheme had paid £158m to victims of violent crime in the previous year alone.A subsequent review by the Home Office's Victims of Terrorism Unit found support for victims and survivors of terror attacks \"needs to go further\". In response to that, the consultation for the national day was launched, along with plans for a support hub with specialist trauma care that the government says it expects to start next summer.",

    "body": "Race to rescue London's rare hairy snail5 hours agoGettyFine hairs on the shell are thought to allow the snail to sweat off moistureConservationists and citizen scientists have joined forces for a project to save London's \"charming little\" ice-age hairy snail.Named the German hairy snail because of tiny hairs that cover its shell and because it is believed to originally come from the continent, the rare species is one of the UK's most endangered molluscs.The finger-sized animal (Pseudotrichia rubiginosa) can be found only in small, fragmented patches of its historic damp riverside habitat along the River Thames.The team, led by Citizen Zoo and Zoological Society of London (ZSL), has started a series of surveys to better understand the species' distribution across the capital and inform conservation action.Taking place over the last couple of months, the team has been searching and identifying species at both known and potential river sites in boroughs such as Newham, Richmond upon Thames and Barnet.The team hopes to then build a stronger picture of the snail's current UK range, and identify how habitat restoration, pollution management and the careful movement of snails between sites can help recover their numbers.Joe Pecorelli, freshwater conservation programme manager at ZSL, said: \"This charming little snail has called our riverbanks and wetlands home for thousands of years - yet it is sadly now very rare in the UK, potentially restricted to just a few sites along the Thames.\"PAThe German hairy snail is listed as a priority species for conservation efforts in the London biodiversity action planAlthough first recorded in the UK in 1982, fossilised remains indicate that the German hairy snail has called the UK home since at least the Stone Age - and potentially even as far back at the last Ice Age, when Britain was still joined to mainland Europe.During this period, the Thames was still connected to the Rhine - Germany's longest river - which today empties into the North Sea.Mr Pecorelli said: \"These surveys will help us understand how the snail is faring and how we can protect it - not only securing their future for years to come, but also helping safeguard green spaces throughout London for people and wildlife for future generations.\"The team hopes to then build a stronger picture of the snail's current UK range, and identify how habitat restoration, pollution management and the careful movement of snails between sites can help recover their numbers.The fine hairs that run along the slim, round shell are thought to allow the snail to sweat off moisture, helping to make its slime sticky enough for it to cling to the slippery riverside debris and the plants it feeds on.More on conservation in LondonElliot Newton, director of rewilding at Citizen Zoo, said: \"The German hairy snail is a species that helps spark imagination and open people's minds to the curious and diverse wildlife that can thrive across Greater London.\"It reminds us of the remarkable natural world that exists right on our doorstep.\"The surveys show how, by working together across the capital with many partners and empowering local communities, we can gain a deeper understanding of London's more hidden biodiversity and take steps to protect it.\"The project is running in partnership with London Wildlife Trust, the Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC and the Port of London Authority, and with funding support from Thames21 and the Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.Related internet links",

It is believed she died by strangulation in Corby on the evening of 10 November.The Northamptonshire force later referred itself to the IOPC - a mandatory step because of officers' previous contact with Ms Brella.Northamptonshire PoliceA CCTV picture of the murder suspect Pankaj LambaThe IOPC said its investigation considered the actions of two detectives who had been assigned to the domestic abuse investigation, and two senior officers with \"supervisory responsibility\".In a statement, the IOPC said: \"Having examined all available evidence, it is our opinion the two detective constables have a case to answer for gross misconduct.\"We believe a police disciplinary panel could find the officers didn't appropriately review the case, set investigative actions, seek supervisory advice, or keep Ms Brella sufficiently updated.\"Our investigation also concluded there is a misconduct case to answer for a sergeant and chief inspector over their supervision and review of the domestic abuse investigation and associated risk assessment for Ms Brella.\"It took the view that officers \"may potentially have breached police standards of professional behaviour relating to duties and responsibilities\".IOPC director of engagement, Derrick Campbell, added: \"Our independent investigation examined Northamptonshire Police's response to the disclosure made by Ms Brella that she'd suffered domestic abuse.\"It has scrutinised their investigation strategy, actions taken, communication with the victim, and any safeguarding considerations.\"After a thorough review of the evidence, we have determined four officers should face disciplinary proceedings.\"It will be for a police disciplinary panel to determine whether the allegations are proven.\"The IOPC said it would now be for Northamptonshire Police to organise disciplinary proceedings.Related internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoGeeta PandeyDelhiDinodiaDharmendra often said he was 'embarrassed' by talk about his looksBollywood star Dharmendra has died in the Indian city of Mumbai at the age of 89.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the actor, saying his passing \"marks the end of an era in Indian cinema\".Dharmendra, who often described himself as \"a simple man\", commanded extraordinary affection and loyalty from his tens of millions of fans.Best known as Veeru, the lovable petty criminal in the 1975 blockbuster Sholay, he appeared in over 300 films, many hits, captivating audiences for decades.Songs featuring him topped the charts, and his romance and marriage with Hema Malini made headlines.Dubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\" and \"Garam (hot) Dharam\", the actor often made it to global lists of \"most handsome men\" in his heyday and female fans were known to sleep with his photographs under their pillows.Bollywood stars weren't immune to his charms either - over the years actress Madhuri Dixit described him as \"one of the most handsome people I have seen on screen\", superstar Salman Khan said Dharmendra was the \"most beautiful looking man\" and actress Jaya Bachchan called him \"a Greek God\".Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".Watch: Popular Indian actor Dharmendra receives lifetime achievement awardsBorn on 8 December 1935 in Nasrali village in Punjab's Ludhiana district in a middle-class Jatt-Sikh family, he was named Dharam Singh Deol by his schoolteacher father.In a 2018 interview with BBC Hindi, he said his father wanted him to study, but he fell in love with films early on and wanted to be a hero.\"I watched my first film when I was in the ninth standard and I was hooked. I was wondering, where is this heaven where all these beautiful people live? I thought I must find my way there. I felt like they were mine and I belonged to them.\"But when he told his family, they were appalled.DinodiaDharmendra (right) with Amjad Khan in Sholay\"My mother said, 'you are our eldest child, you have family responsibilities'. I was very sad. So when we heard about the All India Talent Contest by Filmfare magazine, to humour me, she said, 'ok, send in your application'. We didn't think I would be selected.\"But then he won the contest and moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) and the rest, as they say, is history.For three decades - after debuting with Dil Bhi Tera, Hum Bhi Tere (The heart is yours and so am I) in 1960 - he ruled Bollywood, delivering several hits a year.Dharmendra first rose to fame with Bimal Roy's 1963 film Bandini, earning praise for his elegant portrayal of a prison doctor who falls for a convict.He soon became a romantic hero, pairing successfully with top actresses like Nutan, Meena Kumari, Mala Sinha, and Saira Banu.In 1966, he did his first action role in Phool Aur Patthar (Flower and rock), but it was the 1971 hit Mera Gaon Mera Desh (My village, my country) which cemented his reputation as an action hero.Tall and well-built, Dharmendra often did his own action scenes, involving daring stunts, even taking risks.Besides romance and action, the actor also delivered thrillers and comedies that were hits. Critics praised him \"for his impeccable comic timing\" in the hilarious 1975 film Chupke Chupke.DinodiaDharmendra with wife Bollywood actor Hema MaliniOver the years, Dharmendra said he was cast against 70 heroines, but his most successful screen pairing was with Hema Malini, who later became his second wife.The couple first met at a film premiere in 1965 and Hema Malini made an immediate impression on Dharmendra. In her 2017 biography, she wrote that she heard Dharmendra telling fellow actor Shashi Kapoor in Punjabi, \"Kudi badi changi hai (The girl is quite pretty)\".Their romance bloomed in the 1970s through superhit films like Seeta Aur Geeta, Raja Jani, and Sholay, making headlines as Dharmendra was already married with grown-up children with his first wife, Prakash Kaur.The media wrote about the resistance from Hema Malini's family to their wedding, but the couple finally tied the knot in 1980. Some reports said they had converted to Islam, which allows polygamy, to marry - a claim Dharmendra later denied.The actor-producer also dabbled in politics. He was the BJP MP from Bikaner in Rajasthan for one term from 2005 to 2009. But he was criticised for not taking politics seriously as he rarely attended parliament, preferring to spend time shooting for films or working on his farm.Speaking to a television programme, Aap Ki Adalat, years later, he agreed that he was a misfit in politics. \"Politics is not for emotional people, it's for the thick-skinned,\" he said. \"These five years were very tough for me, they were difficult.\"He worked almost to the end of his life, acting alongside his sons Sunny and Bobby Deol, judging reality shows, and connecting with fans via social media.AFP via Getty ImagesDharmendra with sons Sunny (right) and Bobby Deol (left) at his Mumbai residenceIn his lifetime, the actor gave many fine performances, but if there's one role that he'll always be remembered for, it'll be that of Veeru in Sholay - the 1975 blockbuster that has become a cultural phenomenon.The multi-starrer that also had Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini and Jaya Bachchan in the lead roles saw Dharmendra and Bachchan play loveable rogues-turned-saviours who are recruited to fight a dreaded bandit.The film became a cult classic and many fans credited Dharmendra for its success, describing him as the \"soul of Sholay\". The actor also described it as his finest role. \"I don't think I have ever done a better role than Veeru's,\" he said.The young girl who became Bollywood's pen-palBut despite delivering dozens of hits, Dharmendra never made it to the \"number one\" slot in Bollywood - losing to contemporaries such as Dilip Kumar, Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan - and was passed for the prestigious Filmfare awards several times.It was finally in 1997 that Filmfare honoured him with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to Hindi cinema and in 2012, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan - an Indian government honour given to civilians for distinguished service.But Dharmendra wore his stardom lightly, staying away from the rat race and said he never wanted to be number one in the industry.\"I never asked for too much money, and fame is transient. All I ever wanted was people's love,\" he told an interviewer.\"I came here just for this love. Everyone loves Dharmendra and I am grateful for that,\" he added.On Wednesday, news of his death prompted tributes from the film fraternity on social media.\"Growing up, Dharmendra was the hero every boy wanted to be,\" said actor Akshay Kumar. \"Thank you for inspiring generations. You'll live on through your films and the love you spread.\"Describing his passing as the \"end of an era\", director Karan Johar said it had left \"a gaping hole in the industry... a space that can never be filled by anyone... there will always be one and only Dharmendra\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editorReutersBusiness leaders face a nervous final few days before the chancellor's second Budget, having borne the brunt of a brutal set of tax hikes this time last year.Firms are still reeling from those: the £25bn National Insurance increase and an inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage.Confidence in boardrooms has grown increasingly fragile as the Budget nears. Almost all measures of sentiment among chief executives and finance bosses in the last six months have shown alarm bells ringing.So what can nervous business owners and leaders expect from Rachel Reeves?We are certain taxes will rise, and that takes money out of the economy. Research firm Capital Economics estimates the Budget will knock 0.2% off GDP in 2026 – a meaningful hit to an economy that only grew 0.1% in the third quarter of this year.However, as the chancellor pulls money out of the economy, the Bank of England is likely to push money back in by lowering interest rates, encouraging people and businesses to borrow and spend.And, as one senior government adviser told the BBC, that means a lot of the \"big things\" that affect business confidence, including inflation, are expected to fall next year. I would expect the chancellor to accentuate those positives.When it comes to business, the government will in part want to be judged on what it does not do in this Budget: no more nasty surprises, no blanket tax rises.The head of the CBI business group, Rain Newton-Smith, has said \"stability is the only road to growth\" and urged the government not to hit businesses with more taxes.Speaking to the CBI's annual conference, she said the government needed to make \"hard choices for growth now before they get harder, having the courage to take two tough decisions rather than 20 easier ones\".\"It means one or two broad tax rises, rather than death by a thousand taxes.\"PA MediaBudget ingredientsSo what might be in the mix?Business rates are a bug-bear. Many firms have seen their bills almost double, after a pandemic-era discount of 75% for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses was cut to 40% last year.The chancellor has previously promised reform. She could make the existing discounts permanent and remove cliff edges that see small businesses' rates bills shoot up when they expand. That could be partly paid for by increasing rates on the largest retail properties.Business Secretary Peter Kyle addressed the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference on Monday, and had a couple of business-friendly policies to announce.He pledged to lower electricity bills for 7,000 British businesses, and said the British Business Bank would focus its lending on the eight \"high potential\" sectors identified in the industrial strategy.He told the conference: \"Let's not kid ourselves — actual growth, real growth, comes from enterprise and wealth creation.\"We will build a pro-business, pro-wealth creation, pro-growth Britain. This week's budget will take the fair and necessary choices to embed that further.\"The chancellor is also likely to point to the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill, a piece of legislation that she has described as \"probably the biggest thing we will do this parliament\", as a way of removing barriers to growth.Bank profits are a tempting target and there have been mixed messages on whether she might hike taxes there. But ministers are concerned it does not fit the pro-growth, pro-investment narrative. It is possible that the Treasury will reduce payments to the Bank of England that cover their losses on the sales of government bonds that were bought to support the economy during the pandemic and financial crisis. That in turn reduces payments to commercial banks and would be seen by them as a bank tax in all but name.The oil and gas industry has lobbied hard for some respite on the \"windfall\" taxes on their profits, arguing that, with oil prices low, there is no windfall profit to tax. They say investment in the North Sea is shrivelling fast, with knock-on effects in refinery and chemical plant closures. Firms say relief could preserve jobs.The additional 38% tax, which is on top of a 40% tax rate specific to the industry, is due to expire in 2030. There is a chance it could be phased out earlier.Getty ImagesAmong bosses there is still concern over the government's flagship Employment Rights Bill, which promises sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal for new workers from day one. Rain Newton-Smith told the CBI conference that the government should \"change course\" on the bill and that businesses were not being listened to.There is no sign the government is backing off, but Kyle recently told a committee of MPs that there were 26 consultations to come on exactly how these measures will be implemented.The business secretary told the BBC's Today programme on Monday that any changes to the law would \"be implemented in a way that is benefiting business and benefiting the people who work in business\".\"We do not see this as zero-sum,\" he said.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the bill her speech to the CBI, saying it would allow new hires to lodge claims with an employment tribunal \"before they've even worked out where the toilets are\".She said this would make hiring \"riskier, slower and a lot more expensive\".The chancellor is also expected to speak in the Budget about consumers having the \"confidence to spend\".Some in the business community will interpret this as possibly heralding another higher-than-inflation rise in the national living wage, which also tends to push up other salaries in a firm's wage structure.One other policy that will hit both employers and employees is a cap on salary sacrifice schemes which allow workers to put some of their pre-tax earnings into their pension pots.Such schemes are widely used in larger companies and there is concern that cutting them will mean less generous workplace pensions in the years to come. Restoring faithWhat the government wants business to hear is that it is on their side, that it knows a lot was asked of them last time, and that this time they are being spared, even helped at the margin where possible.After months of anxious waiting business may then breathe a collective sigh of relief.According to a recent survey by Barclays, 55% of business leaders say they are delaying investment decisions until they have seen the Budget. But 43% say they expect to increase investment after it, a sign of possible pent-up optimism.But confidence is still very fragile. The chancellor will need to handle with care.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJonathan Beale, Anastasiia Levchenko and Volodymyr Lozhko in KyivReutersSome troops are resigned to the proposals but many remain defiant, and angryUkraine's frontline soldiers have reacted to draft US peace proposals with a mixture of defiance, anger and resignation.The BBC spoke to half a dozen who sent us their views via social media and email in response to the original US plan – details of which were leaked last week.Since then, American and Ukrainian negotiators have been working on changes to the proposals – and are set to continue talks about the \"peace framework\". Of the original US plan, Yaroslav, in eastern Ukraine, says it \"sucks… no one will support it\" while an army medic with the call sign Shtutser dismissed it as an \"absolutely disgraceful draft of a peace plan, unworthy of our attention\".But one soldier with the call sign Snake told us \"it's time to agree at least on something\".This is what the soldiers who spoke to the BBC had to say about some of the key points in the original US draft peace plan.Giving up territoryThe US put forward a draft peace proposal at a time when Russia is making significant advances on the battlefield. Over the past month alone Ukraine has lost a further 450 sq km to Russia. Kyiv still controls around 15% of the Donbas region, the eastern part of Ukraine encompassing the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts which is a key war goal for Russia. But the original US plan proposes that Ukraine give up the entire region - even parts it has successfully defended for nearly four years of full-scale war.\"Let them take it,\" Snake told the BBC. \"There's practically no one left in the cities and villages… We're not fighting for the people but for the land, while losing more people.\"Andrii, an officer in Ukraine's general staff, says that what is being proposed for Luhansk and Donetsk is \"painful and difficult\" but he suggests the country may have no other choice.Ukraine has been defending the region since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces seized parts of the Donbas. \"We may not want to give it up, but we won't be able to hold it by military force and resources,\" Andrii says.Eastern Ukraine has been the scene of the heaviest fighting in this war, and Ukraine has lost tens of thousands of troops defending it. Matros, who has been fighting since 2018, told us giving up the Donbas would \"nullify everything - all the efforts of the armed forces\". \"It will disregard the lives of fallen soldiers and civilians,\" he said.Cutting the size of Ukraine's armed forcesThe US draft peace plan envisages limiting the size of Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000. That is still significantly more than before the full-scale invasion when its full-time strength was around 250,000, but smaller than its current size. The most recent estimates suggest Ukraine's military strength is more than 800,000.Snake believes the country will need many of those currently in uniform to help rebuild Ukraine when the war ends. \"What's the point of having so many people in the army if there will be security guarantees?\" he asks.Andrii the staff officer agrees. \"If there are security guarantees, then of course there's no point in keeping such a large army,\" he says. \"People are tired and want to return to their families. There's no reason to keep them in a peacetime army after the war.\" He believes Ukraine's economy would be unable to sustain such large armed forces in peacetime.Getty ImagesIt is thought more than 800,000 Ukrainians are currently in uniformArmy medic Shtutser does not agree, saying that Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\" while Matros calls the proposal to reduce the size of the armed forces \"absurd and manipulative\".Security guaranteesUkraine's willingness to agree to the proposals will depend on its future security guarantees.The US draft plan rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato, but not of the European Union. There is a promise of US security guarantees if Russia were to attack again, though no further detail on the measure of that support. The draft also rules out the presence of Nato forces in Ukraine, if there is a deal.But Yevhen, a drone operator in eastern Ukraine, thinks the presence of foreign troops in the country is an important security guarantee. The UK and France have been leading efforts to provide a \"reassurance force\" in the event of a ceasefire, through a \"Coalition of the Willing\". \"I like the UK's plan to put troops into Ukraine [through this coalition],\" he says. \"This is the only plan that will help us win, to introduce allied troops.\"Getty ImagesThe UK is one of the countries which is planning to send forces to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefireBut staff officer Andrii does not believe Europe can provide much in the way of security guarantees. \"Europe has turned out to be completely spineless and divided,\" he says. \"It seems all hope rests only on the United States.\"However, other soldiers suggest there is no great faith in the US either. \"US security guarantees under its current government are not guarantees at all,\" says Schtutser.Fresh electionsThe US draft plan sets out a proposal for Ukraine to hold fresh elections within 100 days of the end of the war. Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting. Andrii has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"",

    "body": "17 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia business correspondent, Hokkaido, JapanGetty ImagesHokkaido is a tourism and agricultural region, but Rapidus is making chips there too  The island of Hokkaido has long been an agricultural powerhouse – now Japan is investing billions to turn it into a global hub for advanced semiconductors.More than half of Japan's dairy produce comes from Hokkaido, the northernmost of its main islands. In winter, it's a wonderland of ski resorts and ice-sculpture festivals; in summer, fields bloom with bands of lavender, poppies and sunflowers.These days, cranes are popping up across the island – building factories, research centres and universities focused on technology. It's part of Japan's boldest industrial push in a generation: an attempt to reboot the country's chip-making capabilities and reshape its economic future.Locals say that beyond the cattle and tourism, Hokkaido has long lacked other industries. There's even a saying that those who go there do so only to leave.But if the government succeeds in turning Hokkaido into Japan's answer to Silicon Valley - or \"Hokkaido Valley\", as some have begun to call it - the country could become a new contender in the $600bn (£458bn) race to supply the world's computer chips.An unlikely playerAt the heart of the plan is Rapidus, a little-known company backed by the government and some of Japan's biggest corporations including Toyota, Softbank and Sony.Born out of a partnership with IBM, it has raised billions of dollars to build Japan's first cutting-edge chip foundry in decades.The government has invested $12bn in the company, so that it can build a massive semiconductor factory or \"fab\" in the small city of Chitose.In selecting the Hokkaido location, Rapidus CEO Atsuyoshi Koike points to Chitose's water, electricity infrastructure and its natural beauty. Mr Koike oversaw the fab design, which will be completely covered in grass to harmonise with Hokkaido's landscape, he told the BBC.Local authorities have also flagged the region as being at lower risk of earthquakes compared to other potential sites in Japan.A key milestone for Rapidus came with the delivery of an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) system from the Dutch company ASML.The high-tech machinery helped bring about Rapidus' biggest accomplishment yet earlier this year – the successful production of prototype two nanometre (2nm) transistors.These ultra-thin chips are at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology and allow devices to run faster and more efficiently.It's a feat only rival chip makers TSMC and Samsung have accomplished. Intel is not pursuing 2nm, it is leapfrogging from 7nm straight to 1.8nm.\"We succeeded in manufacturing the 2nm prototype for the first time in Japan, and at an unprecedented speed in Japan and globally,\" Mr Koike said.He credits the IBM partnership for helping achieve the breakthrough.Tie-ups with global companies are essential to acquiring the technology needed for this level of chips, he added.The scepticsRapidus is confident that it is on track to mass produce 2nm chips by 2027. The challenge will be achieving the yield and quality that is needed to survive in an incredibly competitive market – the very areas where Taiwan and South Korea have pulled ahead.TSMC for example has achieved incredible success in mass production, but making high-end chips is costly and technically demanding.In a 2024 report, the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office highlighted that although Rapidus is receiving government subsidies and consortium members are contributing funds: \"The financing falls short of the expected 5 trillion yen ($31.8bn; £24.4bn) needed to start mass production.\"The Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) has previously said: \"Rapidus has no experience in manufacturing advanced chips, and to date there is no indication that it will be able to access actual know-how for such an endeavour from companies with the requisite experience (ie TSMC and Samsung).\"Finding customers may also be a challenge – Samsung and TSMC have established relationships with global companies that have been buying their chips for years.The lost decadesNevertheless, Japan's government is pouring money into the chip industry - $27bn between 2020 and early 2024 - a larger commitment relative to its gross domestic product (GDP) than the US made through the Biden-era CHIPS Act.In late 2024, Tokyo unveiled a $65bn package for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductors that could further support Rapidus's expansion plans.This comes after decades of decline. Forty years ago Japan made more than half of the world's semiconductors. Today, it produces just over 10%.Many point to US-Japan trade tensions in the 1980s as a turning point.Naoyuki Yoshino, professor emeritus at Keio University, said Japan lost out in the technology stakes to Taiwan and South Korea in the 1980s, leaving domestic companies weaker.Unlike its rivals, Japan failed to sustain subsidies to keep its chipmakers competitive.But Mr Koike says that mentality has changed.\"The [national] government and local government are united in supporting our industry to revive once again.\"Getty ImagesRapidus has already achieved a production prototype of a 2nm chipJapan's broader economic challenges also loom large. Its population is shrinking while the number of elderly citizens continues to surge. That has determined the national budget for years and has contributed to slowing growth.More than a third of its budget now goes to social welfare for the elderly, and that squeezes the money available for research, education and technology, Prof Yoshino says.Japan also faces a severe shortage of semiconductor engineers – an estimated 40,000 people in the coming years.Rapidus is partnering with Hokkaido University and others to train new workers, but agrees it will have to rely heavily on foreigners, at a time when public support for workers coming into the country for employment is low.Growing an ecosystemThe government's push is already attracting major global players.TSMC is producing 12–28nm chips in Kumamoto, on the south-western island of Kyushu - a significant step for Japan, even if it lags behind the company's cutting-edge production in Taiwan. The expansion has transformed the local economy, attracting suppliers, raising wages, and leading to infrastructure and service developments. Japan's broader chip revival strategy appears to be following a playbook: establish a \"fab\", and an entire ecosystem will tend to follow. TSMC started building a second plant on Kyushu in October this year, which is due to begin production by the end of 2027. Beyond Rapidus and TSMC, local players like Kioxia and Toshiba are also getting government backing.Kioxia has expanded fabs in Yokkaichi and Kitakami with state funds and Toshiba has built one in Ishikawa. Meanwhile, ROHM has been officially designated as a company that provides critical products under Tokyo's economic security framework.American memory chipmaker Micron will also receive $3.63bn in subsidies from the Japanese government to grow facilities in Hiroshima, while Samsung is building a research and development facility in Yokohama.Hokkaido is seeing similar momentum. Chipmaking equipment companies ASML and Tokyo Electron have both opened offices in Chitose, off the back of Rapidus building a production facility there.\"This will make a form of 'global ecosystem',\" Mr Koike says, \"where we work together to be able to produce semiconductors that contribute to the world.\"Getty ImagesThe CEO of Rapidus says the firm's edge is bespoke chips that can be delivered quicklyMr Koike said Rapidus's key selling point would be - as its name suggests - an ability to produce custom chips faster than competitors, rather than competing directly with other players.\"TSMC leads the world, with Intel and Samsung close behind. Our edge is speed - we can produce and deliver chips three to four times faster than anyone else. That speed is what gives us an edge in the global semiconductor race,\" Mr Koike said.Big betGlobal demand for chips is surging with the rise of AI, while Japan's automakers -  still recovering from pandemic-era supply shocks - are pressing for more reliable, domestically or regionally sourced production across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished chips.Securing control over chip manufacturing is being seen as a national security priority, both in Japan and elsewhere, as recent trade frictions and geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan raise concerns around the risks of relying on foreign suppliers.\"We'd like to provide products from Japan once again – products that are powerful and with great new value,\" Mr Koike said.For Japan's government, investing in Rapidus is a high-stakes gamble to revive its semiconductor industry and more broadly its tech power.And some analysts say it may be the country's best chance to build a domestic ecosystem to supply advanced chips to its many manufacturers, and one day become a formidable challenger in the global market.Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar",

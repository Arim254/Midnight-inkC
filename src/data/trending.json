    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England head coach Thomas Tuchel caused a stir by leaving Jude Bellingham out of his last squadByChief football writer in RigaEngland confirmed qualification for next summer's World Cup with victory over Latvia in Riga on Tuesday, enabling head coach Thomas Tuchel to start finalising his plans as the countdown to the tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States continues.Competition for places will be intense, with disappointment inevitable for some of those who have played a part in England's smooth qualifying campaign.The jockeying for positions will continue over the next months - so who are those players with something to prove to Tuchel as he considers England's squad to take to the World Cup?Jude BellinghamIt is inconceivable that Jude Bellingham will not be part of England's squad at the World Cup but does the Real Madrid star, who is arguably the biggest global name available to Thomas Tuchel, still have something to prove to the head coach?The recent evidence on and off the pitch suggests he does.It all stems from Bellingham being left out of England's latest squad despite telling Tuchel he wanted to be included, to the constant narrative of team spirit and the excellence of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers in the number 10 role.England's next squad for what are effectively dead rubbers against Serbia and Albania will now have one main point of interest, namely whether Bellingham is included.If he is, Bellingham will return to duty having been made acutely aware by Tuchel that there is no star system, no special cases, no automatic route back into England's team.And it will also come after it has been made crystal clear that Tuchel's England world does not revolved around Bellingham and how best to utilise his undoubted talent.Bellingham is not exactly starting again with England - the odds will still be on him being in the line-up their first game in next summer's World Cup - but he has to prove to Tuchel that he can be part of the team spirit the German cherishes, and that he deserves his place back in the side.The England star famously mouthed \"who else?\" when scoring a spectacular stoppage-time overhead kick when England beat Slovakia in the last 16 at Euro 2024, but he now knows there are others Tuchel is willing to consider.Cole PalmerCole Palmer's England career has, so far, been a mixed bag ranging from the moment of brilliance that gave England hope with the equaliser against Spain in what was eventually a losing cause in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin, to other occasions when he has left even supporters of his superb talent wanting more.Palmer's current problem is a lingering groin injury. Further down the line it will be the Chelsea star performing in consistently eye-catching fashion that might persuade Tuchel to find a place for the 23-year-old in what is already a crowded area.Tuchel is unlikely to start fitting square pegs in round holes so close to a major tournament - therefore Palmer, who has only played 64 minutes under the German, has work to do.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cole Palmer celebrates scoring for England in the Euro 2024 final against Spain in BerlinHe is unlikely to get in as the 10, with Rogers currently in possession and Bellingham waiting in the wings.It is hard to see a place on the flanks, where he is less effective, with Anthony Gordon and Marcus Rashford contenders on the left and Arsenal pair Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke fighting for a place on the right.This effectively means Palmer will have to produce a spectacular run of form to force his way back into Tuchel's thinking.Phil FodenManchester City's brilliant 25-year-old was, along with Bellingham, a stand-out exclusion from Tuchel's squad for the friendly against Wales and the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga.Foden, who has won two caps under Tuchel, has been rebuilding form and confidence with an excellent start to the season after a poor campaign last term.And he will do all this with his sights set on the World Cup.He was a permanent fixture in Sir Gareth Southgate's plans up to Euro 2024, but getting Foden and Bellingham in the same team was often a struggle and never felt like a neat fit at the time, with the former often out on the left rather than his preferred central role.No-one, least of all Tuchel, can ignore Foden's talent but he must continue to impress to reclaim what was once an automatic place in England's squad.Like Palmer, Foden operates in what is now a congested place under Tuchel, whether it is in the centre or pushed out wide.Never rule a player of Foden's quality out, but he has a fight on his hands to make England's World Cup squad.Trent Alexander-ArnoldThis ship may have already sailed.Trent Alexander-Arnold's World Cup hopes were already in deep trouble even before he sustained the hamstring injury that has interrupted the start to his Real Madrid career.If Alexander-Arnold has been looking for signs of a bright England future under Tuchel, then not many of them are promising.He played former Liverpool team-mate Curtis Jones, a midfield player, ahead of him at right-back in the 1-0 win away to Andorra then dropped Alexander-Arnold completely for the return World Cup qualifiers with Andorra and visit to Serbia.This came after Tuchel appeared to publicly cast doubt on Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities when he spoke about his influence at Liverpool, saying: \"If he wants to have this impact in the English national team, then he has to take the defensive part very, very seriously.\"Tuchel is also a big admirer of another right-back, Reece James, who played under him at Chelsea, although he has had injury problems of his own.Alexander-Arnold may have to make other plans for the summer unless his form for Real can force a change of heart from Tuchel.Jack GrealishJack Grealish has been a player and personality reborn since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City, but Tuchel saw fit to ignore the clamour for an England recall when he selected his latest squad.Tuchel is a confirmed Grealish fan but, at present, it is hard to see where the midfielder would fit into England's plans, and who would make way to accommodate him.Grealish can join names like Palmer and Foden, who both face a fight to win places either as the 10 or on the flank.This is not to denigrate Grealish's form, which has already made him a hero with Everton's fans, but a brutal reality.Tuchel may also want to see Grealish produce consistently over 20 Premier League games rather than the seven so far. This is the task facing the popular 30-year-old if he is to put himself back in World Cup contention.Adam WhartonAdam Wharton has been outstanding for Crystal Palace for a long time now, running games against elite opponents, especially Manchester City when the Eagles won the FA Cup at Wembley last season, and in the win against Premier League champions Liverpool recently.Wharton's loping, languid style may sometimes disguise a classy, fiercely competitive midfielder, but his England breakthrough has not arrived, despite going to Germany as part of Southgate's Euro 2024 squad.He is yet to get his first minutes under Tuchel and was another surprise omission.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Adam Wharton during his only England appearance - 28 minutes as a substitute against Bosnia & Herzegovina in June 2024 under Sir Gareth SouthgateWharton's only England cap came under Southgate against Bosnia & Herzegovina in June 2024, when he made a 28-minute appearance as a substitute.Like others, he is still waiting for his chance to make his mark as Nottingham Forest's Elliott Anderson has taken the opportunity handed to him by Tuchel with excellent performances, looking right at home on the international stage.Tuchel has made all the right noises, even down to contacting Wharton to re-assure him he is in his thoughts.Wharton, however, has still not made Tuchel's squad so he is another who must continue to press his case to finally get some action under England's head coach.Marcus RashfordBarcelona is the latest stop on Marcus Rashford's road to redemption after being exiled by Manchester United - but he still has a way to travel to re-establish himself as a permanent fixture in England's squad.If the 27-year-old needed any reminding that he still has to prove himself to be fixed firmly in Tuchel's World Cup plans, he only needed to listen to the head coach's words before the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga.Tuchel said: \"It's not a question of talent. It's a question of whether he can prove the point at club and international level.\"It never has been a question of Rashford's talent, it is the times when he has lost his way after producing stunning performances in spells that raise doubts.He has to produce consistency at Barcelona then, as Tuchel suggests, \"prove the point\" with England as well.Rashford knows Tuchel has faith in his ability - he is selecting him for starters - but the warning is clear. He cannot afford to slip, or fail to prove his point, otherwise others are ready and waiting to take his place.Myles Lewis-SkellyWhen Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly scored the first goal of the Tuchel era against Albania in March, becoming the youngest player to score on his senior England debut, aged 18 years and 176 days, he not only looked like a superstar in the making but the answer to the problem left-back position.He may well still be, starting England's victory in Latvia, but has a potentially major problem ahead that Tuchel has already made reference to.And it is a problem that comes in the imposing shape of Riccardo Calafiori.England apart, Lewis-Skelly has been ousted from Arsenal's left-back slot by the Italian this season, starting only two games for the Gunners and playing only 263 minutes.This is not a question of Lewis-Skelly's quality - that is there for all to see. This is a question of how much football he will play.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly scored the first goal of the Thomas Tuchel era when he made his debut against Albania in March.It is a subject that has already been exercising Tuchel's mind, even though he played Lewis-Skelly in Riga.It is clear that unless he can find his way back into Arsenal's starting line-up, Tuchel may face a difficult choice with the gifted youngster, saying: \"Maybe it becomes a problem for him, yeah.\"Being a good team-mate in camp may not be good enough to stay the whole year with us. You have to perform at club level on a regular basis.\"Lewis-Skelly's task is clear. He may yet claim the left-back berth if Tuchel is unable to find a better alternative but he cannot rely on past credit. He has to find a way into Arsenal's starting line-up.Jordan HendersonJordan Henderson has a huge admirer in Tuchel. He was an instant inclusion for his first squad in March, winning a recall after being absent from England duty since November 2023.It was a pick that raised eyebrows but Tuchel was unmoved, continuing to keep faith with Brentford's veteran midfielder, even to the exclusion of Palace's Wharton, saying: \"He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"No-one could ever question the desire and attitude of one of the game's most consummate professionals, but Henderson will be 36 during next summer's World Cup, which will be played in gruelling conditions in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Tuchel has praised Henderson's influence around camp, and his impact can already be seen at Brentford, but he will need to be seen as someone who will figure on the pitch as well. There is no room for non-playing figureheads at a major tournament.Plenty question Tuchel's wisdom on this decision. It remains to be seen how much longer he will include Henderson, so the former Liverpool captain must produce high-class performances with Brentford consistently to stop eyebrows being raised further.Morgan Gibbs-WhiteMorgan Gibbs-White is a real talent and the Nottingham Forest player has won four caps under Tuchel, who is clearly an admirer of his quality.The problem for Gibbs-White may come with competition for places in the areas he likes, especially with Bellingham, Palmer and Foden not currently in England's squad and Aston Villa's Rogers producing excellence.This is no slight on Gibbs-White, who has been outstanding at Forest. Tottenham Hotspur thought they had signed him in a £60m deal during the transfer window but were left desperately disappointed when Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis persuaded him to stay by offering an improved contract.It is simply that, when the final numbers take shape, Gibbs-White could be in an area where there are just too many names to fit into a limited pot.Gibbs-White has the ability to be in that shake-up, although he may hope for some stability at the City Ground, where new manager Ange Postecoglou is already under pressure after the sacking of Nuno Espirito Santo, who got Forest into Europe and also got the best out of the 25-year-old.Who else must make a good impression?The understudy to England captain Harry Kane is always a thorny issue with options seemingly limited beyond Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.Spurs striker Dominic Solanke and Chelsea's Liam Delap will want to be in Thomas Tuchel's thoughts but both are currently troubled by injuries.Arsenal's Eberechi Eze operates in an area of the pitch where England competition is red-hot, but he offers variety and versatility, so that may well bolster his claims when the time comes for Tuchel to name his squad.The same may just apply to Newcastle United's Dan Burn with limited choices in central defence and left-back, but he will need to maintain good form and there are still questions about his quality at international level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, James Trafford hoped to be Manchester City's first choice keeper when he moved from Burnley - but was then replaced by Gianluigi DonnarummaEverton's Jordan Pickford is unchallenged as goalkeeper with Crystal Palace's Dean Henderson as his understudy - but what does the England future hold for James Trafford?He is currently third choice but had hoped to challenge Pickford for top spot after he moved from Burnley to Manchester City.This plan unravelled somewhat when City bought world-class Italian Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris St-Germain, Trafford losing his place immediately.City manager Pep Guardiola has insisted Trafford will get game time - but will it be enough to make Tuchel feel comfortable about his match sharpness?Arsenal's Declan Rice believes England have the all-round quality to cope with any squad issues, saying: \"I think every time you play for England you want to grab the shirt, you want to grab your chance. We do miss Jude for sure, we miss Phil, we miss Cole, we miss loads of players that have not been turning up for reasons the manager has said. \"We are an unreal team when they are in the team as well. What they have done for England in an England shirt is nothing short of incredible. We are looking forward to having them next camp hopefully, as a team we want to keep integrating as many people as possible before the World Cup.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondent andKathryn ArmstrongFar-right activist Tommy Robinson was unlawfully stopped driving a Bentley at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel, and counter-terrorism officers made a disproportionate use of their powers, his lawyer has told a court.The 42-year-old, who was charged under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon is standing trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court for refusing to give the Pin for his mobile phone to officers during the stop. He has pleaded not guilty.Prosecutor Jo Morris said that while the stop may not have been \"perfect\", that does not mean it was unlawful. Judgement in the trial has been delayed until 4 November following closing arguments.If found guilty, Mr Lennon could be jailed for up to three months and/or receive a £2,500 fine.He was stopped by police on 28 July, 2024, using their counter-terrorism powers as he prepared to enter the Channel Tunnel while driving a silver Bentley Bentayga.Officers from Kent Police said they did so partly because he was driving someone else's car and had not pre-booked his ticket. They said they became more suspicious when Mr Lennon would not make eye contact with them and said he was driving all the way to Benidorm. When asked for the Pin to his phone he refused.A person who is detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act is legally obliged to provide the password or Pin for electronic devices.In his closing submissions to the judge on Tuesday, Mr Lennon's barrister, Alisdair Williamson KC, said: \"The question for you. Is this a lawful stop? If it is not, you cannot convict Mr Lennon.\"Mr Williamson described the power that police officers have at ports and airport as \"extraordinary\" and said there needed to be \"assiduous oversight\" of this power, which he described as the only one there was to \"compel people under pain of criminal penalty to answer questions\". He described Mr Lennon as a \"public figure\" whose views are \"well known\" and asked what the justification was for the police's use of \"coercive powers\". \"What were they going to find out that wasn't in the public domain?\" Mr Williamson asked. He pointed out that the officers did not ask any further questions about the Bentley after Mr Lennon told them it belonged to \"a mate\" and said his client travelled to Benidorm regularly. In her closing speech, prosecutor Jo Morris said \"we accept that the stop may not have been a perfect one but that does not make it unlawful\". She said \"there was no real dispute over the facts\" and that Mr Lennon had been warned of the consequences and was offered legal advice but still refused to give officers his Pin. Before the hearing began on Monday, Mr Lennon - the former leader of the English Defence League (EDL) - said on X that the social media platform's billionaire owner, Elon Musk - who has previously championed him - had \"picked up the legal bill\" for the case against him, which Mr Lennon described as \"state persecution\". Mr Musk has not publicly confirmed this.",

    "body": "2 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsJessica SmithWhen Jess Smith uploaded a photo of herself into an AI image generator this summer, she wasn't expecting a social experiment.The former Australian Paralympic swimmer wanted to vamp up her headshot and uploaded a full-length photo of her and prompted it really specifically that she was missing her left arm from below the elbow.But ChatGPT couldn't create the image she was asking for and despite various prompts, the results were largely the same - a woman with two arms or one with a metal device to represent a prosthetic. She asked the AI why it was so hard to create the image and it said it was because it didn't have enough data to work with. \"That was an important realisation for me that of course AI is a reflection of the world we live in today and the level of inequality and discrimination that exists,\" she says.Smith recently tried to generate the image again on ChatGPT and was amazed to find it could now produce an accurate picture of a woman with one arm, just like her. \"Oh my goodness, it worked, it's amazing it's finally been updated,\" she tells the BBC. \"This is a great step forward.\" Jessica SmithJess Smith found that ChatGPT was able to generate this image of her recently It might not sound like a big deal, but for millions of people with disabilities, this shift matters.\"Representation in technology means being seen not as an afterthought, but as part of the world that's being built,\" Jess says.\"AI is evolving, and when it evolves with inclusion at its core, we all benefit. This is more than progress in tech it's progress in humanity.\"A spokesperson for OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT,  said it had recently \"made meaningful improvements\" to its image generation model. They added: \"We know challenges remain, particularly around fair representation, and we're actively working to improve this - including refining our post-training methods and adding more diverse examples to help reduce bias over time.\" Naomi BowmanAI edited Naomi's eye even though she didn't request for this to be doneWhile Smith’s disability is now reflected with AI, Naomi Bowman, who only has sight in one eye, is still experiencing a similar problem. She asked ChatGPT to blur the background of a picture but instead it \"changed my face completely and evened out my eyes\". \"Even when I specifically explained that I had an eye condition and to leave my face alone; it couldn't compute,\" she says. Naomi initially found it funny but says \"it now makes me sad as it shows the inherent bias within AI\". She is calling for AI models to be \"trained and tested in rigorous ways to reduce AI bias and to ensure the data sets are broad enough so that everyone is represented and treated fairly\".Some concerned about AI‘s environmental impact have criticised the creation of images on ChatGPT.  Professor Gina Neff of Queen Mary University London told the BBC that ChatGPT is \"burning through energy\", and the data centres used to power it consume more electricity in a year than 117 countries.Awkward conversationsExperts say bias in artificial intelligence often reflects the same blind spots that exist in wider society and it's not just disabilities that are unrepresented. Abran Maldonado, chief execuive of Create Labs, a US-based company that builds culturally aware AI system, says diversity in AI starts with who's involved in training and labelling the data.\"It's about who's in the room when the data is being built,\" he explains. \"You need cultural representation at the creation stage.\"Not everything is represented on the internet correctly and Maldonado adds that if you don't consult the people with lived experiences then AI will miss them. One well known example was a 2019 US government study which found that facial recognition algorithms were far less accurate at identifying African-American and Asian faces compared to Caucasian faces.Despite living with one arm, Jess doesn't see herself as disabled, saying the barriers she faces are societal. \"If I use a public toilet and the tap has to be held down, that impacts my ability, not because I can't do it, but because the designer hasn't thought about me.\"She believes there is a risk of the same oversight happening in the world of AI,  systems and spaces built without considering everyone.When Jess shared her original experience on LinkedIn, someone messaged her to say his AI app would create an image of a woman with one arm. \"I tried to create it and the same thing happened, I couldn't generate the image,\" she says. She told the person, but they never replied to her and she says that's typical of conversations around disability. \"The conversation is too awkward and uncomfortable so people back away.\" ",

    "body": "4 hours agoIone WellsSouth America Correspondent andNadine YousifThe US has struck another vessel off the coast of Venezuela on Tuesday, killing six people, President Donald Trump has said. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the vessel belonged to \"narcoterrorists\" and that it was \"trafficking narcotics\". This is the fifth strike of its kind by the Trump administration on a boat accused of trafficking drugs on international waters since September. In total, 27 people have been reported killed, but the US has not provided evidence or details about identities of the vessels or those on board them.Some lawyers have accused the US of breaching international law, and neighbouring nations like Colombia and Venezuela have condemned the strikes.In his Truth Social post, Trump said \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known\" route for smuggling. He also posted an aerial surveillance video showing a small boat on water that is struck by a missile and explodes.US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': What do we know, and was it legal?What is Trump's goal as US bombs 'Venezuela drugs boat'?Trump did not specify the nationality of those on board, or what drug smuggling organisation they are suspected of belonging to. He added that no US military personnel were injured. The strike comes after a recent leaked memo sent to Congress, and reported on by US media, that said the administration determined the US was in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. It has also deployed multiple warships to the Caribbean. The US has positioned its strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels as self-defence. Many lawyers questioning the legality of such military action.Framing this as an active armed conflict is likely a way for Trump to justify using more extreme wartime powers – for example killing \"enemy fighters\" even if they have not posed a violent threat, or detaining people indefinitely.While it is true that some drug trafficking occurs in Venezuela, and some cartels operate in the region that some of these vessels allegedly have originated from, it is not considered a hotspot for drug trafficking compared to some other locations in the region.As a result, many believe this is part of a wider political campaign to put military pressure on Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro.The strikes come after the US announced a $50m (£37m) reward for any information leading to the arrest of Maduro - whose election to lead the country has been widely rejected by the international community - on drug-trafficking charges.Venezuela's government has reacted to previous recent strikes with anger. Maduro denies American accusations that he is involved with drugs trafficking, while another official has questioned the veracity of footage posted by Trump.",

She died three days later.Opening the case for the prosecution, Michelle Heeley KC told the jury the defendant was \"clearly excited about what he had done\". Mr Majek denies murder.CCTV shown to the jury on Tuesday showed Mr Majek staring at Ms Whyte in the hotel, following her to the station, running from the scene and throwing her phone into the river, the court heard.Family / British Transport PoliceRhiannon Whyte's blood was found on Deng Majek's clothes, the court heardMs Heeley told the court Ms Whyte's blood was found on the defendant's clothes, while her DNA was discovered under his fingernails.She said Mr Majek was seen on CCTV at the Park Inn Hotel in Walsall, laughing shortly after killing her. The defendant had been living at the hotel, which houses asylum seekers, while Ms Whyte had worked there for about three months.The court heard her job included cleaning and serving food and co-workers could not recall any issue which might have led to the attack.\"There had been an issue about some broken biscuits with some of the residents but nothing serious,\" Ms Heeley said.CPSThe jury was shown CCTV footage on TuesdayIn a statement released following her death, Rhiannon Whyte's family described her as \"selfless... brave, quirky, funny\" and always there for other people. The prosecution said CCTV showed the defendant staring at Ms Whyte, before he followed her from the hotel to the railway station when she finished her shift at 23:00 BST. \"He had been hanging around waiting for her to leave and waited until she was on her own before he followed her,\" Ms Heeley said.The court was told Ms Whyte called a friend at 23:04 and he was seen on CCTV cameras closing the gap on her as she approached the deserted platform.Ms Heeley said: \"It was then that the prosecution say that this defendant attacked her.\"Her friend heard a scream and then another scream, before the phone went dead at 23:19.The prosecution said Mr Majek could then be seen running back up the stairs with an object in his hand, which they said was Ms Whyte's mobile phone.Ms Heeley said he then went to a local shop to buy himself a drink before returning to the hotel.Slumped on platformShe added: \"In between the station and the hotel he had thrown Rhiannon's phone into a river. \"Once at the hotel he was seen dancing and laughing, clearly excited about what he had done.\"The train she had been due to catch pulled in at 23:24 and the driver saw a figure slumped on the platform, the court was told.Ms Heeley said the guard tried to help her, along with another employee from the hotel, but nothing could be done to save her and she died on 23 October, having never regained consciousness.The court was told 11 of the 23 stab wounds penetrated her skull, one of which damaged the brain stem, causing her death. She also had injuries to her chest and arm, indicating she had tried to defend herself, the court heard. The puncture wounds had the appearance of a cross-headed screwdriver, which has never been found. Ms Heeley said: \"He left her bleeding to death and then casually went back to his hotel. We say you can be sure he is guilty of murder.\"The trial is expected to last about three weeks.  Police were at the station following the incident Related internet links",

    "body": "28 minutes agoThe \"shattered remains\" of Khan Younis have been pictured on the front page of the Guardian, which writes that the \"fragile ceasefire\" in Gaza has already been tested. The paper reports four dead hostages have been returned to Israel, but says Hamas has previously claimed it may take longer to return the rest of the bodies as \"not all burial sites have been identified\". Israel has said aid into Gaza will be cut by half and a key border crossing will remain closed, the paper adds.The UK state pension is set to climb 4.8%, the i Paper reports, with pensioners now set to receive £12,547.60 annually. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that UK inflation will remain \"higher than any other large rich country\", the paper notes. But it adds the IMF's \"modest\" growth rate forecast will offer a \"slight boost\" to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her Budget next month.The Express offers a different interpretation on the IMF's forecasting, declaring it a \"bleak verdict\" on the UK economy and \"fresh humiliation\" for the chancellor.The Daily Mail zeros in on official figures which it says show unemployment in the UK is at a four-year high, and wage growth has slowed.  It also refers to the IMF predictions, and says the \"darkening outlook\" has prompted a Bank of England official to warn of a \"growing risk of recession\".The Telegraph leads with the Home Secretary's upcoming speech at a summit with Balkan interior ministers, where she is expected to warn that a failure to control UK migration is \"eroding trust\" in politicians. According to the paper, Shabana Mahmood will tell leaders that \"international co-operation\" is the only way to secure borders. \"Hamas kills its enemies on ceasefire Gaza streets\" reads the headline of the Times, detailing the alleged executions in Gaza of \"suspected collaborators\" following the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The front page also features a photograph of the Princess of Wales beaming as she bakes at Long Meadow Farm, captioned \"On a roll\".The Financial Times leads with comments from US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, after he told the paper that China is \"trying to hurt the world's economy\" following the introduction of export controls on rare earths and critical minerals. A member of Madagascar's military is also pictured, amid reports that the army has seized power in the African nation and President Andry Rajoelina has fled.\"Illegal migrant madness\" says the Sun, alleging that art classes and puzzle rooms in immigrant removal centres are funded by the taxpayer. The Home Office has said they are reviewing the provision of activities in immigration centres to \"ensure they deliver value for taxpayers\".The Mirror leads with comments from former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who told the Covid inquiry that the 2021 phased return to school was \"destined to fail\" and \"damaging for children and parents\".\"Gavin and numpty\" reads the headline of the Star, reporting that Williamson also told the inquiry that the decision to shut schools during the pandemic was made in just 24 hours.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoAna Faguy andMark SavageMusic correspondentFrans Schellekens/RedfernsAward-winning R&B and soul singer D’Angelo has died aged 51 after a cancer diagnosis, his family has said. In a statement, they wrote that the star, whose real name was Michael Eugene Archer, left behind a \"legacy of extraordinarily moving music\" and asked fans to celebrate “the gift of song that he has left for the world”.The influential singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz. His three albums won D'Angelo four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D'Angelo appeared to be performing naked.\"The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,\" his family said in a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC’s US media partner. Tributes have flooded in, with rappers Doja Cat and Missy Elliot, as well as singers Jill Scott and Jennifer Hudson paying their respects.\"A true voice of soul and inspiration to many brilliant artists of our generation and generations to come,\" Doja Cat wrote on X. Jennifer Hudson said \"we lost a true original today\".\"D'Angelo, your voice will live on forever. Rest well, King!!!\"Tyler the Creator said his \"musical DNA\" was shaped by D'Angelo - \"We are so lucky to have been alive to enjoy his art,\" he wrote.ReutersThe award-winning singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazzD’Angelo began his career as a songwriter, and worked alongside big names in music like Lauryn Hill and The Roots. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar. His song, Lady, from that album reached the number 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 1996. That song earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot on the music scene.The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano when he was just three years old.Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.).When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI.He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo.However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died in a car crash in 2005. He returned to music in 2014 with Black Messiah - an album in the works for years - which he finished after watching the national unrest prompted by protests over the failure to convict police officers in the deaths of the unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner.Getty ImagesD'Angelo's song Lady earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot in the music sceneIt went on to win the Grammy for best R&B album in February 2016.Among those paying tribute was hip-hop legend DJ Premier, who produced D'Angelo's song Devil's Pie.\"Such a sad loss,\" he wrote on social media. \"We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING.\"The Voodoo album which was released in 2000 topped the US charts and in its most recent list of the greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at 28 – one place above The Beatles' White Album.D'Angelo had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq.",

    "body": "Some migrants coming to the UK will need to speak English to an A-level standard under tougher new rules set to be introduced by the government.The changes, which will come into force from 8 January 2026, will affect some graduates and those applying for skilled worker or scale-up visas, which are for people employed by fast-growing businesses.The new rules  form part of wider plans to cut levels of immigration to the UK outlined in a white paper in May.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"If you come to this country, you must learn our language and play your part.\"\"This country has always welcomed those who come to this country and contribute,\" Mahmood said. \"But it is unacceptable for migrants to come here without learning our language, unable to contribute to our national life.\"Applicants will be tested in person on their speaking, listening, reading and writing at Home Office-approved providers, with their results checked as part of the visa process.Those applying for skilled worker, scale-up and high potential individual (HPI) visas will be required to reach B2 level - a step up from the current B1 standard which is equivalent to GCSE.To come to the UK on the skilled worker visa, migrants have to work for a government-approved employer and earn at least £41,700 a year, or the \"going rate\" for their type of work, whichever is highest.The scale-up visa is open to migrants coming to work for a fast-growing UK business. Migrants can apply for a high potential individual visa if they have been awarded a qualification from a top global university within the last five years.According to the British Council, which offers English language courses, learners who achieve B2 level can \"understand the main ideas of complex texts on concrete or abstract topics.\"They can express themselves \"fluently and spontaneously\" and communicate comfortably with other English speakers. They can also produce \"clear, detailed text on many subjects and explain a complex viewpoint\".Further English language requirements for other visa routes and family dependants are expected to be introduced in due course, Home Office Minister Mike Tapp told Parliament on Tuesday.The prime minister previously said the changes outlined in the white paper would make the UK's immigration system \"controlled, selective and fair\".Home Office estimates suggest the measures could reduce the number of people coming to the UK by up to 100,000 per year.Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - fell to 431,000 in 2024, down almost 50% on the total in 2023, when it reached a record high of 906,000. Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the government faced a \"trade-off\" between \"ensuring migrants speak good English and enabling employers to recruit workers who are expected to bring economic benefits.\"Many graduate jobs already require language skills above A-level standard, she said.The new language requirements will have \"more impact in middle-skilled jobs involving technical and manual skills, where employers sometimes do not require high language proficiency\".Immigration lawyer Afsana Akhtar told BBC News she thought it was \"unfair\" that migrants had to reach such a high standard of English \"because even many people in the UK probably wouldn't be able to pass English A-level\". \"This would rule out even skilled workers who want to come and contribute to our British economy,\" she said. \"The GCSE standard is sufficient - and then when they come live here, [and] integrate into England and the English way of life, their English will improve inevitably.\"Other measures in the white paper include cutting the time period international students can stay in the UK to find a graduate job after their course ends from two years to 18 months, which will take effect from January 2027.Students will also have to meet higher financial requirements, raised to £1,171 per month outside London (from £1,136) for up to nine months.The Global Talent visa, for high achievers in technology, arts and academia fields has also been expanded to include winners of more prestigious prizes. Further plans in the White Paper include, the immigration skills charge for UK employers to pay when sponsoring foreign workers on specific visas has also been  increased to £480 per person per year for small organisations or charities, and to £1,320 for medium and large organisations.This is raised from £364 and £1,000 respectively.As part of the government's efforts to attract highly skilled people to the country, the HPI route will be expanded. The number of migrants on the visa is expected to double from 2,000 to 4,000, but there will be a cap of 8,000 applications each year.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporter Former House of Lords Speaker Baroness D'Souza faces an eight-week suspension after complaining to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner about \"unfair\" speeding fines.A Lords inquiry found the 81-year-old peer broke rules on \"personal honour\" by writing to Sir Mark Rowley on Lords headed notepaper to query multiple breaches of the 20mph limit adding up to £400 in fines.Baroness D'Souza said she only wanted to \"open a conversation\" on London speed limits, but later called the letter to Sir Mark \"unwise\" and said she regretted sending it.The Lords Standards Commissioner ruled the letter was \"an attempt to influence\" the police investigation.In his report, Commissioner for Standards Martin Jelley said Baroness D'Souza's actions \"may harm the House by eroding public trust in parliamentarians and in institutions which exist to serve the public interest\". In the letter, Baroness D'Souza complained the offences would result in 12 points on her driving licence, which meant she would lose it and might have to \"give up attending Parliament\".\"I live deep in the countryside with no local bus services and unsuitable train schedules,\" she added.The peer had asked Sir Mark if losing her licence was \"a fair response for exceeding the speed limit while we are all still learning what a 20-mile speed actually feels like?\"\"Who can say if my speedometer or your radar is entirely accurate in recording 21 miles instead of 20,\" she added in her letter, which was sent on House of Lords headed paper.Baroness D'Souza,  a crossbench peer who does not belong to a party, was eventually disqualified from driving temporarily on 16 July. She has only spoken in the House of Lords once since then and, voted twice.In the letter, she acknowledged that Sir Mark, the UK's most senior police officer who also leads on Britain's counter-terrorism efforts, had \"much other business to deal with\".\"I apologise for bothering your office with such a trivial matter,\" she added.The Met Police passed the letter to the House of Lords' commissioner for standards who recommended an eight-week suspension, citing the aggravating factor that the intervention was for personal benefit.Baroness D'Souza,  who was the Lords' speaker between 2011 and 2016, denied she had been attempting to influence the police investigation, but instead find \"any mitigating factors\" that might keep any driving ban to a minimum.She told investigators she used Lords stationery because she had previously met Sir Mark \"in the context\" of her parliamentary role.Baroness D'Souza accepted that her letter to the Met Police chief was \"inappropriate\" and said she \"deeply regretted\" the decision to send it.She appealed against the proposed eight-week Lords ban, claiming it was \"unduly severe\" compared with shorter suspensions for bullying or misuse of facilities. Her appeal was rejected by the committee.The report will now go before the House for approval. If agreed, the suspension will take effect immediately.Baroness D'Souza was previously criticised for billing taxpayers thousands of pounds in expenses for chauffeur-driven cars.This includes a keeping chauffeur-driven Mercedes waiting outside the Royal Opera House - just a mile from parliament - for four hours, before returning to the Lords at a cost of £230.40.She also used a Mercedes to get from Westminster to Canterbury for the enthronement of Archbishop Justin Welby in March 2013 cost £627, freedom of information results found.",

    "body": "29 minutes agoBBC BanglaDhaka andKelly NgAt least 16 people have died after a huge fire broke out at a garment factory in Bangladesh, with officials warning that the toll could rise.Sixteen bodies have been recovered but were burned beyond recognition, the fire service said. Distraught relatives gathered outside the four-storey factory in Dhaka's Mirpur area on Tuesday in search of their loved ones still missing.The blaze, which broke out at the factory around midday, was extinguished after three hours. But an adjacent chemical warehouse continued to burn, authorities said.Up until 21:00 local time (15:00 GMT) yesterday, the fire at the chemical warehouse had not been completely doused, media reports said.Fire service officials have not ascertained which of the two buildings caught fire first. According to eyewitnesses, the chemical warehouse stored bleaching powder, plastic and hydrogen peroxide, all of which can intensify fires. Plastic also releases toxic fumes when burned.Police and military officers are still trying to locate the owners of the factory and the warehouse, fire service director Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury told reporters.An investigation on whether the warehouse was operating legally is also ongoing, he added.Tearful family members stood outside the charred buildings, many of them cluting photographs of their missing relatives. Among them is a man searching desperately for his daughter, Farzana Akhter. \"When I heard about the fire, I came running. But I still haven't found her....I just want my daughter back,\" he told Reuters news agency.",

    "body": "10 hours agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterHouse of CommonsThe UK's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood helped to bring about the ceasefire deal in Gaza, Sir Keir Starmer has told MPs.Speaking after a summit in Egypt, the PM stressed that the agreement signed there belonged to US President Donald Trump, telling MPs: \"This is his deal.\"But he said the UK had been in a position to work \"behind the scenes\" for a ceasefire \"precisely because of the approach this government takes,\" including its recognition of a Palestinian state.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said recognising Palestine without setting a condition for the release of hostages was \"rewarding terrorism\" and accused the PM of \"diminishing\" UK influence in the Middle East. Sir Keir told MPs that Monday's deal provided \"a moment of profound relief\" as he paid tribute to both the hostages and the civilians killed in Gaza.But he also stressed that \"making that peace last will be no less difficult a task\" and that implementing the peace plan \"is no small challenge\".Negotiations will now follow on phase two of the deal, which involves Hamas laying down its weapons - a possibility the group is reported to have dismissed - and the rebuilding of Gaza under a \"peace board\" chaired by Trump and potentially including former prime minister Sir Tony Blair.Sir Keir said the UK stood ready to deploy its diplomacy and expertise to support the reconstruction of Gaza - the devastation of which he says \"defies description\".The UK will provide an additional £20m in humanitarian aid to provide \"water, sanitation and hygiene products\" to people in the territory, he added.There are no plans to send British troops to be part of the multinational force that will monitor the truce, but the prime minister said the UK would help with the ceasefire monitoring process.And he said the UK could draw on its experience in Northern Ireland to \"play a full role\" in the decommissioning of Hamas's weapons and capability.The prime minster told MPs the deal represented the \"first real chance we've had\" of a two-state solution since the 1993 Oslo Accords, which were meant to provide interim self-government for Palestine as a stepping stone to an independent state.\"So we are fully committed to this [deal] because a safe and secure Israel, alongside a viable Palestinian state, is the only way to secure lasting peace for the Middle East,\" he told MPs. The PM also claimed that the UK's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood had aided the cause of peace.He told MPs: \"This move, taken alongside our allies France, Canada, Australia and others, helped lead to the historic New York declaration, where for the first time the entire Arab League condemned the atrocities of October 7, urged Hamas to disarm and, crucially, demanded that they end their rule in Gaza.\"Kemi Badenoch accused the prime minister of \"taking the wrong decisions time and time again, diminishing our influence in\" the Middle East.\"It's quite clear that UK relations with Israel have been strained by the actions of this government,\" she told MPs, to cries of \"shame\" from the Labour benches. The Conservative leader added: \"In a move praised by Hamas, Labour decided to recognise a state of Palestine with no condition to release the hostages still held in the tunnels of Gaza, rewarding terrorism.\"At the time, the US voiced strong opposition to the UK and other countries recognising Palestinian statehood, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying Hamas would \"feel more emboldened\" by the move.Under Trump's proposed 20-point peace plan, Gaza would initially be governed by a temporary transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a \"Board of Peace\".Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority - which administers the West Bank - once it has undergone reforms.According to the plan, Hamas - which seized control of Gaza in 2007 by ousting its rivals, a year after winning legislative elections - would play no future role in its governance, directly or indirectly. The ceasefire deal says Hamas should release all the 48 Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza after two years of war.All but one were among the 251 people abducted during the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 67,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. ",

    "body": "6 hours agoFaisal IslamBBC Economics Editor andLucy HookerBusiness reporterGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves said, despite the IMF's upgrade to UK economic growth, \"for too many people, our economy feels stuck\"The UK is set to be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year, according to new projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).But the IMF also predicts the UK will face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations both this year and next, driven by rising energy and utility bills.The forecasts are part of the Fund's twice-a-year outlook for the global economy.It said so far there had been a \"muted response\" to the wave of tariffs imposed on imports to the US this year, but that they were having an impact on global growth.The IMF, whose purpose is to bring its 190 members together, to work on maintaining global economic stability, is a respected forecaster. However, uncertainties, ranging from geopolitics to the weather, often derail expectations.According to the Fund's latest predictions, unveiled as government officials gather in Washington DC, the UK appears to be weathering the storm better than others.The IMF predicts that in 2025 the UK economy will outperform other G7 economies, apart from the US, in what has been a torrid year for trade and geopolitical tensions.The G7 are a grouping of the world's richer countries, including the US, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Japan, but not fast-growing economies such as India and China.Despite edging ahead of most rivals, UK economic growth rates are expected to remain modest at 1.3% for this year and next.Moreover, on a per head basis economic output is only set to grow 0.4% this year and 0.5% in 2026, putting the UK at the bottom of the G7 league table.Chancellor Rachel Reeves who arrived in Washington on Tuesday, said people sensed the economy was \"stuck\".\"Working people feel it every day, experts talk about it, and I am going to deal with it,\" she said.She will use the IMF gathering to try to provide reassurance over the UK's financial stability and tout the country as an attractive place for investment.Price pressuresHowever the IMF warned the UK still faces stronger inflation than in other similar countries, with prices forecast to rise by 3.4% this year and 2.5% in 2026. The IMF said higher inflation was likely to be temporary, and should fall to 2% by the end of next year.Speaking at a separate event in Washington, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said he also believed inflationary pressures were easing, after unemployment data in the UK on Tuesday showed unemployment rising and wage growth slowing.Highlighting the inflation forecasts, shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said the IMF assessment made for \"grim reading\".He said UK households were \"being squeezed from all sides\", adding: \"Since taking office, Labour have allowed the cost of living to rise, debt to balloon and business confidence to collapse to record lows.\"Trump tariffs loom largeThe IMF's global outlook was dominated by the reaction to US tariffs, a weakened dollar, questions about the independence of the US Federal Reserve and sky-high valuations of US tech companies, the Fund said.The IMF said resilience was \"giving way to warning signs\" and that US tariffs costs, were starting to feed through to higher prices for American shoppers.However, in an interview with the BBC, the IMF's chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the worst consequences of a global trade war had been tempered.\"The effect of the tariff shock is there. It is negative for global outlook. It is weighing down on investment and consumption decisions, there is trade policy uncertainty… but it's not as bad as expected because the shock itself has been scaled down and there are these offsets,\" he said.The IMF cited Brexit as an example of how uncertainty around major changes in trading arrangements can, after a delay, lead to steady falls in investment and he said the Bank of England should be \"very cautious\" about cutting interest rates as expectations around future inflation remained high.The IMF's forecast noted that Canada's economy, hit hard by the trade-war with the US will be pushed into second place in the growth league table this year. However, Canada is expected to retake second place next year when its economy is forecast to grow at a rate of 1.5%.Germany, France and Italy are all forecast to grow far more slowly at rates of between 0.2 and 0.9% in 2025 and 2026.Economist tells the BBC's Michelle Fleury he sees \"lower growth\" and \"higher inflation\" for USAI warningThe IMF also pointed to \"excessively optimistic\" expectations around AI, which could trigger a market correction.In its separate Global Financial Stability Report the IMF concluded that markets appeared \"complacent\".Mr Gourinchas said the IMF was not asserting that there would be an imminent bursting of a bubble, but that this was \"one of the risks\" it was looking at.The concentration of the overvaluation of tech stocks on a small number of companies was now \"substantially higher\" than at the dotcom bubble in 2020, the IMF said.However, Mr Gourinchas said the \"AI investment boom\" was also helping sustain US economic growth.Correction 14 October: An earlier version of this article said the UK would have the second-fastest growing economy of the G7 both this year and next. The UK will have the third fastest growing economy in 2026.",

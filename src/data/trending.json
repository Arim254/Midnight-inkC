There are around 32,000 asylum seekers currently being housed in hotels. Adam and Chris discuss whether this will help with government’s pledge to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.\nAnd, there are fears of mass killings as Sudan’s civil war appears to have reached a significant turning point. More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 14 million have fled their homes. Adam is joined by chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet and Kholood Khair a Sudanese political analyst and director of Khartoum think tank Confluence Advisory.\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.

Will Kamala Harris (and Donald Trump) run for president again?AmericastAvailable for over a yearIt’s just over a year since the 2024 presidential election but attention is already turning to 2028 with both candidates from last year’s race expressing a desire to run again. Kamala Harris told the BBC over the weekend that she “wasn’t done” with public service, while Donald Trump said on Monday morning that he’d “love” to stand again for a third term. We answer your questions on whether Donald Trump plans to override the constitution for a third term in office, and whether he’d have support of the American public.\nMeanwhile, the president is back in construction, this time building a new ballroom at the White House, which has involved demolishing the 103-year-old East Wing in the process. We answer your questions on whether Trump is allowed to demolish parts of the White House and who’s actually paying for the changes. \nAnd, after Kamala Harris’s interview with the BBC, Justin and Anthony take a bit of time off air to chat through some of the issues she spoke about with Laura Kuenssberg and the circumstances surrounding Joe Biden’s eventual decision to withdraw from the election. \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

Police were called to reports that three people had been stabbed in Midhurst Gardens, Uxbridge on Monday and paramedics  treated three victims for stab wounds. A 45-year-old man is being treated in hospital with life-changing injuries, and a 14-year-old boy has been discharged from hospital after the incident. Mr Dawood was not known to Mr Broadhurst, but was known to the other two alleged victims, the Metropolitan Police said.He required hospital treatment after \"suffering a medical episode\" and was later returned to police custody where he remained, the force added.The Home Office confirmed the suspect entered the UK in a lorry in November 2020, was granted asylum and leave to remain in 2022, and does not live in Home Office accommodation.He also faces a charge of possession of an offensive weapon and  will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentA British man has been detained by Ukrainian security services and accused of spying for Russia.Prosecutors in Kyiv said the unnamed man had been passing information to Russian intelligence while working as a military instructor.They said the Briton had arrived in Ukraine in January 2024 and had \"conducted instructional sessions for military personnel in Mykolaiv\", a city near the front line in the south of the country. He later worked for Ukrainian border units, they added.The man is being held without bail while a pre-trial investigation is conducted. Ukrainian security services say he could face up to 12 years in prison.The BBC has approached the Foreign Office for comment.In a statement, the Ukrainian prosecutor's office said the British man had stopped working as an instructor in September 2024 and moved to Odesa where he \"established contact with a representative of the Russian special service and agreed to provide military information for money\".It said there was evidence showing the Briton in May 2025 transmitting the location of Ukrainian units, photographs of training areas and information about military personnel that could lead to their identification.The man is also accused of gathering information about facilities in Odesa, trying to get access to military units and even discussing \"the possibility of using explosive devices\". For one of these tasks, the prosecutors say he received $6,000 (£5,148).In a separate statement, Ukraine's security service, the SBU, said the man had been \"preparing to commit terrorist attacks\".It said he had \"professional skills in fire and tactical training\" and had advertised his willingness to spy on \"various pro-Kremlin internet groups\".The SBU said Russian spies had sent the Briton instructions about how to make an improvised explosive device as well as the location of a cache of weapons from which he took a pistol and two loaded magazines.It added that the man had been detained at his \"temporary residence\" in Kyiv.The man appeared in court this week and was detained without bail while a pre-trial investigation was being conducted by the SBU with support from counterintelligence units.Prosecutors published photos showing him in court with his face blurred to prevent his identification.",

    "body": "Two men arrested in connection with the Louvre theft two weeks ago have \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the brazen heist, according to officials.The pair in custody are suspected of being the two who used power tools to enter the museum's Apollon gallery and steal some of the French crown jewels.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that the jewels had not been recovered yet, and the gang involved could be bigger than the four people caught on CCTV.The two men, both in their thirties, have criminal records and were identified by DNA found during investigations, Beccuau said.One of the men was arrested as he tried to board a one-way flight to Algeria, but Beccuau said the other man had not been planning to leave France, despite earlier media reports.There was no evidence currently to suggest the theft was an inside job confirming no accomplices worked at the museum, she added.But Beccuau said she was not ruling out the possibility that this involved more than the four suspects caught on CCTV, including the people expecting to receive the stolen jewels.\"I want to remain hopeful that [the jewels] will be found and they can be brought back to the Louvre, and more broadly to the nation\", she said.A crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, was dropped by the thieves as they fled. Damage to the crown is still being assessed, Beccuau added.On Sunday when the arrests were made, the prosecutor criticised the \"premature disclosure\" of information related to the case, adding that it hindered efforts to recover the jewels and find the thieves.On the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30 (08:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Beccuau said at Wednesday's conference.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.She said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars and heading east.Nobody had been threatened during the raid, she told reporters.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJaroslav LukivShutterstockPrince Andrew has lived at Royal Lodge since 2004 and has a 75-year leaseParliament's spending watchdog has raised concerns over whether Prince Andrew's lease arrangements are \"achieving the best value for money\", amid increased scrutiny over the cost of his accommodation at the Windsor mansion.The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) asked the Crown Estate and Treasury to explain the rationale behind the lease on the 30-room Royal Lodge by 28 November.Prince Andrew took a 75-year lease on the property in 2003 and paid a large amount up front, including for renovations, in effect, so there would be no rent liability.There has been increased focus on the prince over his links with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The prince has always denied any wrongdoing.When he took on the lease Prince Andrew had to pay £5m for renovations, £2.5m towards rent in advance, an extra £1m premium, and then in practice an extra £2.5m for renovations, according to the National Audit Office and Crown Estate.In Wednesday's letter to the Crown Estate and the Treasury, PAC chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown wrote: \"There is considerable and understandable public interest in the spending of public money in relation to Prince Andrew, which in part stems from the fact that he is no longer a working royal and from serious and disturbing allegations made against him.\"In a series of questions, Sir Geoffrey asked whether the cost of any works on the property had been funded by the taxpayer, and what the Crown Estate's plan was to ensure value for money in any future agreements with Prince Andrew.\"We are therefore concerned as to whether the lease arrangements for Royal Lodge are, in light of recent developments and changes in the responsibilities of Prince Andrew, achieving the best value for money,\" the letter said.It added that it was a concern that the terms of the lease, including those related to maintenance, were being enforced to maintain the \"nationally important royal residence\".The Treasury and the Crown Estate have not publicly commented on the PAC letter.Prince Andrew - who gave up titles including the Duke of York earlier this month -   has lived at Royal Lodge since 2004, after signing the 75-year lease deal the previous year with the Crown Estate, an independent property company which is owned by the monarch.The Grade II-listed Royal Lodge boasts a gardener's cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.ReutersPrince Andrew paid significant amounts up front on his lease deal for Royal LodgeLast week, more details emerged about how he could afford his sprawling mansion, after the lease agreement had been revealed.The arrangement means he has only ever paid a token - or peppercorn - annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate, a lease document seen by BBC News confirms.In effect, those payments - which totalled more than £8m and were detailed in a National Audit Office report - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the lease, based on paying in advance a notional rent of £260,000 per year.Last week, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called on the PAC to launch an inquiry and ask Prince Andrew to give evidence about his lease of Royal Lodge.While there is nothing preventing a House of Commons committee from inviting Prince Andrew to do this, an appearance in such a setting by a member of the Royal Family would be unprecedented. It is unclear whether the committee would be able to compel him to do so.The government has so far refused to give MPs time to debate Prince Andrew's titles or taxpayer-funded home.There have been reports that Prince Andrew is willing to leave Royal Lodge but wants other royal properties for himself and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson.Buckingham Palace has not commented on whether Prince Andrew might move out of his home - or where he might go.In a separate development, it emerged this week that Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge as part of his daughter Beatrice's birthday celebrations in 2006 - two months after a US arrest warrant had been issued for Epstein for the sexual assault of a minor. Andrew did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterNvidia has hit a new milestone, becoming the first company in the world to reach a market value of $5tn (£3.8tn).The US chip-maker has rapidly climbed from a niche graphics-chip manufacturer to an AI titan, as euphoria about the potential of artificial intelligence keeps driving demand for its chips and propelling its stock to record highs.The company reached a market value of $1tn for the first time in June 2023 and hit the $4tn valuation mark just three months ago.Shares in the chip-maker rose as much as 5.6% to more than $212 on Wednesday morning, boosted by investor optimism about Nvidia's sales in China, which has been a geopolitical flashpoint.The world's most valuable company - the biggest winner in the AI spending spree - has soared past its rivals in the technology sector. It has struck deals with leading AI companies including OpenAI and Oracle as its chips continue to power the AI boom.Nvidia's value now exceeds the GDP of every country except the US and China, according to data from the World Bank, and is higher than entire sectors of the S&P 500.Microsoft and Apple have also recently crossed the $4tn valuation mark, reinforcing a broader tech rally fuelled by optimism on Wall Street about AI spending.AI-related enterprises have accounted for 80% of the stunning gains in the American stock market this year.But concerns about an AI bubble - and whether these companies are overvalued - continue to mount as tech stocks hit record after record.Warnings have come from the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund, as well as from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who told the BBC that \"the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds\".Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, called Nvidia's $5tn valuation \"a sum so vast the human brain can't properly get a handle on it\".\"Of course, this is going to do nothing to dispel fears over an AI bubble, but the market seems keen to march on regardless,\" she added.Some sceptics are now publicly asking whether the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies may be, at least in part, the result of what they call \"financial engineering\". Leading AI firms have been investing in one another, creating a tangled web of deals that has been drawing scrutiny. For example, OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with ChatGPT in 2022, last month secured a $100bn investment from Nvidia.Nvidia's share price dipped in April when global markets were jolted by US President Donald Trump's intensifying trade wars. Concerns about Trump's trade policies linger, but Nvidia's stock has still seen strong growth since the spring.It share price has risen more than 50% so far this year.Investors have been focused on Nvidia's access to China, which is the biggest market for its products and has been investing heavily to produce its own high-end chips. Nvidia had previously been banned from selling its most advanced chips to China, before Trump reversed the ban in July. Nvidia has to pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government in an unprecedented deal struck in the summer.Trump, who is expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, said on Wednesday that the two leaders will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell artificial intelligence processors. His comments helped nudge Nvidia's stock even higher.Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive who has achieved celebrity status amid the company's meteoric rise, announced a flurry of partnerships on Tuesday. He said he expects $500 billion in AI chip orders through next year.",

    "body": "9 hours agoAna Faguyin Sarasota, FloridaBBCChantille Manuel has celebrated many successes over the last five years - but still struggles to put food on the tableChantille Manuel has spent the past five years transforming her life. The Florida resident has celebrated five years in recovery for addiction, she has lost more than 140lbs (64kg), and has started her own businesses, a beauty salon. Despite all these successes, Ms Manuel has struggled to put food on the table and depends on food assistance from local churches and the US government alike, to keep herself fed. \"I don't want to have to have help from anybody, I want to be self-sufficient,\" she says.She is one of the more than 40 million Americas who may not get essential food assistance after Saturday, because of an ongoing government shutdown caused by the inability of Congress to agree a new funding deal. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) is used by one in eight Americans - including Ms Manuel - and plays a vital role in how many people purchase their groceries. It works by giving people reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy food. But officials who oversee the programme say they will not have the funds to pay full benefits from 1 November.Ms Manuel spent the last of her October Snap money last week on essentials like coffee, creamer and tuna.She could not pause to consider whether or not the government would find a solution before Saturday when she made her purchases.“It’s either going to be there or it’s not,” she says. “So I might as well get what I need right now.” Half of US states sue Trump administration over halting food stampsWhen will the US government shutdown halt food stamps?Earlier this month, the Trump administration declined to draw on a contingency fund that would have continued benefits, saying this was needed for potential emergencies such as natural disasters. At any rate, even those contingency funds would not have been enough to fully resolve the issue. They would only cover about 60% of a single month of benefits payments, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families.Democrats and Republicans have disagreed over using the contingency funding to at least ease the situation. Democrats have argued that the Trump administration has already secured funding for other essential services during the shutdown - such as keeping up payments to members of the military - so could do the same with Snap. Trump's Republicans, meanwhile, say that Snap will receive its funding once again if Democrats reopened the government - seeking to blame the opposition party for an impasse which is now in its fifth week.On Tuesday, Democrats in the US Senate introduced legislation to continue to fund Snap during the shutdown. It remains unclear if that has enough votes to pass. While lawmakers in Washington continue to play the blame game, the “fundamental safety net” of Snap hangs in the balance, says Hanna Garth, a Princeton University professor who studies food insecurity.“Many users make very little money, even though they work,“ she says. “And so it becomes this critical lifeline that keeps families out of deep, deep poverty. It can also be the tipping point that moves some families above the poverty line.” Because these funds might not be replenished from Saturday onwards, many Americans will have to turn to other places to get food - like food banks. Food bank warns of 'new storm'All Faiths Food Bank in Sarasota fed more than 80,000 people last yearOn a sunny Tuesday, a dozen or so volunteers fill a warehouse packaging space inside the All Faiths Food Bank in Sarasota, Florida. They fed more than 80,000 people with more than 22 million pound of food last year, and the need in the area continues to grow, says Nelle Miller, the food bank's CEO.Since the current government shutdown began, the food bank has seen an increase in people needing food.“We had three hurricanes here last year. It was a disaster, but this is a new storm,” she says. “The difference is that people will not immediately recover.” Roughly 20,000 people in the area use Snap benefits, she says - and of those people, roughly 6,000 also use the food bank’s resources. Ms Miller is worried about what happens to those 14,000 Snap recipients after their payouts dry up this weekend. Will they need the food bank’s help as well, she asks. While All Faiths is able to redistribute its food supplies in order to feed more people in case of need, that would mean each person getting less food, she explains.“Receiving food is an inalienable right. You’re born on Earth, there’s enough food here to feed everyone. It’s a distribution problem,” Ms Miller says. “I just can’t imagine denying food, water, or air to any human being. This is really difficult, it’s very distressing.” The need for food in her area continues to grow, says food bank chief Nelle MillerA family of four on average receives $715 (£540) per month, according to CBPP, which breaks down to a little less than $6 per person per day.But as an individual, Austin Lemmer receives even less than that - $295 each month. He has already spent his October Snap benefits and is readying himself to not receive next month’s. “I’m super anxious,\" he says. \"I’ve been trying to stretch the little bit of food that I have as far as possible, but there’s only so much you can do, especially when you’re already living on bags of rice and canned beans.”Individual states administer the programmes, with much of the funding coming from the federal government.Several states have pledged to use their own funds to cover any shortfall, however the federal government has warned that they will not be reimbursed.Some states - including Florida - have said their Snap recipients will lose benefits if nothing is done before the weekend. In an effort to stop that, on Tuesday, 25 Democrat attorneys general in 25 states plus the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration over its plan to halt funding for food aid. They argued that a decision by the administration to not use the contingency funds would be unlawful and deprive millions of Americans from being able to afford groceries. Responding to the lawsuit, the US Department of Agriculture blamed Democrats for the fund running dry, and said the party needed to decide whether it wanted to \"hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments\".The government shutdown entered its 29th day on Wednesday, and is the second-longest shutdown in history.There has been no meaningful progress towards a deal to reopen the government. That is something that has frustrated many Snap recipients, like Ms Manuel. “I don’t feel like [the politicians in Washington] would make the decision that they’re making if it affected them, the way it affects us,” she says. “As long as they’re eating, that’s what they care about.”",

    "description": "The French parliament has ratified an amendment to add consent to the legal definition of sexual assault and rape law.Previously, rape or sexual abuse",
    "body": "The French parliament has ratified an amendment to add consent to the legal definition of sexual assault and rape law.Previously, rape or sexual abuse in France had been defined as \"any form of sexual penetration committed with the use of violence, coercion, threat or surprise\".Now, the law will say that all sexual acts done to another without consent constitute rape.The change is the result of a cross-party, years-long debate which gained renewed urgency after last year's Pelicot rape trial, in which 50 men were found guilty of raping Gisèle Pelicot while she had been drugged unconscious by her husband Dominique.The defence of many of the accused hinged on the fact they could not be guilty of rape because they were unaware Ms Pelicot was not in a position to give her consent.Some defence lawyers in the Pelicot case had therefore argued that there could be no crime without the intention to commit it.The new bill will make this argument more tenuous, as it says that consent must be \"free and informed, specific, prior and revocable\",The law now says consent will have to be evaluated according to the circumstances, noting that it cannot be inferred from \"silence or lack of reaction\".\"There is no consent if the sexual act is committed through violence, coercion, threat or surprise, whatever their nature,\" it states.The two MPs who drafted the amendment - the Greens' Marie-Charlotte Garin and centrist Véronique Riotton - said a \"historic victory\" had been achieved and hailed \"a major step forward in the fight against sexual violence\".Some critics of the amendment had argued it would result in sexual relations turning into \"contracts\". Others were concerned that the changes could force victims of rape to prove they had not consented.But France's highest administrative court, the Council of State (Conseil d'État) said in March that it was backing the amendment, saying that it would \"clearly express... that sexual assaults infringe upon the fundamental principle of everyone's personal and sexual freedom\".An initial version was adopted by the National Assembly in April. Its progression was delayed by France's current political turmoil, but on Wednesday the Senate definitively adopted the bill, with 327 votes in favour and 15 abstentions. It then went back to parliament, which gave it final approval.Last year Greens senator Mélanie Vogel argued that while society had \"already accepted the fact that the difference between sex and rape is consent\" but that criminal law had not kept up.\"This is a historic step forward, following in the footsteps of several other European countries,\" Lola Schulmann, advocacy officer at Amnesty International France, told AFP on Wednesday.Sweden, Germany and Spain are among the European countries that already have consent-based rape laws.",

    "body": "Teenager guilty of murdering boy at NYE event4 hours agoFamily handout / PA MediaHarry Pitman was stabbed once in the neck on 31 December 2023An teenager has been found guilty of murdering 16-year-old Harry Pitman, who was stabbed in the neck at a New Year's Eve event in north London. Areece Lloyd-Hall was convicted at the Old Bailey following a retrial after jurors in the first trial were unable to reach a verdict.Lloyd-Hall, from Westminster, was found guilty by a majority of 11 to one after almost eight hours of deliberation. He had already been convicted of possessing an offensive weapon.The fatal stabbing took place at Primrose Hill on 31 December 2023 after Harry accidentally bumped into another boy while \"play-fighting\" and practising high kicks, the jury was told.Prosecution barrister Jocelyn Ledward KC told jurors \"revelry turned to tragedy in the blink of an eye\".Harry and Lloyd-Hall were strangers who had each gone to watch the fireworks with separate groups of friends.Earlier that evening, Special Constable David Smith said Harry had seemed excitable and \"physically bounced\" up to him for a friendly chat before \"fist bumping\" another reveller nearby.PA MediaPolice officers were seen on Primrose Hill in the days following Harry's deathThe attack happened in front of a crowd gathered in the popular park to watch fireworks over the River Thames.Lloyd-Hall, now aged 18, pushed forward and lunged at Harry with a pointed dagger, metres from where uniformed police officers were stationed.In \"shocking\" mobile phone footage played in court, a knife sheath was seen to fly through the air during the fast-paced incident.Harry held his neck, his white T-shirt covered in blood, as he pushed through crowds calling to officers for \"help\".He collapsed and died minutes later, shortly before midnight.College student Lloyd-Hall, who was 16 at the time, claimed he thought he had only hit Harry with the sheath in an attempt to get Harry away from him.'Not my intention'He said: \"I did not want him to lose his life.\"I feel horrible for what I caused. It was not my intention.\"He said he ran off not realising what had happened because he was holding a knife and knew there were police officers nearby.Jurors were told Lloyd-Hall was suffering from cannabis-induced paranoia and may have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder triggered by witnessing the aftermath of an earlier stabbing and the loss of a friend to knife crime in June 2023.At the first trial in October last year, a jury found Lloyd-Hall guilty of possession of an offensive weapon but failed to agree on other charges, it can now be reported.There were gasps from Harry's family sitting in court as Lloyd-Hall was convicted of murder.The teenager will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 10 November.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "54 minutes agoFiona Nimoni and Yasmin MalikThe UK will provide £2.5m in emergency humanitarian funding to Jamaica, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has announced.UK relief supplies and technical experts have also been deployed to assist with the disaster response and recovery from the devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons: \"The scenes of destruction emerging from Jamaica are truly shocking.\" The £2.5m funding will go towards delivering emergency supplies such as shelter kits, water filters and blankets, according to the FCDO. The PM also told MPs that naval vessel HMS Trent had been \"pre-positioned in the region\" to provide support.As many as 8,000 Britons are understood to be in Jamaica and the FCDO has urged them to register their presence to receive updates on the hurricane.A specialist FCDO team has travelled to Miami to provide consular assistance to affected British nationalsIn a statement on X, King Charles said he and Queen Camilla had been \"deeply concerned and profoundly saddened to see the catastrophic damage caused by the ferocity of Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica and across the Caribbean\". \"Above all, our most heartfelt sympathy is with the families, friends and loved ones of those who have tragically lost their lives,\" the statement added.Hurricane Melissa - now a category three storm and headed towards the Bahamas - first hit Jamaica's southern coast with maximum sustained winds of 295km/h (185mph) - the strongest on Earth so far this year.Those speeds were above those of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , one of the worst storms in history.With communications crippled, the true scale of the disaster remains unknown.Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared the island a \"disaster area\" on Tuesday, warning of \"devastating impacts\" and \"significant damage\" to hospitals, homes and businesses.Three-quarters of the country had no electricity overnight and many parts of Jamaica's western side are under water, with homes destroyed by strong winds after the hurricane tore across the island with catastrophic force.Families and friends in the UK have faced difficulty contacting Britons in Jamaica. Rayanne Walters, 26, from London, says her messages have not been delivered to her friend in Jamaica.\"We tried phoning him. After a few minutes - it cuts off. \"I've been really, really sad and feel heartbroken. I just really want to know my friends are okay. It's one tick on all the phones,\" she told the BBC. Yvonne Williams, a teacher from Leeds, has also been unable to contact her sister. She said: \"Ever since the storm made landfall at around 5pm I haven't been able to get in touch with my sister\"I kept waking up periodically through the night to try and get through.\"Kyle Holmes, from Bolton, was visiting the Caribbean island for his mother's wedding when Hurricane Melissa struck. Mr Holmes, his wife, and three young children were forced to hunker down in their hotel room for 20 hours. \"It was like being like in a war zone - it was horrible,\" he told BBC North West Tonight. \"All the windows were shaking and things were getting thrown at us.\"While Melissa has now cleared Jamaica, there will still be some thunderstorms across the island.The National Hurricane Center warns that an additional 8-15cm (3-6in) of rain is possible in parts, with up to 76cm over mountainous areas.Certain areas will remain flooded and there is a risk of ongoing flash flooding and numerous landslides around mountainous regions that could continue into Wednesday night.According to the Met Office, a low-pressure system containing the remnants of Hurricane Melissa will move across the UK next week. The weather system will move across the far north-west late on Sunday and into early Monday - likely as a largely \"business as usual\" system, the Met Office said. ",

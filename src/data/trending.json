    "body": "Everything you need to know about the Budget2 hours agoGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to increase taxes in the Budget later.Ahead of delivering her Budget statement, Reeves said she will take \"fair and necessary choices\" for the economy, to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.The chancellor said she will push ahead with \"the biggest drive for growth in a generation\", which will include sweeping investments across many sectors, to build a \"fairer, stronger and more secure Britain\". The statement will be made in the House of Commons at about 12:30 GMT. The leader of the opposition, Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, will give an immediate response. What has already been announced? The minimum wage for over-21s will go up by 50p an hour to £12.71 in April 2026, Reeves announced on Tuesday, ahead of the Budget.For workers aged 18 to 20, the minimum wage will rise to £10.85, an increase of 85p. The government wants to eventually scrap the separate rate for this age group, creating a single minimum wage for all adults.For 16 and 17-year-olds and apprentices, the minimum wage will increase to £8 an hour, up from £7.55.After the minimum wage went up last year, businesses warned that another increase could result in hiring freezes or job cuts.A so-called milkshake tax has been announced ahead of the Budget.The existing sugar tax, which mainly applies to fizzy drinks, will be applied to bottles and cartons of milk-based drinks, including milkshakes, flavoured milk, milk substitute drinks and lattes. That could add a few pence to these drinks. Or, as has happened with some fizzy drinks, manufacturers may lower their sugar content to avoid the tax.What other tax rises could be in the Budget?According to government sources, Reeves has decided not to raise income tax rates, a move that had been widely expected.However, speculation remains that the chancellor could extend a freeze on income tax and NI thresholds beyond the planned 2028-29 deadline.Freezing thresholds means that, as salaries rise over time, more people reach an income level at which they start paying tax and NI. Some people have to start paying higher tax rates.The chancellor is planning to raise about £2bn by limiting a tax break on pension contributions, the Times has reported.It suggested Reeves could put a £2,000 cap on the amount workers can put into their pensions under \"salary sacrifice\" schemes without paying National Insurance. At the moment there is no limit.It would mean that any contributions above the cap would be subject to NI payments by both employees and employers.For people receiving the full rate of the new state pension, the chancellor is expected to confirm an increase of more than £550 a year from April.This is due to the \"triple lock\", which means the state pension increases by either 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth - whichever is the highest figure. Reeves is planning to introduce a new tax on high-value homes in England, both the Times and the Telegraph have reported. About 2.4 million properties in council tax bands F, G and H will be revalued, they said. The tax will apply to properties worth more than £2m, which will affect about 100,000 homes with an average surcharge of £4,500, the Times said.There have also been suggestions that more landlords should pay NI. At present, if being a landlord is not your main source of income, you may not pay any. The Resolution Foundation think tank suggested that all landlords should pay NI at a basic rate of 20% with an additional rate of 8% for property earnings above £50,270 a year.The chancellor is considering a new tax on electric vehicles (EVs). This could help make up for the fall in fuel duty as more drivers move away from petrol and diesel cars. According to the Telegraph, EV drivers could be charged 3p per mile, on top of other road taxes, amounting to an extra £12 on a journey from London to Edinburgh.A government spokesperson told the BBC: \"Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there's no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers.\"The Budget is also expected to include an extra £1.3bn in funding for the Electric Car Grant scheme, which offers subsidies of up to £3,750 for eligible models.The government may limit the tax break that people can get when buying a bicycle through the Cycle to Work scheme, according to reports.A limit on how much people can spend on a bike through the salary sacrifice scheme could be introduced, the FT said.The scheme offers savings of 42% of the cost of a bike for higher rate taxpayers and 30% for basic rate taxpayers. A previous spending cap of £1,000 was lifted in 2019.Sturti/Getty ImagesThe chancellor is expected to introduce a new limit on how much can be spent on a bicycle through cycle to work schemesThe chancellor is reportedly planning to cut the amount of money that can be saved tax-free in cash Individual Savings Accounts (Isas).Reports have suggested that Reeves could reduce the annual allowance from £20,000 to £12,000.However, cutting the cash Isa limit is unlikely to have the intended effect of promoting investment in stocks and shares, MPs on the Treasury Select Committee have said.The government is expected to close a tax loophole which UK firms argue gives an unfair advantage to foreign online retailers such as Shein.At the moment, overseas retailers can send packages worth less than £135 to the UK without paying import duties, but this would end.The TUC, the umbrella group for UK trade unions, has called for higher taxes on banks and online gaming companies. In September, the chancellor told ITV News that \"there is a case for gambling firms paying more\".What other measures could be in the Budget?Parents can only claim universal credit or tax credits for their first two children. The rule applies to third or subsequent children born after 6 April 2017.The chancellor hinted at changes when she told the BBC it was not right that children in bigger families were \"penalised\".She could scrap the limit entirely or extend the benefit to all families, irrespective of the number of children, but at a lower level.Mike Harrington/Getty ImagesReeves has suggested that benefit limits on larger families might be liftedThe BBC understands the government could bring down gas and electricity bills by cutting the current 5% rate of VAT charged on energy, or reducing some regulatory costs which suppliers can pass on to customers.Why is the chancellor expected to put up taxes?The chancellor needs more money in order to meet self-imposed rules for government finances which she says are \"non-negotiable\". The two main rules are:Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliamentTo get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliamentThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's official forecaster - has assessed the gap in public finances to be close to £20bn, the BBC understands.How is the UK economy doing?The government has repeatedly said that boosting the economy is a key priority.A growing economy usually means people spend more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.In October, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that the UK was set to be the second-fastest-growing major economy in 2025. However, it also predicted that the UK will face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations in 2025 and 2026.Here's what you want to see in the Budget ",

    "body": "An 18-year-old Central Florida student was found dead aboard a Carnival cruise ship earlier this month while vacationing with her family.The family of Anna Kepner, a soon-to-be high-school graduate, is speaking publicly for the first time about her mysterious death and the loss they are grappling with.Authorities have released few details. But a death certificate provided to ABC News by her family states that Miss Kepner died of \"mechanical asphyxia\", with the date of injury listed as 6 November.  Ms Kepner was on vacation in the Caribbean with her father, stepmother and three step-siblings when she was discovered dead in her cabin.Here's what we know about the case.Anna Kepner's body was found under a bed, wrapped in a blanket and covered by life vests, ABC News reported.The death certificate provided to the network by Anna Kepner's family states  that she \"was mechanically asphyxiated by other person(s)\". The Miami Dade Medical Examiners office did not confirm ABC's reporting and declined to provide any more information to the BBC, citing an \"active and ongoing investigation\".The FBI has not named any suspects, and no charges have been filed.Much of what is publicly known about the family's trip comes from an interview Miss Kepner's grandparents gave to ABC news.The family was travelling on the Carnival Horizon, a family vacation that included Miss Kepner's father, one of her biological siblings, a brother, her stepmother, and her stepmother's children from a previous relationship. Her grandparents were also on board.\"We were all having a great time,\" said her grandmother Barbara Kepner. \"I couldn't fathom why anyone would wanna hurt my baby.\"Her grandparents said she was expected to graduate from high school in May and planned to join the US Navy. \"We were looking forward to seeing her grow,\" her grandfather Jeffrey Kepner said.  \"The cruise itself wasn't what made me excited. It was the fact that I was gonna get to spend another week with my youngest son and his family and all the grandkids.\"The Kepners said that the relationship between Anna Kepner and her step-siblings was a happy one, adding there was \"no such thing as steps\". \"It's all family. It's a blended family, yes, but that's not how our family is,\" Jeffrey Kepner said. \"Our dynamic is we're all just family.\"Barbara Kepner recalled that the last day she saw her granddaughter alive, the teenager had complained about her braces bothering her.Despite the discomfort, she dressed up and joined the family in the cruise casino, her grandmother said.Barbara Kepner said her granddaughter told her \"Meemaw, I love you guys, I'll see you later.\"\"And we never saw her again after that,\" she said. Her grandparents are now desperate for answers. \"I now know how she died,\" Barbara Kepner said. \"It helps a little bit, but it's not going to bring Anna back.\"The cruise company told the BBC it is fully cooperating with the FBI's investigation.",

The popular US dancing competition sees stars paired with professional dancers to perform in front of a panel of judges, with the audience also voting on their favourite couple.The 21-year-old was favoured to win, with strong performances over the show's 11 weeks, including a tribute to his father and a surprise appearance from his sister Bindi. With a legion of fans in the US, Irwin's finale had an Australian bent with one dance choreographed to a song by Australian rock band Jet.During the three-hour finale on Tuesday evening, local time, Irwin and his dance partner Witney Carson also performed to songs by Avicii and Sydney-born Sam Sparro.They then triumphed in the \"instant dance challenge\" – where Irwin and Carson were told the style and song minutes before taking to the stage.Irwin, who competed in the final despite having a rib injury, beat fellow finalists including influencer Alix Earle and Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles.This came despite three contestants - not including Irwin - earning a perfect score of 30 for their first dances. However, Irwin got a perfect score not long after.Getty ImagesThe pair triumphed in the \"instant dance challenge\"He broke down in tears after his final performance, saying that said he wanted to make his father proud.\"I wish he could see it, I really wish he could be here,\" he said.Steve Irwin was famous for his TV wildlife shows which regularly saw him handling crocodiles and led to him being dubbed the \"Crocodile Hunter\".He was killed by a stingray during a diving expedition off the Australian coast in 2006, when Robert was just a baby. Following his father's love for wildlife, Robert Irwin has long been a keen photographer and recently became an Earthshot ambassador.",

The pair, who married in 1989, had three children and five grandchildren.In a post on Instagram, the Virgin Group founder said his wife was his \"best friend\" and \"guiding light\". \"She was the most wonderful mum and grandmum our kids and grandkids could have ever wished for,\" the 75-year-old wrote.

    "body": "A parking inspector and his wife have been arrested on suspicion of embezzling more than €1m (£878,000) from a small German town's parking meters.The unnamed municipal employee is thought to have taken coins out of parking meters in Kempten \"on numerous occasions\" and placed them in bank accounts that his wife had access to, local police said in a statement.A money laundering report by a credit institution alerted investigators to the suspected theft. The inspector faces charges relating to 720 alleged incidents of theft, while his wife faces charges of aiding and abetting theft, also in 720 cases.Kempten Mayor Thomas Kiechle said he was \"stunned and dismayed\" by the allegations. In October, the Kempten public prosecutor's office was informed that cash was repeatedly being deposited into several bank accounts, according to the German news agency DPA.Police then searched office premises in the early hours of 24 November, the same day that the 40-year-old man and 38-year old woman were arrested.They are now being held in separate detention facilities.It is not clear how long it might have taken the couple to accrue the sum.In response to the allegations, Kiechle announced the appointment of a commission to \"review past work processes, uncover potential weaknesses, and reliably remedy them for the future.\"Kiechle noted that the names of the couple could not currently be released due to the ongoing investigation and privacy concerns.In a written statement, Kiechle said: \"I naturally support the public prosecutor's office and the police in their thorough investigation of the allegations.\"\"Until the proceedings are concluded, the presumption of innocence applies,\" he added.Kempten is one of the oldest settlements in Germany. Located in the country's south, it sits under the hills of the Allgäu and has around 70,000 residents.",

    "body": "Jack Shepherd, the English actor perhaps best remembered for playing the title role in the 1990s ITV detective drama Wycliffe, has died at the age of 85.The Leeds-born TV star passed away in hospital following a \"short illness\", with his wife and children present, PA news agency reports. \"His passing is a sad loss to us all,\" said his agents Markham, Froggatt and Irwin.Awards he received include an Olivier for the original production of the stage play Glengarry Glen Ross in 1983.He had an earlier television incarnation as Bill Brand in the 1970s ITV series of the same name about a fictional firebrand Labour MP.Shepherd also had numerous film roles and was a playwright and theatre director.   After school in Leeds, he won a scholarship to Newcastle University to study fine art, then moved to London to study at The Central School for Speech and Drama.He went on to perform in the National Theatre and Royal Court theatreFor his breakthrough TV role as Bill Brand, he won a Bafta nomination in the best actor category in 1977.The show was described in a Spectator tribute last year as a \"time capsule of the 1970s – the brown everywhere, the fag-smoke and lunchtime beer, the patterned wallpaper, the rusty Ford Cortinas and sense of national decay\".The character Shepherd portrays is described as \"part of a long tradition, reminding the Left of the principles it has wandered from in the search for power\".As the thoughtful Det Supt Charles Wycliffe, Shepherd solved murders in Cornwall over 36 episodes between 1993 and 1998. His work as an actor in BBC productions ranged from a schoolteacher in Play for Today: Pidgeon - Hawk Or Dove? (1974) to a barrister in Blind Justice (1988), and from the Austrian composer Franz Joseph Haydn in the BBC docudrama Beethoven (2005) to an Auschwitz inmate in the drama God on Trial (2008). Shepherd directed The Two Gentlemen Of Verona in 1996 at Shakespeare's Globe and the production also went to Broadway.He worked with director Bill Bryden on numerous theatre productions and was also a saxophonist and jazz pianist.Jack Shepherd is survived by his wife Ann Scott and five children Jan, Jake, Victoria, Catherine and Ben.

    "body": "Australia's landmark social media ban for children is being challenged in the nation's highest court, with two teenagers alleging the law is unconstitutional as it robs them of their right to free communication.From 10 December, social media firms - including Meta, TikTok and YouTube - must ensure that Australians aged under 16 cannot hold accounts on their platforms.The law, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms. However, 15-year-olds Noah Jones and Macy Neyland - backed by a rights group - will argue the ban completely disregards the rights of children.\"We shouldn't be silenced. It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,\" Ms Neyland said in a statement.After news of the case broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told parliament the government would not be swayed.\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she said.The Digital Freedom Project (DFP) announced the case had been filed in the High Court on Wednesday. Teenagers rely on social media for information and association, and a ban could hurt the nation's most vulnerable kids - young people with disability, First Nations youth, rural and remote kids and LGBTIQ+ teenagers - the most, the group said on their website.Led by a New South Wales parliamentarian, John Ruddick, DFP said their challenge would hinge on the ban's impact on political communication, and whether it was proportional to the law's aims.Other measures to improve online safety should be used instead, the group argued, pointing to digital literacy programmes, the forced introduction of age-appropriate features for platforms, and age assurance technologies which have greater privacy protections.Mr Jones argued the government's policy was \"lazy\". \"We are the true digital natives and we want to remain educated, robust, and savvy in our digital world... They should protect kids with safeguards, not silence.\"Australian media have previously reported that Google, which owns YouTube, has also been considering launching a constitutional challenge.Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJemma CrewandMyranda MowafiCases of violence against women and girls need broader interrogation so investigators do not miss other \"often hidden\" crimes, prosecutors have warned.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was a \"significant overlap\" between some offences, with data showing a \"growing relationship\" between domestic abuse and crimes including rape, strangulation, so-called revenge porn and stalking.But it was \"not sufficiently appreciated that abuse often involves different layers of offending\", director of public prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said.Mr Parkinson said it was his personal priority to improve prosecutions for violence against women and girls (VAWG) as the CPS launched a five-year strategy to tackle such crimes in England and Wales. The term violence against women and girls includes offences such as harassment, stalking, rape, sexual assault and murder,While men and boys also suffer from many of these forms of abuse, they disproportionately affect women, the National Police Chiefs' Council says.\"It is vital we train our staff to recognise the full picture of abuse so the charges we make reflect the totality of the offending,\" he added.Over the past five years, on average more than a third of rape charges were linked to domestic abuse, the CPS said.According to the CPS data, more than nine in 10 charges of honour-based abuse, and of strangulation or suffocation, were flagged as relating to domestic abuse.So were more than eight in 10  stalking and revenge porn charges, and more than six in 10 harassment charges, it said. As part of its strategy, the CPS will develop and roll out new VAWG training modules on honour-based abuse, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, and stalking or harassment.And it said it will review and update prosecution guidance on domestic abuse to incorporate learning and understanding.Baljit Ubhey, director of policy and the senior responsible officer for the CPS's VAWG strategy, said prosecutions were a \"deterrent\". He said investigators must not be \"blinkered\" or put crimes into boxes while ignoring the overlap between some offences.\"Evidence shows these crimes are a complex web of harm which are often hidden, often repeated and too often overlooked,\" he said.He continued: \"What this means in practice is when a victim reports an offence, there may be a much deeper pattern of offending across a range of crime types and it is vital this is explored as part of a prosecution.\"The government has pledged to halve VAWG in a decade.In July, the ONS estimated that around one in eight women were victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse or stalking in the last year. It was the first time the ONS had given an estimate of the combined prevalence of the three crimes, after being asked by the Home Office to help monitor the government's ambition.A report at the start of this year found the Home Office's response to the \"serious and growing problem\" of VAWG had been ineffective.The National Audit Office report in January said the department had \"not led an effective whole-system response\" to the rising incidence of rape and sexual assault recorded by police.A Home Office spokesperson said at the time the report had looked at the previous government's \"failure to deliver systemic change\", and that Labour was \"delivering a step-change in the government's response\".",

    "body": "Israel has confirmed that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) handed over the body of deceased Israeli hostage Dror Or on Tuesday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said his government \"shares in the deep sorrow of the Or family\" following the completion of forensic testing overnight.It stressed that Israeli authorities were working \"tirelessly\" to bring home the last two dead hostages still in Gaza and demanded that Hamas uphold its commitments to hand over their remains under the six-week-old Gaza ceasefire agreement.Or's body was transferred via the Red Cross after PIJ and Hamas announced that it had been recovered in central Gaza on Monday.On Wednesday morning, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its representatives had informed Or's family that his body was returned after experts at the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv confirmed its identity.According to the IDF, the 48-year-old father of three was killed by PIJ at his home in Kibbutz Be'eri during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. His body was then abducted and taken to Gaza as a hostage.Mr Or's wife, Yonat, was also killed during the attack, while two of their children, Noam and Alma, were kidnapped alive. They were held hostage in Gaza until November 2023, when they were released as part of a week-long ceasefire deal.\"The IDF expresses deep condolences to the families, continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages, and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement,\" an IDF statement said.\"Hamas is required to fulfil its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to a dignified burial.\"Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 330 Palestinians killed during the war. It should hand over another 15 bodies in return for Mr Or's remains.One of the remaining dead hostages is Israeli - Ran Gvili, 24 - and the other is Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the hostages' bodies, while Hamas has insisted it is struggling to find them under rubble.The slow progress has meant there has been no advance on the second phase of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan. This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction.The two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 69,770 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered that right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro begin serving his prison sentence of 27 years and three months for plotting a coup after he lost the last election.Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday ruled that the case had reached its final judgement and that no further appeals were possible. Bolsonaro, 70, was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.He will begin serving his sentence in a federal police jail cell in the capital, Brasilia, where he has been detained since Saturday after being deemed a flight risk and removed from home detention. At a hearing on Sunday, Bolsonaro admitted trying to open his ankle monitor with a soldering iron until he \"came to his senses\", court documents show. He said he had had no intention of fleeing and blamed medicine-induced \"paranoia\" for damage he caused to the monitor. Justice Moraes on Tuesday mandated that full-time medical care be given to Bolsonaro, whose medical team has previously said he is suffering from worsening health.Supreme Court justices said in September, when Bolsonaro was found guilty of plotting a coup, that he had known of plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes, who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.The conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro, whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.Bolsonaro was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.The former president called the trial a \"witch hunt\" designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.Justice Moraes also ordered on Tuesday that others found guilty of being Bolsonaro's co-conspirators must begin their sentences.They include Gen Augusto Heleno, former minister for institutional security, and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, former defence minister.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJon DonnisonCorrespondent, JerusalemZaher IbrahimMohammed Ibrahim was 15 when he was arrested at his family's holiday home in the occupied West BankA Palestinian-American teenager is expected to appear in court in Israel later this week after nine months in detention without being charged.Mohammed Ibrahim, who is 16 and lives in Florida, was arrested in February while on holiday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank for allegedly throwing stones at Jewish settlers, something he denies.Last month, 27 Democratic US Senators and House members sent a letter to the US State Department, urging the Trump administration to do more to pressure Israel to release him.In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Mohammed had committed a \"a serious potentially deadly crime\" and that the court was proceeding under due process.The teenager's family disagrees.\"You can ask anybody you know, he's a real sweet boy, into his sports and his PlayStation and school,\" his father, Zahar Ibrahim, tells me before wiping a tear from his eye.Mohammed was arrested in a raid on his family's holiday home in the Palestinian village of al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya in the middle of the night by Israeli soldiers. He was 15 years old at the time.Mr Ibrahim has not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February.\"He's just a regular fun kid that loves and respects anybody,\" Mr Ibrahim tells me from the holiday home.Unable to speak to his son for nine months, Mr Ibrahim has only heard accounts of his detention through court documents and says his son was forced to confess.According to the court documents, he says, Mohammed woke up surrounded by Israeli soldiers. \"They tied him up and blindfolded him, and they threw him on the floor of the jeep and took him to wherever they took him.\"Mr Ibrahim, a father of four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, says his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.The Israeli prime minister's office has not responded to a request for comment on whether Mohammed is being held without charge or the allegation that he was beaten while in detention.The US embassy assigned a case worker who has visited Mohammed in prison. Mr Ibrahim says they told him he had lost a lot of weight and was not doing well.He has a message for President Donald Trump, another Florida resident.\"Do what you said from day one. You know America first. He's American, and he's a citizen and he's a child. So, you know, as a president, his [Trump's] duty is to protect Americans, and we're not seeing that for Mohammed.\"\"What's lucky about an American passport?\" Mr Ibrahim says. \"It's not helping. That's one thing that usually a foreign passport makes a difference, but the US state department is not really doing anything.\"A state department spokesperson told the BBC that it was \"tracking Mr Ibrahim's case closely and working with the government of Israel on this case\".US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and embassy staff in Jerusalem were also \"deeply involved\", they said, before adding that they could not comment further \"due to privacy and other considerations\".Zaher IbrahimMohammed is accused of throwing stones at Israeli settlers - something he deniesBecause Mohammed is an American citizen who was only on holiday in the West Bank when he was arrested, his case has attracted the attention of US lawmakers.\"This is a case where the US does have influence. It's just failing to exercise its influence, and that's a great dereliction of duty,\" says Democratic US Senator, Chris van Hollen, from his office in Washington DC.Along with 26 other US lawmakers he has written a letter to the state department and President Trump demanding more to be done to release Mohammed.\"If this were any other country, you would be seeing a much bigger effort. But for whatever reason, the Trump administration does not want to push the Netanyahu government to do what it needs to do,\" Van Hollen tells us.\"You have an American citizen who is being terribly mistreated, who has been beaten up, who has been deprived of adequate food and nutrition, and I haven't heard much from the US government. I haven't heard anything from the secretary of state. I mean, Donald Trump himself. I mean, who says that he is the 'America First' president?\"Mohammed is being held without charge at Ofer prison in the West Bank. It also houses adult detainees, including some who have been convicted of the most serious terrorist offences including murder.Mohammed's case has become relatively high profile because he is an American citizen.But there are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.Many have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.\"We should be demanding justice,\" says Van Hollen.As I leave Zahar Ibrahim's holiday home in al-Mazraa al-Sharqiya, he looks drained and alone. The house is sparse. Just a set of weights to fill his time.All he can do is wait.",

    "body": "57 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterWarner Music Group (WMG) will begin an artificial intelligence (AI) music venture with technology start-up Suno - a year after it sued the firm in a landmark case.As part of the settlement agreement struck between the two firms, Warner will let users create AI-generated music on Suno using the voices, names and likeness of artists who opt-in to the programme.The record label, which represents artists like Dua Lipa, Coldplay and Ed Sheeran, was among several music giants like Sony Music that sued Suno and a similar platform called Udio.AI-generated content has been controversial, with many artists voicing concerns that it could undermine human songwriters.Starting next year, Suno will roll out new advanced and licensed models to its generative-AI music platform, which allows users to create music based on simple descriptions, said Warner in a statement.The Massachusetts-based firm has around 100 million users and was launched two years ago.Suno's 2026 model will replace its existing version and will require users to pay for audio downloads, said Warner. Songs on the service's free tier can still be played and shared.Warner said the \"first-of-its-kind partnership\" will open \"new frontiers\" in music creation while ensuring the creative community is compensated.\"Artists and songwriters will have full control over whether and how their names, images, likenesses, voices and compositions are used in new AI-generated music,\" said Warner. It did not say which artists had opted-in to the program.\"The deal also settles previous litigation between the companies,\" it added.Suno, along with another AI company offering a similar platform called Udio, were sued by music giants Warner, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. The lawsuit was announced in 2024 by the Recording Industry Association of America, which the BBC has contacted for comment.The labels accused Udio and Suno of profiting from copying existing songs, claiming the platforms produced tracks that were indistinguishable from work by real artists. The companies described the use of AI as \"wholesale theft\" and as part of a trend that threatened the music ecosystem.The legal battle came just months after some 200 artists including Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj signed a letter calling for the \"predatory\" use of AI in the music industry to be stopped.Supporters of generative AI works have compared machine learning by computers to the way humans learn by reading, hearing and seeing previous works.",

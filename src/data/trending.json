    "body": "8 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent, HelsinkiPA MediaYvette Cooper watched Finnish border agents demonstrate how they seize Russian boatsForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper has told the BBC the UK is ready to work with European allies to intercept sanction-busting oil tankers in Russia's shadow fleet.She was speaking on board a patrol ship in Helsinki harbour where she watched armed border agents rappel from a helicopter to show how they seize Russian vessels.Cooper promised more \"assertive action\" to \"tighten the chokehold\" on the shadow fleet with more \"disruption\" and \"enforcement measures\".Last week British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic which US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia.The foreign secretary told the BBC: \"We've already acted in support of US action, and you've seen the interdiction we've taken, we also stand ready to work with other countries and with other allies on the kind of enforcement action we need there.\"Cooper was briefed on the Turva offshore patrol vessel which two weeks ago detained a cargo vessel called the Fitburg suspected of damaging an undersea cable in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor.\"We're going to look at a wide range of ways in which to increase that pressure on the Russian shadow fleet,\" she said.\"We need to protect our undersea cables. We need to protect our critical national infrastructure and protect our environment from these often decrepit and dangerous vessels that are also fuelling the war in Ukraine, and that's why we'll take that stronger action. \"We're ready for much stronger enforcement, a much more assertive and robust approach, so that we don't have that navigation becoming sabotage instead.\"To date, no UK military personnel have boarded any vessels.PA MediaBBC News understands the government has identified a legal basis to allow the UK military to board and detain vessels in so-called shadow fleets.The Sanctions and Money Laundering Act, from 2018 can be used to approve the use of military force, ministers believe.Cooper said the shadow fleet was not just fuelling the war in Ukraine by allowing Russia to evade sanctions, but it was also a threat to UK national security. She told the BBC: \"I've been talking to our Finnish allies about the action that they're taking against the shadow fleet, but also the intensifying action that we all want to take together now we're determined to have a much more assertive approach to tighten that chokehold on the Russian shadow fleet.\"Cooper added that the government was also working internationally to pursue a maritime services ban.ReutersOil tanker Marinera was seized by the US Coast Guard last weekLast week, British armed forces supported the seizure of the Marinera which was stopped by the US Coast Guard as it travelled northwards through waters between Iceland and Scotland. The Russian-flagged oil tanker seized is accused of being part of a shadow fleet breaking US sanctions. But Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.Shadow fleets, or ghost fleets, are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil.Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries. The ships are often ageing tankers and use false flags to try and avoid detection.",

In a statement on Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said: \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet.\"Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to the chatbot over the images and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer warned X could lose the \"right to self regulate\" amid outrage over the AI images.Britain's media regulator, Ofcom, said on Monday that it would investigate whether X had failed to comply with UK law over the sexual images.",

    "body": "1 hour agoThe global tensions from Greenland to Iran feature prominently on Thursday's front pages. \"World on the brink\" is the Daily Mirror's headline as it reports that UK and US personnel were evacuated from their bases in the Middle East in anticipation of American strikes on Iran.Leading the Times' picture slot is a striking photo of a woman with a mock gunshot wound painted on her forehead during a rally in support of Iranian protests in Rome.  The paper features Trump saying that he has been informed on \"good authority\" that the killing of protesters in Iran has stopped.

    "body": "'Appropriate and unambiguous': White House defends Trump over middle-finger gesture at hecklerThe White House has defended US President Donald Trump after he aimed an offensive gesture at a heckler during his appearance at the Ford factory in Detroit on Tuesday.Footage of the incident published by TMZ appears to show Trump responding to a man who shouted at him from afar.The White House said: \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"The heckler has been suspended by Ford, the United Auto Workers union told the BBC's US partner, CBS News. Within 24 hours of the incident, two separate GoFundMe pages have raised nearly $700,000 (£521,000) for him from more than 27,000 donors. A Ford spokesperson told CBS: \"One of our core values is respect and we don't condone anyone saying anything inappropriate like that within our facilities. \"When that happens, we have a process to deal with it but we don't get into specific personnel matters.\"According to the subtitles provided by TMZ, the heckler called Trump a \"paedophile protector\". In the clip, which shows Trump from a distance, the president can be seen speaking back at the heckler, allegedly mouthing an expletive as well as using a middle-finger gesture.  A man who spoke to The Washington Post, named TJ Sabula, identified himself as the man who shouted. He said he had \"no regrets\" about what he did. Sabula reportedly said he his remarks referred to Trump's handling of the Epstein files. Trump has faced pressure for more transparency on what was uncovered by federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender.Trump signed a law that compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release all the files that it held on Epstein by 19 December, although only a fraction of the files have so far been made public.Trump was once friends with Epstein before they fell out, which Trump says was years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.United Automotive Workers (UAW), the union that represents Sabula, defended his actions, saying: \"He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"Trump was in Detroit on Tuesday to give a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. The president's public use of expletives have attracted headlines in the past - for example, when discussing the relationship between Iran and Israel last June.His predecessor Joe Biden also caused controversy for uttering an expletive during a conversation with a worker during his own visit to a factory in Detroit while on the campaign trail in 2020, before he was elected president.

    "body": "44 minutes agoTabby WilsonReutersUkraine has declared a state of emergency in the country's energy sector, with particular focus on Kyiv, as ongoing Russian strikes continue to leave thousands of residents without power. The nation is in the midst of a particularly cold winter, with overnight temperatures in Kyiv dropping to around -20C.After a special cabinet meeting, President Volodymyr Zelensky said a round-the-clock task force would be set up to deal with the damaging consequences of Russian airstrikes and worsening weather conditions. He accused Moscow of deliberately exploiting the harsh, sub-zero temperatures to target critical infrastructure, including energy distribution facilities.In recent weeks, Kyiv has been particularly affected by Russian attacks, leaving thousands of homes without regular power, heating or running water. After one particularly heavy night of missile and drone attacks last week, 70% of the capital was left without power for several hours.Zelensky said the new measures would include procuring vital energy equipment and resources from abroad to replace damaged installations. \"The First Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Energy of Ukraine has been assigned to oversee work supporting people and communities under these conditions,\" he wrote on X.He also ordered an increase in the number of emergency help points around Kyiv to provide heat and power for residents, a move which could see a relaxing of current midnight curfew in the capital.ReutersA government-run humanitarian aid point in KyivRussian attacks on energy infrastructure have not been limited to the capital.Last week, Ukrainian officials said that more than one million people in south-eastern Ukraine spent hours without heating and water supplies as a result of Russian air strikes. DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its CEO, Maxim Timchenko, told the BBC last month.As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and the company had found it difficult to cope.He added that the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".DTEK currently provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians.More from the BBC",

Maryam had been fatally shot - and they had no idea where the bullet had come from.Reza carried Maryam's body for an hour and a half. Exhausted, he sat down in an alley. After a short time, the door of a nearby house opened. The people who lived there took them into their garage, brought a white sheet and wrapped Maryam's body in it.Days before Maryam headed out to the protests, she had told her children - aged seven and 14 – about what was happening in their country. \"Sometimes parents go to the protests and don't come back,\" she said. \"My blood, and yours, is no more precious than anyone else's.\"Reza and Maryam's names have been changed for safety reasons.Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting via WANA via ReutersIranian state television has shown this burnt-out bus, saying it was filmed in Tehran on 10 JanuaryMaryam is one of thousands of protesters who should have returned home but never did, as the authorities responded to the rapid spread of demonstrations across Iran with a deadly crackdown.The US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has been able to confirm the killing of at least 2,400 protesters, including 12 children, during the past three weeks.It is extremely difficult to determine the death toll, which is expected to rise in the coming days, because the country remains under a near-total internet blackout imposed by Iranian authorities on Thursday night.  Human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is unable to report on the ground.Iranian authorities have not provided a death toll but local media have reported 100 security personnel have been killed, and protesters - whom they have portrayed as \"rioters and terrorists\" - have set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities.User generated contentKashani, Tehran, on 8 JanuaryDemonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers.Security forces soon launched a violent crackdown, with at least 34 protesters reported killed by 7 January, the 11th day of the unrest. However, it appears the bloodiest crackdown was last Thursday and Friday, when thousands of people took to the streets across the country and called for an end to the rule of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.BBC Persian has received dozens of accounts from inside Iran. Defiant despite potential repercussions, the witnesses said they wanted to ensure the rest of the world knew of the violence against the protesters.User generated contentA demonstration outside Hoze Elmiye religious institution, in Najaf Abad, on 8 January\"Our neighbourhood smells of blood - they killed so many,\" one told BBC Persian. Another recalled security forces \"mostly shooting at heads and faces\".The protests have spread across all 31 provinces. And the information trickling in clearly shows the scale of the killings in smaller cities and towns is just as severe as in major cities.In Tonekabon, a town of 50,000 people in the north, Sorena Golgun was killed on Friday. The 18-year-old university student was \"shot in the heart\" running from an ambush by security forces, according to a family member.Family of Sorena GolgunSorena Golgun's family say the 18-year-old university student was shot in his heart running from security forces in TonekabonLike Sorena, many of the other protesters killed were young and full of dreams. Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion-design student who hoped to study in Milan, was shot dead in Tehran on Thursday.Her mother spent about six hours travelling from their home, in the western city of Kermanshah, to collect Robina's body from Tehran. On her way back, she held her beloved daughter in her arms. But when she arrived, the security forces made her bury the body in a remote cemetery outside the city - with no other family or friends present.Not all those killed were protesters. Navid Salehi, a 24-year-old nurse in Kermanshah, was shot multiple times leaving work on Thursday.The bodies of many protesters were sent to the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre, in Tehran. The scenes there were so distressing Sahanand, who did not want to give his real name, decided to travel almost 1,000km to a border area so he could send out video footage by using the mobile data networks of neighbouring countries. On Saturday, Sahanand had seen more than 2,000 bodies lying on the ground, he said. Again, the BBC has no means to confirm this. However, in two newly emerged videos from Kahrizak, BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in one piece of footage and at least 178 bodies in the other. The two videos probably show some of the same bodies, so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.User generated contentKashani, Tehran, on 8 JanuaryOne young woman, speaking to BBC Persian on condition of anonymity, described last week's events as like \"a war\". The protesters remained \"more united than ever before\" but it was too much for her and this week she had fled the country - like many, gripped by fear the authorities will start a new wave of executions and prosecutions.\"I'm really afraid of what might happen to those who are still in Iran,\" she added.Additional reporting by Farzad Seifikaran and Hasan Solhjou",

    "body": "5 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondentCalifornia's top prosecutor has launched an investigation into the spread of sexualised AI deepfakes generated by Elon Musk's AI model Grok.Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement announcing the probe: \"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking.\"xAI, which develops Grok, has previously said \"anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content\". California's inquiry comes as British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer warns of possible action against X.In Wednesday's statement, Bonta said: \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet.\"The Democratic prosecutor urged xAI to take immediate action.California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, posted to X on Wednesday that xAI's decision to \"create and host a breeding ground for predators... is vile\".The BBC has contacted xAI for comment. On Wednesday, Musk posted to X that he is \"not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\"\"Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images,\" Musk wrote. \"It does so only according to user requests.\"The tech billionaire, a Republican mega-donor, has also said that critics of X were politically motivated and using the Grok controversy as an \"excuse for censorship\".In November, Wired magazine reported that tools from other AI companies like OpenAI and Google have also been used to digitally undress people.Last week, three US Democratic senators asked Apple and Google to remove X and Grok from their app stores.Within hours of the request, X restricted its image generation tool so that it would only be available to paying subscribers.X and Grok remain available on Apple's App Store and Google Play.It comes amid a debate over whether US tech companies are shielded from responsibility for what users post on AI platforms.Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 provides legal immunity to online platforms for user-generated content.But Prof James Grimmelmann of Cornell University argues this law \"only protects sites from liability for third-party content from users, not content the sites themselves produce\".Grimmelmann said xAI was trying to deflect blame for the imagery on to users, but expressed doubt this argument would hold up in court.\"This isn't a case where users are making the images themselves and then sharing them on X,\" he said. In this case \"xAI itself is making the images. That's outside of what Section 230 applies to\", he added.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon has argued that Section 230, which he co-authored, does not apply to AI-generated images. He said companies should be held fully responsible for such content.\"I'm glad to see states like California step up to investigate Elon Musk's horrific child sexual abuse material generator,\" Wyden told the BBC on Wednesday.Wyden is one of the three Democratic senators who asked Apple and Google to remove X and Grok from their app stores.The announcement of the probe in California comes as the UK is preparing legislation that would make it illegal to create non-consensual intimate images.The UK watchdog Ofcom has also launched an investigation into Grok.If it determines the platform has broken the law, it can issue fines of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18m, whichever is greater.On Monday, Sir Keir Starmer told Labour MPs that Musk's social media platform X could lose the \"right to self regulate\" adding that \"if X cannot control Grok, we will.\" ",

    "body": "32 minutes agoTinshui YeungTSGT Scott Reed, USAFAl-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle EastThe US and UK are reducing the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, as US President Donald Trump considers whether to take action against Iran over its crackdown on anti-government protests. Officials have told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\". The BBC understands some UK military personnel are also being removed. A Qatari government statement said the measures reportedly being taken by the US were \"in response to the current regional tensions\".The Foreign Office has also temporarily closed the British embassy in Tehran, which will now operate remotely, a government spokesperson said.The US embassy in Doha has advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to the Al-Udeid air base.According to rights groups, more than 2,400 anti-government demonstrators have been killed in the recent violent crackdown by the Iranian authorities.Regarding the removal of military personnel, the Qatari government said it would continue to \"implement all necessary measures to safeguard the security and safety of its citizens and residents as a top priority, including actions related to the protection of critical infrastructure and military facilities\".A UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson declined to comment on reports that UK personnel were being withdrawn \"due to operational security\".Al-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle East and about 10,000 personnel are based there, as well as about 100 UK staff. It is not clear how many will be leaving.Earlier this week, Trump warned the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if the authorities execute protesters. Iran has said it will retaliate if attacked by the US.On Wednesday, he said his administration had been told \"on good authority\" that \"the killing in Iran is stopping, and there's no plan for executions\". When questioned by a reporter, Trump said that these were \"very important sources on the other side\" and that he hoped the reports were true. The US president was also asked whether military action was now off the table, to which he replied: \"We're going to watch and see what the process is.\"The Reuters news agency, citing diplomats, reported that while some personnel had been told to leave the Al-Udeid air base, there was no immediate sign of large numbers of troops being bussed out like in the hours before an Iranian strike last year.Speaking to Fox News on Wednesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned Donald Trump to \"not repeat the same mistake that you did in June,\" adding: \"You know, if you try a failed experience, you will get the same result.\"As well as the temporary closure of the British embassy in Tehran, the US Mission to Saudi Arabia has advised its personnel and citizens to \"exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region\".Italy and Poland have published statements urging their citizens to leave Iran, while Germany has issued a notice to air operators recommending that flights do not enter Tehran, citing potential risk from \"escalating conflict and anti-aviation weaponry\".Iran's government has accused the US of seeking to \"manufacture a pretext for military intervention\", with the parliament speaker warning that if the US attacked, both Israeli and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets.The latest protests in Iran began at the end of December following the collapse of the currency and as the country deals with soaring living costs. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,403 protesters, as well as 12 children, despite an internet blackout. More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, the group also reported.Amnesty International said there were \"mass unlawful killings committed on an unprecedented scale\", citing \"verified videos and credible information from eyewitnesses in Iran\".The organisation urged UN member states to recognise the \"crimes committed by security forces\" in the protests.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editorThe Chancellor has declined to rule out extending support for hospitality businesses hit by rising business rates, beyond the help she has promised pub owners.Last week, the BBC reported that the Treasury was poised to announce further assistance for pubs which - like all hospitality businesses - are facing the end of Covid-era business rates relief in April.That scheme will end at the same time as sharp increases in the rateable value of their premises take effect.Earlier in the day Reeves had hinted she was resisting calls for more support for the rest of the hospitality sector and link.However, speaking at a press conference later the chancellor said she was \"working with the hospitality sector\".Treasury officials told the BBC that a package to specifically help pubs would be announced \"in the coming days\" but also declined to rule out additional relief for the wider sector.Opposition MPs and industry bodies have been pressing for any additional help to be extended to other businesses in the sector including hotels and restaurants.Speaking to the BBC, Rachel Reeves said: \"As that transitional relief comes to an end, although we've put in £4.3bn over the next three years, we need to make sure that we do that in a balanced way that particularly supports our pubs and the hospitality sector.\"The £4.3bn figure refers to the value of caps placed on rate rises in the next three years to smooth out increases that will eventually see rates bills for pubs rise 76% in three years, while hotels face rises of 115% over the same period.Kate Nicholls from the trade body Hospitality UK said she was encouraged that the door appeared to be open for non-pub businesses also facing steep rises in business rates.\"It's good to see recognition of wider hospitality and that she is talking about support beyond pubs,\" she said.Reeves told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday that she is \"particularly concerned\" about the impact of business rates on pubs, but hinted she was resisting calls for more support for the rest of the hospitality sector.Asked what support other smaller hospitality businesses would get, Reeves said: \"I think that people can see that the biggest impact and the biggest concern right now is around pubs.\"Some of the smallest businesses, particularly some cafes, don't pay any business rates at all because they're not big enough to do so.\"Businesses have warned they will struggle to pay higher rates, after Covid-era relief ends in April and sites are revalued.",

    "body": "Neil Robertson completed an unprecedented eighth 6-2 win in the first round of the Masters as he advanced past Chris Wakelin into the quarter-finals.Wu Yize started the sequence when he defeated defending champion Shaun Murphy on Sunday at Alexandra Palace.World number one Judd Trump progressed past Ding Junhui on Wednesday afternoon for the first round's seventh consecutive 6-2 scoreline - at odds of 44,000-1.But there was more to come, with Robertson completing a 6-2 clean sweep in the evening - and the odds of all eight opening-round matches finishing that way were 220,000-1.Remarkably, the odds of predicting the scores and also correctly naming all eight winners amounted to 20,000,000-1.No more than four first-round contests had previously ended 6-2 at any Masters tournament, but when two-time winner Robertson made superb back-to-back century breaks after the interval to establish a 4-2 advantage, a clean sweep appeared inevitable.Wakelin, making only his second appearance at the Masters, as a last-minute replacement for record eight-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, was unable to arrest the trend.\"I wasn't even thinking about winning the match - I was thinking just win it 6-2,\" joked Robertson on BBC Four. \"I didn't know if someone in the audience had maybe had a pound on all the matches being the same scoreline or something. It is amazing. I hope I have made someone a multi-millionaire. I have never seen anything like that before.\"Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry, added: \"It is phenomenal. You would normally at least three 6-5 scores because of the nature of the tournament. \"It has been incredible. After the interval players have really stepped up.\"Ken Doherty, who won the 1997 world title, echoed those comments, adding: \"I have never seen anything like this in snooker.\"Australia's Robertson, who knocked in superb breaks of 116, 135 and 102, will now face Kyren Wilson in the last on Friday (19:00 GMT).In truth, Trump's margin of victory over Ding was hardly surprising given he swept past the same player by the same score at the UK Championship in December.It was also Trump's fifth consecutive success against China's Ding, who won this title in 2011.And he did it in style, constructing three century breaks along the way.The Englishman crafted breaks of 116 and 69 as he raced into a 3-0 lead before Ding responded with runs of 98 and 53 to reduce his arrears to a solitary frame.However, Trump regained a two-frame cushion with a run of 88 and then compiled a wonderful 117 and 109 to confirm a meeting with Northern Ireland's Mark Allen in the last eight on Thursday at 19:00 GMT.\"I feel confident and have got to a few finals recently and it has taken some good players to stop me,\" Trump told BBC Sport.\"I am full of confidence and hopefully I can go one better this tournament. I have had a month off tournaments but still been putting the work in.\"\"I convinced myself my game would not be 6-2 and at 3-0 up I thought, 'at least I can't lose 6-2',\" said Trump.\"It's incredible really because all the players are so closely matched and to have every single game go that way is so surprising.\"Ding, who did not pot another ball after getting back to 3-2, admired Trump's ruthlessness and felt his own play made it all too easy for his opponent.\"I played a few terrible safety shots and let him win and have chances easier,\" Ding said.\"He was playing good and I wasn't at a good enough level to play against him. His standard is very high. He didn't miss much and it is very difficult to play him.\"",

    "body": "US launches phase two of Gaza peace plan with new technocratic government4 hours agoDavid GrittenandJon Donnison,JerusalemReutersPhase two of the peace plan should see reconstruction starting in Gaza after two years of warUS envoy Steve Witkoff has announced the start of phase two of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, with a technocratic Palestinian government established in the territory.Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Witkoff said phase two would also see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.\"The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations,\" he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"However, two key points of phase two could be problematic.Hamas has previously refused to give up its weapons without the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and Israel has not committed to fully withdrawing from Gaza.The ceasefire is also fragile at best, with both sides accusing each other of repeated violations. Almost 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.And humanitarian conditions in the territory remain dire, according to the UN, which has stressed the need for the unrestricted flow of critical supplies.In his statement, Witkoff declared that with the launch of phase two of Trump's 20-point peace plan on Wednesday, Gaza was \"moving from ceasefire to demilitarisation, technocratic governance, and reconstruction\".\"Phase Two establishes a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in Gaza, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), and begins the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel,\" he said.Following the announcement, regional mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey welcomed the formation of what they called the \"Palestinian Technocratic Committee to Administer the Gaza Strip\", saying it would contribute to \"efforts aimed at consolidating stability and improving the humanitarian situation\".They also revealed that the 15-member committee would be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy planning minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control.Gaza's transitional administration will operate under the supervision of a \"Board of Peace\", which will be chaired by Trump, according to the 20-point plan he unveiled three months ago.Announcements related to the board are expected in the coming days, including when the president visits the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, is set to be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza.Trump's plan says an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will also be deployed to Gaza to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces.Israel's prime minister told Ran Gvili's parents that his return was \"a top priority\"Earlier on Wednesday, Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said in a joint statement that they had agreed to support the efforts to form the technocratic Palestinian government \"while providing the appropriate environment\" for it to begin work.The PA - which is dominated by Fatah, Hamas's rival - also expressed support.Vice-President Hussein al-Sheikh said Trump's leadership urged all Palestinian factions, institutions and segments of society to \"ensure the success of this critical transitional phase\". He also stressed the importance of linking institutions in the West Bank and Gaza in order to uphold \"the principle of one system, one law, and one legitimate weapon\".According to Trump's plan, the PA will take over governing Gaza once it has completed reforms and can do so \"securely and effectively\".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had spoken on Wednesday evening with the parents of Ran Gvili, the last dead hostage in Gaza.He made it clear to Itzik and Talik Gvili that \"Ran's return is a top priority and that the declaratory move regarding the establishment of a technocratic committee will not affect the efforts to return Ran for a Jewish burial\", the office added.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum insisted: \"There is no phase 2 while Ran Gvili in Gaza. Phase Rani must come first.\"The Israeli government had accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the 24-year-old police officer's remains and said it will not reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt – one of its obligations under phase one - until they are handed over.Gvili was among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,430 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "10 hours agoMark Savage,music correspondentandLizo Mzimba,culture correspondent, High Court, LondonGetty ImagesThe Police, pictured on tour in Japan in 1981, from left to right: Andy Summers, Sting and Stewart Copeland Sting has paid his former bandmates in The Police more than half a million pounds after acknowledging underpaying royalties, court documents show.In a filing at London's High Court, the musician's lawyers said Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland received a payment of \"over $800,000\" (£595,000) after they launched legal proceedings last year.The pair sued Sting and his publishing company in September, claiming they were owed between $2m (£1.5m) and $10.75m (£8m) in royalties for hit songs like Roxanne and Every Breath You Take. At a hearing on Wednesday, their lawyers said their claim could rise above £8m.Sting denies that they are entitled to a portion of his income from streaming and download sales.His bandmates did not receive writing credits on most of The Police's hits, but argue that the group entered an \"oral agreement\" to share income in 1977, which was later formalised in written contracts.The agreement acknowledged that, although Sting was the chief composer, the other two members sometimes made crucial contributions - such as Summers' guitar line on Every Breath You Take.As a result, the trio decided that when any of them received publishing income for a song they had written, they would share a percentage of that money - usually 15% - with the other two members, in what was termed an arrangers' fee.Summers and Copeland argue he has withheld some of those payments. Getty ImagesThe trio famously have a fractious relationship, despite a reunion tour in 2008None of the band members were in court for the start of the two-day preliminary hearing on Wednesday.But lawyers for guitarist Summers and drummer Copeland are asking the court for permission to bring new and additional arguments that they are owed money from all downloads and streaming income, under the terms of their prior agreements made in 1997 and 2016.They say the language of those agreements should be interpreted in light of changes to the music industry, where streaming income has largely replaced the sale of vinyl, CDs and cassettes.In court papers, they acknowledged a recent payment from Sting and his publishing company, disclosing a figure of $870,000 (£647,000), but noted that no interest had been added to the \"historic underpayment\".Speaking in court on Wednesday, the musicians' lawyers said the total value of their claim was \"not less than £8m\" and \"will be considerably larger\" if their amended case is allowed to proceed.Meanwhile, Sting's lawyers argue that he shouldn't have to give his former bandmates royalties when The Police's music is played on streaming services like Spotify because that counts as \"public performance\" rather than a sale.Furthermore, they say Summers and Copeland are not eligible for royalties from streaming and digital sales because their 2016 agreement only allows for royalty payments derived \"from the manufacture of records\".They added that the musicians' attempt to amend their case should be thrown out as it has \"no real prospect of success\".The hearing, before Mr Justice Bright, is due to conclude on Thursday, with a trial expected at a later date.Success, collapse and reunionThe Police formed in 1977 and quickly became one of the UK's most successful bands.Their innovative fusion of rock guitars with reggae rhythms spawned chart-topping hits like Message in a Bottle, Walking on the Moon and Every Little Thing She Does is Magic.They earned a US number one single with Every Breath You Take, taken from their fifth album, Synchronicity, in 1983.It was later recognised as the most-played radio song of all time and was heavily sampled on P Diddy and Faith Evans' 1997 song I'll Be Missing You.However, The Police split up in 1984 amid personal and musical animosity.Copeland later told The Guardian that the members \"beat the crap out of each other\" during the \"very dark\" recording sessions for Synchronicity.They reformed in 2007 to open the Grammy Awards, before setting out on a lucrative world tour. Tickets for the British leg sold out in just 30 minutes, but the band dissolved again after the final date.In 2022, Sting sold the rights to his songwriting catalogue to Universal Music Group, with the deal covering both his solo hits and songs he penned for The Police.The deal was estimated to be worth $200m.",

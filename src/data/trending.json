On the agenda was a full-throated defence of the administration’s record, hailing a \"turnaround for the ages,” whilst playing down the Supreme Court's ruling against his signature tariff policy (with the judges themselves in the crowd).\nDespite the speech lasting nearly two hours,  there was little to suggest a change of course from Trump’s favourite taking points. He focused on the economy, immigration, the Democrats…. And the US men’s olympic hockey team.\nBut with growing voter dissatisfaction souring the polls, will Trump’s sales pitch be enough to counter sliding approval ratings and convince voters to stick with him for November's midterm election?\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporter Watch: Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle says he passed information onto policeThe Metropolitan Police has apologised to the Commons Speaker for \"inadvertently revealing information\" relating to Lord Mandelson's arrest on Monday.It comes after Sir Lindsay Hoyle confirmed he had passed on information to the force suggesting the peer could be a flight risk.Lord Mandelson's lawyers have complained about the Met's decision to detain him as part of its probe into misconduct in public office allegations.They say he had agreed to an interview next month, and the decision to take him into custody was prompted by a \"baseless\" suggestion he was planning to \"take up permanent residence abroad\".The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's lawyers were twice told by the police that information about his alleged travel plans had been passed on by Lord Forsyth, the Speaker of the House of Lords.On Tuesday evening, Lord Forsyth denied any involvement after he was initially reported as the source of the referral, calling the suggestion \"entirely false and without foundation\".On Wednesday, The Times then reported the information had in fact been shared by Sir Lindsay. Shortly afterwards, the Commons Speaker made a statement to MPs confirming he had given \"relevant\" information to the force.He told MPs he had done this \"in good faith\", considering it to be his \"duty and responsibility\". \"It is regrettable this rapidly ended in the media,\" he added.He did not provide any details, but the BBC understands Sir Lindsay passed on information he received in the British Virgin Islands during a visit last week that Lord Mandelson was planning to travel there.Senior officers from the Met met Sir Lindsay on Wednesday to explain the situation, which is regarded by the force as a serious breach of protocol.A spokesperson for the force said: \"The Met has apologised to the Speaker of the House of Commons this afternoon for inadvertently revealing information during an investigation into allegations of misconduct in public office.\"Lord Mandelson's lawyers Mishcon de Reya have written to the Met asking what information and evidence they based their decision to arrest their client on.The force is understood to have conducted its own assessment of the credibility of the information passed on by Sir Lindsay before deciding to arrest Lord Mandelson on Monday afternoon.The former Labour minister was taken to Wandsworth police station in London for interview, before later being released on bail pending further investigation. It is understood he surrendered his passport as one of his bail conditions.ReutersLord Mandelson pictured outside his home after police launched their investigation earlier this monthIt comes after the force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. Lawyers for the peer say he intends to co-operate with police to \"clear his name\". Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.

    "body": "4 hours agoPaulin KolaEPAMost of the victims were young and relatives are still struggling to comprehendThe Swiss government has announced an emergency payout of 50,000 francs ($65,000;  £48,000) for the victims of the deadly fire at the ski bar resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve.The so-called solidarity contribution will go to each of the 115 injured and the families of the 41 who died, the Federal Council said. Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire at Le Constellation bar began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foam that lined the ceiling of the bar's basement, which was packed with people.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and 58 people are still being treated in hospital for severe burns.The announcement of the payout was made by Swiss President Guy Parmelin and Finance Minister Beat Jans.They said the one-off sum would be in addition to the emergency aid of 10,000 francs offered by the regional government of the canton of Valais where Carns-Montana is situated and \"intended to offer rapid, un-bureaucratic assistance to those affected\". The federal government is also pledging to provide funding of up to 20m francs in addition to facilitating talks between the victims, officials and insurers to reach amicable compensation agreements, Jans said. \"The Federal Council shares with the victims and their families the desire for truth and justice,\" Parmelin told a press conference. \"We, too, want to know what happened, why, and how it could have been prevented.\"Local authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.The owners of the bar, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Criminal proceedings have also been brought against the municipality's head of public safety and a former council fire safety inspector.",

    "body": "10 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporterGetty ImagesEmperor Penguins are likely more at risk from climate change than any other air-breathing Antarctic animal Scientists have discovered that an annual event when Emperor penguins completely shed and regrow their feathers is putting the birds in peril as Antarctica is transformed by a warming world.Each year the birds must stay on platforms of floating ice for long enough to replace weather-beaten feathers with new, waterproof coats.But in 2022-24 Antarctic sea ice shrank significantly, largely down to climate change, depriving the birds of safe places to moult.Now scientists who track the animals using satellite pictures can no longer find most of the birds. They fear that thousands of penguins may have frozen in Antarctica's icy waters.\"This was really an \"oh my God\" moment,\" says the scientist behind the findings, Dr Peter Fretwell at British Antarctic Survey, who has worked on Emperor penguins for 20 years.\"You could see this was something game-changing for Emperor penguins. Suddenly you're thinking, well, have we got time to save them?\" he says. The research, published in the scientific journal Communications Earth & Environment, provides evidence about the impacts of the collapse in Antarctic summer sea ice in 2022-24 which the BBC reported on here.It is focussed on West Antarctica, home to 30-40% of the global population of Emperor penguins. The animals are amongst the most threatened in the world. They migrate thousands of kilometres to find stable sea ice during Antarctic summer to wait out what is called a \"catastrophic moult\" every year. VantorOn vast white sea ice, the blobs of brown are feathers left behind by penguins as they moultLittle else was known about the 30-40 day moult, until Fretwell spotted large brown smudges in satellite pictures from 2019-2025. They turned out to be mounds of feathers, left in an area called Marie Byrd Land.The penguins' feathers are \"the most complicated and best insulating of any animal\", he says. Over time they are damaged, so the penguins shed them annually.\"It's incredibly energy-intensive and the birds use up to 50% of their body mass,\" he says.VantorScientists identified extensive mounds of brown feathers in satellite picturesIt is \"probably the most dangerous time for adult Emperor penguins because they haven't got their waterproof suits on,\" he says. If they go into water, they are likely to die.In 2019, 2020 and 2021 the sea ice was relatively stable and significant feather mounds were visible. But in 2022 summer sea ice in much of Antarctica dramatically shrank, falling from an average of 2.8m sq km to a record low of 1.79m sq km in 2023.That trend continued until 2025, when there was a modest recovery in the sea ice in West Antarctica.Getty ImagesResearchers fear that most Emperor Penguins colonies could be wiped out by 2100But when Fretwell looked at the satellite pictures, he saw few signs of the birds. \"There should have been lots of penguins there, but actually we could only see 25 groups,\" he said. Groups vary in size from 10s to up to 1,000 birds.\"Again this year the sea ice hasn't been too bad, but I can only see a handful of penguins really,\" he says.He fears most have could died. Some may have travelled to another location in East Antarctica to moult, but this would have disrupted breeding, also leading to population losses.Longer term, the bird's best chance for survival is to adapt to moult on shallow ice shelves. Fretwell has seen some groups begin to do this, although it may come with a cost to the penguins' breeding and feeding patterns.Peter FretwellHe says the findings are a reminder that while the effects of global warming can be slow at times, there are moments of dramatic change.\"It wasn't just a few colonies that were lost and it wasn't a slow process,\" he says.\"It is the only piece of science I've ever done that's really emotionally got me,\" he says.Next he will compare his findings with an imminent population count of Emperor penguins in the Ross sea region where the birds migrate to and from. That will give more data about the possible numbers of deaths.He says the results could change predicted extinction dates for Emperor penguins.\"Now I'm asking, is that coming forwards towards us? Is it the end of the century?\" he asked.",

Their findings show that sperm motility - the ability of sperm to swim effectively - was consistently highest in June and July for both parts of the world.Understanding these seasonal patterns could improve fertility treatments, by optimising the timing of treatment and fertility testing to provide better guidance to couples trying to conceive.The study, published in the journal Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology, suggests that sperm's motility levels remain consistent across different climates, instead changing with the seasons.Levels were lowest in December and January, even though Florida remains warm all year round.But scientists found no changes in the total sperm concentration - the amount of sperm in someone's semen - or the ejaculate volume, how much semen is ejected during ejaculation, no matter the season.This means that while sperm's ability to move effectively does vary by season, the time of year doesn't impact the number of sperm produced.These findings suggest that seasonal patterns may affect male fertility more than just temperature differences alone.On average, the optimal temperature of the testes  - where sperm is stored - should be two to four degrees lower than the average body temperature of 37 degrees. Anything higher or lower than this can negatively affect sperm motility, therefore impacting fertility.The University of Manchester's Professor Allan Pacey, who co-authored the study, said: \"We were struck by how similar the seasonal pattern was in two completely different climates.\"Even in Florida, where temperatures stay warm, sperm motility still peaked in summer and dipped in winter, which tells us that ambient temperature alone is unlikely to explain these changes.\"He added: \"Our study highlights the importance of considering seasonality when evaluating semen quality. It also shows that seasonal variation in sperm motility occurs even in warm climates. These findings deepen our understanding of male reproductive health and may help improve fertility outcomes.\"Related stories",

    "body": "Man accused of driving wife to suicide claims she lied about abuse, jury told3 hours agoBeth CruseWest of EnglandPA MediaChristopher Trybus is charged with the manslaughter of his wifeA husband who is accused of driving his wife to suicide says she lied about being abused by him, a court has heard.Tarryn Baird was making \"demonstrably false allegations to health professionals\" about Christopher Trybus before her death in November 2017, his defence barrister said.Trybus, from Swindon in Wiltshire, faces charges of manslaughter, controlling and coercive behaviour and two charges of rape. He denies all charges.If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.Prosecutor Tom Little KC told the jury the defendant carried out a \"tsunami\" of abuse against Baird.But Katy Thorne KC, defending, later told the jury Trybus was \"never abusive to his wife\".\"This without question is a tragic case, a young woman has died and she took her own life and nothing you decide in this courtroom can alter the grief and loss of those who loved her,\" she said.Family handout Baird was 34 years old when she took her own life\"The defence position is he didn't beat her, he didn't break her, he didn't coerce her, control her and he didn't cause her death.\"On the contrary, he loved her and cherished her deeply and his case is that without anyone's knowledge, Tarryn Baird was making demonstrably false allegations to health professionals,\" she continued.Thorne told the jury Trybus's actions did not cause Baird's death.\"The defence case is that on a number of occasions Tarryn Baird made allegations of violence which were demonstrably false, for example, by reporting injuries to health professionals when Christopher Trybus was not even in the country.\"Health professionals were being told a false story and her boredom and troubled mind was leading her to make allegations to seek care and attention,\" she said.The jury also heard from Dr Tessa Jones who confirmed that she had seen Baird on multiple occasions and had more than 100 entries in her treatment notes.Baird had initially sought treatment in September 2015 for fainting episodes and cardiac concerns before she started to report suffering various injuries, the court heard.These included Baird stating that Trybus had sex with her \"against her will\" in October 2016, which is the basis of the first of the two rape counts.The court heard that Jones wrote in her notes that Baird had told her \"he put his hands around her throat, he started to strangle her\".Baird then managed to hit Trybus with a free hand but he proceeded to \"have sex against her will\" and \"during the altercation he also hit her around the head several times with an object, Tarryn thinks it's her phone\".The court heard the GP continued to state that Baird \"doesn't think she will ever be able to escape the situation, has suicidal thoughts\".The trial continues.More from Wiltshire",

However, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court convicted him following an eight-day trial earlier this month.Sentencing, Mr Justice Akhlaq Choudhury told Skebas, who showed little emotion, that it was a \"shocking and horrific act of violence\" and added: \"You did the unthinkable.\"Lincolnshire PoliceDeividas Skebas has been jailed for the murder of Boston schoolgirl Lilia ValutyteChoudhury added: \"You headed straight towards her, pulled out the knife and as soon as you approached the unsuspecting Lilia, you plunged the knife into her heart.\"He said the CCTV from before the incident showed Lilia as a \"carefree, happy girl\" who \"should have been safe\". He added: \"How could anyone imagine that within seconds she would be stabbed by a complete stranger and left to die?\"Yours was a shocking and horrific act of violence.\"Nothing I can do or say today can relieve the pain of losing Lilia.\"Skebas, who appeared via videolink from Rampton Hospital in Nottinghamshire, was told he would remain at the psychiatric facility.However, the judge said if at any point Skebas was deemed well enough to be discharged he would be sent to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence.During the trial, the jury heard Lilia had been playing in Fountain Lane.Skebas, formerly of Thorold Street, Boston, ran towards Lilia and stabbed her once in the chest.Her mother, Lina Savicke, told the court Lilia called her name and after she rushed outside the girl collapsed into her arms.Despite the efforts of an off-duty police officer, doctors and paramedics, Lilia died within an hour of being attacked.Lina SavickeLilia died from a single stab wound to her heartJurors heard Lithuania national Skebas had a history of mental health issues and told police after his arrest he was being controlled by a microchip.Three psychiatrists who assessed Skebas agreed he had schizophrenia and was showing symptoms of psychosis on the day he killed Lilia.Andrew Campbell-Tiech KC, representing Skebas, told the court on Wednesday that his client had been \"subject to a serious and dangerous condition for many years\".He invited the court to \"realise the defendant is likely to spend much of the rest of his life contained and confined\".Campbell-Tiech added there was \"no need further to stigmatise the appalling act that he [Skebas] performed in the midst of a mental health crisis\".Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan KC argued his mental illness did not stop him planning a deliberate murder, calling it a \"wicked act\".PA MediaDeividas Skebas stabbed Lilia Valutyte outside the shop where her mother workedAfter the sentencing hearing, Lilia's family issued a statement.It read: \"This decision will not change our lives.\"Nothing will bring our child back, the pain will not disappear, and the tears shed will not wash it away.\"From the bottom of our hearts, we thank those who were not afraid to stand by us and support our family during the hardest time.\"No matter how strong we may appear, there are moments when all we need is to know that we are needed and not alone.

    "body": "Spain declassifies files on 1981 attempted coup in effort to dispel conspiracy theories56 minutes agoGuy Hedgecoe,BBC Madrid correspondentandRobert Greenall,BBC NewsGetty ImagesCoup leader Antonio Tejero Molina died on the very same day as the files were declassified.Spain's government has released dozens of documents related to an attempted coup that took place 45 years ago - regarded as a key moment in the country's history.A group of armed officers burst into parliament and threatened MPs, aiming to overthrow the country's fledgling democracy and return it to dictatorship. Their efforts failed when King Juan Carlos refused to support them. However, conspiracy theories have abounded since, including that the king may have had prior knowledge of the coup or even that he may have been actively involved. The release of the files also came on the same day as the death of the coup's leader, Antonio Tejero Molina, at the age of 93. Tejero's lawyer described him as a \"man of honour, unwavering faith, and great love for Spain\".\"May God grant him the peace that men denied him,\" he wrote on X on behalf of his family.On 23 February 1981, a group of officers led by Tejero burst into the main chamber of the national parliament, wielding guns and threatening the politicians as a new government was being sworn in. Their aim was to return authoritarianism - six years after the death of the country's dictator Francisco Franco.A photo of Tejero brandishing a handgun in the parliament as MPs take cover is perhaps the most famous image of the coup.Getty ImagesKing Juan Carlos ascended the throne two days after the death of Gen Francisco FrancoThe release of the 153 classified files generated enormous expectation - so much so that the government web page where the documents were to be posted collapsed temporarily. They include police and judicial reports, transcriptions of conversations between officials, and the reactions of foreign governments to the events.But the files themselves appear to contain no explosive revelations. Franco - Spain's brutal dictator - died in 1975, paving the way for the introduction of a parliamentary monarchy.Six years later, Spain's fragile democracy appeared to hang in the balance for several hours as the coup attempt took place. Eventually, it failed, after the young king addressed Spaniards - and the armed forces - via a televised message, expressing his opposition to the rebels and ordering all military to remain in their barracks.For many Spaniards, the episode sealed Juan Carlos's status as the saviour of their young democracy and the country's rejection of Francoist values.However, in the decades since, many have cast doubt over the supposedly heroic role of the king. Other theories claimed the uprising was a set-up by the political establishment aimed at providing a test that would reinforce the country's democracy.The current, Socialist-led government of Pedro Sánchez said having documents related to this event under lock and key was an \"historical anomaly\" that needed to be corrected and that their release posed no risk to anyone. It also said their declassification would serve to undermine those peddling false theories about the coup.However, there were some interesting revelations in the files, including that six members of the intelligence services were involved in the plot. Another document showed the security forces estimated that, if a police special unit attempted to break into the parliament building, it might lead to \"between 80 and 110 deaths\".Among the documents were also messages of support from foreign governments once the coup had failed. A message in Spanish from Queen Elizabeth II to King Juan Carlos read: \"All of us in Great Britain are reassured to know the final result.\"",

    "body": "UK government denies Chagos Islands deal is paused, despite minister's comment4 hours agoJoshua Nevett,Political reporterandDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos dealThe government has said there is \"no pause\" in its Chagos Islands deal despite a minister earlier telling MPs that the UK was \"pausing\" the process of passing the legislation to transfer control of the territory to Mauritius.A government source said \"there is no pause, we have never set a deadline and timings will be announced in the usual way\".Foreign Office Minister Hamish Falconer was answering questions from MPs when he said the UK was \"pausing\" the process while \"discussions\" happened with the United States.The move comes after US President Donald Trump urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to scrap the deal last week, despite earlier expressing support for the treaty.The Chagos Islands - officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory - are located in the Indian Ocean and Britain has controlled them since the early 19th century.The deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the territory to Mauritius, and pay an average cost of £101m a year to lease back a joint UK-US military base on the largest island.The UK is in the process of passing legislation to ratify the deal and on Wednesday, Falconer faced questions about that in the House of Commons.\"There was support from the US administration for this treaty, which has not changed,\" Falconer said.\"There clearly has been a statement from the president of the United States more recently, which is very significant. \"And as I told the house [of Commons] we are now discussing those concerns with the United States directly. We have a process going through Parliament in relation to the treaty.\"We will bring that back to Parliament at the appropriate time. We are pausing for discussions with our American counterparts.\"In earlier comments in the Commons, Falconer said the deal was going \"through Parliament in the normal way\".\"We are pausing in discussions with the United States,\" Falconer said. \"And those discussions continue.\"Earlier, the prime minister's spokesperson told reporters the UK's position had not changed and the focus was on \"discussions with the US on next steps\".Mauritius's Attorney General Gavin Glover said he was not surprised by the minister's comments.\"There has been no discussion on the legislative process for the last three weeks,\" Glover.\"I note that it says a pause from the legislative process and not a backing off. \"I am in close contact with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\"The deal has been thrown into doubt by President Trump, who last week posted on his Truth Social platform to urge Sir Keir to not \"give away Diego Garcia\", home to the UK-US military base.Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and called the deal \"a blight on our great ally\".The comments came despite the US Department of State giving its official backing to the UK government's plan a day earlier.The US State Department said it had nothing to add, following Falconer's comments in the Commons.Legislation delayedThe Diego Garcia Military Base and British Indian Ocean Territory Bill is designed to enshrine the Chagos Islands agreement into UK law.It is in the final stages of its passage through Parliament and is currently in the House of Lords.A debate on the bill was pulled in January after the Conservatives - who have long opposed the deal - tabled an amendment calling for a pause \"in light of the changing geopolitical circumstances\".The bill has not been on the order paper in the Lords since then and no date has been set for the next stage.Last week, Politico reported that the legislation would be delayed but Justice Minister Alex Davies-Jones said it would return to the Lords \"as soon as parliamentary time allows\".Opposition pressureBritain has controlled the Chagos Islands since 1814 and evicted its inhabitants in the 1960s to make way for the military base on Diego Garcia.The islands became formally established as an overseas territory in 1965, after the British government paid Mauritius a £3m grant to retain the archipelago.Last year, the UK government agreed to hand over control of the islands to Mauritius, arguing the future of the military base had been threatened by recent international court decisions.Under the deal, the UK has agreed to pay £101m annually for 99 years to keep control of the UK-US military base.Many Chagossians see the deal as a betrayal and want to see the UK retain sovereignty over the islands so they can one day return to their homeland.The Conservatives and Reform UK are staunchly opposed to the deal as well.MPs from those parties have been travelling to Washington to lobby American politicians, in a campaign aimed building opposition to the agreement in the US.Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Reform UK MP Nigel Farage said there was \"no basis, historically, culturally, in any way, for Mauritius to have a claim on those islands\".He said the region could \"finish up with a turf war going on between India and China in the region\".Farage claimed the Maldives were about to issue a counter-claim to the International Court of Justice over the Chagos Islands in \"just a few days\".\"If anybody has the right to the sovereignty of those islands, it is the Maldives and not Mauritius,\" Farage said. \"And I would urge you to pause all of this.\"Shadow foreign minister Wendy Morton said the Chagos deal would leave Britain \"weaker, poorer and less safe\". \"This is not a legal necessity,\" Morton said. \"It's a political choice made by a floundering prime minister and it's British taxpayers who are left to pay the price.\"",

    "body": "The warmer southerly wind is also helping draw up a plume of Saharan dust to the UK which could bring some dramatic, fiery sunsets and sunrises.The dust from the Sahara has been picked up high into the atmosphere and is carried thousands of miles before gradually filtering down toward the surface.As the fine particles scatter sunlight, they can enhance reds and oranges at dawn and dusk when conditions are right. If the dust also combines with spells of rain, it can lead to what is often referred to as \"blood rain\", leaving behind a thin, dirty residue on cars, windows and outdoor surfaces.While it can appear dramatic, this is a relatively common and entirely natural seasonal event in the UK. Episodes of Saharan dust transport occur several times a year, most often in late winter and spring, when southerly winds draw warm air northwards from north Africa towards the UK.Look out for some particularly intense colours at dusk later on Wednesday, possibly extending into Thursday and Friday.Dust concentrations are expected to be highest over southern England.",

    "body": "10 hours agoEleanor LawsonWest MidlandsGetty ImagesAston Martin's net losses jumped 52% in 2025 to £493.2mAston Martin has confirmed it will be axing 20% of its workforce, with the firm's net losses jumping 52% last year to £493.2m. The luxury car firm, synonymous with James Bond, has struggled for several years and blamed US president Donald Trump's tariffs in a statement made last month.Aston Martin, which has its headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire, employs about 3,000 people, meaning job losses will total around 600.The firm said the job cuts should deliver annual savings of around £40m and did not specify when the job cuts would be implemented, but said most of the savings would be made this year.A spokesperson for Aston Martin said US tariffs had been \"extremely disruptive\" and demand had also been \"extremely subdued\" in China, the world's biggest auto market.It has also trimmed its five-year capital spending plan to £1.7bn from £2bn by delaying investment in electric vehicle technology.Aston Martin said: \"Having undertaken at the start of 2025 a process to make organisational adjustments to ensure the business was appropriately resourced for its future plans, we had to take the difficult decision at the end of 2025 to implement further changes.\"This latest programme will ultimately see the departure of up to 20% of our valued workforce.\"It is understood the majority of cuts will impact the UK, where the bulk of Aston Martin's workers are based, with roles across the business being impacted, including factory staff.The company also has a UK site in St Athan, south Wales, as well as worldwide offices and dealerships.More on this storyRelated internet links",

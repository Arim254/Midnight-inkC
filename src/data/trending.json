    "body": "59 minutes agoEmma SimpsonBusiness correspondentBBCRain drifts across the car park of Crawley's sprawling Asda, but the gloom does little to slow the steady stream of shoppers this midweek afternoon. Parents hurry past with school bags and groceries; car boots slam shut as people load up their weekly shops.For Carol Stimpson, who grew up in the area, the Asda is only a ten‑minute walk from her home, and she pops in most days. \"It's my corner shop,\" she says.Joanne Dench, another local, is also shopping in Crawley, and says she visits the town's Asda for its variety. \"They've got a good range of stuff — clothes, all sorts of things... And they have lots of international food, which is lovely because I like trying new things.\"But despite the bustle in this West Sussex Asda, the chain has been losing ground to rivals at an alarming rate.Joanne Dench, shopping in the centre of Crawley, says she enjoys Asda's rangeThe UK's third biggest supermarket had a dreadful Christmas. Two sets of industry data show Asda suffered a big slump in sales while all its main rivals reported an increase.Asda's sales decreased by 4.2%, during the 12 weeks to 28 December 2025, according to Worldpanel — and that's off the back of a terrible Christmas the year before.\"A mess\" is how William Woods, a food retail analyst from Bernstein Research, describes Asda's situation.The industry data suggests that despite Asda embarking on a turnaround and cutting prices, shoppers are still turning away. Asda's hope is that with time the plan will work out, but the question others are asking is whether this 60-year-old retailer is really able to turn things around?A controversial dealFor decades, Asda had the reputation as Britain's cheapest grocer, a slightly cheeky northern-based business loved by families for its \"everyday low prices.\"A generation grew up with its \"That's Asda Price\" TV commercial, first featured in an advert for the supermarket in 1977, showing shoppers tapping their back pockets signalling they'd saved money at the tills.The business was sold to the US retail giant Walmart in 1999, in what was then the largest foreign takeover in the UK retail sector.But from about 2010, Asda struggled to fend off the growing threat from Aldi and Lidl as Walmart's global priorities focused on its businesses in the US and elsewhere.In 2021 it sold the chain. In the four years leading up to the transaction, Asda paid just over £4bn to Walmart through a series of dividend payments.Asda was bought by two billionaire brothers from Blackburn and the private equity firm TDR Capital for £6.8bn.Mohsin and Zuber Issa made their fortune by building a petrol forecourt empire, EG Group. They were hailed as self-made entrepreneurs who would inject fresh thinking.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAsda's sales decreased by 4.2%, during the 12 weeks to 28 December 2025, according to WorldpanelBut the sale was financed by adding billions of pounds worth of debt onto Asda's business — one of the UK's biggest debt-funded takeovers in recent history.It was a controversial deal inked at the end of a Covid boom in groceries, when people were spending much more time at home and less money eating out. But the market soon changed. The war in Ukraine triggered a huge rise in inflation and a new era of rising interest rates, pushing up the cost of Asda's borrowings.Asda's market shareFollowing the takeover, Asda's CEO left, and Mohsin Issa took over the reins.\"His instincts were good, but it needed an experienced figure to guide the business through the very choppy waters,\" says one former Asda executive.The problems grew, compounded by high management turnover and shifting priorities.Store standards fell after cuts in staff hours and shoppers complained about empty shelves, slow restocking, and poor online availability.Lynette from Swindon first started shopping at Asda more than 20 years ago, but says it began to go \"downhill\" really quickly — \"you could see it in the supermarket, half the tills were closed, shelves were empty.\"Once a loyal Asda shopper, she has within the last few years begun using the discounters, Aldi and Lidl for her main shopping.EG GroupFollowing the takeover, Mohsin Issa took over the reinsBehind-the-scenes, Asda was also working through a huge tech overhaul as it moved away from the systems it used under Walmart.This included installing close to 16,500 new checkouts and launching a new groceries app and website — costing hundreds of millions of pounds.By autumn 2024, Mohsin Issa had stood down from his role. TDR also took majority ownership of the business, putting them in the driving seat.Asda's market share stood at 14.3% just before the takeover, according to Worldpanel, at the end of December 2025, it had fallen to 11.4%.Comparing this to the value of the grocery market overall, you end up with a business that is £4.5bn smaller in terms of annual revenue, at today's prices, than it would have been if Asda had maintained this share, according to Worldpanel sales analysis.Grocers have high fixed costs and slim profit margins. If you can grow the amount of stuff you sell, your profits can increase quickly, but the reverse can happen if your volumes decline (you sell fewer products in total) — leading to \"a negative spiral which is really, really difficult to get out of,\" says Bernstein's William Woods.The revival of AsdaAsda is now in the midst of a turnaround plan.But, judging by the industry data, there's been little sign of traction. The question is, does it simply need more time, or will it be unable to win customers back?The company has brought in the man who helped rescue Asda from the brink of collapse some thirty years earlier, to revive its fortunes.Allan Leighton was appointed executive chair in November 2024, then aged 71. His big plan? The revival of Asda Rollback, the price campaign which he deployed, successfully, in the '90s.Getty ImagesAllan Leighton was appointed executive chair in November 2024\"Rollbacks\" are temporary price reductions. This time round, after the Rollback ends, the products are then moved to a new \"Asda Price\" which are \"guaranteed\" to be lower than the original pre-Rollback price.Leighton said his aim was to make Asda 5-10% cheaper than other traditional supermarkets by the end of 2026, and he was prepared to take a big hit on profits, in the short term, to achieve it.One year on from its launch, Asda's pricing has improved. Data provided to the BBC by retail research firm Assosia shows that Asda's prices on more than 30 branded items were mostly cheaper than Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons based on promotional deals over the festive quarter.The retailer has also regularly come top of a closely watched weekly price survey run by The Grocer magazine. It doesn't include Aldi and Lidl.\"At times in the last year, Asda has certainly been 5% cheaper than all its established rivals,\" says Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of The Grocer.The trouble is, the price cuts don't appear to have made any difference.\"For shoppers, it's not just about price,\" says Leyland. Customer service, in-store experience and range is also important as well as perception about \"value\" and brand appeal.That sentiment is echoed by Madeline in Crawley. She says she avoids doing her weekly shop at the town's Asda.\"A lot of the shelves are quite empty, and there are always trolleys in the aisles when they're filling up shelves. Sometimes you can't get to where you want to be — it puts you off.\"One key supplier I spoke to said Asda needed to strike a better balance by investing more in stores and availability, and getting a grip on \"the basic fundamentals of retailing\".Asda has put more staff in stores and insists it is making progress.But once you've lost shoppers, it's very hard to win them back, especially when many of your rivals are firing on all cylinders, helped by price matching and loyalty schemes, in an intensely competitive market.William Woods believes Asda should have stuck to its year-long Aldi and Lidl price match campaign, which ended in January 2025. He says price matching has been a \"great psychological mechanism\" for Tesco and Sainsbury's to change customer perception and fight the discounters.Their respective loyalty price schemes, Clubcard and Nectar, also create a \"wow\" factor at the till, Woods says.Asda points out that rebuilding the business is a three to five year journey.\"We are in the early stages of our transformation,\" a spokesperson said. \"This is anchored in offering an unmatched value proposition, making sure products are always available and ensuring customers have the best possible experience when visiting our stores or shopping online.\"This approach is beginning to be reflected in stronger volumes over recent periods.\"One person familiar with the situation said there had been signs of a recovery last summer, but that coincided with the final stage of Asda's separation from Walmart's systems. This caused disruption, leading to empty shelves in the all important run up to Christmas trading, a \"nightmare\" putting the turnaround six months behind schedule, they said.\"It's annoying, disappointing, but we had to get out of the Walmart system,\".Does Asda have the firepower?In December, Asda registered its 22nd consecutive month of decline, according to Worldpanel sales data.Many in the industry are wondering if it has the necessary firepower to regain all the lost ground. Even if it can fix the basics, will Asda's high levels of debt prevent a full recovery?It sold off a raft of stores and a distribution centre – and then rented them back – to help reduce its borrowings. At the end of December 2024, its net debt stood at £3.8bn, whilst the annual financing costs, including debt interest payments, increased 38% to £611m.\"It's an amazing brand….  but sadly, I believe the business is totally broken,\" the former Asda executive believes.\"Whoever the owner is, I just don't think the business can stomach, or the balance sheet can't stomach, the level of investment that is required. The lack of investment goes back 10-15 years,\" they claimed.Getty ImagesIn December, Asda registered its 22nd consecutive month of decline, according to Worldpanel sales dataAn Asda spokesperson said its \"strong balance sheet and underlying free cash flow generation\" means it can comfortably cover current and future debt obligations.Like Asda, Morrisons has also been struggling under new private equity owners and has been selling assets to reduce its debt pile. It has lost all important market share and the number four spot to Aldi but its performance has recently stabilised.According to the major supplier, both businesses are in a race to get out of the debt burden, which is holding them back.\"I would love for them [Asda] to get back to where they were. Whether it's feasible is another question...\" the supplier says.Ged Futter spent fifteen years working as a buyer for Asda. He now runs a business training suppliers on how to negotiate with supermarkets and fears his former employer is in \"real trouble\".\"I was with a client today who said Asda was asking for this investment for promotions. The client said I'm walking away. What they asked for is too much. I'm backing another horse.\"2026: Make or breakThis year there's also been a further fall in the price of Asda's traded debt — a sign that investors are getting more nervous about the viability of the turnaround.The person familiar with the workings of Asda says they believe it has a compelling offer with its in store pharmacies and opticians, as well as the George clothing brand and a general merchandise business that is healthy.The view among many observers I've spoken to is that some form of consolidation in the sector seems, at some point,  inevitable — whether that means supermarkets breaking up, being sold, or merging.Allan Leighton has compared his task to climbing Mount Everest. Certainly, winning back customers will be no mean feat.Swindon local Lynette says: \"I don't think I will ever go back to shopping at Asda again, I might pick up the odd thing there, but they've lost me as a loyal customer.\"Asda badly needs some momentum, and 2026 feels make or break for the turnaround.Top image credit: Getty ImagesMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "1 hour agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesCynthia Erivo, Sabrina Carpenter and Lady Gaga all have multiple Grammy nominations this yearAt the ripe old age of 67, the Grammy Awards are still considered \"music's biggest night\". This year's ceremony takes place in LA on Sunday, with everyone from Harry Styles to Chaka Khan due to attend.Kendrick Lamar tops the nominations with nine nods, most of them for his sixth album, GNX. He was the main winner at last year's ceremony, too, winning both record and song of the year for his scorching diss track, Not Like Us.Other contenders include Lady Gaga, with seven nominations, along with Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter and Leon Thomas, who have six each.In total, there are 95 awards, distributed over a mind-boggling eight hours. Alongside banner categories like album of the year, we'll find out who had the best album artwork, and who's made the best \"ambient, new age or chant\" album.Here's everything you need to know ahead of the ceremony.1) Who's going to win album of the year?Getty ImagesBad Bunny could be the first person to win the night's main prize with an album sung entirely in SpanishMost insiders agree that there's a three-way race for the night's biggest prize - with Bad Bunny, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga the presumed favourites.None of them have ever won before, despite multiple nominations, and there are good reasons to think they're the front-runners.Gaga is a Grammy darling, with 14 wins from 45 nominations. Her seventh album, Mayhem, is a triumphant return to the maximalist pop that made her famous, delivered with the hard-won grace of someone who's endured 18 years in the pop machine. Like Beyoncé last year, voters might feel she's put in the work to earn the top title.Lamar is in a similar position. He's the only artist with album of the year nominations for five consecutive releases, and GNX is a snappy, crowd-pleasing tour de force.Giving him the prize would also go some way to correcting the Grammys' rap problem. The last time a hip-hop album won album of the year was in 2004.But Bad Bunny is the presumptive front-runner. The Puerto Rican star's musically ambitious Debí Tirar Más Fotos, fuses live instrumentation with the hip-swaying pulse of reggaeton, plena, salsa and a multitude of other Latin styles.A win for Bad Bunny would mark the first win for a Spanish language album.That said, the Grammys have a habit of making spectacularly weird decisions, so don't discount the chances of Justin Bieber or Sabrina Carpenter lifting the trophy.Notably, no matter who wins album of the year, it will be their first victory in the category.2) Will there be justice for Milli Vanilli?!Getty ImagesRob Pilatus (left) and Fab Morvan won best new artist in 1990 - but they didn't get to keep the trophies for longPop duo Milli Vanilli were stripped of their Grammy Award for best new artist in 1990, when it was discovered that the members, Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus, had been miming to someone else's vocals.Thirty-six years later, Morvan is nominated for best audiobook for his memoir You Know It's True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli.It's an eye-opening and harrowing story that lays bare what fame demands of you, and how Morvan struggled to rebuild his life after becoming one of music's biggest punchlines.If he wins, it could be an emotional moment of redemption.3) Can Olivia Dean win best new artist?Olivia Dean was one of the biggest break-out stars of last yearThe British star is certainly a front-runner. Her joyful, old-school pop songs were deservedly massive last year, pairing classic songcraft with an unabashedly romantic outlook.Her album, The Art Of Loving, had a golden streak in December, just as voters were filling in their ballots, boosting her odds of victory.It came out too late to be shortlisted for album of the year, though. She'll have to wait 12 months for that one.Dean faces strong competition from fellow Brit Lola Young, whose cathartically confrontational single Messy was a breakout hit last year.R&B artist Leon Thomas could also sneak off with the trophy. A former writer for Ariana Grande, SZA and Post Malone, he's the only best new artist nominee to pick up an album of the year nod, which suggests he's popular with voters.The rest of the pack includes influencer-turned-pop star Addison Rae, influencer-turned-pop star Alex Warren, frenetic girl group Katseye, chiselled rock star Sombr and LA indie outfit The Marías.For the second year in a row, all eight new artist nominees will perform during a special segment on Sunday night.4) What about the other big prizes?Getty ImagesAfter performing at last year's Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar and SZA are hot favourites to win record of the year for their loved-up duet, LutherOne of the year's most fiercely-contested categories is record of the year - better understood as \"best single\".That's where you'll find Sabrina Carpenter's Manchild butting heads with Lady Gaga's Abracadabra and Chappell Roan's The Subway.But none of them really captured the public imagination in the same way as Rosé and Bruno Mars's APT. A honking great crossover hit, it has exactly the sort of cross-generational appeal the Grammys loves.The only serious competition is Kendrick and SZA's Luther, a sumptuous rap ballad that spent 13 weeks at number one in America last year.If APT wins, it'll be a record-breaker twice over. Rosé will become the first K-pop artist to win a Grammy; and Mars will become the only artist to win record of the year four times. (Right now, he's tied with Paul Simon on three.)The song of the year award - which recognises the songwriters - has almost exactly the same shortlist, with the addition of Golden, from the movie K-Pop Demon Hunters.The prominent use of samples and interpolations in Luther and APT could put them at a disadvantage here; which is good news for Carpenter's Manchild - whose country-pop hybrid appeals to a broad cross-section of voters.Bad Bunny could also win here for DTMF (I should have taken more photos), a gorgeous rumination on the passage of time that segues into a lively celebration of life.5) Is there a list of Grammy performers?Getty ImagesJustin Bieber will take to the stage ahead of his headline slot at this year's Coachella Music FestivalHeck, yeah. And what a list...Justin BieberSabrina CarpenterClipse & Pharrell WilliamsOlivia DeanKatseyeLady GagaLauryn Hill (Tribute to D'Angelo & Roberta Flack)Reba McIntyre with Brandy Clark and Luka NelsonThe MaríasBruno MarsPost Malone, Slash, Chad Smith (Tribute to Ozzy Osbourne)Addison RaeRoséSombrTyler, The CreatorLeon ThomasAlex WarrenLola Young6) Will Taylor Swift be performing?ReutersTaylor Swift's Life Of A Showgirl album was released after the eligibility period for this year's Grammy AwardsNot on your nelly.Rumours that Taylor Swift would turn up and tinkle the ivories were shot down by Grammy producer Ben Winston.Asked about the speculation by the showbiz website Hits Daily Double, he pointed out that the source of the story was... er, the showbiz website Hits Daily Double.\"The only reason people think Taylor might be performing or coming is because Hits decided to print it this week and it was picked up globally,\" he said.\"But Hits just totally made that up. And now I am getting asked about it by you, as if it's a real thing, when it was made up in your office!\"Also not performing: Bad Bunny. His gig headlining the Super Bowl half time show next month means he's unable to take the stage at the Grammys.7) Is it finally time for a K-pop Grammy?Getty ImagesRosé could be the first K-Pop star to win a Grammy on SundayRight now, no K-pop artist has ever won a Grammy - although BTS have received multiple nominations and even performed at the ceremony.That could change on Sunday. Rosé, one quarter of the South Korean girl group Blackpink, is nominated for three awards for APT, her irresistible, cheerleader chanting duet with Bruno Mars. In the song of the year, she goes head-to-head with the fictional girl group Huntr/x, who appear in the hit animation K-Pop Demon Hunters.And Katseye, a global girl group trained under the arduous K-pop system, are also up for best group and best pop group performance, for their single Gabriela.They might not win, but there's a growing recognition that K-pop has become a cultural and commercial force. For Audrey Nuna, one of the singers behind Huntr/x, getting to perform at the show represents a huge step forward.\"You're going to see three Korean faces,\" she told E! News. \"To think about the kids who are going to see that, and hopefully for that to shape their understanding of what they can do in this world, is the stuff that is giving me chills up my spine.\"In an interview earlier this week, the Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, confirmed there was a \"groundswell\" amongst voters for a separate K-pop category. Could it be created just in time for BTS's comeback? Watch this space.8) Any other notable nominees and surprises?EPAThe Dalai Lama is up for his first ever GrammyBarbra Streisand could correct a historic wrong on Sunday night. Her duets album, The Secret of Life, is nominated for best traditional pop album - a category she has lost 13 times since it was introduced in 1992.Her chances look slim, though, with stronger albums by Lady Gaga, Elton John & Brandi Carlile, and Icelandic jazz singer Laufey all in the running.Festival headliners and generally excellent people Haim could become the first ever all-female band to win best rock album.\"We really set out to make a rock album this time, so it's a huge milestone,\" Alana Haim told the BBC after their nomination. \"But we're just grateful for the women that came before us.\"Elsewhere, the Dalai Lama is nominated for best audio book, for Meditations: The Reflections Of His Holiness The Dalai Lama. It's the first time a Dalai Lama has received a Grammy nomination.And we could end the night with the youngest-ever Grammy winner. Eight year old Aura V is nominated for best children's album for Harmony, a bubbly, life-affirming record she made with her dad, Harold Simmons II. 9) Will artists address the political situation in the US?ReutersBillie Eilish has been a vocal critic of the actions of Immigration enforcement officers in the USIn the week that Bruce Springsteen released a song denouncing \"King Trump\" and \"federal thugs\" in Minneapolis, it seems impossible that politics won't feature on the Grammys stage.Billie Eilish, nominated for record and song of the year, has called on her fellow musicians to \"speak up\" about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, whose actions have resulted in the death of two protestors. Bad Bunny didn't need prompting. He previously called ICE agents \"sons of bitches\" who won't leave \"people alone and working\". President Trump has defended the immigration operation in Minnesota, saying it took \"thousands of hardened criminals\" out of the state. On Wednesday, however, he said his administration would \"de-escalate a little bit\", amid rising tensions.Grammys boss Harvey Mason Jr said it was inevitable that emotions would spill onto the stage this Sunday.\"You're going to hear and feel what's going on in the world through the music,\" he  told CNN. \"Maybe some people will choose to speak out about it, but you're definitely going to feel it in the music, in the performance, in the passion that goes into the art.\"10) Who votes for the Grammys?Getty ImagesWinners all receive a golden gramophone trophyThis year, about 15,000 people were eligible to vote for the Grammys - including musicians, producers, lyricists, and even the people who write album liner notes.To qualify, they must be currently working in the music industry, and pay an annual subscription of $150 (£120) to the Recording Academy. All former winners are also eligible to vote.Every member is allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields, such as rock, classical and R&B. They are encouraged only to vote in genres where their expertise lies.Additionally, every member, regardless of their background, gets to vote for the six biggest awards of the night. Those are: Album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, best new artist, songwriter of the year and producer of the year.The 2026 awards recognise music released between 31 August, 2024 and 30 August, 2025. More than 20,000 records were submitted for consideration this year. The winners will not be revealed until the ceremony.11) How can I watch in the UK?Getty ImagesComedian Trevor Noah is hosting the ceremony for the sixth and final timeThe ceremony is split into two parts, with the first 80 awards distributed during what's called the \"premiere ceremony\" at 12:30 in Los Angeles / 20:30 in London on Sunday.It's often worth tuning in. The winners in the more obscure categories are less polished and more excited about winning, and the performances are looser and, dare I say it, more musical than the grandiose set pieces you'll see later.It's also the place to see British stars like Wet Leg, Yungblud, FKA Twigs and Sleep Token find out whether they've won in the rock and dance categories.That's also where you want to go to watch red carpet coverage, which kicks off at 15:00 in Los Angeles / 23:00 in the UK.Finally, the main show kicks off at 17:00 Los Angeles / 01:00 Monday in the UK. It's broadcast live in the US on CBS and streaming platform Paramount Plus. At present, there is no way to watch in the UK without circumventing geographical streaming restrictions, but clips from the ceremony appear on social media with incredible speed.Full speeches and select performances are usually uploaded to YouTube the following day.",

On Tuesday Democratic Rep Ihan Omar was attacked at a local event in the city and protests are continuing following Saturday’s shooting of US citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents. Video evidence contradicts claims by Trump administration officials immediately after Pretti’s killing that he was a “domestic terrorist”, planning a “massacre” and “brandishing” a weapon. \nIn this episode, Sarah, Anthony and Marianna discuss the president’s controversial response to the attack on Democrat Ihan Omar, and whether Trump can actually de-escalate tensions when thousands of ICE agents remain in Minnesota.\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Kris Jalowiecki and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "1 hour agoNew pictures of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the latest batch of released documents related to Jeffrey Epstein dominates Sunday's papers. The Sunday Telegraph's front page features a photo of the former prince kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground. The paper also leads on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer suggesting that Mountbatten-Windsor should testify to US Congress on everything he knows about the Epstein scandal. Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to the late sex offender and being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.The Sunday Times follows with more on the prime minister's reaction to the latest images of the former prince. It says Sir Keir implied that Mountbatten-Windsor would be failing victims if he continues to refuse to testify about his relationship with Epstein. Sir Keir said that \"in terms of testifying, I have always said anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information,\" adding \"you can't be victim-centred if you're not prepared to do that.\" The paper adds that the the prime minister's comments \"signal a significant increase in political pressure\" on the former prince, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing. \"Creepy crawler\" is the Daily Star's headline as it spotlights the same picture of Mountbatten-Windsor. The paper says the photos \"heap more pressure on disgraced ex-prince\".The Sunday Mirror suggests \"there's worse to come\", quoting a lawyer for victims of Epstein. According to the paper, attorney Spencer Kuvin says: \"There are more photos and videos very likely to be released. They will be more damning.\" There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing and the BBC has reached out to Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. The Sun follows with comments from a former royal cop, who calls the new images of Mountbatten-Windsor \"shameful\".The Independent echoes other headlines, saying Mountbatten-Windsor \"faces more Epstein questions\" and is again \"under fire\" over his friendship with the late sex offender. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction\" in relation to Epstein.The Mail on Sunday shifts its focus to a potential leadership challenge, reporting that former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has secured a \"war chest\" of more than £1m to fund a bid to succeed Sir Keir Starmer.The UK could be in danger of becoming a \"welfare state attached to a bankrupt country\", the Sunday Express warns. The paper says new research shows that more than six million workers would be better off living on benefits.The Observer's front page previews \"the plot against democracy\" as it reports on the \"campaign to kill off the assisted dying bill\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "46 minutes agoJaroslav LukivEPA/ShutterstockSome roads in Balochistan's provincial capital Quetta have been sealed offPakistan' military says it has killed at least 92 militants blamed for deadly co-ordinated attacks in the south-western Balochistan province on Saturday.The military said 15 security service personnel and 18 civilians were also killed. It accused India of supporting the militants. Delhi has repeatedly denied such accusations.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group had earlier claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying dozens of soldiers were killed.The claims by both sides have not been independently verified. The escalation is one of the deadliest days of violence in the impoverished province, where Pakistan's government has been battling an ethnic insurgency for decades.In a statement late on Saturday, Pakistan's military blamed the militants for carrying out multiple attacks targeting civilians around the provincial capital Quetta and other cities.The military said it responded by launching \"clearance\" operations across Balochistan and \"successfully thwarted the evil design\" of the rebels. Some key administrative buildings in Quetta and roads around them were reported to have been sealed off during the day. Mobile phone services were jammed, and regional train services were suspended as a precaution.Prime Minister Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later praised the military, pledging to \"continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication\".Earlier on Saturday, militants armed with grenades and guns attacked 12 cities and towns across the province, targeting police and paramilitary installations, as well as prison and government buildings. The BLA accuses the federal government of exploiting rich mineral resources of Pakistan's largest province without benefiting the local population. Local activists also blame Pakistani security forces for enforced disappearances - Islamabad denies the allegations.Resistance against the Pakistani government and the militant insurgency advocating for an independent state for the Baloch people began in 1948, after Pakistan's independence from the British Indian Empire.Sharing a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, Balochistan also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.The region derives its name from the Baloch tribe, which has resided here for centuries. Balochs remain the largest ethnic group, followed by the Pashtuns. The largest part of Balochistan is in south-western Pakistan. The Pakistani province covers nearly 44% of the country's total land but is home to about 5% of the country's more than 240 million people. Balochistan is also the richest Pakistani province in terms of natural resources, including gas and minerals. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykBBCLord Triesman, former Labour minister and ex-chairman of the Football Association, has died aged 82. Labour figures paid their respects to their colleague, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praising his \"brilliant contribution to our party and country\" and former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair describing him as \"a vital part of the New Labour movement\". Born David Triesman in London, he joined Blair's government as Foreign Office minister in 2004,  and sat on several prominent select committees, holding an active role in House of Lords until his death.As FA chair between 2008 and 2010, he campaigned against racism in the sport and was a vocal supporter of women's football. Lord Triesman was the general secretary of the Association of University Teachers, and the general secretary of the Labour Party, before he joined the Blair government in the House of Lords.When Labour went into opposition in 2010, he became shadow minister for foreign affairs in the Lords.A passionate Spurs fan, Lord Triesman was the first independent chair of the FA. He stood down from the role - as well as chair of England's 2018 World Cup bid - in May 2010 following a tabloid newspaper sting in which he was recorded accusing rival bidders of bribery. Lord Triesman said the remarks were part of a private conversation and \"never intended to be taken seriously\".In the following years he suggested that football's ruling body Fifa needed a culture change to tackle corruption allegations it faced.In a statement, the Labour Party said Lord Triesman died on Friday night \"peacefully and at home\". The prime minister said on X he was \"saddened\" to hear of the death.Sir Tony said he was \"passionate about the cause, whether the Labour Party or football, he was deeply committed to making change to improve people's lives.\"\"He was a gentle, genuine, good guy who put others before himself naturally and without hesitation,\" he added in a statement.Leader of the House of Lords, Labour peer Baroness Angela Smith said Lord Triesman was \"respected and loved by his colleagues for his courtesy, kindness, wisdom, loyalty and generosity of spirit\".Lord Triesman leaves behind his wife, Lucy, and their daughter, Ilona.",

    "body": "12 minutes agoSofia Ferreira SantosAnadolu via Getty ImagesSeveral strikes have been reported across the Strip, including in Khan YounisAt least 32 people have been killed in a wave of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, according to local authorities.The civil defence agency, which is operated by Hamas, says children and women were among those killed. It added that in one attack, helicopter gunships hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the southern city of Khan Younis.Palestinians have described these strikes as the heaviest since the second phase of the ceasefire, brokered by US President Trump last October, came into effect earlier this month.The Israeli military confirmed that a number of strikes were carried out in response to what it said was a Hamas violation of the agreement on Friday.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce since it came into effect last year.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said \"eight terrorists were identified exiting the underground terror infrastructure in eastern Rafah\", an area in Gaza where Israeli forces are deployed under the October agreement.The IDF said it had, together with the Israel Security Agency (ISA), struck targets in various locations including \"four commanders and additional terrorists\" as well as a weapons storage facility, a weapons manufacturing site and \"two launch sites belonging to Hamas in the central Gaza Strip\".Hamas has condemned the strikes and urged the US to take immediate action, adding that \"these ongoing violations\" confirm that the Israeli government \"continues its brutal war of genocide against the strip\".It said that seven of the victims were from one displaced family in Khan Younis, with a civil defence spokesman adding that the strikes hit residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station.Officials at Gaza City's Shifa hospital said an air strike on the city hit a residential apartment, killing three children and two women.\"We found my three little nieces in the street. They say 'ceasefire' and all. What did those children do? What did we do?\" said Samer al-Atbash, an uncle of the three dead children, according to Reuters news agency.Video footage and images from across Gaza showed several bodies being lifted out of rubble and a number of buildings destroyed.ReutersA police station was also hit in Gaza City, local authorities say, killing at least 12Egypt's foreign ministry condemned the strikes in a statement seen by AFP news agency, and urged all parties to \"exercise the utmost restraint\".Qatar, one of the key mediators during ceasefire talks, also denounced the \"repeated Israeli violations\", its foreign ministry said.In January, US special envoy Steve Witkoff  announced the start of phase two of the ceasefire deal.Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed the ceasefire in October 2025, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Witkoff said phase two would see a technocratic Palestinian government established in Gaza, the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of the territory, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.The war between Israel and Hamas began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.The health ministry's figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media. Israel does not allow news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza to report independently.",

    "body": "9 hours agoMaia DaviesReutersElon Musk - the boss of SpaceX as well as Tesla and X - is the world's richest personElon Musk's SpaceX has applied to launch one million satellites into Earth's orbit to power artificial intelligence (AI).The application claims \"orbital data centres\" are the most cost and energy-efficient way to meet the growing demand for AI computing power.Traditionally, such centres are large warehouses full of powerful computers which process and store data. Musk's aerospace firm claims processing needs due to the expanding use of AI are already outpacing \"terrestrial capabilities\".It would increase the number of SpaceX satellites in orbit drastically. Its existing Starlink network of nearly 10,000 satellites has already been accused of creating congestion in space, which Musk denies.The new network could comprise up to one million solar-powered satellites, according to the application filed on Friday with the Federal Communications Commission - which does not specify a timeline for the plan.SpaceX claims the system would deliver the computer capacity required to serve \"billions of users globally\".It also says it would be the first step towards \"becoming a Kardashev II-level civilisation - one that can harness the Sun's full power\", referencing a scale of hypothetical alien societies proposed by an astronomer in the 1960s.Musk wrote on his social media site X: \"The satellites will actually be so far apart that it will be hard to see from one to another. Space is so vast as to be beyond comprehension.\"Like the Starlink satellites, which provide high-speed internet, they would operate in low-Earth orbit at altitudes from 500-2,000km (310-1,242 miles).SpaceX claims \"orbital data centres\" - a concept also being explored by other firms - would be a greener alternative to traditional centres, which require enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.An expert previously told the BBC that launching hardware into orbit remains expensive and that the infrastructure to protect, cool and power them can be complex - while a growing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.Meanwhile, astronomers complained in 2024 that radio waves from the Starlink network were \"blinding\" their telescopes and hindering their research.Musk has previously rejected claims that his satellites were taking up too much room and crowding out competitors.",

    "body": "12 hours agoPaul NjieHassan Lali / BBCSources say the mine, currently under rebel control, has been poorly maintainedMore than 200 people have been killed in a mine collapse in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, rebel authorities have said.The mine, in the town of Rubaya, gave way on Wednesday due to heavy rains, Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesman for the North Kivu region's rebel governor, told reporters. At the time, the death toll remained unclear.Women and children were among those mining coltan - a mineral used to manufacture electronics such as smartphones and computers - at the time.A former supervisor of the mine told the BBC the site was not properly maintained, making accidents more likely and hampering rescue efforts when they occur.He added that the fragile nature of the soil made the situation worse.Women, children and artisanal miners - those not officially employed by a mining firm - are among those killed in the collapse. Around 20 survivors are said to be receiving treatment in hospital.A source whose cousin died in the landslide expressed shock, saying it was \"a big loss\" for the family and community.\"I didn't believe he could pass away in such circumstances,\" the source, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC, describing his cousin as a \"courageous\" and \"ambitious\" man whose main goal was to provide for his wife and two children.\"I didn't believe [he was dead] because investigations were still ongoing. His body wasn't found after the accident, so I did have hope that he could be found alive. Unfortunately, some hours later, his body was discovered.\"Governor Erasto Bahati Musanga, who was appointed by M23 rebels after seizing swathes of territory in North Kivu, visited survivors of the incident on Friday.Rubaya is one of a number of towns across North Kivu under the control of the M23, who international observers say are backed by neighbouring Rwanda.The mines in Rubaya hold about 15% of the world's coltan supply and half of the DR Congo's total deposits. The metallic ore contains tantalum, which is used to produce high-performance capacitors in a range of electronic devices, making it in high demand worldwide.When a BBC team visited the site in July 2025, they observed miners digging manually to source the precious mineral. Conditions at the site are very bad, with dangerous pits dotted around its vast expanse.Since 2024, the M23 rebels have been in control of the mines. The UN has accused the group of imposing taxes on the mining sector for their own benefit.The BBC has contacted the Congolese government in Kinshasa for comment.",

    "body": "6 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinGetty ImagesBillionaire businessman and US Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick planned a visit to Jeffrey Epstein's island with his family, emails show - years after Lutnick claimed to have cut off ties with the convicted paedophile.Lutnick, his wife, their four children and another family planned a visit to Little Saint James in 2012, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files released by the Department of Justice (DOJ).The emails contradict statements Lutnick made in October about vowing in 2005 to \"never be in a room\" with Epstein again.A Commerce Department spokesperson said Lutnick had never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection to Epstein.On Friday, the justice department released millions of pages from Epstein files, the largest number of documents shared by the government since a law mandated their release last yearSeveral emails show that Lutnick and his family planned a visit to Little Saint James - a private island that Epstein purchased in 1998.In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant: \"We are looking forward to visiting you. We will be coming from Caneel Bay in the morning. We are a crowd... 2 families each with 4 kids ranging in age from 7-16! 6 boys and 2 girls. I hope that's okay. We would love to join you for lunch.\"In another email, sent to a redacted recipient days before his wife's email, Lutnick writes, \"Hi Jeff, We are landing in St. Thomas early Saturday afternoon and planning to head over to St. Bart's/Anguilla on Monday at some point.... Does Sunday evening for dinner sound good?\"Lutnick then asks for specific location details for his boat captain, and mentions that another family is with his family.Other emails were exchanged in December about Howard Lutnick joining Epstein for lunch on the island. On 24 December 2012, Lutnick received an email from a redacted sender that said Epstein wanted to pass a message to him, which said: \"Nice seeing you\" - suggesting that at least one visit did happen.The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing.According to an October 2025 interview with The New York Post, Lutnick said he had cut off ties with Epstein in 2005 when the pair were neighbours in New York.Lutnick explained to the Post that Epstein had given him and his wife a tour of his Manhattan townhouse, where the late financier showed off his massage room.\"I say to him, 'Massage table in the middle of your house? How often do you have a massage?'\" Lutnick told the Post. \"And he says, 'Every day.' And then he gets, like weirdly close to me, and he says, 'And the right kind of massage'.\"Lutnick told the outlet that after leaving Epstein's house, \"in the six to eight steps it takes to get from his house to my house, my wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again\".The Commerce Department said in a statement to the BBC that \"Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing\".Three million pages, 180,000 images and 2,000 videos were posted publicly by the DOJ on Friday.Epstein was convicted in 2008 in Florida for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl after coming to a controversial plea agreement with prosecutors.He died in August 2019 while in jail on charges in a sex trafficking case.",

His life on the tracks started at British Rail when he was 16; he was then offered a job on the Metro, becoming its youngest train driver at the age of 19.The record had stood \"for all these years, not least because they changed the age limit for the role\", he said.The father-of-two said he and his wife initially went to Florida with their daughters but now go just by themselves, although sometimes they are joined by friends.\"We do all the rollercoasters every time we go,\" he said.SuppliedTaylor has said he has no plans to retire from thrill seekingTaylor admitted the cost of paying for air fares and accommodation so often did add up, but said he did not drink or smoke and bought annual passes to make it more affordable.His favourite ride was the Jurassic World VelociCoaster at the nearby Universal Orlando Resort, which has a launch speed of 70mph (113km/h) - 40% faster than the average metro.Although the lure of Florida has proved irresistible, Taylor has remained loyal to railways. He was a rail guard and then a train driver for 14 years before moving to a role training others.Taylor said it was \"an exciting time\" for the Metro when he started working on it in 1980.\"The Metro was a new concept for the region and millions of pounds had been spent making it become a reality,\" he said.\"I found myself at the age of 19 getting the chance to drive the trains when they were shiny and new.\"I vividly recall being told each one was worth a million quid.\"After that he then became operations manager and, most recently, a service delivery controller.\"All my working life has been on the railways, and it's given me a brilliant career,\" he said.SuppliedTaylor said he and his wife enjoy the food, the entertainment, the people and, most of all, the ridesTaylor said the \"shiny\" trains he started with were now old and \"were more like the rollercoasters where you get flung around\" but the new ones were \"much more smoother, quieter and more comfortable\".More on this story",

Downing Street said the China visit had also secured £2.2bn in export deals.After a meeting between Sir Keir and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing also agreed to lift sanctions on British parliamentarians.",

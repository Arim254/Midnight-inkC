    "body": "Blocking Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an Aston Villa match is the \"wrong decision\", the prime minister has said.Followers of the Israeli team will not be allowed to attend the Europa League match between the sides on 6 November because of safety concerns, the body responsible for issuing safety certificates for matches said on Thursday.Sir Keir Starmer criticised the move, saying \"we will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets\" and that the role of police was \"to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation\".Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch branded the decision a \"national disgrace\" and suggested Sir Keir should act to reverse it.She wrote on X that Starmer should \"guarantee that Jewish fans can walk into any football stadium in this country\".\"If not, it sends a horrendous and shameful message: there are parts of Britain where Jews simply cannot go.\"West Midlands Police said the game had been classified as high risk and that it had concerns about its ability to deal with potential protests at the match at Villa Park.It said this was based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including \"violent clashes and hate crime offences\" between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans before a match in Amsterdam in November 2024.More than 60 people were arrested over the violence which city officials described as a \"toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger\" over the war in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East.The Safety Advisory Group, which issues safety certificates for matches, told Aston Villa that no travelling fans would be permitted at the match in Birmingham.Aston Villa said it was in \"continuous dialogue with Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local authorities,\" with the safety of supporters and local residents \"at the forefront of any decision\".Football's European governing body Uefa said it wanted fans to be able to travel and support their team in a \"safe, secure and welcoming environment\".Uefa told Reuters: \"In all cases, the competent local authorities remain responsible for decisions related to the safety and security of matches taking place on their territory.\"Ayoub Khan, the independent MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, welcomed the decision: \"From the moment that the match was announced, it was clear that there were latent safety risks that even our capable security and police authorities would not be able to fully manage.\"Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar called the decision \"shameful\" and urged officials to reverse it.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was \"a serious mistake,\" adding: \"You don't tackle antisemitism by banning its victims. This decision must be reversed.\"Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the move \"takes racial discrimination to a whole new level\".Various sporting events have seen protests over the war in Gaza, including when Israel's national team played Norway and Italy in recent World Cup qualifiers.Earlier on Thursday, the prime minister said it was his \"responsibility\" to address how many in the Jewish community were feeling \"insecure and unsafe\", particularly after the attack at a Manchester synagogue in early October that killed two men.During a visit to the Community Security Trust (CST) - a charity that provides security at Jewish sites such as synagogues and schools - he told Jewish News: \"We have heard loud and clear in the last few days and weeks that words are not enough. Action is what matters, and we're absolutely committed to that.\"",

    "body": "44 minutes agoHelen SullivanBBC NewsGetty ImagesPaul Daniel \"Ace\" Frehley, founding guitarist for the American rock band KISS, has died aged 74, his family announced in a statement reported in US media.Frehley died surrounded by family, who said they were \"completely devastated and heartbroken\".\"We were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth,\" the statement said. The guitarist was known for his \"Spaceman\" persona, from the days when KISS was founded with the original line-up of Paul Stanley on vocals and rhythm guitar, Gene Simmons on vocals and bass guitar, Frehley, on lead guitar and vocals and Peter Criss on drums and vocals. Getty ImagesThey applied black and white face paint to create four enduring characters - Demon, Starchild, Spaceman and Catman.  \"We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!\" the family said. In a joint statement, Stanley and Simmons said, \"We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley. He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy.\"Frehley is survived by his wife Jeanette and his daughter, Monique.Kiss first formed in 1973. The band produced hits such as Rock and Roll All Nite and God of Thunder. Known for wearing big wigs, black leather, glitter, platform shoes - and making a lot of noise - the band had sold 100 million records by 2024. Frehley often played a guitar that emitted smoke.In 1983, they appeared without face paint for the first time and enjoyed something of a resurgence. This was known as their \"unmasking\". They later re-masked in the late 1990s.In 1982, Frehley quit the group, which continued with different musicians. He returned for the band's 1996 reunion tour and stayed on until 2002. The original members were inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame in 2014. Getty ImagesFreyley was born in the Bronx, New York, and was given his first guitar as a Christmas present when he was 13. He later left high school to pursue music. \"I'm a high school drop out but here I am a millionaire and I never even took a guitar lesson in my life,\" he told Metal Express radio in 2020.In 2024, the band sold its back catalogue of songs to a Swedish music investor for a figure thought to be upwards of $300m (£237m).Stockholm-based Pophouse Entertainment also bought the group's brand, likeness and intellectual property.The sale marked the band's retirement from live performances, but Frehley continued to perform, releasing eight solo albums. In September this year he announced that he would have to cancel his performance at the Antelope Valley Fair in Lancaster, California after falling in his studio and being taken to hospital. \"He is fine, but against his wishes, his doctor insists that he refrain from travel at this time,\" representatives said in a statement at the time. He later cancelled the remainder of his tour dates due to \"ongoing medical issues\". The BBC has reached out to the band's representatives. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoKevin Nguyen,Phil Leake andMerlyn ThomasBBCThe controversial US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has confirmed it suspended operations in Gaza after the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas came into effect on 10 October.Despite being funded until November, the organisation said its final delivery was on Friday.The GHF has been heavily criticised after hundreds of Palestinians were killed while collecting food near its distribution sites. Witnesses say most were killed by Israeli forces.Israel has regularly denied that its troops fired on civilians at or near the sites and the GHF has maintained that aid distribution at its sites has been carried out \"without incident\".The group's northernmost aid distribution site, known as SDS4, was shut down because it was no longer in IDF-controlled territory, said a spokesman.Satellite imagery revealed it was dismantled shortly after the 10 October ceasefire came into effect. Images show tyre tracks, disturbed earth and detritus strewn across the former compound.\"Right now we're paused,\" the GHF spokesman said. \"We feel like there's still a need, a surge for as much aid as possible. Our goal is to resume aid distribution.\"Despite the group's apparent desire to continue there has been speculation the final terms of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel would exclude them.Meanwhile, analysis of UN-supplied data shows little change in aid collected from crossings after the ceasefire deal came into effect last Friday.The average amount of aid \"collected\" - defined by the UN as when it leaves an Israeli-controlled crossing - each day has increased slightly compared with the previous week, but it remains in line with September figures.UN data shows about 20% of aid leaving a crossing has made it to its intended destination since 19 May. More than 7,000 aid trucks have been \"intercepted\" either \"peacefully by hungry people or forcefully by armed actors\", according to UN data.Aid sources told the BBC they hoped looting would subside in coming weeks as law and order is re-established and the populace is given assurances the ceasefire would hold.A spokesperson from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said while it was critical for the ceasefire to allow for an increase in aid and other essential supplies, it was important to reach vulnerable Gazans, including in areas that were inaccessible until recently.OCHA has hundreds of community and household service points involved in distributing aid. It lost access to many, sometimes due to conflict and sometimes due to Israel denying it access.\"We need to re-establish our service points, we need looting to reduce, we need roads to be cleared of unexploded ordnance and we need safety assurances,\" the OCHA spokesperson said.",

    "body": "8 hours agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporter andJoshua NevettPolitical reporterPA MediaChinese state operatives present a daily national security threat to the UK, the head of MI5 Sir Ken McCallum has said.In a speech, he said MI5 had intervened operationally to disrupt Chinese activity of national security concern in the past week.Addressing a row over the collapse of a case involving alleged spying on behalf of China in the UK, Sir Ken said the alleged activity was disrupted by MI5 and that it was \"frustrating when prosecutions fall through\".The government and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are facing questions over the collapse of the case.The unanswered questions after release of China spy evidenceWhat was alleged against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry in China spy case?Decision on China mega embassy site delayed againThe controversy over the collapsed China spy case explainedMI5 operating in new era of terror and state threats, says chiefThe CPS dropped the case last month after deciding the evidence did not show China was a threat to national security.But witness statements from the UK's deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins - published late on Wednesday - are clear that the Chinese are carrying out spying operations against the UK, raising questions for the government and the CPS about why the prosecutions did not go ahead.In the documents, he said China was carrying out \"large scale espionage\" against the UK and was \"the biggest state-based threat to the country's economic security\".Sir Ken described Mr Collins as a \"man of high integrity and a professional of considerable quality\".In his speech, Sir Ken said \"Chinese state actors\" presented a threat to UK national security but added that the \"overall balance\" of the UK's relationship with China  was \"a matter for the government\". \"When it comes to China, the UK needs to defend itself resolutely against threats and seize the opportunities that demonstrably serve our nation,\" he said.The Conservatives have accused the government of allowing the spy case to collapse to avoid jeopardising economic relations with China.Downing Street said it would have been \"absurd\" for the PM to step in last month after being told the case was going to collapse, stressing it was a \"criminal matter\" for the CPS to handle independently.In a letter to the prime minister, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the events leave \"a strong impression that your government undermined Britain's national security because you are too weak to do anything other appease China\".In his reply, Sir Keir argued that the prosecution's case relied on the then Conservative government's policy towards China at the time of the alleged offences, between 2021 and 2023.\"In other words, the prosecution's case required demonstrating that the position of the then Conservative government was that China was an enemy of the United Kingdom,\" he said, and it was \"plainly wrong\" to suggest that had been the case.The head of the CPS Stephen Parkinson is also in the firing line, with MPs suggesting there was sufficient evidence to put the case before a jury.He is reported to have told senior MPs on Wednesday that the evidence was \"5%\" short of what would have been required to stand a chance of getting a conviction.The Conservatives have written to the CPS to ask what evidence it had wanted the government to provide. And the chairs of four parliamentary committees have written to Mr Parkinson asking for \"a fuller explanation for the dropping of charges\".Labour MP Emily Thornberry, who chairs the foreign affairs committee, told the BBC's World at One: \"I can't see that the jury would have had any problem deciding that China was a threat.\"I really don't understand why they [the CPS] were being so pusillanimous about it.\"Another signatory, Labour MP Matt Western, has said the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy is launching a formal inquiry into the case. PA MediaChristopher Berry (left) and Christopher Cash (right) were both accused of spying for ChinaIn the first witness statement, sent in December 2023, Mr Collins outlines the case against former parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and academic Christopher Berry, 33.The pair are accused of collaborating with a Chinese Communist Party leader who was deputy director of the Central National Security Commission, chaired by President Xi Jinping.In one message, Mr Cash is alleged to have told Mr Berry: \"You're in spy territory now.\" Both men deny any wrongdoing.The second witness statement, written by Mr Collins in February 2025, after Labour had taken power, said China's spying threatened \"the UK's economic prosperity and resilience\".A third witness statement published in August this year restated the UK's view of the challenge posed by China.But the two statements submitted under Labour made clear the government was \"committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China\".China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said: \"China's position is very clear: we firmly oppose peddling China spy narratives and vilifying China.\"In a Commons debate, former Security Minister Tom Tugendhat, for whom Mr Cash was a parliamentary researcher, accused the government of being obsessed with following the correct process, rather than doing everything it could \"to make sure the prosecution works\".\"Who the hell's side are you on?\" he asked the government.In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Mr Cash said he had been placed in an \"impossible situation\" because he had not \"had the daylight of a public trial to show my innocence\".He added: \"The statements that have been made public are completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial.\"In a separate statement, Mr Berry said: \"I pleaded not guilty to the charge, and I have been acquitted.\"My reports were provided to a Chinese company which I believed had clients wishing to develop trading links with the UK. \"Those reports contained no classified information… and drew on information freely in the public domain, together with political conjecture, much of which proved to be inaccurate.\"I do not accept that, in so doing, I was providing information to the Chinese Intelligence services.\"Tory MP Tom Tugendhat: \"Who the hell's side are you on?\"The third witness statement includes the words \"we will co-operate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must\".Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who also previously employed Mr Cash as a parliamentary researcher, noted that the phrase was \"a direct lift\" from Labour's manifesto.\"It's very hard to believe there was no political interference,\" she added.\"In my view, the Crown Prosecution Service should have proceeded with this.\"The case law shows it's for a jury to decide if China is or could be a threat to our country.\"BBC News understands that Mr Collins assumed he had given enough evidence for the prosecution to continue when he submitted his third witness statement in August 2025.A government source pointed to comments made by him where he described \"the increasing Chinese espionage threat posed to the UK\" as an example of why he believed he had said enough to satisfy the CPS's threshold for prosecution.It is also understood that the CPS contacted Mr Collins after his first witness statement to ask for further clarification on the threat posed by China, but that they were not explicitly clear what the official would need to say in subsequent statements, in order to meet the CPS's threshold.The director of public prosecutions has said there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought but a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said the witness statements raised \"yet more unanswered questions\", adding: \"We clearly need a statutory public inquiry to get to the bottom of this whole fiasco.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoTheo LeggettBusiness correspondentPlans for a groundbreaking rare earths refinery in East Yorkshire have been abandoned, after the company behind the project decided to seek investment in the United States instead.Pensana has spent the past seven years developing a rare earths mine in Angola. The $268m (£185m) project, one of the largest of its kind in the world, will begin delivering raw materials in 2027.The company had planned to build a refinery at the Saltend Chemicals Plant near Hull, which would have processed the raw materials into metals used to create powerful magnets.These magnets would then be used in high-tech applications such as motors for electric vehicles, wind turbines and robotics.The project would have given the UK a strategic foothold in the rare earths industry, which is currently dominated by China. However, as first reported by Sky News, the plan has now been dropped.Despite what the name implies, rare earths are actually relatively common. The term is used to describe a group of chemically similar minerals which are abundant in the Earth's crust – but which are also comparatively difficult and costly to extract.However, according to Pensana, China has in recent years used its market power to keep prices artificially low in order to stifle potential competition – and this has made refining in the UK uneconomic without significant government support.Speaking to reporters on Thursday at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund, Chancellor Rachel Reeves was asked about growing tension between the US and China over rare earths. The chancellor said she was working with G7 counterparts \"on our own critical minerals strategy, so that we are less reliant\".In 2022, Boris Johnson's announced plans for \"a multi-million pound investment\" in the Saltend project - launched alongside the then Tory government's 'Critical Minerals Strategy'. However, according to Pensana's founder and chairman, Paul Atherley, this contribution – actually £5m - was \"nowhere near enough\", and the Treasury proved unwilling to contribute more.Mr Atherley compares this with a deal between the US government and MP Materials, under which MP will benefit from more than half a billion dollars worth of investment and soft loans to fund a similar facility in California, as well as a 10-year agreement to ensure all the magnets it produces are sold for a minimum price.Earlier this year Pensana announced plans to team up with the US refiner ReElement, to develop a \"sustainable, independent rare earth supply chain\". It is also planning to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange.Mr Atherley insists he remains \"very positive on the UK\". Another company he is involved in, Tees Valley Lithium, is pushing ahead with plans for a lithium refinery in the Northeast.",

    "body": "2 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorWatch: Government will be taking targeted action on cost of living, says ReevesChancellor Rachel Reeves has said she is planning \"targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges\" in next month's Budget.Speaking to the BBC, she said it was the job of both the government and the Bank of England to reduce inflation.The UK's inflation rate is forecast to be the highest among the G7 group of developed nations this year and next.The BBC understands that the government could intervene to bring down energy bills, for example, by cutting the current 5% rate of VAT charged on energy.Another option is to reduce some of the regulatory levies currently added to bills.The government will receive the next draft from the official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Monday, which will reveal how much space there is for such a measure.The expectation from most analysts is that Reeves will have to announce tax rises or spending cuts in order to meet her self-imposed borrowing rulesEarlier on Thursday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated there was a £22bn gap for the chancellor to fill, which is at the lower end of expectations.\"There's a shared job between the Bank of England and the government to bear down further on some of the causes of inflation,\" Reeves told the BBC in Washington, at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.While much of the focus has been on likely tax rises, the chancellor said the latest information from the OBR had not changed her commitment to manifesto promises not to raise rates on income tax, VAT or National Insurance.She blamed an \"uncertain world\" with rising geopolitical and trade concerns for the Budget tax moves, likely to be focused on those \"with the broadest shoulders\".The chancellor also announced a new support scheme to help attract financial firms into investing in the UK.The government said its so-called \"concierge\" facility – called the Office for Investment: Financial Services – would guide companies through regulations and help them choose the best locations to set up, making it easier for them to do business in Britain.About 1.2 million people across the UK are employed in the financial services sector, with more than half of those jobs located outside of London, according to the Treasury.Reeves, who is in Washington DC for the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) annual meeting, said: \"This service will drive investment across our United Kingdom, making sure that the world's most innovative businesses can access the talent found in every corner of our country and that working people feel better off.\"The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries. They work together to maintain global economic stability.Ms Reeves also addressed at the IMF meeting the concerns about the UK's economic relations with China, saying \"our national security always come first.\"Last week's announcement by China to tighten export controls on rare earths and other materials that are key for advanced tech manufacturing led US President Donald Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on imports from China, raising the prospect of an all-out trade war between the two economic giants.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called China's move \"economic coercion\" and \"a global supply chain power grab\".Asked about accepting the US offer to join it in its battle with China, Reeves said she was \"very concerned\" by China's actions and urged the Chinese government \"not to put up barriers and restrict access\".She said the move was \"bad for the global economy and creates further headwinds\".\"I believe there are areas where we must challenge China, but there are also important opportunities to sell into Chinese markets, including financial services and other areas of the economy. We've got to get that balance right.\"The chancellor also confirmed she was working with G7 counterparts \"on our own critical minerals strategy, so that we are less reliant\".Reeves also acknowledged that the price the NHS pays for medicines could go up as a result of ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration and its drugs companies, in return for lower tariffs and investment.Some of the world's largest drug companies have said recently that they are either pausing or scrapping projects in the UK, with some blaming the low prices they are receiving.Last month, Science Minister Patrick Vallance said the price the NHS pays for medicines would need to rise to stop companies and pharmaceutical investment leaving the UK.Reeves told the BBC: \"We have seen because of the pricing regime, that clinical trials, new drugs have not been offered in the UK in the way that they are in other European countries.\"We want to make sure that people getting treatment from the NHS are able to access the best life-saving drugs in the world. And so we are looking at all of that, and… looking to secure more investment into Britain.\"Additional reporting by Pritti Mistry.",

    "body": "Trump says he will meet Putin in Hungary for Ukraine talks after 'very productive' call4 hours agoSean SeddonReutersPutin and Trump met in person at a US base in Alaska in August 2025US President Donald Trump says \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks in Hungary.He said the call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow will meet next week.Trump did not confirm a date for his meeting with Putin in Budapest. The Kremlin said work on the summit would begin \"immediately\" after the \"extremely frank and trustful\" call.The talks came a day before Ukraine's President Zelensky was to visit the White House, and with Trump weighing whether to arm Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles capable of striking deep into Russia.As he arrived in the US, Zelensky said Moscow was \"rushing to resume dialogue as soon as it hears about Tomahawks\".Writing on his Truth Social platform after the call concluded, Trump said he and Putin \"spent a great deal of time talking about Trade between Russia and the United States when the War with Ukraine is over\". He said \"high level advisors\" from both countries would meet at an unspecified location next week, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio leading the American delegation. Trump also said he would update Zelensky on his talks with Putin on Friday, adding: \"I believe great progress was made with today's telephone conversation.\"He later told reporters he expected to meet Putin \"within two weeks\".Asked about the prospect of giving the missiles to Ukraine after his call with Putin, Trump said \"we can't deplete\" the US stockpile of Tomahawks, adding \"we need them too... so I don't know what we can do about that\".Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Olga Stefanishyna, said Russia launching overnight strikes on Ukraine \"hours before\" Putin's call with Trump \"exposes Moscow's real attitude toward peace\".In a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS, she added: \"These assaults show that Moscow's strategy is one of terror and exhaustion. The only effective response is pressure - through tougher sanctions, reinforced air defense, and the supply of long-range capabilities.\"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on X the planned Budapest meeting was \"great news for the peace-loving people of the world\".Earlier, he also said: \"Peace requires patience, strength, and humility. Europe must shift its stance. Instead of arrogance and fanning the flames of endless war, we need negotiations with Russia. Only dialogue can bring peace to our continent.\"Trump has taken a much tougher line towards Putin over the Ukraine war since a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August failed to produce a decisive breakthrough in attempts to broker a peace deal.The pair met on US soil on 15 August for a summit which the US president hoped would help convince the Russian president to enter comprehensive peace talks to end the Ukraine war. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.EPAThe two leaders last met in Alaska in August for a summit which last only a few hoursThey spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.Since then, neither the White House or Kremlin have public confirmed any communications between the two.During his presidential election campaign, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within days but has since admitted resolving the conflict has been more challenging than any he has been involved in since returning to power. Trump had been seen as more sympathetic to Russia than his predecessor Joe Biden, and strained relations with Zelensky came to a head on 28 February when he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president in the Oval Office on live television. But public relations with Zelensky have vastly improved in recent months. In September, Trump signalled a major shift in his view of the conflict, saying he  believed Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\", a far cry from his public calls for Kyiv to cede territory occupied by Russia. During Zelensky's upcoming visit to Washington on Friday, his third since January, the subject of Tomahawk missiles is likely to be high on the agenda.Zelensky has called on the US to provide Ukraine with the advanced missiles, which have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles).Asked earlier this week if he was considering giving Ukraine the missiles, he said: \"We'll see... I may.\" In late July, Trump set Putin a deadline of less than a fortnight to agree to a ceasefire or face sweeping sanctions, including measures against countries which still trade with Russia.But he did not follow through the threat after Putin agreed to meet Trump in Alaska, which the US president hailed as a significant diplomatic success at the time, despite it not producing any tangible outcome.Earlier on Thursday, India's foreign ministry cast doubt on a claim made by Trump a day earlier saying Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to stop purchasing Russian oil.An Indian government spokesman said he was \"not aware of any conversation between the two leaders\" taking place the previous day, after Trump said Modi had assured him purchases would stop \"within a short period of time\".The US has pushed for countries - in particular India, China and Nato members - to stop buying Russian energy in an effort to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin. Zelensky has also repeatedly echoed those calls.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAna FaguyWashington andAoife WalshGetty ImagesBolton, who Trump fired from his first administration in 2019, has been a vocal critic of the presidentJohn Bolton, who served as Donald Trump's national security adviser before becoming a vocal critic of the president, has been criminally indicted on federal charges.The Department of Justice presented a case to a grand jury in Maryland on Thursday, and they agreed there was enough evidence to indict Bolton, who issued a statement maintaining his innocence.It comes after FBI agents searched Bolton's home and office in August as part of an investigation into the handling of classified information. The indictment makes Bolton, 76, the third of the US president's political opponents to face charges in recent weeks. He could face decades in prison.According to a 26-page indictment filed at a court in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday, Bolton is charged with eight counts of transmission of national defence information (NDI) and 10 counts of unlawful retention of NDI.Prosecutors accuse him of illegally transmitting top secret information about US national defence using his personal email and other messaging apps. \"These documents revealed intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations,\" the court papers state.Watch: \"That's the way it goes\", says Trump on John Bolton's indictmentIf found guilty, Bolton could face up to 10 years in prison for each charge. He is expected to surrender to authorities on Friday.\"No one is above the law,\" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement announcing the charges. Bolton said in a statement that he looked forward to defending his \"lawful conduct\" in court as he accused Trump of seeking \"retribution against me\".\"Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he [Trump] deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts,\" Bolton said.Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said the charges stemmed from diary entries kept by his client over his 45-year career in public service. \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb Bolton kept diaries – that is not a crime,\" said Mr Lowell. He described the records as \"unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021\".According to CNN, Bolton is alleged to have shared the information with his wife and daughter. The unauthorised information includes \"diary-like entries from Bolton's time as the National Security Advisor\" and were allegedly \"printed and stored\" at Bolton's home in Bethesda, Maryland.Bolton was fired from Trump's first administration in 2019. His 2020 memoir, The Room Where It Happened, recounted his time working under Trump and portrayed him as a president who was ill-informed about geopolitics.The White House filed a lawsuit to block the book from being published, arguing it contained classified information and had not been properly vetted. A judge denied the request and the book was released days later.The US Department of Justice then opened an investigation into whether Bolton had mishandled classified information by disclosing certain information in the book. Asked about the indictment on Thursday at the White House, Trump said he did not know about it, but added that Bolton was \"a bad guy\". Watch: How the FBI raids on John Bolton's home and office unfoldedBolton, who served as George W Bush's UN ambassador, was among former officials critical of Trump who had their Secret Service protection stripped in January.He is the third Trump critic to be criminally charged since September. New York City Attorney General Letitia James was indicted on bank fraud charges in October. Former FBI director James Comey was charged in late September with lying to Congress.The cases were filed after Trump urged the US attorney general to prosecute his political opponents.\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote on social media.",

    "body": "1 hour agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesWitherspoon has co-written her debut novel with bestselling author Harlan CobenGrowing up, Reese Witherspoon's dad was a huge James Bond fan - which meant she also watched a lot of 007 films. But she questioned why the girls all wore bikinis, with the young Reese asking herself what their revealing attire had to do with solving a crime.The Oscar-winning actress - and now novelist - says that's why she wanted her new thriller to centre on a woman who has a unique skill, rather than being about her sex appeal.Getty ImagesWitherspoon won an Oscar in 2006 for her portrayal of June Carter Cash in Walk The LineWitherspoon, 49, is best known for roles in Legally Blonde and The Morning Show, but has now written her first adult fiction book.Gone Before Goodbye, co-written with bestselling author Harlan Coben, tells the story of a talented surgeon called Maggie, who is trapped in a deadly conspiracy.Speaking exclusively to BBC News, she admits that part of her was worrying, \"Oh God, why did I do this?\" - but says she also felt excited to see her idea come to life.Witherspoon, who already runs an influential book club that's picked out hits like Where the Crawdads Sing, adds that she mainly cares about how other writers will receive it. \"I have so much reverence for authors,\" she says.Getty ImagesThe actress starred as Elle Woods, a fashionable sorority queen, in hit 2001 film Legally BlondeWitherspoon was born in New Orleans to a medical doctor father and a mother who worked as a nurse.Her breakthrough role came with the 1999 teen drama Cruel Intentions, alongside her now-ex husband Ryan Phillippe.Legally Blonde, released in 2001, made her a major star, and was followed by roles including country singer June Carter Cash in Walk The Line, which earned her an Academy Award in 2006.Witherspoon says her parents' line of work helped inspire the characters in her new novel.\"I grew up in a medical military family and I grew up on a military base, so I was surrounded by other mums and dads who were medical military people,\" she says.\"There was this sense of service, and that what they were doing was an important service to humanity, but also to their country.\"\"We both have the viewpoint that doctors are heroic,\" adds Coben, who is married to a pediatrician. \"They really are. I mean, it's a cool profession.\"Getty ImagesCoben and Witherspoon co-wrote Gone Before GoodbyeIn the book, Maggie has lost her medical licence after a series of tragedies, but is thrown a lifeline by a former colleague.The theme of career setbacks is familiar to Witherspoon, who starred a string of poorly received films in the years after her Oscar win and her 2008 divorce from Phillippe, with whom she shares two children.In 2014, she opened up in an interview about how her marriage breakdown affected her career.\"You can't really be very creative when you feel like your brain is scrambled eggs,\"  she told CBS's 60 Minutes. \"I was just kind of floundering career-wise. I wasn't making things I was passionate about.\"Asked whether her personal experience of a career setback inspired her book's plotline, Witherspoon says: \"I think every great story has a character who is taken to their knees. We just happen to start the story with her on her knees.\"It was \"a great place to start\" the book, she adds, \"because it can really only go up from there\".Witherspoon's acting career has bounced back. And through her production company Hello Sunshine, she has made a point of celebrating strong female characters through films and TV series including The Morning Show and Big Little Lies, which she produced and starred in.'Skills more important than sex and violence'I ask Witherspoon how rare it is to see a female character like Maggie, who is not about her sex appeal but rather about her particular skill.\"Growing up, I always saw James Bond movies, my dad was obsessed with them, but I was like, why are [the girls] all in bikinis, and I don't understand what that's got to do with solving the crime,\" she replies.\"If I was going to do a thriller, I wanted the woman to be at the centre of it. I wanted her to have a unique skillset everybody in the world wanted, but she didn't even realise it, and that she doesn't have to shoot guns or punch bad guys. She's actually just very smart and very intuitive and an incredible surgeon.\"But the film industry still has further to go in creating such roles for women, Witherspoon suggests.When I ask whether Hollywood still suffers from a lack of strong female leads, the A-lister says: \"I always see the gap, I see the white space.\"I started Hello Sunshine in 2011 because I just wasn't seeing complex storytelling for women in the movie space.\"So, in a way, I was just taking the relationships I've had from 30 years of being an actor and just helping shine a light on women who were ready for those opportunities.\"Entertainment journalist Lauren Morris believes Witherspoon has been \"quite clever\" in the way she's built her business empire.\"She has her book club, where she publicises books, often centring female stories. Then she has her production company, where she adapts it for TV or film, and she often stars in it herself too,\" she says.\"It's a good business model and it's working well for her.\"'I'm really enjoying this moment'Celebrity novels have been all the rage in recent years, with stars such as Keanu Reeves and Millie Bobby Brown among those releasing books.Often, collaborations involve a ghostwriter or co-author who does the majority of the writing, with minimal input from the celebrity. Reeves admitted as much to BBC News last year, when he said his novel had been mostly written by British science fiction author China Miéville.But both Witherspoon and Coben insist that wasn't the case for them. Witherspoon originally brought the idea to Coben, and the pair say they were both involved in the writing, to the point that - according to Witherspoon - \"we couldn't figure out who wrote what\".A number of Coben's books have recently been adapted for the small screen, with mystery thriller Fool Me Once becoming one of Netflix's most-watched dramas last year.So will Gone Before Goodbye get the same treatment? For Coben, the answer is yes.\"I think one day it'll be adapted. I think I have somebody in mind who I think would like to play Maggie, but I'm not going to say anything,\" he says.Is he thinking about Witherspoon by any chance? He laughs. \"Yeah.\"I ask Witherspoon whether she sees herself in Maggie.\"Every character I play is some part of my personality,\" she responds. \"My personality is a big pie. Each character is a piece of the pie.\"So, having conquered film, TV, book clubs and now novels, what's next?\"Wow, when you put it like that, I want to lie down,\" Witherspoon laughs.\"I'm just really enjoying this moment. This is a big new frontier for me. And it just made me feel like, gosh, creativity doesn't stop at any one age. It just goes on and on.\"Gone Before Goodbye is published on 23 October in the UK.",

    "body": "Strange shrieks as tensions rise in Celebrity Traitors3 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterThe Celebrity Traitors: Could you guess this clue?Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from the fourth episode of The Celebrity TraitorsThe latest episode of The Celebrity Traitors has taken place, and all we're talking about is which celebrity can shriek the best.During a challenge, the contestants - including Alan Carr, Celia Imrie and Lucy Beaumont - were tasked with asking a group of banshees to sing, before relaying the songs down a well.It was weird, and off-the-wall. But for many social media users, it was the subtitles that stole the show.\"Celia shrieks strangely,\" read one, while another said: \"They repeat the wail.\"\"The people responsible for the subtitles deserve a raise,\" wrote one X user.Singer Charlotte Church was, unsurprisingly, the most impressive. Meanwhile, Imrie's efforts - and facial expressions - won her more love online, with one calling her \"the funniest person to have ever existed\".The subtitles during the challenge left many fans in hystericsThere was also a rare moment where presenter Claudia Winkleman's mask appeared to slip, as national treasure Sir Stephen Fry plunged his head into the well.\"Oh no, Stephen Fry is in the water, I can't look\" she said, covering her eyes.\"I'm a grown man, what the hell am I doing,\" said Sir Stephen after he emerged, in a quote that could sum up the entire series.Elsewhere, the celebrities' continued inability to pick out a Traitor was the other big talking point of the night.\"They're hopeless, absolutely hopeless,\" said TV critic Toby Earle.TV sports presenter Clare Balding became the latest celebrity to be banished from the castle.The 54-year-old received seven votes from her fellow contestants during Thursday's episode, before revealing she was in fact a faithful.\"What are the odds of us being so useless,\" said Sir Stephen, while Winkleman urged the celebrities to do better. \"Stop being so polite,\" she told them.Other faithfuls - YouTube star Niko Omilana, and actress Tameka Empson - were both already voted out at previous roundtables.The younger celebs are being murdered and banished at a rapid paceEarlier in the episode, another of the younger celebrities - actress Ruth Codd, 29 - was murdered by the traitors.Codd had won fans with her cutting one-liners, and there was sadness on social media to see her go. \"Icon down,\" wrote one X user.Her murder comes after she raised her suspicions about TV presenter Jonathan Ross being a traitor during Wednesday's episode.Fellow traitor Cat Burns warned that \"it could backfire on you\" to remove his prime suspect, but Ross replied: \"Look, if I was a traitor, I wouldn't have done that.\"The words \"double bluff\" and \"double double bluff\" were bandied around throughout the episode - but in the end, Ross survived to tell the tale.\"How am I still here. I've got to be the luckiest traitor in the history of the game,\" Ross wondered.Murder, betrayal and lies - why we're attracted to The Traitors' dark sideOther highlights from the show included Ross's leopard cardigan, which Balding likened to a \"Flintstones outfit\".Meanwhile, comedian Alan Carr continues his transformation from giggly liability to cold-hearted killer.\"Let's get rid of her now before she poisons everyone,\" he declared about poor Codd.Lucy Beaumont wondered whether her height may be a disadvantage. Sir Stephen is \"too tall\" for her to see his eyes and suss out his motives, she says - although she can tell you if his flies are undone.And finally, Fartgate hasn't gone away. At one point, the celebrities were playing badminton, and Carr shouted out to Imrie: \"Celia, we need a bit of wind to get it over the net.\"She replied: \"Oh, shut up.\"The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer. There will be nine episodes.",

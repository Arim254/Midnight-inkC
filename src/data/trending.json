    "body": "David Dimbleby: Can William's 'ordinary Joe' approach win back more support for the monarchy?12 hours agoDavid DimblebyPresenter, What's the Monarchy For?BBCI've spent much of my career commentating on royal occasions, and over the past two years I've been looking at the institution in close detail for a personal-view documentary series, interviewing former private secretaries and communications advisers, along with royal historians, friends of King Charles III and staunch anti-monarchists, trying to understand how it works and why it has had such a hold on Britain.Now, polls suggest public approval is in decline.When asked how important it was to continue having a monarchy, as part of the first British Social Attitudes survey back in 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\". In last year's survey, just 51% of people answered the same. The proportion of young people approving of the monarchy is lower still.That's not to say that people want an elected head of state instead - a majority don't. And finding an elected President who could unite Scotland England Wales and Northern Ireland would, I suspect, be a good deal harder than some republicans think.But the declining support marks a problem. Getty ImagesIn 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\" to continue having a monarchy, as part of a British Social Attitudes survey. In last year's survey, 51% of people answered the same\"The only way the monarchy works is by everybody either being apathetic or feeling very affectionate towards it,\" argues Anna Whitelock, a professor of the history of monarchy at City, University of London.\"If those bonds are broken, there really is no purpose or point of monarchy.\"Plenty of people might be quick to put the most recent threat to those bonds down to scandal. There is no love lost between Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, and the British public. Only 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of him in a YouGov poll in October (the same month he was stripped of his titles), followed by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, with ratings of 30% and 21% respectively.Yet no-one I spoke to while making these films pointed to any one individual as the sole reason for the current standing of the monarchy in the eyes of the public.AFP via Getty ImagesOnly 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of Andrew in a YouGov poll in October, the same month he was stripped of his titlesI suspect the real challenge facing the Royal Family is the fundamental question of what it stands for in the modern world - a world radically different to the one Elizabeth II reigned over when she ascended the throne in 1952.Even though there is evidence that suggests change is on the agenda, as the Prince of Wales acknowledged last month, what should he do, as heir to the throne - and what should King Charles do as reigning monarch - to win back more support for the institution?Winning the 'oxygen of public support'Three monarchs have been on the throne during my lifetime, and each understood that what matters is the impression they make on their subjects: their image.As the journalist and editor Ian Hislop put it when I interviewed him for my documentary series, What's The Monarchy For? \"They thrive on the oxygen of public support\".It is, ultimately, the key to their survival.They surround themselves with people who know this too. Lord Janvrin was the private secretary to the late queen until 2007. \"If you took public support for granted it would be a very bad day,\" he told me.Prof Whitelock takes this a step further. \"The Royal family is a brand,\" she explains. \"There is always a sense of needing to keep the brand popular.\"Getty ImagesThe Prince and Princess of Wales with their children at Westminster Abbey for the 'Together at Christmas' carol serviceOne of the boldest attempts the Royal Family has ever made to redefine its public image - and keep that brand popular - came back in 1969 when, for the first time, they invited cameras into the heart of family life.The film, titled Royal Family, which was broadcast on BBC and ITV, was an attempt to try to humanise them.The late queen was filmed in colour, buying a treat for a four-year-old Prince Edward in a shop, using money from her purse. \"What are you going to have? A lolly?\" she was filmed saying, briskly. \"An ice cream,\" Edward replied. As he settled in the front seat of the car, she suggested he might make a \"gooey mess\".Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThis documentary was, at the time, one of the boldest attempts the Royal Family had made to redefine its public imageThere was a picnic scene too, with Prince Philip and the Princess Royal seen barbecuing sausages.The public lapped it up. Across both transmissions it had almost twice as many viewers as the first moon landing when it broadcast.Yet a few years later, the late queen is reported to have ordered that it should never be seen again. Some reports have suggested there were copyright claims, though the Times also reported speculation that there were concerns, or even regrets about it being made.Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesA family portrait at Buckingham Palace in 1972Certainly Princess Anne didn't mince her words about the recording. \"I never liked the idea of the royal family film,\" she reportedly once said. \"I always thought it was a rotten idea.\"But it's a good example of how the Royal Family endeavour to present themselves as they want to be seen.'The degree of control I think is staggering'In September 2022, I was at Windsor to report on the final stages of Elizabeth II's funeral. The Palace issued instructions to the broadcasters about scenes that, once shown live, should never be shown again.A number were quite small things, for example, the crown being handled, somebody looking visibly upset, Prince George touching his nose, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh's handkerchiefs, and, at the lying in state, shots of the Royal Family mouthing the Lord's Prayer.These little excisions from reality - or \"perpetuity edits,\" a kind of George Orwell speak - see them remove from the world anything they don't like.On the one hand, they have the right to grieve in private; on the other, the late queen was our head of state and this is her public funeral. Do we have a right to see it all or do they have the right to control what we see?Getty Images\"The degree of control I think is staggering,\" argues Prof Whitelock. \"If Downing Street were trying to control what's being broadcast, that would be reported upon, but if the Palace is intervening in what's being shown about certain things, why is that not seen as something that should be reported?\"However, a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace has said: \"The events surrounding the funeral of Her Late Majesty were both State occasions and moments of profound personal sorrow for her loved ones. In striking the appropriate balance between those two factors, simple human decency pointed towards a sensitive and sympathetic approach so as not to intrude on elements of individual grief or personal religious observance.\"In particular, we do not believe it would have been fair or appropriate to focus on younger members of the family at a time of mourning.\"Prince William and the e-scooterRecently, Prince William joined forces with Canadian actor and comedian Eugene Levy for an episode of his travel comedy series that aired last month.Mr Levy appeared particularly amused to see his entrance - zipping around Windsor Castle on an e-scooter.\"It gets around quite nicely,\" the Prince explained, later adding: \"I'm always late so I thought this was a way to keep my meetings on time.\" He chatted on about which of Levy's films he had enjoyed. (\"All of the American Pies!\")A bright idea - the image getting across is that William is just an ordinary Joe.'Stress around family overwhelms me', Prince William saysThe social media posts that Prince William and his family share to their 17.1 million followers have a similar approach, with many showing them off-duty, with videos shot in woods, on sand dunes. One shows the Princess of Wales sharing her relief at having finished chemotherapy treatment, and reflecting on the importance \"of simply loving and being loved\".British \"adman\" Rory Sutherland, who has spent 37 years in the heart of the advertising world, currently as vice-chairman of Ogilvy, fully approves of the Waleses' approach to striking a more modern tone.\"I think he's walked the line, which is a very narrow line between modernity and kind of absurdity extremely well,\" he says of Prince William. \"It is a very delicate path to tread.\"It is, he adds, far less crude than one memorable attempt by the generation before him, when Prince Edward, Princess Anne and Andrew took part in It's a Royal Knockout charity tournament in 1987, presiding over teams of celebrities who wore costumes and did challenges like lobbing ham at each other.And it seems to be resonating. Prince William and Catherine have public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively - higher than all other family members in last month's YouGov survey.Getty ImagesPrince William and Catherine have strong public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively,  a YouGov poll suggestsProf Whitelock, though positive about Prince William and his fellow senior Royals' attempts to seem more accessible, is less sure about whether that is enough to modernise the institution as a whole.\"If the monarchy is really to modernise in a significant way, we need to see much more transparency, much more accountability,\" she argues.Tax, politics and royal lifestylesIn talking to people as research for my documentary, there seem to me to be other factors, which are potential stumbling blocks to fuller public support.First, the fact that the monarch is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax on his personal income, because the relevant laws do not apply to the Crown, and only does so voluntarily - and that he was not legally obliged to pay inheritance tax after the death of his mother.\"I think the best way to make those concessions is voluntarily rather than under duress. It's a better look certainly,\" says Rory Sutherland.A spokesperson for Kensington Palace has also said that the Prince of Wales voluntarily pays the top rate of income and capital gains tax on all his personal income, including receipts from the Duchy. No explanation was given, when asked for the documentary series, as to why the Prince of Wales has chosen not to follow his father's example of publishing his tax returns since inheriting the role.Getty ImagesKing Charles is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax but does so voluntarilySecond, the fact that the monarch has the right to be consulted on proposed legislation that may affect the Crown and can ask to be excluded from it. The question of whether the monarch takes up this right, or the extent to which it may or may not have an impact, are other matters - some have argued that the right in itself gives any monarch potential to influence.Then there is their lifestyle - particularly  when many people in the country face a cost of living crisis.Mr Sutherland does not believe the fact the royals live in palaces to be something the public particularly cares about. But he adds: \"I always thought that skiing holidays are a bit of a bad look.\"Of course there is the economic case of the sheer amount of money that the Royal Family brings to the UK thanks to tourism - but Mr Sutherland argues that while \"you can emphatically make an economic case\", it is not the right way to justify the royal's continued existence.How European monarchies workPrince William has been forthright in stating that he has change in mind.\"I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda… Not overly radical, but changes that I think need to happen,\" he told Mr Levy.He also said: \"There are points when you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\"So I like to question things, is what I'm really getting at.\"Getty Images'I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda,' Prince William has saidIt remains unclear exactly what he means by this. Whether it is simply fewer courtiers, a bit less ceremony, no more people calling him sir, or bowing. Or is it possible William envisages much more of a rethink?There has been some debate over the years about whether or not there is merit in a bigger shift: in making the British Royal Family more in line with the Dutch royal family, or the Scandinavian ones with a much more informal and modest style.Prof Whitelock for one believes certain parts of it could well appeal to the prince. \"I don't think the idea of dressing up in all the stuff for the coronation is something that appeals to him.\"But it comes with risks. \"Those who really support the monarchy like all that comes with it, so if we got to a point where we it looks like the Scandinavian monarchies that don't have big coronations… some people might say 'what's the point now'?\"If people are asked what defines Britain,\" she adds, \"I'm sure before too long you do get to the monarch.\"Getty ImagesThe Dutch royal family - King Willem-Alexander attended schools in the Netherlands but finished his secondary education at Atlantic College in WalesGraham Smith, chief executive of pressure group, Republic, is one of those (albeit in a UK minority) who argue that no amount of reform would be enough to win his approval.\"You should not have that family in that position of privilege and status,\" he tells me. \"They are just a bunch of very ordinary people, who just happen to be related to people who, hundreds of years ago, built big castles and won a few battles.\"Essentially, it's a ridiculous institution, which… has no justification.\"AFP via Getty ImagesMany people find having a Royal Family consoling and representative of the United KingdomI put to him that over half the country don't think it's ridiculous - many people find it consoling and representative of the United Kingdom, maybe something better than politicians. The newspapers are full of talk about monarchy too.\"Yes there is an audience,\" he says pointedly. \"But there's also an audience for the Kardashians and David Beckham.\"A masterclass in reinventionI still remember firsthand one of the Royal Family's low points. It was a Sunday in 1997 and I received the news that Diana, Princess of Wales had been killed in the crash in Paris. I was working at the BBC at the time and we were summoned to cover what had happened.We had no inkling at the time what the public response would be - but it was soon clear that something astonishing was happening.There was an outpouring of popular grief. The press started reporting that thousands of people in London were bringing flowers to Kensington Palace but that the Royal Family had remained up in Balmoral and were not responding.Getty ImagesLord Janvrin was in Balmoral with the late queen. \"A choice had to be made between looking after the two young princes and getting back to London.\"Yet the public criticism was sharp. It was a lesson in the cruel demands of monarchy on those who belong to it. And a lesson to never again get behind the story.Support for the monarchy had already been declining. The year after Diana's death, it dipped further, with just 63.5% of people saying it was important for Britain to have a monarchy, according to the British Attitudes Survey. It took time for the approval ratings to climb back to their previous levels – but eventually they did, reaching 75% by 2012.It shows that this institution can recover from disapproval.Getty ImagesThe present and the future of the monarchy: King Charles III and the Prince of Wales\"It is highly, highly culturally adaptive,\" says Mr Sutherland, \"and obviously an 18th century monarchy might look absurd to us today but at the time it was permanently effectively adapting to changed circumstances, which is one of the reasons it is still around and lots of monarchies aren't.\"No matter what changes Prince William makes - nor Prince George after him - the bigger question of what becomes of the monarchy in the distant future may not be theirs to decide.The monarchy's existence thrives on the \"oxygen of public support\", so it is the public themselves who will decide through that support whether having this kind of head of state continues to suit us as a country.David Dimbleby's documentary series, What's the Monarchy For? starts on Tuesday 2 December on BBC1 and BBC iPlayerMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

After weeks of insulting each other during the mayoral campaign, Republicans and Democrats are still reacting to what turned out to be a very amicable and friendly meeting.\nTrump has promised to help Mamdani make New York City a success, and “great again”, but what does this actually mean, and will the US president do it? We also look at how Mamdani will be navigating the wider politics of being a mayor, particularly with midterm elections in 2026. In New York state, can Mamdani persuade his Democratic governor to put up taxes for the wealthiest? And how will he balance maintaining good relations with both Trump and Demoratic socialists in New York? \nMeanwhile, with Trump’s ally Elise Stefanik running for governor, how will the Republican campaign deal with the president’s new attitude towards Mamdani? \nSarah and Anthony are joined by Nick Reisman, POLITICO’s Albany Bureau Chief and New York politics expert.  \nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\n- Nick Reisman, Albany Bureau Chief for Politico \nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Adriana Urbano.

    "body": "Weather warnings issued as month's worth of rain could fall in 24 hoursImage source, GettyImage caption, A major incident was declared in Monmouth after heavy rain in mid-NovemberBySimon King Lead Weather PresenterUpdated 1 hour agoHeavy rain is expected to bring flooding and disruption across large parts of the UK on Monday.An amber Met Office severe weather warning for rain is in force across south Wales, while multiple yellow warnings are in force for many western areas of the UK.As much as a month's worth of rain will fall in a day onto already very saturated ground.There will also be some gusty winds, especially around coastal areas.Winter - meteorologically speaking - has started on a very wet note with rain across much of the UK.That trend is likely to continue for most of Monday and turn particularly heavy at times.Rainfall totals will build quite widely but with very saturated ground there are numerous yellow Met Office warnings in force.A more severe amber Met Office warning is in force for south Wales until 21:00 GMT.Between 20 and 40mm (0.8 and 1.6in) of rain is expected to fall widely here, with some south-western facing hills seeing nearer to 120mm (4.7in).This would mean a month's worth of rain would fall in just one day. Extensive flooding is possible along with disruption on the road and rail network, loss of power and communities potentially cut off. The Met Office has also warned that fast flowing or deep floodwater is possible, causing a danger to life.Image caption, Numerous Met Office weather warnings in force across the UK including a more severe amber warning in South WalesImage source, GettyImage caption, Heavy rain is likely for much of the UK on Monday.Additionally, yellow Met Office weather warnings are in force for:South-west Scotland until 21:00 on MondayNorth-west England and parts of the West Midlands until 23:59 on MondayMost of Wales and south-west England until 21:00 on MondayAgain, between 20 and 40mm of rain is forecast to fall quite widely but some areas, such as the higher ground of the Cumbrian Fells and Eyri, could see between 80 and 120mm (3 and 4.7in).This too could bring some localised flooding and transport disruption.Parts of East Yorkshire were flooded on Monday morning with fire crews needing to pump water away from properties.Flood warnings have been issued by the Environment Agency (EA) and Natural Resources Wales (NRW)An EA spokesperson has said \"We urge people not to drive though flood water – it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm (1ft) of flowing water is enough to float your car.\"Strong winds will also accompany the heavy rain, with gales possible around coasts and over high ground.Record wet NovemberNovember has been very wet overall, especially across England and Wales.Data up to 29 November from the Met Office Hadley Centre shows that there has been 132% of normal rainfall.But, in parts of eastern England, some weather stations have recorded their highest November rainfall on record.Bridlington, Yorkshire for example has had nearly three times the normal rainfall with 180mm recorded compared to an average of 66mm - a new record for November.Other parts of East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire have recieved more than double their normal rainfall with the wettest November on record.",

    "body": "Four people have been arrested in South Korea for allegedly hacking more than 120,000 video cameras in homes and businesses and using the footage to make sexually exploitative materials for an overseas website.Police announced the arrests on Sunday, saying the accused exploited the Internet Protocol (IP) cameras' vulnerabilities, such as simple passwords.A cheaper alternative to CCTV, IP cameras - otherwise known as home cameras - connect to a home internet network and are often installed for security or to monitor the safety of children and pets.Locations of cameras hacked in the country reportedly included private homes, karaoke rooms, a pilates studio and a gynaecologist's clinic.A statement released by South Korea's National Police Agency revealed that the four suspects operated independently of one another, and did not conspire together.One of the suspects is accused of hacking 63,000 cameras and producing 545 sexually exploitative videos, which he then sold for 35 million won ($12,235; £9,250) worth of virtual assets. Another allegedly hacked 70,000 cameras and sold 648 videos for 18 million won worth of assets.The two suspects were responsible for approximately 62% of videos posted in the past year on a website that illegally distributed IP camera hacking footage.Police are now moving to block and shut down that website, and cooperating with foreign agencies to investigate its operator. They have also arrested three people who are suspected of having bought and viewed material through the site.\"IP camera hacking and illegal filming inflict immense suffering on victims and are therefore serious offences. We will eradicate them through vigorous investigations,\" said Park Woo-hyun, a cyber investigation chief at the National Police Agency.\"Viewing and possessing illegally filmed videos are also serious crimes, so we will actively investigate them.\"Authorities have personally visited or notified victims at 58 locations, informing them of the incident and providing guidance on changing passwords.They are also helping victims delete and block content, and working to identify others who may have been affected.\"Above all, it is crucial and effective for individual users who have installed IP cameras in homes or business premises to remain vigilant and immediately and regularly change their access passwords,\" the National Police Agency said in its statement.",

    "body": "3 hours agoFlora DruryandBBC IndonesianWatch: BBC reports from the site of deadly flooding in West SumatraThe death toll in the floods which struck Indonesia last week has now climbed to more than 500, with rescue workers still battling to reach affected areas.The floods, which were caused by a rare cyclone that had formed over the Malacca Strait, have hit three provinces and impacted some 1.4 million people, according to the government's disaster agency.Another 500 people remain missing, while thousands more have been injured.Indonesia is just one part of Asia which has been hit with torrential rain and storms in recent days, with Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka all also reporting deaths.In Indonesia, the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have been hardest hit, with thousands still cut off and without critical supplies.Arini Amalia, a resident from Aceh's Pidie Jaya Regency, told the BBC the floodwaters had been \"like a tsunami\".\"According to my grandmother, this is the worst, the worst in her life,\" Amalia said.Aid workers have been trying to reach people on foot and by motorcycle, as many roads are impassable to larger vehicles.Pictures from the region show bridges washed away, roads covered in mud and debris, and logs piled high.At West Sumatra's Twin Bridges landmark, where floodwaters swept through and deposited enormous amounts of mud and debris, Mariana watched as excavators cleared the roads, hoping they would find her missing family members including her 15-year-old son.\"Watching the excavators, seeing how thick the mud is… I keep thinking, what condition will my child be in when they find him?\" she said. \"Will he still be intact? My mother, my brother-in-law… Looking at how it is here, maybe their faces won't even be recognisable any more.\"ReutersThe floods have impacted some 1.4 million people in IndonesiaMany are still waiting for food aid, with some saying they have not eaten for two to three days.Maysanti, who lives in Central Tapanuli which is one of the worst-hit areas in North Sumatra, told the BBC that aid workers were having trouble reaching her district.\"Everything is gone; our food supplies are running out. We can't eat,\" she said. \"Even instant noodles are being fought over now. Our food is gone; we need food and rice. Access to us is completely cut off.\"She said she has to walk kilometres away from her house to get an internet connection and basic necessities, like clean water.In Central Aceh where local authorities have provided Starlink devices, thousands were seen queuing outside the regency's office on Sunday night hoping to contact their loved ones or charge their mobile phones.\"It's been five days with no signal. We've been waiting since yesterday in case the network comes back. I'm planning to call my mother in Banda Aceh, but until now I still can't reach her,\" said one resident called Mar.As rescue efforts continue, anger has started to grow towards the government's disaster response.Critics say that authorities were ill-prepared for the floods. Some have blamed bureaucratic red tape for slowing down the distribution of food aid.On Monday, President Prabowo Subianto - who was visiting some of the flood affected areas in North Sumatra - acknowledged some roads were still cut off, but added \"we're doing everything we can to overcome difficulties\".\"We face this disaster with resilience and solidarity,\" he continued. \"Our nation is strong right now, able to overcome this.\"Indonesia's monsoon season, which generally runs between November and March, often brings heavy rain.While it is hard to link individual extreme weather events to climate change, scientists say it is making storms more frequent and intense, resulting in heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger winds.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterA major waste firm has warned that wrongly discarded vapes are still causing fires in its rubbish trucks and waste facilities, six months on since disposable vapes were banned.Suez, which runs more than 300 waste management sites around the UK, said it had seen 339 fires this year, more than one a day, putting workers in danger and causing damage worth millions of pounds.Vapes contain lithium batteries which can catch fire if crushed or damaged in the waste stream.The Independent British Vape Trade Association (IBVTA) said the number of vapes sold had halved since the ban, but called for greater consumer education about disposing of them responsibly. The ban on disposable vapes came into force in the UK on 1 June, with the aim of curbing sales to children and reducing the number of devices being littered or incorrectly thrown away.Six months on \"vapes are still an all-too-common sight dumped on the street, in bins and at recycling centres across the country\", said Adam Read, chief sustainability and external affairs officer at Suez, which handles waste for 50 local councils. \"The ban was an important first step, but the reality is it has proved to be a sticking-plaster solution to the mountain of vapes which end up in our rubbish every day.\"Vapes should not be put in general waste or recycling, but disposed of in specialised recycling bins which can be found in shops or recycling centres.But Suez and Biffa have said people are still treating reusable vapes as disposable, and binning them after one or two uses.In September, fellow waste firm Biffa warned despite the ban being in place for three months at the time, it was seeing more vapes being incorrectly thrown away, causing more fires, than ever before.Some manufacturers offer products which look very similar to the most popular disposable vape models, come in similar packets, and sell for similar prices.But because they have a recharging port and a replaceable tank for nicotine-containing liquid, they count as reusable and can still be legally sold. In addition, single-use vapes are still being sold illegally, and contributing to the waste problem. Last month the government announced a crackdown on retailers selling illegal vapes, with the threat of £10,000 fines and prison sentences.  Suez called for a more ambitious plan to tackle the fire risk and environmental damage from cheap throwaway vapes, such as a nationwide recycling scheme paid for by producers.Marcus Saxton, chair of the IBVTA said that according to figures from Nielsen IQ, 7.2m rechargeable and refillable devices were sold in October, compared to 16.2m single-use vapes per month sold last year before the ban.It said it \"applauds this action but equally recognises the continued need for greater consumer education around how to responsibly recycle both used single-use devices purchased pre-ban, and well as refillable devices which have reached their end of life\".Doncaster Council now offers kerbside collections for vapes and household batteries, to make it easier for residents to recycle them, and reduce the numbers being incorrectly thrown away.A government spokesperson said: \"Single-use vapes get kids hooked on nicotine and blight our high streets - it's why we've taken tough action and banned them.\"We're working with Trading Standards and local authorities to enforce the ban and have made it compulsory for all vape retailers to provide recycling bins, with 10,500 takeback bins introduced in UK stores since April.\"",

As a mum with two small children, I also wanted to know whether they may be having an impact on my family.Forever chemicals, or PFAS (per-and poly fluoroalkyl substances), are a group of about 10,000 chemicals. They have been used for decades, in anything from waterproof clothes, to cookware, electronics and medical equipment.They are persistent pollutants, meaning they don't degrade easily and instead build up in the environment.They exist in our homes, our water and in our food.Scientists have linked a small number of them to serious harms, such as infertility and cancer.Any level of PFAS above 2ng (nanograms) per millilitre of blood is considered to bring health risks, according to Dr Sabine Donnai, a specialist in preventative healthcare. She has never met anyone without at least some PFAS in their bloodstream.My result was 9.8ng per millilitre.Dr Donnai delivered the news very gently - but it still hit me hard.The forever chemicals in my blood would \"most likely\" have an impact on my health, she told me.I also learned that, sadly, my body would have rid itself of some of these chemicals during pregnancy, by passing it on to my babies.That was the moment this investigation stopped being just work and felt very personal.\"They [PFAS levels] would have been even higher before your pregnancies,\" Dr Donnai told me.\"You will have passed on to your children for sure.\"I was worried, but I also felt angry about how this could have happened without me having any knowledge, and very little control.I wanted to know more about these substances and the health issues they have been linked to.PFAS chemicals \"don't break down\", said Stephanie Metzger from the Royal Society of Chemistry.\"Once they get into our bodies, they stick around and build up little-by-little until they start to interfere with our systems.\"Some PFAS have been linked to thyroid problems, some to kidney and liver cancer, and some have been shown to affect fertility.\"Stephanie Metzger: PFAS chemicals \"don't break down\"As for me, it is \"unlikely\" I will be able to bring my levels to zero, said Dr Donnai. \"But you can reduce it over the next two or three years with a strategy.\"She suggested I increase my fibre intake - either by eating more oats, barley, beans, nuts and seeds, or by taking supplements of gel-forming fibre. Increased fibre in our diet is \"the strongest evidence to date that might help\", she said.If I did these things, menstruation would also help reduce my current PFAS levels over time, she added.She also told me to identify the biggest sources of exposure in my home - replace my non-stick cookware with ceramic, stainless steel or cast iron alternatives, use a water filter and switch to eco-friendly cleaning products which are transparent about being PFAS-free. Look for PFAS-free make-up and hair products and avoid ingredients with \"fluoro\" or \"PTFE\" in the name, she added.Similar advice was given to mum-to-be Pam Kavanagh, who we visited at home in Berkshire with Dr Federica Amati of Imperial College London.Pam was eager to know how to reduce the possible household risks of PFAS to her baby - and Dr Amati has studied how babies and children can be affected by forever chemicals.\"When we drink tap water, we are, depending on where you live, at varying levels of exposure to PFAS,\" Dr Amati said.Just buying a water filter can help to reduce exposure, she said - whether that is a jug with a filter in it, or a filter installed into the actual sink.Any non-stick frying pans with scratches on them should be thrown out, Dr Amati advised.Stainless steel or ceramic pans \"are far safer\", she said.Carpets can be treated with PFAS to make them more stain resistant, she added, suggesting that people vacuum their carpets every day.\"Making sure you ventilate the room by opening the windows every single day is a good idea [because] it really collects as house dust,\" she addedDr Federica Amati advises mum-to-be Pam Kavanagh about the possible risks posed by PFAS chemicals in the homeDr Amati then turned to children's clothing. Pam was left \"speechless\" to discover that waterproof or stain-resistant clothing can contain PFAS. Manufacturers are under no obligation to disclose this information.Some children's products are not PFAS-free, despite claiming to be, the BBC learned.We found PFAS in a children's coat we bought from the Mountain Warehouse website a few months ago, even though the site says that none of its children's products are made with forever chemicals.The jacket we tested came from a small batch of old stock, made more than three years ago, Mountain Warehouse told the BBC.Although the coat \"meets UK safety standards\", it added, the product has now been withdrawn from sale.The company said it was working \"to eliminate PFAS from all products as soon as possible\" and that \"children's clothing manufactured since 2023 is PFAS-free\".If fabrics containing PFAS come into \"prolonged contact with human skin\" there's the potential the chemicals can be absorbed across the skin, explained Prof Stuart Harrad at the University of Birmingham, who tested the coat for us.To reduce the risk, opt for untreated fabrics and avoid \"waterproof\" or \"stain-repellent\" labels unless they have a PFAS-free certification, said Dr Donnai.Firms ordered to reduce forever chemicals in drinking water sources for 6 million peopleOur greatest exposure to forever chemicals comes from food - particularly fish, meat, eggs, fruit and fruit products, according to the European Food Safety Authority.An innocent-looking strawberry could have PFAS exposure, I learned, because the chemicals can be added to pesticides \"to help them stick better to the fruit, so when it rains it doesn't wash off\", explained Prof David Megson of Manchester Metropolitan University.Of the assortment of picnic items we laid out, a bottle of wine could carry the greatest PFAS risk, Prof Megson told me.\"We concentrate hundreds of grapes into each bottle. As the wider pesticide breaks down, the PFAS bit is left behind,\" he said.Fruits such as grapes may have been exposed to PFAS chemicalsPFAS chemicals are so embedded in modern life that none of us can fully escape them. They have made our lives convenient and our products durable - but at a potential cost we are only now beginning to count.The European Commission is consulting on an outright ban on about 10,000 PFAS chemicals. The UK government says it is looking to ban or restrict some chemicals but has not committed to a blanket ban. It told us that it is \"working at pace with regulators to assess levels of PFAS in the environment, their sources and potential risks\" to inform its approach to \"policy and regulation\".PFAS chemicals have many essential uses, and safer substitutes are not yet available, argues the Chemical Industries Association. It says \"regulators and industry need to work together in setting transition periods\" to bring alternatives to market.When I first had the blood tests, I thought it would provide an interesting scene for our documentary.But once you know these chemicals are inside you, you can't unknow it. Having a plan to reduce my exposure is a small comfort. But I'll be honest, it is also another thing to worry about.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "1 hour agoChris MasonPolitical editorYou may have seen the blizzard of headlines over the weekend, in which the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was variously accused of lying and misleading you before her Budget last week.It is my job, after a careful examination of the facts, to call it, on your behalf, in careful, precise language. And in my judgement, on one specific element of what the chancellor and the Treasury told us before the Budget, we were misled.Let's walk through this, step by step. On Tuesday 4 November, the chancellor called an extraordinary pre-Budget news conference. This was novel and voluntary – such a thing had never happened before.Reeves called that news conference because she wanted to prepare the ground for a big Budget full of difficult choices.And let's be clear: much of what we heard from the chancellor in her breakfast speech that morning almost four weeks ago reasonably laid the ground for what was to come.She made it clear that big tax rises were coming, and she was right. She talked about the importance to her of measures to try to address the cost of living, and they were there in her Budget last week. She expressed a desire for more wriggle room in the spreadsheets against her self-imposed fiscal rules – so-called \"headroom\". She delivered on that too, as she did on maintaining long term, investment spending.Crucially, she also talked about productivity, a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked. The forecaster and watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, was expected to revise down its estimate for productivity growth. This decision by the OBR had big implications for Reeves – impacting the numbers, spreadsheets and therefore the calculations and trade offs she would have to make. In isolation, that made things harder for her, without question.In other words, nothing she said in that news conference was wrong.But – and this is the key point – we now know she knew something then she didn't share with us that morning – and that is that tax receipts were much better than expected and more than offset the reduction in productivity growth.The OBR has since made that very clear and set out the timetable of when it told the Treasury what – including that the chancellor knew about the tax receipts data at the time of the news conference.In fact, 10 days later the Treasury did choose to volunteer this fact about tax receipts, when the Financial Times reported that income tax rates wouldn't change in the Budget after all, and the markets then wondered how on earth the numbers would add up. What followed was briefing, to me and others, which was accurate and was intended to be reassuring to those markets – and which amounted to saying tax receipts are much stronger than we expected, so it's OK.So, in that news conference a month ago, the chancellor volunteered to share some of the information she was privy to, but chose not to share some other information she was also privy to – only to then choose to share the thrust of it when she judged it to be politically expedient 10 days later.I should say the Treasury maintains that it is unfair to say she was misleading because at the time of the news conference the chancellor confronted a huge hole in her spreadsheets given the buffer or headroom she wanted to build up and the policy choices she wanted to make.The numbers do back this up. And the OBR could say the chancellor was right to be conservative and cautious, or that she should have based her plans on early versions of the watchdog's forecast - because that would be the right thing to do. OBR boss Richard Hughes will be answering questions from MPs on the Treasury Committee on Tuesday morning.But the words on the day left an impression not at one with the facts we were later to discover and which the chancellor knew at the time.",

    "body": "55 minutes agoCharlotte Scarr,in BangladeshandBecky Morton,political reporter Labour MP and former minister Tulip Siddiq has been sentenced to two years in prison in Bangladesh after being put on trial in her absence alongside 16 other people over corruption allegations.She was found guilty of influencing her aunt, Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to secure a plot of land for her family in the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, a claim she strongly denies.Siddiq, who is based in London and has rejected the charges, is unlikely to serve the sentence.In a statement, the Labour MP said the process had been \"flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end\".She added: \"The outcome of this kangaroo court is as predictable as it is unjustified. I hope this so-called 'verdict' will be treated with the contempt it deserves.\"My focus has always been my constituents in Hampstead and Highgate and I refuse to be distracted by the dirty politics of Bangladesh.\"Since Hasina's regime was overturned, prosecutors in Bangladesh have launched a number of wide-ranging legal cases against the former leader, her past associates and family members. The trial involving Siddiq - who quit as a Treasury minister in January over controversy around her ties to her aunt - has been playing out in Dhaka since August.Siddiq continues to face a number of outstanding charges. Court documents included claims that Siddiq \"forced and influenced her aunt and the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina using her special power to secure [a plot of land] for her mother Rehana Siddiq, sister Azmina Siddiq and brother Radwan Siddiq\".A prosecutor for Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) previously said Siddiq was tried as a Bangladeshi citizen as authorities had obtained her Bangladeshi passport, ID and tax number.Siddiq's lawyers have disputed she is a Bangladeshi citizen, telling the Financial Times she has \"never had\" an ID card or voter ID, and \"has not held a passport since she was a child\".She was sentenced by Judge Rabiul Alam to two years in prison and a 100,000 Bangladeshi Taka fine ($821; £620). If she fails to pay, six months will be added to the sentence.When the trial began, the MP said prosecutors had \"peddled false and vexatious allegations that have been briefed to the media but never formally put to me by investigators\".A statement on her behalf continued: \"I have been clear from the outset that I have done nothing wrong and will respond to any credible evidence that is presented to me. Continuing to smear my name to score political points is both baseless and damaging.A Labour spokesperson said the party could not recognise the judgement.\"As has been reported, highly regarded senior legal professionals have highlighted that Tulip Siddiq has not had access to a fair legal process in this case and has never been informed of the details of the charges against her,\" the spokesperson said.\"This is despite repeated requests made to the Bangladeshi authorities through her legal team. \"Anyone facing any charge should always be afforded the right to make legal representations when allegations are made against them.\"It is understood Ms Siddiq is not subject to investigation or party disciplinary proceedings and retains her Labour Party membership and the Labour whip in the House of Commons.Last week, a group of senior lawyers raised concerns with Bangladesh's representative in the UK over how the trial had been conducted. Signatories to that statement included ex-Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, and Lady Cherie Blair, a human rights lawyer and wife of former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair.In a letter first reported by the Guardian, they said Siddiq had not been able to secure proper legal representation during the trial, adding: \"Such a process is artificial and a contrived and unfair way of pursuing a prosecution.\"The verdict comes two weeks after Hasina was sentenced to death in a separate trial over her role in a brutal crackdown against the protests which ultimately forced her from office in July 2024.She was found guilty of crimes against humanity over the deaths of an estimated 1,400 people at the hands of the police. That trial was held in Hasina's absence, as she has been in exile in India since being ousted. She denied the charges.Siddiq, whose mother is the former prime minister's sister, continues to face a number of outstanding charges in Bangladesh, including two ongoing trials in relation to the allegations at the centre of Monday's verdict.She is also being investigated over the alleged transfer of a flat located in a lucrative area of Dhaka to her sister.Siddiq and her family have also been investigated in relation to allegations of embezzlement around a £3.9bn deal in 2013 connected to a Russian-funded nuclear power plant deal.Siddiq has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in relation to the allegations, which originated with claims made by Bobby Hajjaj, a political opponent of Hasina.Bangladeshi authorities have said they estimate that around $234bn (£174bn) was appropriated through corruption during Hasina's reign.Responding to the latest verdict, the Awami League, the political party which Hasina leads, described it as \"entirely predictable\" and \"firmly denied\" the allegations against the former prime minister and her family members.\"The process fails to pass any reasonable test of judicial fairness - a point that has been made forcefully by both local and international legal experts,\" the party said.Hasina also accused Bangladesh's judiciary of being controlled by an \"unelected government run by the Awami League's political opponents\", namely the interim government headed up by Dr Muhammed Yunus.Prior to Siddiq's resignation from the British government, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's independent ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus said he had not found \"evidence of improprieties\" following an investigation.However, he said it was \"regrettable\" Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of her ties to Hasina.While Siddiq continued to insist she was not guilty of any wrongdoing, she quit her junior ministerial role in order not to be a \"distraction\" for the government. The UK does not have an extradition treaty in place with Bangladesh. It is categorised as a 2B country, meaning clear evidence needs to be presented to lawyers and judges to authorise any extradition.Siddiq was not compelled to return to Dhaka for the trial despite authorities there issuing an arrest warrant.

    "body": "47 minutes agoJoel Gunter, Hannah O'Grady & Rory TinmanBBCTwo former heads of all UK Special Forces suppressed evidence of possible SAS war crimes, a former high-ranking officer has told a public inquiry in closed evidence sessions.The officer, who was among the most senior in special forces, said he had passed what he called \"explosive\" evidence suggesting \"criminal behaviour\" to the then-director special forces in 2011.He also told the inquiry that the subsequent director special forces, who took over in 2012, \"clearly knew there was a problem in Afghanistan\" and failed to act.The claims come from testimony published on Monday by the Independent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan, which is examining allegations the SAS murdered detainees and unarmed civilians, including children, during operations.The officer giving evidence is known at the inquiry by the cipher N1466. His testimony is significant because he is highest-ranking former special forces officer to allege that evidence of war crimes was suppressed by those leading the SAS.It was \"not just one director that has known about this\", N1466 said in his evidence, adding that UK Special Forces leadership was \"very much suppressing\" the allegations.He confirmed to the inquiry that neither of the two former heads of special forces had passed any of the troubling allegations on to the Royal Military Police (RMP), despite British law requiring commanders to inform the RMP of any possibility someone under their command may have committed a serious criminal offence.The inquiry's reporting restrictions mean the former directors accused by the officer cannot be named.The Afghan inquiry was launched in the wake of allegations of unlawful killings by the SAS, reported by BBC Panorama in 2022.The programme revealed that 54 detainees and unarmed men had been killed by the SAS in suspicious circumstances in just one six-month tour. The programme also found evidence that the director special forces in 2012, General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, had failed to report war crimes.At the outset of the inquiry, both Gen Carleton-Smith and Lt Gen Jonathan Page, the preceding director special forces, were named in proceedings in relation to claims they had failed to inform the RMP of the allegations.'Criminal behaviour'N1466 told the inquiry he had first become concerned back in February 2011, after noticing that SAS reports coming back from Afghanistan showed the regiment was killing people in suspicious circumstances and in unusually high numbers, with too few enemy weapons recovered from some operations to justify the number of deaths.N1466 said his suspicions began with a night raid on which nine Afghan men were killed and just three weapons were claimed to have been discovered. BBC Panorama visited the scene of that raid years later, in 2022, and found bullet holes inside the room where the men died clustered close to the ground.Weapons experts told the Panorama that the pattern suggested the victims had been shot while they were lying down, and that the firefight described by the SAS in their report was unlikely. The family said they were civilians, and had no weapons at their home.BBC Panorama visited the scene of a raid in 2022N1466 also told the inquiry he had been made aware of whistleblower testimony that SAS troopers had been heard bragging during a training course about killing all \"fighting-age\" males during operations, regardless of whether they posed a threat or not.Together with the operational reports, N1466 was left \"deeply troubled by what I strongly suspected was the unlawful killing of innocent people, including children,\" he testified.\"I will be clear, we are talking about war crimes,\" he said.In response, in April 2011, N1466 commissioned a review from another officer at special forces headquarters of recent SAS operations. The results looked \"startlingly bad\" for the SAS, he told the inquiry.The review formed part of the evidence he presented to the then-director special forces in 2011. He said he \"indicated quite clearly to him\" that \"there was a strong potential of criminal behaviour.\"N1466 testified that the director \"absolutely knew what was happening\" in Afghanistan with regard to the alleged war crimes, and \"absolutely knew what his responsibilities were\" when it came to reporting the allegations to military police.The director did not contact police, but instead ordered an internal review of the SAS squadron's tactics – a move N1466 described as a \"warning shot\" to the squadron to tone down the violence.The director had made \"a conscious decision that he is going to suppress this, cover it up and do a little fake exercise to make it look like he's done something,\" N1466 said.The subsequent \"tactics, techniques and procedures\" review was conducted by an SAS officer, who visited Afghanistan but spoke only to other members of the Regiment. The resulting report fully accepted the accounts of those suspected of carrying out the unlawful killings.Habibullah previously told BBC Panorama his two young sons were killed in a raid in 2011Bruce Houlder KC, who as a former director of service prosecutions was responsible for bringing charges and prosecuting those serving in the armed forces, told the BBC that the law \"imposed a very clear duty\" on commanding officers to report suspected crimes, \"including murder, which we are talking about here\".\"If this came to my knowledge I would have asked the service police to investigate the DSF for that failure to report in 2011,\" he said.N1466 eventually reported the evidence directly to the Royal Military Police in January 2015, nearly four years after he had first raised his concerns and only after the RMP had begun Operation Northmoor, an investigation into the SAS.He told the inquiry it was \"a matter of great regret\" that he had not gone sooner to the RMP, nor urged the director to refer the evidence to the RMP – a move which he said he viewed at the time as stepping out of line.\"When you look back on it, on those people who died unnecessarily from that point onwards – there were two toddlers shot in their bed next to their parents, you know – all that would not... necessarily have come to pass,\" he said.He was referring to an SAS raid in Nimruz province in August 2012 which was first uncovered by the BBC, on which two young parents were fatally shot while in bed with their infant sons, who were also shot and gravely wounded.The raid, which occurred after the new director special forces had taken over, was never reported to the military police.The director who took over in 2012 told the BBC that the allegations made by N1466 were refuted and that he would provide a comprehensive response to each of these matters in his evidence to the inquiry in due course. He said that none of his senior commanders expressed any concerns or produced any evidence of unlawful killings at any stage of his three years in charge and that there was no allegation or evidence he was aware of to refer to the RMP.The former officer who was director special forces in 2011 did not respond to a request for comment.Tessa Gregory of law firm Leigh Day, who represents the Afghan families at the inquiry, said they were \"grateful to this officer for giving such candid testimony\".\"They are extremely concerned to hear that many of the soldiers who were on the ground during the operations are currently refusing to give evidence to the inquiry by relying on the right to privilege against self-incrimination,\" she said in a statement.\"They hope that others will follow this officer's lead so that they can find out the truth of what happened to their relatives.\"Col Richard Williams, commanding officer of the SAS between 2005 and 2008, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that N1466's evidence was \"the critical opinion of one\" and \"gives a rather unbalanced picture\" and should be seen alongside that of those \"commanding the troops on the ground\".He added: \"I think for all observers - critics, those concerned, reporters, the general public - would prefer to have a more balanced position shared, don't you?\"Former veterans' minister Johnny Mercer told the same programme he believed the release of N1466's evidence \"fit[s] a certain narrative\" of soldiers behaving badly, and urged caution against \"reading only one side\".Mercer, also a former British Army officer, said: \"I think people do support it [the inquiry] because actually the military isn't full of people who want to go out and break the law and murder civilians and children, and actually the vast majority, and certainly everyone I engaged with, demonstrated the best of the qualities that we know the UK Armed Forces is for.\"A spokesperson for the inquiry said it was \"investigating the deliberate execution of Afghan males, it's not about split second decisions taken in combat.\"The inquiry was \"legally required to publish what evidence we can, when we can,\" the spokesperson added.Get in touch using SecureDrop, a highly anonymous and secure way of whistleblowing to the BBC which uses the TOR network.Or by using the Signal messaging app, an end-to-end encrypted message service designed to protect your data.SecureDrop: http://kt2bqe753wj6dgarak2ryj4d6a5tccrivbvod5ab3uxhug5fi624vsqd.onion/WhatsApp / Signal: 0044 7815 653 458Please note that the SecureDrop link will only work in a Tor browser.

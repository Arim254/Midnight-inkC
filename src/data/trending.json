Unfortunately, Stephen was in their sight.\"</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8083pzrpdo\">Is there still a chance to get justice for Stephen Lawrence?</a></li></ul><p>Over three days this week the Parole Board will listen to evidence about Norris, before deciding whether he is safe to be released on licence.</p><p>Norris is expected to give evidence on Tuesday and may read a statement about the murder.</p><p>The Parole Board will hear evidence from prison staff who have dealt with Norris, and psychologists who have assessed him, as well as impact statements read on behalf of Stephen's family. </p><p>Few parole hearings have been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3vwz73g3no\">heard in public since the law changed</a> two years ago. </p><p>The Met Police ended its murder investigation in 2020, but a BBC investigation has led to an independent review of the case, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrqnp09zl5o\">which began last month</a>. </p></div>",

He added that the brand's future in Britain looks \"hugely exciting\", having just opened its 100th retail outlet.</p><p>UK EV sales hit a record high last month, with sales of pure battery electric vehicles rising to almost 73,000, according to the SMMT.</p><p>Sales of plug-in hybrid cars grew even faster, it said.</p><p>The Kia Sportage, Ford Puma and Nissan Qashqai were the best-selling cars in September. Chinese models - the Jaecoo 7 and BYD Seal U - were also in the top 10.</p><p>But despite the surge in overall EV sales in the UK, petrol and diesel vehicles still made up more than half of new car sales last month, according to the SMMT.</p><p>In October last year, the EU announced it would hit imports of Chinese EVs with levies of up to 45%.</p></div><div><p>The measure is aimed to protect European car makers from being undermined by what the EU believes are unfair Chinese-state subsidies.</p><p>Chinese car makers like BYD have been effectively shut out of the US by high tariffs, which were backed by both President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden.</p><p>Despite <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pr1wwq44o\">slowing sales in China</a>, BYD remains well ahead of US rival Tesla globally. </p><p>Its sales have also outpaced European rivals, including Jaguar and BMW.</p><p>In July this year, the UK government allocated <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvywyev1do\">£650m ($875m) of discounts for car buyers in a bid to boost the adoption of EVs</a>.</p><p>Car buyers can claim subsidies of up to £3,750 on purchases of brands including Nissan, Peugeot and Vauxhall.</p><p>But the scheme excludes Chinese-made vehicles due to the emissions produced in their manufacture.</p><p>BYD has criticised the decision and said it would damage the UK's car market in the long-term.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><div><p>13 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Hugh Schofield</span><span>Paris correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>In the end, Emmanuel Macron's man wasn't able to pull it off either.</p><p>When Sébastien Lecornu was appointed France's prime minister three and a half weeks ago, the spin was that this was President Macron's last card.</p><p>A last card, we were told, but a good one. </p><p>The 39-year-old was a presidential protégé - loyal, modest, undemonstrative. It was thought he had what it took to fix a discreet deal between the parties and save French politics from implosion.</p><p>But as it turns out, that wasn't the case. </p><p>Lecornu has arguably gone down in even more embarrassing circumstances than his two ill-fated predecessors.</p><p>At least Michel Barnier and François Bayrou both presided for a short while over their governments, and tabled a few ideas.</p><p>Lecornu, on the other hand, named his cabinet late Sunday afternoon and by Monday morning he had lost it. He didn't even get to make his inaugural address to parliament, which was planned for Tuesday. </p><p>His government lasted for precisely 14 hours.</p></div><div><p>The immediate cause of his calamitous fin de régime is now clear. It was the conservative Republicans party (LR) and their leader, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.</p><p>With its 40 or so MPs, the LR has become a key part of the centre-right alliance that is trying to run France.</p><p>Retailleau has made much of his presence in government about projecting himself and his party as natural candidates for the offices of state. </p><p>Earlier on Sunday, he'd told Lecornu that he was willing to stay on as minister. But within an hour of the cabinet being announced, he posted on social media that there'd been a change of heart: LR might not be joining after all. </p><p>Officially it was because Lecornu had done the dirty by naming former finance minister Bruno Le Maire as his pick for defence. </p><p>Le Maire - a former party colleague - is a particular bugbear of LR, partly because he betrayed them by joining Macron, and partly because they blame him for letting French debt spiral out of control when in control of the country's finances.</p><p>Either way, LR accuses Lecornu of hiding Le Maire's nomination - apparently Retailleau didn't learn of it until he turned on his television.</p><p>And at the end of Monday there was a new twist. Le Maire agreed not to become a minister and Macron gave his outgoing prime minister a last-minute reprieve of 48 hours, to see if he could persuade LR into the government. </p><p>So, the situation remains fluid.</p><p>Whatever happens, the deeper truth is that the more time passes, the harder it is going to be for anyone - even the most gifted of Macron acolytes - to set up a stable government.</p><p>Why? Because the more time passes, the closer France gets to its next big electoral moment – the 2027 French presidential election.  </p><p>So unpopular is Macron today that all who associate themselves with him risk a severe beating the next time the public gets a chance to vote.</p><p>As a result, the fractious centre-right alliance at the heart of Macron-land is now beginning to splinter.  </p><p>The LR are out, but many centrists are starting to mutter too. Even the president's onetime wunderkind former prime minister Gabriel Attal is keeping his distance.</p><p>If it feels like the twilight of an era, then that is what it is. The faithful are leaving, preparing for a world without Macron. It might not be so far away.</p></div>",

This enabled the growth in renewable generation in China to outpace rising electricity demand and helped reduce its fossil fuel generation by 2%.</p><p>India experienced slower electricity demand growth and also added significant new solar and wind capacity, meaning it too cut back on coal and gas.</p><p>In contrast, developed nations like the US, and also the EU, saw the opposite trend.</p><p>In the US, electricity demand grew faster than clean energy output, increasing reliance on fossil fuels, while in the EU, months of weak wind and hydropower performance led to a rise in coal and gas generation.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7c86/live/93ddfbd0-a2be-11f0-8b38-691926760cd4.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Under a dramatic sky rows of blue solar photovoltaic panels neatly arranged at the leading Photovoltaic Technology base in Yuncheng City, Shanxi Province, China. \n\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div></figure><p></p><h2>'Crucial' turning point</h2><p></p><div><p>Despite these regional differences, Ember calls this moment a \"crucial turning point\".</p><p>Ember senior analyst Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka said it \"marks the beginning of a shift where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth\".</p><p>Solar power delivered the lion's share of growth, meeting 83% of the increase in electricity demand. It has now been the largest source of new electricity globally for three years in a row.</p><p>Most solar generation (58%) is now in lower-income countries, many of which have seen explosive growth in recent years.</p></div><div><p>That's thanks to spectacular reductions in cost. Solar has seen prices fall a staggering 99.9% since 1975 and is now so cheap that large markets for solar can emerge in a country in the space of a single year, especially where grid electricity is expensive and unreliable, says Ember.</p><p>Pakistan, for example, imported solar panels capable of generating 17 gigawatts (GW) of solar power in 2024, double the previous year and the equivalent of roughly a third of the country's current electricity generation capacity.</p><p>Africa is also experiencing a solar boom with panel imports up 60% year on year, in the year to June. Coal-heavy South Africa led the way, while Nigeria overtook Egypt into second place with 1.7GW of solar generating capacity - that's enough to meet the electricity demand of roughly 1.8m homes in Europe.</p><p>Some smaller African nations have seen even more rapid growth with Algeria increasing imports 33-fold, Zambia eightfold and Botswana sevenfold.</p><p>In some countries the growth of solar has been so rapid it is creating unexpected challenges.</p><p>In Afghanistan, widespread use of solar-powered water pumps is lowering the water table, threatening long-term access to groundwater. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.xcept-research.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-05-21_XCEPT-Public_-Report_Digging-an-ever-deeper-hole.pdf\">A study by Dr David Mansfield and satellite data firm Alcis</a> warns that some regions could run dry within five to ten years, endangering millions of livelihoods.</p></div><div><p>Adair Turner, chair of the UK's Energy Transitions Commission, says countries in the global \"sun belt\" and \"wind belt\" face very different energy challenges.</p><p>Sun belt nations - including much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America - need large amounts of electricity for daytime air conditioning. These countries can significantly reduce energy costs almost immediately by adopting solar-based systems, supported by increasingly affordable batteries that store energy from day to night.</p><p>Wind belt countries like the UK face tougher obstacles, however. Wind turbine costs have not come down by anything like as much as solar panels - down just a third or so in the last decade. Higher interest rates have also added to borrowing costs and raised the overall price of installing wind farms significantly in the last few years.</p><p>Balancing supply is harder too: winter wind lulls can last for weeks, requiring backup power sources that batteries alone can't provide - making the system more expensive to build and run.</p><p>But wherever you are in the world, China's overwhelming dominance in clean tech industries remains unchallenged, other new data from Ember shows.</p><p>In August 2025, its clean tech exports hit a record $20bn, driven by surging sales of electric vehicles (up 26%) and batteries (up 23%). Together, China's electric vehicles and batteries are now worth more than twice the value of its solar panel exports.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cebe/live/82f5e790-dc9b-11ef-a37f-eba91255dc3d.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, green banner promoting the Future Earth newsletter with text saying, “Get the latest climate news from the UK and around the world every week, straight to your inbox”.

It is thought 48 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.</p><p>Trump said over the weekend the hostages could be released \"very soon\", while Netanyahu said they could be freed before the end of the Jewish holiday Sukkot - or October 13th.</p><p>Hamas has agreed to the hostage \"exchange formula\" detailed in Trump's plan, providing certain \"field conditions\" are met.</p><p>But the hostages are the group's only bargaining chip - and it's unclear whether it would be willing to release them before other elements of the deal are finalised.</p><p>Trust between the two sides is virtually non-existent. Only last month, Israel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zepgp5neo\">attempted to assassinate Hamas's negotiating team</a> with an air strike on Doha - angering not only Hamas but also Trump and Qatar, a key mediator.</p><p>Members of that same negotiating team - headed by Khalil al-Hayya, whose son was killed in the strike - will now be meeting just a stone's throw from Israel's delegation in Egypt.</p></div><p></p><h2>Hamas disarmament</h2><p></p><div><p>Israel's stated goal throughout the war has been the destruction of Hamas. Netanyahu has repeatedly stated he will not stop until the group is finished. </p><p>A key point in Trump's plan requires the group to disarm. But Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established.</p><p>In its response, Hamas made no mention of disarmament - fuelling speculation that it has not changed its position.</p><p>Over the weekend, Netanyahu vowed: \"Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarised – either the easy way or the hard way\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Future governance of Gaza</h2><p></p><div><p>The plan states that Hamas will have no future role in Gaza, which will be governed by a temporary transitional body of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a \"Board of Peace\" headed and chaired by Donald Trump and involving former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p>Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p><p>Though Netanyahu agreed to all of Trump's 20-point plan, he appeared to push back on involvement of the PA even as he stood on the podium next to the president last week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jq63edv21o\">insisting it would play no role</a> in governing the territory.</p><p>This is one of many points in the plan that will be objectionable to ultranationalist hardliners within Netanyahu's governing coalition - many of whom want to retain control of Gaza and reconstruct Jewish settlements there.</p><p>In Hamas's response, it indicated that it expects to have some future role in Gaza as part of \"a unified Palestinian movement\". Though the wording is vague, this will likely be unacceptable to both Trump and the Israelis.</p></div><p></p><h2>Israeli withdrawal</h2><p></p><div><p>The extent of Israel's military withdrawal is a fourth point of contention.</p><p>The plan states that Israel's military will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes\" that must be agreed by all parties.</p><p>A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c5ykwny8dp9o\">map distributed by the White House</a> showed three proposed stages of Israeli troop withdrawal. The first stage leaves about 55% of Gaza under Israeli control, the second 40%, and the final 15%.</p><p>That final stage would be a \"security perimeter\" that would \"remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat\".</p><p>The wording here is vague and gives no clear timeline for full Israeli withdrawal - something Hamas are likely to want clarity on.</p><p>Additionally, the map shared by the White House doesn't match up with the Israeli military's own maps showing militarised areas, and Gaza's borders are incorrectly drawn in places.</p></div><p></p><h2>Netanyahu's future</h2><p></p><div><p>For more than a year, the Israeli Prime Minister has faced accusations he is only continuing the war in Gaza to remain in power. </p><p>Far-right members of his cabinet have threatened to end his coalition government if the war ends before Hamas is destroyed. </p><p>Earlier this year, Netanyahu and Trump were advocating redeveloping Gaza into a \"riviera\", which would have involved the forced displacement of Palestinians from the Strip. </p><p>This latest plan is a significantly different - and may be a tough pill for hardliners who had given the \"riviera\" idea their full backing to swallow.</p><p>Netanyahu also faces a major corruption trial, which would resume in full should the war end. Some fear a collapse of talks could personally benefit him.</p><p>But there would also be a political benefit in ending the war - even if the terms aren't what he might have hoped for. Polls now consistently show that around 70% of Israelis want the war to end in exchange for the release of the hostages.</p><p>Regardless, Netanyahu will have to face elections in 2026. </p></div><div><p><span> More on this story</span></p></div></article>",

to the Israel-Gaza war. \nIt appears this is the closest both sides have come to a deal since the war began two years ago. But Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan - which Israel has agreed to and Hamas has partly agreed to - is really just a framework, only a few pages long. So will the talks survive the detail? Adam talks to Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent, about how the next few days could play out?\nAnd, yet another French prime minister has resigned, less than a month after being appointed to the role. Sébastien Lecornu, a former armed forces minister, was France's fifth prime minister in under two years.  What does President Macron do now? Adam speaks to co-host of the Global Story Tristan Redman and Marion Solletty Politico’s editor-at-large in France. \nYou can listen the Oslo Accords Old Newscast here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0lx690c\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.

Roland Parker who was offered the same job as Judy with the same client and studio, just three weeks apart. </p><p>\"I'm not well off and I thought this job could help me earn a bit of money and make life more comfortable,\" he says.</p><p>He paid £200 as a refundable attendance fee, then more for other supposed jobs. </p><p>When he arrived at a Manchester studio for one of the shoots, the staff said \"they knew nothing about this\".</p><p>By the time he realised he'd been scammed, he'd lost around £1,000 in fees and travel expenses - money he'd sent using PayPal's \"friends and family\" option, which meant he had no buyer protection.</p><p>Scammers will often ask for purchases to be made through the \"friends and family\" option, which has no fee attached to it. </p><p>But it's important to pay for all goods and services through PayPal's \"goods and services\" option as that ensures you are protected if you are scammed and PayPal will refund eligible transactions. </p></div><div><p>Judy eventually tracked down the genuine owner of the Manchester studio who told her he was \"getting people turning up here expecting a shoot with a cruise line but it's a scam on a big scale\".</p><p>She also paid her attendance fee via PayPal but used the goods and services option which meant she was refunded. She also reported the company to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/\">Action Fraud</a>.</p></div><p></p><h2>Don't pay money upfront</h2><p></p><div><p>Mike Andrews from National Trading Standards, says this new twist on a well-known scam is designed to \"fleece victims out of as much money as possible\".</p><p>\"The scammers are not content with taking a few hundred pounds for fake photoshoots anymore,\" he explains. \"They go back repeatedly with the promise of a lucrative contract.</p><p>To protect yourself from scams, make sure you: </p><ul><li><b>Never pay upfront</b>. Andrew says no reputable business or agency would ask consumers to pay money upfront on the promise of lucrative work</li></ul><ul><li><b>Check who you're dealing with.</b> Look up the company on Companies House, search for independent reviews and confirm their contact details match those on official sites</li></ul><ul><li><b>Use secure payment methods. </b>Always use buyer-protected platforms and avoid bank transfers or \"friends and family\" payments, which can't be refunded</li></ul><ul><li><b>Beware of pressure</b>.

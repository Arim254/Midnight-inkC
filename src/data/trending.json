On Tuesday Democratic Rep Ihan Omar was attacked at a local event in the city and protests are continuing following Saturday’s shooting of US citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents. Video evidence contradicts claims by Trump administration officials immediately after Pretti’s killing that he was a “domestic terrorist”, planning a “massacre” and “brandishing” a weapon. \nIn this episode, Sarah, Anthony and Marianna discuss the president’s controversial response to the attack on Democrat Ihan Omar, and whether Trump can actually de-escalate tensions when thousands of ICE agents remain in Minnesota.\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Kris Jalowiecki and Grace Reeve.

Labour figures paid their respects to their colleague, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praising his \"brilliant contribution to our Party and country\" and former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair describing him as \"a vital part of the New Labour movement\". Born David Triesman in London, he joined Blair's government as Foreign Office minister in 2004,  and sat on several prominent select committees, holding an active role in House of Lords until his death.As FA chair between 2008 and 2010, he campaigned against racism in the sport and was a vocal supporter of women's football. In a statement, the Labour Party said Lord Triesman died on Friday night \"peacefully and at home\". The prime minister said he was \"saddened\" to hear of the death.\"David will be remembered for his brilliant contribution to our Party and country, including as Labour General Secretary and a government minister,\" Sir Keir wrote on X.\" Lord Triesman  was the general secretary of the Association of University Teachers, and the general secretary of the Labour Party, before he joined the Blair government in the House of Lords in 2004.He went on to  later Labour's shadow minister for foreign affairs, and also sat on several prominent select committees.A passionate Spurs fan, Lord Triesman was the first independent chair of the FA. Paying tribute to her former colleague, Baroness Angela Smith said he was \"respected and loved by his colleagues for his courtesy, kindness, wisdom, loyalty and generosity of spirit\".Lord Triesman leaves behind a his wife, Lucy, and their daughter, Ilona.",

    "body": "7 hours agoPaul NjieHassan Lali / BBCSources say the mine, currently under rebel control, has been poorly maintainedMore than 200 people have been killed in a mine collapse in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, rebel authorities have said.The mine, in the town of Rubaya, gave way on Wednesday due to heavy rains, Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesman for the North Kivu region's rebel governor, told reporters. At the time, the death toll remained unclear.Women and children were among those mining coltan - a mineral used to manufacture electronics such as smartphones and computers - at the time.A former supervisor of the mine told the BBC the site was not properly maintained, making accidents more likely and hampering rescue efforts when they occur.He added that the fragile nature of the soil made the situation worse.Women, children and artisanal miners - those not officially employed by a mining firm - are among those killed in the collapse. Around 20 survivors are said to be receiving treatment in hospital.A source whose cousin died in the landslide expressed shock, saying it was \"a big loss\" for the family and community.\"I didn't believe he could pass away in such circumstances,\" the source, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC, describing his cousin as a \"courageous\" and \"ambitious\" man whose main goal was to provide for his wife and two children.\"I didn't believe [he was dead] because investigations were still ongoing. His body wasn't found after the accident, so I did have hope that he could be found alive. Unfortunately, some hours later, his body was discovered.\"Governor Erasto Bahati Musanga, who was appointed by M23 rebels after seizing swathes of territory in North Kivu, visited survivors of the incident on Friday.Rubaya is one of a number of towns across North Kivu under the control of the M23, who international observers say are backed by neighbouring Rwanda.The mines in Rubaya hold about 15% of the world's coltan supply and half of the DR Congo's total deposits. The metallic ore contains tantalum, which is used to produce high-performance capacitors in a range of electronic devices, making it in high demand worldwide.When a BBC team visited the site in July 2025, they observed miners digging manually to source the precious mineral. Conditions at the site are very bad, with dangerous pits dotted around its vast expanse.Since 2024, the M23 rebels have been in control of the mines. The UN has accused the group of imposing taxes on the mining sector for their own benefit.The BBC has contacted the Congolese government in Kinshasa for comment.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosAnadolu via Getty ImagesSeveral strikes have been reported across the Strip, including in Khan YounisAt least 32 people have been killed in a wave of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, according to local authorities.The civil defence agency, which is operated by Hamas, says children and women were among those killed. It added that in one attack, helicopter gunships hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the southern city of Khan Younis.Palestinians have described these strikes as the heaviest since the second phase of the ceasefire, brokered by President Trump in October, came into effect earlier this month.The Israeli military confirmed that a number of strikes were carried out in response to what it said was a Hamas violation of the agreement on Friday.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce since it came into effect last year.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said \"eight terrorists were identified exiting the underground terror infrastructure in eastern Rafah\", an area in Gaza where Israeli forces are deployed under the October agreement.The IDF said it had, together with the Israel Security Agency (ISA), struck targets in various locations including \"four commanders and additional terrorists\" as well as a weapons storage facility, a weapons manufacturing site and \"two launch sites belonging to Hamas in the central Gaza Strip\".Hamas has condemned the strikes and urged the US to take immediate action, adding that \"these ongoing violations\" confirm that the Israeli government \"continues its brutal war of genocide against the strip\".It said that seven of the victims were from one displaced family in Khan Younis, with a civil defence spokesman adding that the strikes hit residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station.Officials at Gaza City's Shifa hospital said an air strike on the city hit a residential apartment, killing three children and two women.\"We found my three little nieces in the street. They say 'ceasefire' and all. What did those children do? What did we do?\" said Samer al-Atbash, an uncle of the three dead children, according to Reuters news agency.Video footage and images from across Gaza showed several bodies being lifted out of rubble and a number of buildings destroyed.ReutersA police station was also hit in Gaza City, local authorities say, killing at least 12Egypt's foreign ministry condemned the strikes in a statement seen by AFP news agency, and urged all parties to \"exercise the utmost restraint\".Qatar, one of the key mediators during ceasefire talks, also denounced the \"repeated Israeli violations\", its foreign ministry said.The war between Israel and Hamas began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.The health ministry's figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media. Israel does not allow news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza to report independently.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMaia DaviesReutersElon Musk - the boss of SpaceX as well as Tesla and X - is the world's richest personElon Musk's SpaceX has applied to launch one million satellites into Earth's orbit to power artificial intelligence (AI).The application claims \"orbital data centres\" are the most cost and energy-efficient way to meet the growing demand for AI computing power.Traditionally, such centres are large warehouses full of powerful computers which process and store data. Musk's aerospace firm claims processing needs due to the expanding use of AI are already outpacing \"terrestrial capabilities\".It would increase the number of SpaceX satellites in orbit drastically. Its existing Starlink network of nearly 10,000 satellites has already been accused of creating congestion in space, which Musk denies.The new network could comprise up to one million solar-powered satellites, according to the application filed on Friday with the Federal Communications Commission - which does not specify a timeline for the plan.SpaceX claims the system would deliver the computer capacity required to serve \"billions of users globally\".It also says it would be the first step towards \"becoming a Kardashev II-level civilisation - one that can harness the Sun's full power\", referencing a scale of hypothetical alien societies proposed by an astronomer in the 1960s.Musk wrote on his social media site X: \"The satellites will actually be so far apart that it will be hard to see from one to another. Space is so vast as to be beyond comprehension.\"Like the Starlink satellites, which provide high-speed internet, they would operate in low-Earth orbit at altitudes from 500-2,000km (310-1,242 miles).SpaceX claims \"orbital data centres\" - a concept also being explored by other firms - would be a greener alternative to traditional centres, which require enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.An expert previously told the BBC that launching hardware into orbit remains expensive and that the infrastructure to protect, cool and power them can be complex - while a growing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.Meanwhile, astronomers complained in 2024 that radio waves from the Starlink network were \"blinding\" their telescopes and hindering their research.Musk has previously rejected claims that his satellites were taking up too much room and crowding out competitors.",

His life on the tracks started at British Rail when he was 16; he was then offered a job on the Metro, becoming its youngest train driver at the age of 19.The record had stood \"for all these years, not least because they changed the age limit for the role\", he said.The father-of-two said he and his wife initially went to Florida with their daughters but now go just by themselves, although sometimes they are joined by friends.\"We do all the rollercoasters every time we go,\" he said.SuppliedTaylor has said he has no plans to retire from thrill seekingTaylor admitted the cost of paying for air fares and accommodation so often did add up, but said he did not drink or smoke and bought annual passes to make it more affordable.His favourite ride was the Jurassic World VelociCoaster at the nearby Universal Orlando Resort, which has a launch speed of 70mph (113km/h) - 40% faster than the average metro.Although the lure of Florida has proved irresistible, Taylor has remained loyal to railways. He was a rail guard and then a train driver for 14 years before moving to a role training others.Taylor said it was \"an exciting time\" for the Metro when he started working on it in 1980.\"The Metro was a new concept for the region and millions of pounds had been spent making it become a reality,\" he said.\"I found myself at the age of 19 getting the chance to drive the trains when they were shiny and new.\"I vividly recall being told each one was worth a million quid.\"After that he then became operations manager and, most recently, a service delivery controller.\"All my working life has been on the railways, and it's given me a brilliant career,\" he said.SuppliedTaylor said he and his wife enjoy the food, the entertainment, the people and, most of all, the ridesTaylor said the \"shiny\" trains he started with were now old and \"were more like the rollercoasters where you get flung around\" but the new ones were \"much more smoother, quieter and more comfortable\".More on this story",

    "body": "4 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo Correspondent andRachel Muller-HeyndykEPASir Keir Starmer has invited Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the UK following talks in Tokyo, saying the relationship between the countries was the \"strongest\" it has been \"in decades\".The leaders of UK and Japan said they had discussed their \"joint values\" and set out plans to strengthen trade and security ties, including boosting defence and partnerships across the Indo-Pacific region.But the meeting at the Prime Minister's Office in Tokyo comes at a tense moment for the region, following controversial comments from Takaichi suggesting that Japan could be drawn into conflict between China and Taiwan.Sir Keir said he and his Japanese counterpart agreed on the need to respond with \"strength and clarity\" to increasing instability in the world, and thanked her for  \"steadfast leadership in supporting Ukraine\".Ahead of a working dinner, the Japanese PM said that Sir Keir \"looked well\", adding  she had been invited to his Chequers country estate later this year.\"I look forward to our dinner in a moment, and to the meeting that I hope we will have,\" Sir Keir said following the 20-minute meeting between the leaders.He added that the UK and Japan \"share vital interests and principles\" and that he looked \"forward to driving that forward together.\"He went on to say that the two countries \"have a clear interest in free and predictable trade\", saying they aimed to improve supply chains in \"key areas such as critical minerals\".ReutersSir Keir attending a ceremonial guard of honour with Prime Minister of Japan Sanae Takaichi at her office in TokyoJapan's leader said she hoped to \"build a new era of Japan-UK relations amid the complex crises facing the international community in the 21st Century\".Japan, the world's fourth-largest economy, is one of Britain's biggest investors outside Europe.For Sir Keir, his East Asia trip was about balance - resetting relations with China, while reassuring Japan and other allies that Britain remains committed to regional security and clear-eyed about the risks China poses.ReutersJapan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer shake hands as they take part in a joint press conferenceWhile Takaichi's comments on Taiwan angered Beijing, they are expected to give her a boost in next week's polls.Jeffrey J Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies, said that Sir Keir's stopover in Tokyo was doing her an \"enormous favour\".\"I think the most important thing from the Japanese perspective is the timing of this visit, which is right in the middle of a major election,\" he said.\"And Prime Minister Takaichi is basically running on the popularity that she received being the first female prime minister and also being successful at diplomacy.\"The Tokyo trip marks the end of Sir Keir's diplomatic meetings in East Asia in which he secured a reduction in tariffs on whisky and the introduction of visa-free travel to China for British citizens. Downing Street said the China visit had also secured £2.2bn in export deals.After a meeting between Sir Keir and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing also agreed to lift sanctions on British parliamentarians.",

While isolated from friends, the trading card game offered comfort, distraction and a way to stay connected.His mum, Rachael, from Cradley Heath, said she knew something was wrong long before the diagnosis. \"He was constantly unwell as a baby. We were always calling the doctors,\" she said. \"One day 111 asked us to check for a rash – and that's when everything changed.\"An ambulance took Dylan to hospital, where tests confirmed the family's fears. \"When they said they were testing for leukaemia, my heart sank,\" Rachael said.\"All the symptoms pointed to it.\"Dylan spent more than three years in treatment and rang the end-of-treatment bell in April 2024, but months later he became unwell again. \"You're told relapse is unlikely, but that fear never really leaves you,\" Rachael said.\"I noticed he was more tired, not playing as much and my instinct was right.\"Dylan needed a stem cell transplant and, after his parents were ruled out as donors, a suitable cord blood match was found. \"We are so grateful he was given that chance,\" Rachael said. \"The transplant and recovery were incredibly tough, but he's come such a long way.\"Throughout it all, Pokémon cards played a surprising role: \"We'd buy packs for him to open in hospital so he always had something to look forward to,\" she said. \"They helped him reconnect with friends when he went back to school. \"His uncle even brought special cards from Japan after the transplant.\"Dr Divij Sachdeva, a clinical fellow at the hospital, said Dylan's resilience stood out. \"He's been through so much and was always so brave,\" he said.\"Hobbies like Pokémon can really help children cope - they offer comfort, spark conversations and bring a bit of joy into hospital life.\"Now back at school full-time, Dylan is still attending regular check-ups – and trading cards in the playground.More on this story",

    "body": "17 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesPhone lines are being opened and webchat services extended by the UK's tax authority on the final day before the self-assessment deadline.Millions of people who are self-employed or have more than one source of income are required to file a 2024-25 tax return online by the end of January.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has scaled up Saturday support for those leaving it to the last minute. Some 1.1 million people missed the cut-off a year ago.Previous excuses for failing to file have included being up a mountain or yachting around the world. Reasonable excuses for avoiding fines include serious illness or a close family bereavement.Anyone who fails to complete a required return by the end of Saturday faces an automatic £100 fine and the possibility of further penalties.More than 10 million people have already filed the latest tax return, according to HMRC, but thousands always leave it to the final day.The tax authority said digital services were the fastest way to access support on Saturday. A webchat was being extended to 10 times its usual Saturday capacity, with the digital assistant service running all day as normal.The telephone helpline, usually closed on weekends, is open from 09:00 GMT to 16:00 GMT for those who need to speak to someone about self assessment. HMRC has faced sharp criticism in the past for the time it takes to answer phone calls, and waits are expected to be relatively long on Saturday. Who files and who doesn'tMillions of people pay only have tax automatically deducted from their wages through PAYE (pay-as-you-earn), but those with more than one source of income may need to file.They include those earning more than £1,000 in the 2024-25 financial year from self-employment or by letting out a property or land.Some not required to file this time include those earning more than £150,000, whose high income was the only reason they needed to file previously, or those who have switched to paying the high income child benefit charge through PAYE.Some people may be missing out on tax relief by submitting an incomplete tax return or not doing one at all.Sir Steve Webb, partner at consultancy LCP, estimated that about 800,000 higher or additional rate taxpayers could be missing out on extra tax relief by failing to declare a personal pension or other \"relief at source\" scheme.Penalties can build upThose required to complete a return must also pay any tax bill.\"Filing the return is only half the battle - you must also pay any tax owed for the 2024-25 tax year by January 31 which will require sufficient cleared funds available in your bank account ahead of the deadline,\" said Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.Those who are unable to pay in full by January 31 may be able to set up a \"time to pay\" arrangement online if they owe less than £30,000 and meet the criteria.Anyone missing the filing deadline faces the following penalties: An initial £100 fixed penalty, even if there is no tax to pay, or if the tax due is paid on timeAfter three months, there could also be additional daily penalties of £10 per day, up to a maximum of £900After six months, there could be a further penalty of 5% of the tax due or £300, whichever is greater. After 12 months, there could be another 5% or £300 charge, whichever is greaterThere are also additional penalties for late payments of 5% of the tax unpaid at 30 days, six months and 12 monthsIf tax remains unpaid after the deadline, interest may also be charged on the amount owedHMRC will consider customers' reasons for missing the deadline. Those with a reasonable excuse may avoid a penalty.People should also watch out for scams, with criminals attempting to dupe taxpayers by purporting to be from HMRC. Fraudsters may threaten people, claiming they have an unpaid tax bill, or they may make offers of fake rebates.Digital overhaul from AprilFrom April, taxpayers with more than £50,000 of gross income from self-employment or rental income in the 2024-25 tax year will need to comply with Making Tax Digital rules which will replace self assessment. They must keep digital records using approved software and submit quarterly income and expense summaries to HMRC. The threshold drops to £30,000 from April 2027 then £20,000 from April 2028.\"Making Tax Digital is the biggest tax change since self assessment and, with just over two months to go, time is running out to get ready,\" said Victoria Todd, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, which has produced a guide for those unsure of the changes.",

If that's not enough, she lifts weights for 10 minutes to get warm.When the weather outside is above zero, it's just about bearable. But later this weekend, the temperature in Dnipro is forecast to plunge below -20C.In Kyiv and elsewhere, it could be colder still.\"That's what's really scary, because all the heating pipes will burst and we won't be able to repair them again. It will be a catastrophe,\" Yulia worries.On Thursday, Donald Trump announced that Vladimir Putin had agreed to halt attacks on Ukraine's major cities during the \"horrendously cold\" snap, supposedly for a week.The US president called it \"very nice\" of his Russian counterpart to agree to an energy truce. But details were sparse from the start.The next day, the Kremlin clarified that Putin's burst of good will expires on Sunday, just as the coldest weather bites.There is usually a week or more gap between massive aerial attacks in any case, so it's unclear whether Russia has actually paused anything.There has been no major strike since 24 January, when hundreds of tower blocks in Kyiv lost power and heating.\"It has been quieter for a bit, but I don't know if that's linked,\" a doubtful Yulia says, suspecting the strikes will restart at any moment.\"I think Putin wants to turn people against their government, to have them say: 'Just give Russia anything to make this stop',\" Yulia says.\"He wants to break us, but it won't work.\"Ukraine's heating system is breaking down though.The Geneva Convention, the laws of war, bans attacks on infrastructure that cause excessive harm to civilians. But this is the fourth winter in a row that the energy grid has been targeted by Russia deliberately, leaving it more fragile and harder to repair after each successive strike.There were widespread power outages across western and central Ukraine on Saturday after a \"technical disruption\" affected power lines connecting its grid to those of Romania and Moldova, its government said.Engineers have been drafted in from Ukraine's national rail company and elsewhere, working around the clock to restore electricity, and to defrost and patch up the heating pipes that run beneath giant apartment blocks in Dnipro, Kyiv and beyond.An extended pause in strikes on the sector would provide a welcome break, but few Ukrainians trust Russia to deliver that.That's because, elsewhere, the deadly strikes have not stopped.Matthew Goddard/BBCFamilies who have fled their homes gather at a centre for the displacedOn Friday, one person was killed and several injured when a bus in Kherson was hit by shelling, while there were multiple air raid warnings for drones.And all along the eastern frontline, the fighting is as intense as ever, still forcing civilians to flee their homes.In Pavlohrad, about 40 miles from the front, we found families dazed after evacuating, abandoning everything, with no idea whether they'll ever go back.They were queuing to register at a centre for the displaced, offered a small handout of cash, food and toiletries by volunteers.Kateryna cried as she told me how hard it had been to leave Vasylkivka, where she had lived all her life. \"It's like abandoning a piece of yourself,\" she said.But she had to protect her two young children, scared by the explosions.\"Our village wasn't touched at first, but now it's a total combat zone. The drones are hitting every day,\" her mother Iryna described the Russian advance.\"One day there were 50 Shahed drones overhead.\"Matthew Goddard/BBCKateryna left her village to protect her two young children from the fighting that continues along the front linesTrump sees the energy truce - a halt to massive aerial attacks on Ukraine's big cities - as a way of reducing tension as he pushes for progress in peace talks.He pledged to end this war \"in a day\" long ago but now admits doing so is difficult.Ukraine has agreed to mirror Moscow's actions by halting its own strikes on oil refineries in Russia and its shadow fleet of tankers that move Russian oil around the world, evading sanctions.The trade pumps vital money into Russia's war economy, but Kyiv wants to show Trump its willingness in his peace efforts.Another round of negotiations is scheduled to take place in the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, though it seems no senior US delegates will attend.The US has been talking up progress and Ukraine also claims only one major disagreement remains – albeit a critical one, over control of territory in the east.But Russian officials have been dampening expectations of a deal.\"Of course we are following the talks, we want some stability,\" Iryna tells me people here long for peace more than anyone. \"But how can we trust Russia not to stab us in the back?\"From the dark and the cold of this war, it does feel to Ukrainians like Moscow is just toying with Trump.The next days and weeks will test that.Additional reporting by Mariana Matveichuk and Paul Pradier",

Police searched them and found \"magnetised probes\" and a mirror attachment for a phone allegedly used to rig games.The pair have been charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage and remain in custody.New South Wales Police said the couple had arrived in Sydney from Kazakhstan in October and applied for membership to the casino the same day.Over the following weeks, they made a number of visits to the casino - reportedly the Crown on Sydney's waterfront - and accumulated winnings totalling A$1,179,412.50.This raised the suspicions of casino staff, who allegedly caught them in the act on Thursday.Police said the spying devices were connected to the couple's mobile phones, allowing them to capture and view images of the table.NSW PoliceCasino staff noticed Dilnoza Israilova wearing the small, discreet camera on her Mickey Mouse T-shirtThey also wore hidden earpieces, through which they allegedly received instructions on when to wager on card games. A New South Wales Police spokesperson told the BBC that they were not currently looking for any other person in relation to the alleged fraud.In a subsequent search of their accommodation near the casino, officers found other \"gambling props\", high-end jewellery and €2,000 (£1,750; $2,320) in cash.The pair appeared in court on Friday and were denied bail, New South Wales police said.Mrs Israilova is due back in court in February, the Guardian Australia reports, while Mr Israilov is scheduled to appear on 11 December.",

    "body": "The founder of the Swiss right-to-die organisation Dignitas has died by assisted suicide, the group says.Ludwig Minelli, 92, died on Saturday, days before his 93rd birthday.The group paid tribute to Minelli, saying he had led a \"life for freedom of choice, self-determination, and human rights\".Minelli founded Dignitas in 1998, and since then it has helped thousands of people to die. In recent decades, some countries have shifted their stance on assisted dying, with Australia, Canada and New Zealand introducing laws. The UK House of Lords is currently debating the assisted dying bill. Critics of the legalisation say it could see disabled and vulnerable people being coerced into ending their lives.Many people helped by Dignitas are those who have travelled to Switzerland because assisted dying is not permitted in their own countries.Across his life, Minelli campaigned passionately for the right to die, giving Dignitas the slogan \"dignity in life, dignity in death\". In a 2010 interview with the BBC, he said: \"I am persuaded that we have to struggle in order to implement the last human right in our societies. And the last human right is the right to make a decision on one's own end, and the possibility to have this end without risk and without pain.\"Minelli began his career as a journalist, working as a correspondent for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, before studying law and taking an interest in human rights.After founding Dignitas he faced numerous legal challenges, making multiple successful appeals to the Swiss supreme court.In a statement, Dignitas said his work had had a lasting influence, pointing to a 2011 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, in which it confirmed the right of a person capable of judgement to decide on the manner and the time of their own end of life.Euthanasia - when a lethal drug is administered by a physician to deliberately end a person's life to relieve suffering - is illegal in Switzerland.But assisted dying, in which a person receives lethal drugs from a medical practitioner which they then administer themselves, has been legal for decades.Dignitas said in a statement that it would continue to \"manage and develop the association in the spirit of its founder as a professional and combative international organisation for self-determination and freedom of choice in life and at the end of life\".If you've been affected by issues in this article, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "At least four people, including three children, have been killed in a mass shooting at a family gathering in California, authorities say.The victims were eight, nine, 14 and 21 years old, a spokesperson for the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said on Sunday. Eleven others were injured in the incident at a restaurant in the state's northern city of Stockton.A suspect is still on the loose and police say they believe the shooting may have been \"targeted\".The city's deputy mayor earlier said the shooting had occurred \"at a children's birthday party\". Police have not confirmed the type of event at which the shooting occurred, beyond it being a family gathering.\"[A] birthday party should never be a place where families fear for their lives,\" Deputy Mayor Jason Lee wrote on social media.The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said the shooting happened shortly before 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT on Sunday), and is appealing to anyone with \"information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of the incident\" to come forward.Spokeswoman Heather Brent described the incident as \"unfathomable\", adding: \"This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited.\"Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities.\"Stockton's Mayor Christina Fugazi called the shooting \"unacceptable\".\"Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.\"California has some of the strictest firearm laws in the US, and has in recent years faced challenges to it.In 2021, a federal judge overturned the state's ban on assault weapons, such as the AR-15 rifle. The following year, the US Supreme Court expanded gun rights as it struck down a New York law restricting gun-carrying rights, jeopardising similar regulation in California.''Families should be together instead of at the hospital'', says Stockton's mayor",

A spokesperson for the RAIB said a decision on any further action in relation to the matter would be taken once evidence gathered by inspectors had been reviewed.Network Rail's route director for the East Midlands Mark Budden said: \"Safety is our top priority and we are fully supporting the RAIB as part of their ongoing inquiries.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "8 hours agoJames Cook,Jerusalem,Paulin KolaandPatrick JacksonEPANetanyahu said a pardon would lead to national reconciliation in IsraelIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the country's President, Isaac Herzog, for a pardon over corruption cases he has been battling.  The president's office said Herzog would receive opinions from justice officials before considering the request \"which carries with it significant implications\".  Netanyahu has been standing trial for the past five years on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. He denies wrongdoing. He said in a video message that he would have preferred to see the process to the end but national interest \"demanded otherwise\". The Israeli opposition says he should admit guilt before seeking a pardon.Early this month, US President Donald Trump urged Herzog to \"fully pardon\" Netanyahu. At the time, Herzog made it clear that anyone seeking a pardon had to submit a formal request.On Sunday, his office released the request and a letter by Netanyahu himself, in light of \"the importance of this extraordinary request and its implications\".It offered no indication of when the president might reach a decision.In 2020, Benjamin Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to stand trial:In the first case, prosecutors alleged that he had received gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favoursHe is accused in a second case of offering to help improve the circulation of an Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverageAnd in a third, prosecutors have alleged that he promoted regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder of an Israeli telecoms company in exchange for positive coverage by a news website.Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and branded the trial as a \"witch hunt\" by political opponents.In Sunday's defiant video message, he claimed that the cases against him were collapsing, but that the process was tearing Israel apart from within.\"I am certain, as are many others in the nation, that an immediate end to the trial would greatly help lower the flames and promote broad reconciliation - something our country desperately needs,\" the prime minister added.Netanyahu said he was being required to testify before court three times a week, describing that as \"an impossible demand.\"A pardon, he insisted, would help Israel fend off threats and seize opportunities by fostering \"national unity\".His political opponents have accused Netanyahu of attempting to conflate his interests with those of the state.Opposition leader Yair Lapid said there could be no pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and Netanyahu's immediate retirement from political life.Yair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of Israeli forces, said \"only the guilty\" sought pardon.According to Israel's Basic Law, the president \"has the power to pardon criminals and reduce or transmute [alter] their sentence\".However, Israel's High Court of Justice has previously ruled that the president can pardon an individual before they are convicted if it is in the public interest or if there are extreme personal circumstances.Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and his supporters have always supported a  pardon for their leader.But for many in Israel - especially on the left - it would be seen as another move away from the country's sense of itself as a robust democracy with a strong legal system.Public concerns over the government's plans for judicial reform brought hundreds of thousands out on to the streets in protest for many months before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 which triggered the most recent Gaza war.In a separate case, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant last year for Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant over war crimes and crimes against humanity that have allegedly been committed during the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned the move as \"antisemitic\".",

A new batch of the chemical was received on Sunday, he said.South East Water incident manager, Marc Sims, said: \"We are aware of about 23,000 customers who are currently experiencing water supply issues, either low pressure or no water. \"The number has reduced from around 24,000 earlier today, with about 1,150 properties in the Pembury area back in supply following rezones.\"He said the firm was \"continuing to move water around and tankering into the network\" and was carrying out \"necessary water quality testing to get the site back up and running as soon as possible\".Bottled water has been selling out at supermarkets in the Tunbridge Wells areaThree bottled water stations have been set up in Tunbridge Wells - at Tunbridge Wells Sports Centre, Odeon Cinema Knights Way and RCP Parking.These are expected to be open until 22:30 on Sunday. \"However, due to the winter festival in Tonbridge, we have closed the Sovereign Way bottled water station,\" Mr Sims said. The incident manager said the SEW customer care team and Water Direct had delivered bottled water to more than 2,000 of its most vulnerable customers and would continue to do so throughout the evening.He added: \"Our teams have been out delivering bottles of water to care homes in the area. \"We are in direct contact with Tunbridge Wells Hospital and have organised a tanker to support them, and will continue to be in contact with them until this is resolved.\"Earlier on Sunday, Nicola Hodgson, who lives near the Pantiles in Tunbridge Wells, was among customers questioning why the first water station was set up in an \"entirely different town\".She said her husband had tried to visit the Tonbridge water station \"first thing this morning and there was nothing there\".\"We have two young children, aged five and seven, so [they] have decamped to their grandmothers' for the moment, so we can get them something to drink and have working toilets,\" she added.Customers in Tunbridge Wells are being affected by a problem at Pembury Water Treatment WorksTunbridge Wells MP Mike Martin said he was also without water and had spoken to the chief executive of SEW.He wrote on X: \"For those who are not aware, the problem has been caused by a bad batch of coagulant chemicals.\"A new set of chemicals have been procured and the team have been working through [Saturday] night to clean out Pembury Treatment Works.\"Meanwhile, Teresa Barrett, who runs the Black Horse in Camden Road, said the pub had been without running water since midnight on Saturday. She said: \"Sadly, this means it is illegal for us to open. If I could, I would be opening.\"The landlady said losing a day of trading would be \"extremely damaging\", adding:  \"I can't afford to be closed, I can't lose a day's trading in the current climate. \"Things are hard enough for hospitality right now, businesses in this sector would have prepared for table bookings today and lost an extreme amount of money, [and] staff will still need to be paid.\"Peter Vincent, who lives in Grove Hill, said he noticed that the \"cistern wasn't refilling properly\" on Sunday morning.\"We would get the flow and the pressure coming down the hill from the mains,\" he told BBC Radio Kent.\"For us to be slow like that, it's going to be pretty hard for some people somewhere in the town when they all start drawing their water off.\"Customers can sign up for the SEW Priority Services Register on its website.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "1 hour agoWill Grant,Mexico, Central America and Cuba correspondentandEmma RossiterGetty ImagesRixi Moncada, Salvador Nasralla and Nasry \"Tito\" AsfuraHondurans are casting their ballots in a general election that is being dominated by threats from US President Donald Trump.There are five presidential candidates on the bill, but the poll is essentially being seen as a three-way race between former defence minister Rixi Moncada of the leftist Libre party, TV host Salvador Nasralla from the centrist Liberals, and businessman Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura, of the right-wing National Party.Trump has thrown his support behind Asfura and threatened to cut financial aid to the Central American nation if he does not win.The most recent opinion poll puts Nasralla in the lead, but with 34% of voters saying they are still undecided, it could be anyone's race.Presidents in Honduras can only serve a single four-year term so the incumbent, Xiomara Castro, who was the country's first female president when she took office in 2021 for the Libre party, is not on the ballot.She has backed Moncada to take her place. The 60-year-old lawyer has pledged to protect \"natural wealth\" from \"21st-century filibusters who want to privatise everything\" if she wins. Moncada has also expressed her commitment to combating corruption \"in all its forms\".On Saturday, Moncada accused Trump of meddling in the election, calling his endorsement of her right-wing opponent \"totally interventionist\".Trump had said that the US would be \"very supportive\" if Tito Asfura wins Sunday's presidential election, which will also see voters choose all 128 members of congress and almost 300 local representatives.\"If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.The US sent more than $193m (£146m) to Honduras last fiscal year, according to the State Department website, and despite aid cuts, has sent more than $102m this year. The Trump Administration has already reportedly cut $167m in economic and governance aid that had been earmarked for 2024 and 2025, the Congress website says.In another post, Trump wrote that he and Asfura, who is the former mayor of the capital, Tegucigalpa, could \"work together to fight the Narcocommunists\" and counter drug trafficking.Nasry Asfura has pledged in a series of social media posts to bring \"development and opportunities for everyone\", to \"facilitate foreign and domestic investment into the country\" and \"generate employment for all.\"However, his party has been plagued by scandals and corruption accusations in recent years - including the sentencing of former party leader and ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández last year.Hernández was jailed for 45 years in the US on drug-smuggling and weapons charges - a decision Trump now intends to overturn.Asfura has carefully tried to distance himself from Hernández. On Friday he told news agency AFP that he has \"no ties\" with the ex-president, and that \"the party is not responsible for his personal actions.\"ReutersNasry \"Tito\" Asfura is seeking to restore his party's reputation after a series of scandals in recent yearsThe current front runner, though, is 72-year-old Salvador Nasralla, who is running for president for the fourth time.He claims that his win in 2017 was stolen due to \"electoral fraud perpetrated by Hernández\". This was never proven and a partial recount found no irregularities, though the decision did spark mass protests across the country.According to his campaign website, Nasralla says his government's main focus would be \"an open economy\", and that he is committed to generating employment. He also says that if he wins, he will sever ties with China and Venezuela.Tensions between Venezuela and the US have escalated recently - the US has built up its military presence in the area and carried out at least 21 deadly strikes on boats it says were carrying drugs. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has said the US actions are attempt to oust him.On Saturday, Trump declared that Venezuela's airspace should be considered closed, even though he does not have the power to do that.Beyond Honduras' relationship with the US, many voters are asking more fundamental questions about this race as they cast their ballots. Will the vote pass off smoothly and will the results be delivered on time? Will the ruling Libre party accept defeat and give up power if they lose? Crucially, will the armed forces, who have been accused of creeping politicisation, remain independent and not aligned with any individual party or politician?Polls for the single-round elections opened at 07:00 CST (13:00 GMT) and will close after 10 hours of voting. Pre-emptive accusations of election fraud, made both by the ruling party and opposition, have sown mistrust in the vote and sparked fears of post-election unrest. It prompted the president of the National Electoral Council, Ana Paola Hall, to warn all parties \"not to fan the flames of confrontation or violence\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoHafsa KhalilReutersAt least 146 people are now known to have died in the devastating fire that tore through high-rise buildings in Hong Kong on Wednesday.Police announced the new death toll on Sunday, cautioning that they \"cannot rule out the possibility of further fatalities\". There still 150 people missing, and the blaze left 79 injured.Seven of eight tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in the northerly Tai Po district rapidly went up in flames. Accusations that the fire was spread by flammable construction materials have sparked widespread anger.Three days of national mourning started on Saturday, and thousands have gathered at the scene to mourn the victims.There have been queues stretching a long as 2km (1.2 miles), as people wait to lay flowers and handwritten notes.Indonesian worker Romlah Rosidah said she was \"very surprised\" at how many people had turned up to pray for the victims.\"This event was only spread on social media, but [it] turned out their hearts moved,\" she told news agency Reuters.A Filipino worker said they had joined the prayers to \"show the Hong Kong community that we are one in this situation\".Officials observed three minutes' silence to begin the mourning period, and the flags of China and Hong Kong are flying at half-staff.The fire is Hong Kong's deadliest in more than 70 years, and the death toll has been rising each day, as officials work to recover and identify bodies.The exact cause of the blaze has yet to be determined. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovations that had been taking place on the towers, while three others were detained on manslaughter charges.Ching Sze Yip/BBCChing Sze Yip/BBCAmong the tributes added are handwritten messages for the victims of the fireHundreds of flower bouquets have been laid down as people queue to mourn and pay their respectsThe fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.Police official Tsang Shuk-yin said on Sunday that officers had so far completed searches of four of the tower blocks.Indonesia's consulate in Hong Kong said at least seven of its nationals had died from the fire, while the Philippines' consulate said one of its citizens had died.Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.The fire department said the blaze had reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F), and 12 firefighters were injured.The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on plastic netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.The buildings were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used for construction work in Hong Kong. The fire has renewed a debate about whether it should still be used.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said that those arrested in the corruption investigation included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors. A police spokesperson previously said they had reason to believe \"those in charge at the company were grossly negligent\", which led to the fire and caused it to \"spread uncontrollably\".Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.Separately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry into the fire.Wang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse. The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died. ",

It said passengers would be able to use their tickets with other train companies at no extra cost.

He shared 136 with Rohit, who made 57 off 51 balls, for the second wicket.Rohit, who already held the record for the most sixes across formats in international cricket (now 642), hit three sixes to overtake Shahid Afridi's 15-year record of 351 ODI maximums. India were 161-2 in the 22nd over when the former captain was dismissed and run-scoring became more difficult in the middle overs but the hosts were superbly marshalled by Kohli.He also shared 76 with stand-in captain KL Rahul, who then took over when Kohli was dismissed, to hit 60 off 56 balls. South Africa slipped to 11-3 in reply and 130-5 but Matthew Breetzke (72 off 80) and Marco Jansen (70 off 39) gave them hope with a 97-run stand. Both were dismissed in the 34th over by Kuldeep Yadav and South Africa's hopes seemed over at 228-7. However, Corbin Bosch (67 off 51) put on partnerships with Prenelan Subrayen and Nandre Burger, who both made 17, to leave the Proteas needing 37 from 18 balls.Bosch was farming the strike and turning down singles and left 18 from the final over, but he skied the second ball from Prasidh Krishna to cover. The second game in the three-match series takes place on Wednesday (08:00 GMT). ",

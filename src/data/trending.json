    "body": "Why have English teams dominated as Real & PSG face play-offs?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Tottenham finished fourth in the Champions League but are 14th in the Premier LeagueBySam DruryBBC Sport journalist and Gary RoseBBC Sport journalistThe Premier League is flexing its muscles in Europe as five English teams finished in the top eight of the Champions League to reach the knockouts.That could become six in the last 16 if Newcastle win their two-legged play-off after they finished 12th in the league phase following a 1-1 draw at defending champions PSG on Wednesday.Arsenal finished in first place with Liverpool third, Tottenham fourth, Chelsea sixth and Manchester City finishing eighth.History could be made if Newcastle progress through the play-offs as never before have there been six Premier League teams in the Champions League knockouts.\"That is dominant,\" said Spurs boss Thomas Frank. \"I think we all said for a few years the Premier League is the best league in the world and I think this is another sign of it.\"So why have Premier League sides been so dominant against Europe's elite?Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesFinancial power and physicality?The most obvious starting point is the financial power of the Premier League, which significantly outweighs other leagues.Six Premier League sides sit inside the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League, while 50% of the top 30 come from the English top flight.TV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.Last summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.To highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent in the summer window was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.More money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big to increase their strength in depth as they finished first in the league phase of the Champions League and sit top of the Premier League.\"The biggest single reason that the English clubs have been dominant so far is the financial power of the Premier League,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport.\"Also, it is about how competitive they have got by fighting it out and being in and around each other - they have pushed each other on.\"Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon also says a more open style of play in Europe has benefited English teams, while the Premier League is \"more physical than I've ever known it to be\".\"I think in the Champions League, teams are more open. They all try to play. It's less transitional,\" he added.\"It [the Premier League] is like a basketball game sometimes, it's so relentless physically. There's not much control, it's a running game and sometimes it's about duels, whoever wins the duels wins the game. Or moments.\"The Champions League is a bit more of an older style of game, more football based. Teams come and try and play proper football.\"In the Premier League, you see a lot more long throw-ins, set pieces - it's become a lot slower and more set piece based, I would say.\"Did Premier League teams have easier fixtures?It is undoubtedly an impressive achievement for five - and potentially six - Premier League teams to reach the knockouts.But was the fixture computer kinder for them than other teams?At the start of the season, football data statisticians Opta analysed, external every team's Champions League fixtures and ranked them all to work out who had the kindest draw.Arsenal's fixtures were ranked the third easiest, with Tottenham fourth, Liverpool seventh and Chelsea eighth.Manchester City were deemed to have the 14th easiest fixtures while Newcastle - who played defending champions Paris St-Germain - were 32nd in the rankings.Image gallerySkip image galleryImage source, OptaSlide 1 of 2, Easiest Champions League fixures, On target to be record breakers, but could fatigue hit?The last - and only - time five Premier League teams made it through to the knockouts was in 2017, when Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed.However just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to the final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.With five Premier League sides finishing in the top eight of this season's league phase, and therefore avoiding the prospect of facing one another in the last-16, there is the chance of a record number of English teams making the quarter-finals.Having numerous English clubs in latter stages of the Champions League is nothing new with four sides progressing to the quarters in both 2007-08 and 2008-09, as well as 2018-19 - leading to an all-English final in 07-08 and 2018-19.No other country have ever had four teams in the quarter-finals - this year England could have as many as six.But the demands of playing in the Premier League alongside the Champions League takes its toll, which is why many managers were relieved to avoid the two extra play-off games.\"I still think it will be very difficult for one of them to go on and win it, just because of how difficult the Premier League is every week - whether you are fighting for the title or for a place in the top four,\" Warnock added.\"Clearly the English clubs are in a good position going into the knockout stages, though. Some of the other big clubs that we thought would peak or start to show better form - like Paris St-Germain for example - have not really got going yet.\"How are other countries doing?Media caption, Benfica keeper scores stoppage time goal to seal win over Real MadridThe three other countries who had teams join English sides in progressing to the knockouts were Germany (Bayern Munich), Spain (Barcelona) and Portugal (Sporting CP).That has left some surprises having to go through via the play-offs, with Paris St-Germain failing to get the win they needed against Newcastle to secure a top-eight spot.Real Madrid, meanwhile, were on the wrong end of a thrilling and dramatic match with Benfica. Real were reduced to nine men while a last-second goal by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin secured a memorable 4-2 win for Jose Mourinho's side that earned them a play-off spot.Other big sides who are facing the lottery of the play-offs include Italian sides Juventus and Inter Milan, along with Germany's Borussia Dortmund and Spain's Atletico Madrid - who were stunned by Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday.The Norwegians have been the surprise package of the Champions League and their win against Atletico came just eight days after they beat Manchester City.Those results meant they are into the play-offs and have become the first Norwegian side to progress from the league or group phase in Champions League since Rosenborg in 1996-97.Champions League highlightsMedia caption, Spurs see off Frankfurt to secure automatic last-16 spotMedia caption, Joao Pedro scores superb double to give Chelsea top-eight finishMedia caption, Man City avoid play-offs with win against GalatasarayMedia caption, Salah scores Liverpool's third in victory over QarabagMedia caption, Newcastle come from behind to draw with holders PSGMedia caption, Arsenal maintain perfect record with narrow win over KairatWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.

    "body": "6 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersA passenger plane has crashed in northern Colombia, killing all 15 people on board, the country's state-run airline Satena confirmed.In a statement, it said its aircraft - a Beechcraft 1900 - \"suffered a fatal accident\", but gave no further details. The wreckage has now been located in a mountainous area.The official passenger list includes lawmaker Diógenes Quintero Amaya and Carlos Salcedo, a candidate in upcoming congressional elections.Satena earlier said contact with the plane was lost 11 minutes before it had been scheduled to land in the city of Ocaña, near the Venezuelan border, at 12:05 local time (17:05 GMT) on Wednesday.According to the airline, Flight NSE 8849 took off from the city of Cúcuta, about 100km (62 miles) north-east from Ocaña, carrying 13 passengers and two crew members. A search operation has been launched in the mountainous area, and a hotline was set up for the relatives of those who were on the plane. Speaking to local news outlet Semana, governor of Norte de Santander William Villamizar said seven bodies have been recovered.Colombia's armed forces have been helping with the search effort in the area where the plane went missing, which has areas controlled by Colombia's ELN guerrilla group. The country's president Gustavo Petro expressed his condolences to the families of the victims on X, writing \"I am deeply sorry for these deaths\".A statement acknowledging Quintero's death has been shared from his Facebook page, describing him as \"a man who throughout his life served those who needed it most\".Quintero held one of 16 seats in Colombia's parliament intended to represent victims of conflict between between the Marxist rebel army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), and the Colombian state.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMany of the papers have headlined on Iran, with the Mail declaring: \"Countdown to conflagration\". It says US President Donald Trump has issued a \"chilling threat\" to the Middle Eastern nation, demanding that the Ayatollah make a nuclear deal or \"face an overwhelming military onslaught\". Tehran says that any attack on Iran would be considered an \"act of war\", the Mail reports.The Guardian writes that a US armada \"heads towards Iran\", and notes that it is \"prepared to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence if necessary\" as per Trump's post to Truth Social. The \"decline of Britain's high streets\" also features prominently on the front page, with new research from the University of Southhampton indicating that the Labour Party must address the problem or risk being \"washed away in a tide of discontent\". \"Trump's war threat to Iran\" says the Mirror, alongside a photo of the USS Abraham Lincoln, which reportedly leads the armada currently en route to the Gulf.The unfolding situation in Iran has been labelled a \"nuclear ultimatum\" by the i Paper, which reports that people are fleeing Tehran in anticipation of an imminent attack. Iran's foreign minister has said that armed forces are ready \"with fingers on the trigger\" to \"powerfully respond\" to aggression.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is the focus of the Daily Telegraph's leading story, which says he called for European human rights laws to be invoked in order to investigate British soldiers in Iraq, in a book published by \"disgraced lawyer\" Phil Shiner. The piece follows on from the paper's front page yesterday, which revealed Sir Keir's involvement in a landmark legal case in 2007. A No 10 spokesperson said that the prime minister assisted the court on points of law, but did not advocate for either side. \"The prime minister was not involved in the subsequent case heard in the European Court of Human Rights,\" the spokesperson said, and added that allegations were a \"desperate and deliberate misrepresentation\".\"PM shelves fresh plan to overhaul benefits\" reads the Times, which says that Sir Keir has vetoed plans for a new attempt to reform the UK's welfare system. Two reviews of the welfare state are due to report this year, it reports, but both are expected to require legislation. This latest decision by the prime minister makes welfare reform before the next election unlikely, according to the paper.The Express quotes Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch on its front page, following a speech where she addressed recent defections to Reform UK. \"My party is for serious people and not drama queens,\" said Badenoch, and claimed those joining Nigel Farage were having a \"tantrum dressed up as politics\".The world's biggest mining companies have added almost half a trillion dollars to their valuations this year, according to the Financial Times. The paper notes that the \"biggest winners\" included Rio Tinto and Glencore, as well as Sydney-listed BHP and China's Zijin Mining.A retired police official has told the Sun that he believes nurse Lucy Letby is innocent, and that her conviction could be \"the greatest miscarriage of justice this century\". Letby is currently serving 15 life sentences in jail for the murder of seven babies, and the attempted murder of seven more.The Metro reports that a British lotto winner has been jailed for building a \"drug empire\" worth £228m. The paper says the man, 80, won £2.4m in 2010.\"Spend it like Beckham\" says the Star, pricing a wine featured in Brooklyn Beckham's Instagram post at £80,000.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Keep suspended pupils in school, ministers say3 hours agoHazel ShearingEducation correspondentGetty ImagesThe government hopes the move will limit the amount of learning suspended pupils miss Pupils should not automatically be sent home if they are suspended from school in England and could instead remain on site, the government has said.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said being sent home could mean children \"retreating to social media\".She said on-site suspensions should be used for pupils who had not been violent.The Department for Education (DfE) said the move, which will form part of broader changes to the school system in England, should limit the amount of learning pupils miss.Pupils can be removed from classrooms without being suspended, and many schools already use internal suspensions - although what that looks like can vary.The DfE said pupils could sometimes be set \"generic work that does not support learning or reintegration\" when they were internally suspended, and it would make clear that \"internal suspension is a short, structured intervention with meaningful learning and time for reflection\".The number and rate of suspensions had been increasing before Covid, but the rise has accelerated ever since.The number of suspensions increased by 21% between 2022-23 and 2023-24 - from 787,000 to 955,000. Over the same period, the rate of suspensions rose from 9.33 per 100 pupils in 2022-23 to 11.31 in 2023-24. The largest percentage rise was in primary schools.Head teachers will decide which form suspensions should take.Richard Walkden, head teacher at Ecclesfield Secondary School in Sheffield, said sending children home was seen as a last resort, but suspensions demonstrated to pupils that there were \"lines in the sand\" when it came to behaviour.\"Suspensions are never easy. They cause harm,\" he said.\"Lost learning is the biggest one. Students get one chance at education in secondary. They've got five years and every day matters.\"But he added: \"I fundamentally understand running the schools I have done for many years, that suspensions sometimes are needed and required.\"BBC/ Hazel ShearingHead teacher Richard Walkden says suspensions cause harm, including lost learning Phillipson said: \"Suspensions will always play a critical role in helping heads manage poor behaviour, but time at home today can too easily mean children retreating to social media, gaming and the online world.\"She said it resulted in \"high levels of lost learning\", adding: \"We want to restore suspensions as the serious sanction they should be, while keeping young people engaged in their education and reducing the time teachers spend helping pupils catch up.\"Pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (Send) and those who are eligible for free school meals have much higher rates of suspensions and permanent exclusions than average.Schools can give up to three reasons for suspending a pupil. In 2023-24, \"persistent disruptive behaviour\" made up more than half (51%) of all reasons given for suspensions.\"Physical assault against a pupil\" made up 13% and \"physical assault against an adult\" accounted for 6%.The DfE said \"the most serious and violent behaviour\" would still result in pupils being removed from school. Permanent exclusions will continue to exist.It said it would consult on a new \"framework\" that would \"give heads the flexibility to ensure pupils facing suspension for non-violent behaviour continue learning in a separate, supervised setting, away from other pupils\".The measure will feature in the government's delayed Schools White Paper, which will also set out plans to reform the Send system.Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the BBC he welcomed greater consistency but had some concerns.\"The fear for head teachers will be how will they be held to account for the data that they share [and] how can they make sure that they've got the resources and investment to do the best possible job for internal seclusions and internal exclusions - because all of that requires a lot of investment,\" he said. Matt Wrack, general secretary of NASUWT teachers' union, said there was an opportunity to \"offer helpful clarity\" for schools, but questioned \"how these expectations will be fulfilled in every school in the absence of any additional funding or resources to support these measures\".Marianne Lagrue, a policy manager at Coram Children's Legal Centre, said existing approaches to internal suspensions and removing pupils from classrooms varied. She said \"worst case scenarios\" existed where children were being kept in isolation away from friends and the classroom for months \"without being suspended or excluded formally\".Isolation could be particularly difficult for pupils with certain types of Send, she added.\"We hope that with the Schools White Paper... the Department for Education will take the opportunity to make sure that those children get better support rather than just being isolated in a room with no stimulation.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoYasmin RufoLeicester SquareGetty ImagesChris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo have been close friends for many yearsChris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo are no strangers to sharing the screen, having previously starred together in Marvel films such as Thor and Hulk.Now the pair have reunited for a very different type of film.They are starring alongside each other in Crime 101, a tense thriller that swaps superhero spectacle for a game of psychological cat and mouse.Speaking at the premiere, Hemsworth told the BBC that their long-standing friendship brought both energy and challenges to the set.\"The two of us get together and we're like a couple of naughty kids at school that need to be wrangled to be focused,\" he said. In the film, Hemsworth plays an elusive jewel thief planning one final heist, while Ruffalo stars as a determined detective intent on catching him.While the pair are well known for their comedic chemistry, Crime 101 marks a shift into darker territory.\"We have a familiarity in the comedic space,\" Hemsworth said. \"This is a dramatic film so it was quite an adjustment and discomfort at first.\"Getty ImagesMonica Barbaro (second left), Halle Berry (third left), and Barry Keoghan (second right) also star in Crime 101 Ruffalo said Crime 101 gave Hemsworth the opportunity to take on a very different type of role from those that audiences may be used to seeing.\"I got to see him do something I've been dying to see him do that I know he can do but hadn't had the director to help him,\" the 58-year-old actor said. \"When I saw him walk on set, I didn't recognise him, he was totally transformed and I thought this is what I want to see you do.\" The Poor Things actor revealed that the pair had been discussing working together outside the Marvel universe for years.\"We've been talking about doing a project for years,\" he said. \"I love him and we have a really close relationship. We always see each other and ask, 'What are we going to do together?'\"Ruffalo said it was Hemsworth who first approached him about the film.\"Chris reached out to me immediately. I read the script and thought, absolutely,\" he said.Getty ImagesBerry plays an insurance broker who gets entangled in the heistStarring alongside Hemsworth and Ruffalo is Halle Berry, who plays an insurance broker who gets entangled in the heist. The 59-year-old said her character showed that \"women of a certain age are not indispensable and resists that by standing up for herself\". That mentality is very similar to how Berry sees herself, telling the BBC she is focused on \"building a company to help women going through perimenopause\", which she was diagnosed with in her early 50s.The American actor says she is \"always\" being pigeonholed into a certain role due to her age but she \"resists at every turn\". Berry is set to play President Joanna Duncan, a gender-swapped version of the lead role from the The President is Missing, a political thriller novel by Bill Clinton. \"It's my fantasy to have a female American president and I would love to see a woman lead the country and I hope to get to see that in my lifetime but at least I get to play one.\" 'Grit and authenticity'Crime 101 features all the classic car chases and stunts you'd imagine from an old school crime thriller and Hemsworth said that was one of the most enjoyable parts of filming. \"The stunts were intense for all the right reasons - you have the adrenaline pumping and you're like a big kid, and that's what I love about doing those films.\" The Australian actor joked that his upbringing \"on farms where we were bashing about in old cars\" helped prepare him for the car chasing stunts. Avoiding stunt doubles and green screen added to the film's authenticity, according to Hemsworth. \"It is really us experiencing those emotions so there's an added layer of grit and authenticity,\" he said. Outside of acting, Hemsworth has been throwing himself into new challenges, from fitness experiments to learning new skills.His Limitless documentary sees him explore ways to live longer and healthier and as part of the show which aired last summer he learnt to play drums, eventually performing live with Ed Sheeran. National GeographicHemsworth joined Ed Sheeran on stage in Romania last year after learning to play the drums\"I had planned to continue the drumming,\" he said, \"but that period was so intense I get PTSD when I see a drum set.\"With three children, he said he knew he should return to it \"for my brain health\", but suggested his brief moment on stage might remain a one-off.\"Ed Sheeran is doing a tour in Australia and he said he'd come get me and three beers into that conversation I agreed. \"I thought about it again when I was sober and told him I'm not doing that again. I've done it once and checked that box.\" ",

    "body": "5 hours agoTheo LeggettBusiness CorrespondentSimon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBritish car, van, truck and bus production fell to its lowest level since 1952 last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).Its chief executive Mike Hawes said it had been \"the toughest year in a generation\", with output hit by a major cyberattack at Jaguar Land Rover, the closure of Vauxhall's plant in Luton and deep uncertainty over US trade policy.The situation is expected to improve this year, with the introduction of new electric models. The SMMT believes production of cars and vans could exceed 1million by 2027.But Hawes warned that \"increasingly protectionist\" proposals emerging from  Brussels represented a \"significant threat\" to the UK industry.Overall, 764,715 vehicles were built in 2025, which was 15.5% fewer than in 2024. The vast majority of these were cars, with 717,371 leaving the production line. That was some 60,000 fewer than last year.Last year, vehicle manufacturing was badly affected by a number of one-off or temporary issues. They included the cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover, which forced the company to shut down its computer networks and brought its factories to a halt at the beginning of September.Facilities which would normally build thousands of cars each week remained idle for more than a month, and production did not get back to normal for some time after that.With roughly 78% of the cars built in the UK destined for export, the industry is also vulnerable to trade disruption. US President Donald Trump's sudden announcement in April of import taxes, or tariffs, on cars sent to America prompted some manufacturers to limit shipments there.Ultimately, a deal was done which removed the threat of very high levies. But the basic tariff on UK cars exported to the US still increased from 2.5% to 10%, and had a dampening effect on sales.A further factor that limited car production last year was the earlier decision by Nissan and JLR to end production of ageing models while preparing their factories to produce a new generation of electric vehicles.The latest version of Nissan's electric Leaf began rolling out of its factory in Sunderland in mid-December, while JLR's new electric Range Rover and the first of a new generation of electric Jaguars are due to emerge from its Solihull plant later this year.Output of commercial vehicles, meanwhile, fell 62% last year to just 47,344. The bulk of the decline was caused by the closure of Vauxhall's plant in Luton, which shut its doors for good in late March. Parent company Stellantis is consolidating its UK van production at its Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire.The SMMT believes this year will be better, with car output expected to rise by 10% as production of new models ramps up. According to Hawes, there is a \"pathway\" to increasing output of cars and vans to more than 1 million per year by 2027.This \"optimisitic but realistic\" target would rely on the introduction of more new models, he said, as well as a recovery in demand in key export markets, especially in Europe. It would also require the government to implement key parts of its Modern Industrial Strategy, notably measures to drive down what the SMMT describes as the UK's stubbornly high cost of energy.The government's own target is more ambitious. It wants the UK to produce 1.3 million vehicles a year by 2035. For that to happen, according to Hawes, a new manufacturer would need to set up a factory in the UK – with a Chinese firm the most likely target. \"In terms of who is expanding their production globally, obviously it's the Chinese,\" he said.However, the UK industry is also facing threats which could significantly harm future production.Hawes expressed deep concern about what he called a shift towards a 'Made in Europe' approach from the EU authorities. This included plans to restrict government subsidies for low emission vehicles to those built in Europe, as well as measures forcing corporate fleets to favour European-made cars.\"Unless the UK can be seen as part of that, these proposals could have the effect of delivering what Brexit didn't deliver – and that's making it much harder for UK produced vehicles to access the European market,\" he said. \"So this is a significant threat.\"He also pointed to tougher European Union 'rules of origin' measures which are due to come into force in January next year. These will significantly increase the amount of parts and components produced in the EU or the UK that needs to be included in electric vehicles exported in either direction, if they are to be exempted from steep tariffs imposed at the border.However, many EVs being transported across the channel still do not meet these requirements. This is largely because battery-building capacity in the UK and Europe has not grown as quickly as was expected when the rules were drawn up. Hawes said he was hoping an agreement could be reached during the year, in order to give manufacturers more time to comply.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJessica RawnsleyEPA/ShutterstockSeveral cars were damaged in one coastal area after the roof of a university collapsedAt least five people have died after Storm Kristin tore through central and northern Portugal, causing flooding, landslides and widespread damage.The storm, which the government described as an \"extreme climactic event\", left schools shuttered, buildings damaged and travel severely disrupted. In the coastal city of Figueira da Foz, a Ferris wheel overturned and several vehicles were hit when part of a roof was torn from a building.Portugal has been hit by a succession of storms in recent days, including one over the weekend in which a man died after his car was swept away in floods.Heavy rain and wind gusts of up to 150km (95 miles) per hour caused more than 3,000 weather-related incidents across the country, civil protection authorities said. Several people were struck by falling trees or debris. The strongest winds were recorded at the Monte Real air base in Leiria, where gusts of 178km were recorded before the monitoring equipment was destroyed. Officials said the location was likely the storm's entry point to mainland Portugal.More than 850,000 people lost power on Wednesday, according to electricity distributor E-Redes. EPAA ferris wheel was overturned and several vehicles were hit when part of a roof was torn from a buildingThe civil protection agency (ANEPC) reported that three people had died in the central district of Leiria - one of the worst affected areas.In Leira, one person was hit by a metal sheet, and another was trapped in the structure of a house, according to officials. Local media said a man in Vila Franca de Xira died when a tree struck his car, local media said. There were also reports of a death in the Marinha Grande area.Transport across Portugal has been severely disrupted, with roads - including the main motorway connecting Lisbon to the north - and railways blocked by debris.Ten coastal areas were placed under a red weather warning on Wednesday due to dangerous sea conditions, with waves forecast to reach up to 14m (45ft,11in), according to the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA).The PSP (Public Security Police) urged people in Coimbra and Leira to stay inside, while Portugal's Secretary of State for Civil Protection said the country remained on maximum alert.Prime Minister Luis Montenegro expressed condolences to the victims' families. He said authorities were assessing the damage and would take \"whatever measures are necessary\".Meanwhile, Leiria's mayor, Goncalo Lopes, urged the government to declare a state of emergency.\"We have public spaces turned upside down,\" he told reporters. \"It's something that will require a very large recovery effort in the coming months. The impact is similar to what a bomb could mean in our city, with massive destruction.\"After crossing Portugal, Storm Kristin moved east into Spain - bringing with it snow, rain and strong winds. The storm caused widespread disruption across the country, with schools, roads and train lines closed and hundreds of thousands without power.In Andalusia, emergency services reported some 2,000 weather-related incidents.Spain's national weather agency, AEMET, warned of very strong winds in some areas, with gusts expected to reach hurricane force. A red weather alert has been issued for parts of Almeria in the south-east due to the strength of the wind.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesWater bills will rise by £2.70 a month on average from April, a year on from hefty increases for households in many parts of the country.The average annual bill in England and Wales will increase by £33 to £639, prompting calls for a \"stronger safety net\" for those unable to pay.The size of the increase and the cost of the average bill both vary widely across different regions, with one water-only supplier raising prices by 13%.The industry trade body, Water UK, said bill increases were needed to fund vital upgrades to the system and tackle spillages that have caused a public outcry. The figures come a few days after it was announced water bills in Scotland would rise by an average of £42 a year (up 8.7%), taking the average bill to £532 a year.Firms have been granted permission by the regulator to increase bills to pay for upgrades after decades of underinvestment, as public anger has simmered about sewage released into the UK's rivers and seas. Household water bills climbed by £10 a month to an average of more than £600 last April, and this year will see another above-inflation increase.The average bill in England and Wales will go up by 5.4%, compared to the latest Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation of 3.4%.However, different suppliers charge different amounts, and the increases vary sharply too.Getty ImagesSouth East Water required bottle stations during disruptions to suppliesThames Water, which raised prices significantly nearly a year ago, will only increase bills by an average of £3 a year, or 0.4%, this April, taking its average bill to  £658 a year.At the other end of the scale among water and sewerage companies, customers of Severn Trent Water will see a rise of 10% (up £52 to £587). Hafren Dyfrdwy is raising annual bills by 9% (up £54 to £635), and United Utilities is also increasing bills by 9% (up £57 to £660).Among water-only companies, customers of Affinity Water's central region will see a 13% increase. Bristol Water is raising average bills by 12%, but bills in Affinity Water's East region will only go up by 0.4%.Some 30,000 properties had no water at the height of the problems which the company blamed, in part, on Storm Goretti and a power cut at a pumping plant.'Urgent' investmentIndustry trade body Water UK said companies were preparing to invest £20bn over the year to secure water supplies, support economic growth and end sewage entering rivers and seas.\"While we urgently need investment in our water and sewage infrastructure, we know that for many this increase will be difficult,\" said chief executive David Henderson.He said 2.5 million households would be supported through discounted social tariffs and other affordability measures.But the Consumer Council for Water, which represents customers, said a patchwork of different social tariff schemes meant where someone lived - rather than their actual level of need - could determine what support they received.\"A stronger safety net is also needed for those who simply can't afford these bill rises,\" said its chief executive, Mike Keil.The group said people could cut bills by:Checking if they are eligible to discounted tariffsTrialling a water meterSaving water, for example, by setting a time limit on showersThe water regulator Ofwat said it would monitor companies' performance and hold them to account.\"If they do not deliver on their commitments, they will be made to return money to customers in their future bills,\" it said.Graphics by Tommy Lumby",

    "body": "12 hours agoSoroush PakzadBBC PersianBBCX-rays showed birdshot embedded in the legs of a wounded protester\"People helped us and we got into a car... I said, 'Don't take us to a hospital.'\"Tara and her friend were attending a protest in the central Iranian city of Isfahan when security forces arrived on motorcycles and began shouting at the crowd.\"My friend told an armed member of the security forces, 'Just don't shoot us,' and he immediately fired several shots at us. We fell to the ground. All our clothes were covered in blood,\" she said.They were bundled into a stranger's car, but Tara said they were too frightened to be taken to the hospital because of the risk of being arrested. \"All the alleyways were full of security forces, so I asked a couple standing at their front door to let us in.\"They stayed at the couple's home until it was almost dawn and then managed to find a doctor they knew, who cleaned the birdshot wounds on their legs, according to Tara.She said a surgeon was later able to remove some of the birdshot at home but warned them: \"They cannot all be removed and will remain in your bodies.\"All names in this article have been changed for their safety.Warning: This story contains details and images which some readers might find distressing.The full scale of the bloodshed resulting from the crackdown by security forces on the anti-government protests that swept across Iran this month is still not known because of an internet shutdown and a ban on reporting by most international news organisations.But the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, 112 children, 50 bystanders and 214 affiliated with the government. It is also investigating reports of 17,091 more deaths.At least another 11,000 protesters were seriously wounded, according to HRANA.Some of them have told the BBC that they have avoided seeking treatment for their injuries at hospitals because they fear being arrested.That has left them reliant on doctors, nurses and other volunteers willing to risk their own safety by treating them secretly at their homes.Healthcare workers have also told the BBC that security forces are present in hospitals and that they are constantly monitoring patients' medical records to identify injured protesters.Tara was able to find doctors willing to treat her wounds at their homesNima, a surgeon in Tehran, said he witnessed many young people being injured in the streets on his way to work on 8 January, when authorities responded to the escalating protests with lethal force.\"I put one of the wounded in the boot of my car to take him to hospital, as I was worried that we would get in trouble if we were stopped by the police,\" he told the BBC.Nima said armed officers stopped him but allowed him to go after seeing his hospital identification card.\"For almost 96 hours straight - without interruption, without sleep, without even closing our eyes for a moment - we were operating. We were crying and operating. Nobody complained.\"\"All our clothes and hospital gowns were covered in blood - our outer clothes, our underwear, everything was soaked in the blood of these young people.\"Nima described operating on one man who had been shot in the leg and face at a protest.\"A bullet had entered through his chin, ripped through his mouth and exited through his upper jaw,\" he recalled.Nima also said many of the young people treated at his hospital suffered gunshot wounds to their vital organs and limbs that required amputation and left them with permanent disabilities.Blood was seen on the floor of a hospital in TehranIranian authorities have said more than 3,100 people have been killed during the unrest, but that majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Health ministry spokesman Hossein Shokri was also quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency as saying that around 13,000 operations had been carried out during the unrest.\"Fortunately, people trust the ministry of health and hospitals, and confidence that all injured individuals are treated impartially in medical centres has led around 3,000 people who had been treating themselves at home over the past six days to seek care at hospitals,\" he added.The head of the Farabi Eye Hospital in Tehran, Dr Qasem Fakhrai, told Isna, another semi-official news agency, that it had treated a total of 700 patients with severe eye injuries requiring emergency surgery as of 10 January, and referred almost 200 to other hospitals. He said almost all of the patients were admitted after 8 January.Imanemunmusic/XVideo footage from a street in eastern Tehran showed wounded people fleeing the sound of gunfire at a protestSaeed told the BBC that his friend's eyes were hit by birdshot fired by security forces during a protest in the central city of Arak.Local doctors told him to go to a specialist eye hospital in Tehran, he said.Upon arrival, nurses took protesters with eye injuries to operating theatres through the back by using staff lifts.According to Saeed's friend, around 200 people with eye injuries from different cities were being treated at that hospital.\"He had two operations, but the surgeon did not charge him,\" Saeed said.A healthcare worker in Tehran also said that doctors were trying to avoid mentioning gunshot wounds in medical records because they were being constantly monitored by security forces.Vahid OnlineVideo footage from early January showed security forces storming a hospital in Ilam where activists said wounded protesters were being treatedSina took his brother to a hospital after he was shot in the legs during protests in Tehran.\"It was like a battlefield hospital - there were so many wounded that there were no blankets or medical kits,\" Sina told the BBC.\"When I asked a nurse for a blanket for my brother, she told me to bring one from home because there were too many injured and not enough supplies.\"Sina said they had no choice but to give their actual ID number in order to use their health insurance. \"At any moment, the security forces could raid our home,\" he added.In smaller cities, the situation is believed to be even more dire.Reports received by the BBC said security forces had abducted patients from hospitals and that they had not been seen again.HRANADr Alireza Golchini, a surgeon in Qazvin, has reportedly been arrested for treating injured protestersHuman rights groups have also said that medics and others who have treated injured protesters are now themselves being targeted by security forces.Iran Human Rights (IHR) said last week its sources on the ground in Iran had reported the arrest of at least five doctors and a volunteer first responder. \"Security agencies appear to be aiming to intimidate the public and obstruct treatment for injured protesters by arresting doctors and raiding makeshift medical shelters,\" the Norway-based organisation warned.And this week, sources close to Dr Alireza Golchini, a surgeon from the northern city of Qazvin, said he had been beaten up at his home by security forces when they arrested him for treating injured protesters.They added that he had been accused of \"moharebeh\" (enmity against God) - an offence that can carry the death penalty under Iranian law.Additional reporting by Faren Taghizadeh and Maryam Afshang, BBC Persian",

    "body": "5 hours agoKali HaysSan FranciscoReutersMeta boss Mark Zuckerberg plans to ramp up spending on artificial intelligence (AI) projects this year, even as other executives warn of a potential bubble in the industry.During a call with financial analysts on Wednesday to discuss the Facebook-owner's 2025 financial results, the company said it expects to spend up to $135bn (£97bn) this year, mostly on infrastructure related to AI.That is nearly twice the $72bn Meta spent last year on AI projects and infrastructure.In the last three years, the technology giant has spent roughly $140bn in an attempt to get ahead of the AI boom.Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that he is expecting \"2026 to be the year that AI dramatically changes the way we work.\"His comments came as Meta's figures showed expenses rose faster than revenues, which squeezed profit margins, during the last three months of 2025.Meta shares were around 6.5% higher in extended trading in New York after the announcement.In addition to explaining the potential benefits of such massive AI investment, Zuckerberg's comments seemed to hint at further layoffs at the tech giant.\"We're starting to see projects that used to take big teams now be accomplished by a single, very talented person,\" he said.Already this year, Meta has laid off several hundred workers mainly in its Reality Labs division, a part of the company that focuses on its \"metaverse\" ambitions, hardware products and AI initiatives. Zuckerberg said Meta is investing more across the company in AI tools that help employees like software engineers complete more work.As workers use the tools to become \"significantly more productive,\" he said there is \"a big delta between the people who do it and do it well and the people who don't.\"\"What we were talking about is, I think it's very hard for anyone exactly to predict what the shape of how organisations working is going to feel, but I just think the fact that agents are really starting to work now is quite profound,\" he added.Some in the industry warn that such major investments risk creating an AI bubble, similar to one seen in the dotcom boom that peaked in 2000.Chuck Robbins, chairman and chief executive of Cisco Systems, told the BBC that while AI could end up \"bigger than the internet\", the current market is probably a bubble and some companies \"won't make it\". JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon has voiced similar concerns, while Google CEO Sundar Pichai said there was some \"irrationality\" to the AI boom.Sam Altman, whose company OpenAI kicked off the current obsession with AI in the tech industry, was more direct. \"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,\" he said last year.",

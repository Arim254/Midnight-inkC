    "body": "1 hour agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentBBCOn Valentine's Day, there's the temptation to believe that somewhere out there is \"The One\": a soulmate, a perfect match, the person you were meant to be with.Across history, humans have always been drawn to the idea that love isn't random. In ancient Greece, Plato imagined that we were once whole beings with four arms, four legs and two faces, so radiant that Zeus split us in two; ever since, each half has roamed the earth searching for its missing other, a myth that gives the modern soulmate its poetic pedigree and the promise that somewhere, someone will finally make us feel complete.In the Middle Ages, troubadours and Arthurian tales recast that longing as \"courtly love\", a fierce, often forbidden devotion like Lancelot's for Guinevere, in which a knight proved his worth through self-sacrifice for a beloved he might never openly declare.Getty ImagesPlato (left) imagined humans were once whole,  with four arms, four legs and two faces, before Zeus (right) split them, leaving each half searching for its otherBy the Renaissance, writers such as Shakespeare were talking of \"star-crossed lovers\", couples bound together by an overwhelming connection yet pulled apart by family, fortune or fate, as if the universe itself both wrote their love story and barred them from a happy ending.In more recent times, Hollywood and romance novels have sold us fairy tale love stories.But what does the latest science say about soulmates? Is there a particular special someone out there for us?How we fall for 'The One'Viren Swami, Professor of Social Psychology at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), in Cambridge, has traced our contemporary European understanding of romantic love back to medieval Europe and those stories of Camelot, Lancelot, Guinevere and the chivalry of the knights of the round table that swept across the continent.\"These stories first pushed the idea that you should choose one other individual as your companion and that companion is for life,\" he says.\"Before that, in much of Europe, you could love as many people as you like, and love was fluid, and it was often not about sex.\"Over time, as people are uprooted from their agricultural communities as industrialisation tears apart people's familiar attachments, individuals become \"alienated\", he says. \"They start looking for one other individual to save them, to save them from the wretchedness of their lives.\"Getty ImagesViren Swami believes today's ideas about romantic love can be traced back to medieval European stories like Lancelot and GuinevereToday's dating apps turn that story into an algorithm, which Swami calls \"relation-shopping\". The search for a soulmate turns into the opposite of what they are looking for: \"For many people, that's a really soulless experience.\"You're shopping for a partner… going through possibly dozens of people on the dating app until you get to a point where you go… I need to stop,\" he says.The OneJason Carroll, Professor of Marriage and Family Studies at the US Brigham Young University, based in Provo, Utah, is sympathetic to the longing for \"The One\".\"We are attachment-based creatures,\" he says. \"We desire that bond.\" But in his lectures, he tells students they need to leave the idea of a soulmate, without giving up their desire for The One.It sounds like a contradiction, but for Carroll, it's the difference between destiny and graft.\"A soulmate is just simply found. It's already pre‑made. But a one and only is something two people carve out together over years of adapting, apologising, and occasionally gritting their teeth,\" he says.Soulmate trapCarroll's argument draws on decades of research, which he put together in his report, The Soulmate Trap, much of which distinguishes between what psychologists call \"destiny beliefs\" - the idea that the right relationship should feel effortless - and \"growth beliefs\", which focus on what partners can do to make things work.In a widely cited series of studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s led by Professor C. Raymond Knee at the University of Houston, researchers found that people who believed relationships were \"meant to be\" were far more likely to doubt their commitment after conflict. Those with more growth-minded views tended to stay more committed, even on days when they argued.Those with growth-based views, Carroll argues, still want something special, but expect rough patches. \"They ask… what can they do to make their relationship better, have improvement and have growth?\"Getty ImagesResearch suggests people with \"growth\" beliefs about relationships still want something special, but expect challenges along the wayIn his view, the soulmate belief is a trap - not the romance itself, but the expectation that love should never be hard. The most \"soulful\" part of a long relationship, he says, is not a cinematic charge, but having \"front-row seats not only for each other's strengths, but... [their] challenges and weaknesses\".\"That's a pretty sacred space,\" he says. \"We only know those things because they've let us be there.\"For Carroll, when love is treated as fate, people become less willing to do the unshowy work that actually keeps love alive. Carroll says the soulmate trap makes it much harder when a relationship hits its first serious snag.\"The first time there's any type of struggle, the immediate thought is, 'well, I thought you were my soulmate. But maybe you're not, because soulmates aren't supposed to deal with things',\" he says. \"But if relationships are going to go long term, it's never just going to be a downhill run.\"Spark or trauma?Vicki Pavitt, a London-based love coach, often helps people who thought they'd found their soulmate, only to discover that the fairy tale came with emotional manipulation, flakiness, and a constant sense of anxiety.\"When there is a lot of chemistry and the spark, I think that can sometimes be about opening old unhealthy patterns, like old wounds\", she says.\"A person who is inconsistent or plays a bit hot and cold can make you feel 'I can't wait to see them again', but what's really happening is they're giving you so much anxiety and that it has you wanting more\".Vicki PavittLove coach Vicki Pavitt often works with people who thought they'd found a soulmate, only to find the relationship brought anxietyPavitt says what we feel to be destiny may be a pull from our nervous system recognising something that hurt us before and trying to fix it, a pattern therapists call a trauma bond.This bond can seem like love, she says, and leads to people magnetically drawn into unhealthy dynamics because they are familiar, not because they are the perfect match.One study often cited is by Canadian psychologists Donald Dutton and Susan Painter. In research published in 1993 while they were at the University of British Columbia, they followed 75 women after they had left abusive partners.The team measured how strongly the women still felt attached to their exes and compared this with what their relationships had been like.They found the strongest bonds were not in women who had consistently been abused, but in those whose partners alternated between charm and cruelty.Getty ImagesPavitt says what feels like destiny can sometimes be a trauma bondDutton and Painter argue that this trauma bond helps explain why people can feel magnetised back to relationships that are objectively bad for them – because the mix of danger and affection is familiar, not because it is healthy.It is that distinction Pavitt tries to surface in coaching: \"It's about discerning whether the chemistry you feel is showing me this person's compatible with me or if it is a familiar sense of anxiety.\"In my language, I never talk about soulmates,\" she says. \"I don't personally believe that there is one person for everybody... but I do believe that we become \"The One\" for someone.\"Real chemistryIf ruling out the existence of a soulmate sounds unromantic, the biology of attraction points in the same direction.Hormonal contraceptives may subtly reshape how partners feel about each other. Research suggests that pills which flatten the natural ebb and flow of fertility can dampen shifts in attraction that typically occur across the menstrual cycle, potentially altering initial mate choice.PA WireSome research suggests hormonal contraception may subtly influence attraction in partnersOne large study of 365 hetrosexual couples found that women's sexual satisfaction was higher when their current contraceptive status matched what it was when they first chose their partner, hinting that changes in pill use can change how a partner is experienced. These effects are small but could help explain some couples' puzzling shifts in chemistry over time.If hormones and pills can tilt who feels like \"The One\", then it becomes harder to argue there is a single, pre‑ordained match – which is where the mathematicians come in.The one but not the onlyPsychology and biology offer one way of thinking about \"The One\", but mathematics puts forward another.Dr Greg Leo, an economist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, has come up with a compatibility algorithm. It finds that not only might you have a \"One\" you have lots of \"Ones\".In his Matching Soulmates paper in the journal of Public Economic Theory, everyone is in a computer simulated dating pool, where thousands of digitally created daters rank each other. His algorithm picks \"first‑order soulmates\": pairs who choose each other in a stable matching. It removes them, and runs it again with those left, and you get second‑order soulmates, and so on.More from InDepthIn his simulations, it was extremely rare for someone to have their mutual first picks; but many people had those that were second or third picks. In this scenario a couple counts as happy if each is near the top of the other's list and neither can find someone they and that other person would both prefer more.It may only be number crunching, but the love algorithm tells us that there are many viable partners, not just The One.Sweat the small stuffSo how can a couple co-create their Ones?Jacqui Gabb, Professor of Sociology and Intimacy at The Open University, assessed this in her Enduring Love project, published in the journal Sociology in 2015.It surveyed around 5,000 people and then followed 50 couples in forensic, sometimes intrusive detail, combining statistics with diaries, interviews and \"emotion maps\" of what happened in the home.When she asked people what made them feel appreciated, it wasn't sunset proposals or surprise trips to Paris.It was \"surprise gifts, thoughtful gestures and the kindness of a cup of tea in bed\". Warming the car on a cold morning. Picking wildflowers and putting them in a vase. Sharing a private smile at a party.Quantitatively, what she describes as these \"everyday attentive acts\" turned out to be much more powerful than grand romantic gestures.In her survey, 22% of mothers and 20% of childless women picked such small gestures as one of the top two things that made them feel valued – more than big nights out or expensive presents.Relationship satisfaction in the data wasn't primarily about money or romance; it was about \"intimate couple knowledge\" and its expression in daily life.In one young couple's diary given to them for the project, Sumaira describes her partner coming home, the dinner she has cooked, the hug in the hallway, the two of them eating together at the table.\"It's perfect,\" she writes in her research diary. \"Just us and food. What more could I want?\"Then there is a spontaneous dance in the living room, a walk in long grass where she gets scared of the dark, and a photo her partner loves so much he makes it the background on his phone.It reads like a lovely every day tale, not a fairy tale: no glass slippers, but wellies.Yet Gabb points out that woven through the sweetness are money worries, family obligations and a history of depression that the couple are learning to manage together.\"The soulmate feeling here doesn't float above life; it is made, inch by inch, by life, in the way the pair meet those pressures,\" she says.Valentine's DinnerThe science doesn't steal the romance – rather it's there to help it bloom, in good times and bad, according to Carroll.\"I'm pretty comfortable with the aspiration to be in a unique special relationship as long as we remember it needs to be created,\" he says.Pavitt thinks \"it's fine, helpful, even to have faith that your person is out there, so long as you know there are many people that you could form a really great connection with and stop expecting anyone to be perfect\".As for soulmates, the science points to a paradox. The people who end up with relationships that feel uniquely \"meant to be\" are often the ones who stopped waiting for fate, turned towards the flawed person in front of them and said, in effect: shall we make something of this?Additional reporting by Florence FreemanTop image credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "45 minutes agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGettySussan Ley has been deposed by Angus Taylor (back centre) as leader of Australia's Liberal party The first female leader of Australia's Liberal Party, Sussan Ley, has been ousted after just nine months in the job, losing a leadership ballot to her former shadow defence minister Angus Taylor.Ley was elevated to the role after the party suffered a resounding defeat in last year's election, but since then has been plagued by poor poll numbers and infighting among the conservative Liberal-National Coalition.Taylor had announced he would challenge her for leadership of the opposition on Wednesday, ending months of speculation.In a social media post he said his election on Friday was \"an immense honour\" and that he looked forward to working with new deputy leader Jane Hume.Taylor, from the party's conservative faction, won the secret ballot, 34 votes to 17.Shortly after the results were announced, Ley said that she would resign as an MP and step away \"completely and comprehensively from public life\".She told waiting reporters she harboured \"no hard feelings\" towards the new leader although, in an apparent jab at the infighting she has endured, she added that it was important he get \"clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders\".  Taylor, who narrowly lost the 2025 leadership contest to Ley, is a former management consultant who first entered parliament in 2013. He served as a minister under Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison.Ley's position had never seemed secure. The Liberal-National coalition, a partnership dating back to the 1940s, twice split under her leadership, the first time immediately after the May election and the second time just weeks ago.A series of recent polls have also shown the populist One Nation Party - which only got 6% of the national vote last year - overtaking the Coalition to take second place behind Labor. Ley's personal ratings have also been poor.The coalition has largely failed to agree on what caused its crushing election defeat to Labor, which saw the Liberals all but wiped out in the major cities, with disagreements on energy and climate policy in a particular.Reflecting on her time at the helm, Ley said it had been \"very tough\" at times but added: \"I was part of the early punk rock movement in Canberra, I will continue to find wisdom in one of punk's defining themes, a fearless and honest belief in yourself.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoHafsa KhalilGettyVaping could be banned in cars carrying children, as well as in playgrounds and outside schools, according to government plans.The plans - which are subject to a 12-week public consultation - seek to prevent smoking, vaping and the use of heated tobacco in these settings across England.Indoor spaces - where smoking is already banned - would also become vape and heated tobacco-free under the proposals, as would areas outside hospitals.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said children and patients should not have to suffer because others choose to smoke.\"Second-hand smoke increases the risk of heart disease and lung cancer and we want to protect children and the sick from harm,\" he said.\"Prevention is better than cure, so this government is taking pressure off the NHS and building a healthier Britain where everyone lives well for longer.\"England's chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty listed asthma, poor birth outcomes, several cancers, heart disease and stroke as some of the \"significant harmful effects\" of second-hand smoking.\"These measures would reduce the harm second-hand smoke causes the most medically vulnerable in our society,\" he added.The proposals form part of the government's 10-year health plan to shift the focus from sickness to prevention, as well as reduce the pressures on the NHS.\"The government aims to prevent avoidable harm before it happens and support a healthier generation,\" it explained in a statement.A public consultation launched on Friday is seeking views on points such as which settings should have a ban implemented, exemptions, and how to inform people of the restrictions.The government said findings from the consultation will \"help shape future regulations under the Tobacco and Vapes Bill\", which it said will \"create a smoke-free generation and protect young people from a lifetime of addiction\". The bill is currently progressing through parliament, it added.Outdoor hospitality venues like pub gardens and wider open spaces such as beaches and private outdoor spaces are not included in the plans.People will also be able to continue smoking and vaping in their homes.If the ban goes ahead, enforcement would \"mirror existing smoke-free laws\", the statement said, adding there will be a minimum of six months between the regulations being made and coming into force.The British Heart Foundation's chief executive Dr Charmaine Griffiths said the research charity strongly supports the consultation and is calling for urgent implementation of the legislation. \"Tough measures must be taken to prevent smoking from robbing more families of their loved ones and harming vulnerable people,\" she said.The consultation will run for 12 weeks and will end on 8 May 2026.

    "body": "7 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaSir Chris Wormald was appointed as cabinet secretary just over a year agoSir Chris Wormald has been forced out as the head of the Civil Service and cabinet secretary.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who only appointed Sir Chris to the role in December 2024, said he was grateful \"for the support he has given me over the past year\".The Cabinet Office said the move was \"by mutual agreement\" but it follows months of negative media reports suggesting Downing Street was unhappy with his performance.His responsibilities will be shared by Catherine Little, permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, Dame Antonia Romeo, permanent secretary at the Home Office and James Bowler, permanent secretary at the Treasury, until a replacement is appointed \"shortly\".It makes Sir Chris the shortest-serving cabinet secretary in the history of the post.At the time of his appointment, the PM said Sir Chris would be tasked with \"the complete re-wiring of the British state to deliver bold and ambitious long-term reform\".However, as a career civil servant some questioned whether he was the best person to reform the Civil Service.Sir Chris also had ultimate responsibility for the due diligence checks carried out before Lord Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador, although he took up the role only a few days before the appointment was formally announced.He is the third senior official to leave the government operation in a matter of days, following Sir Keir's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and his director of communications Tim Allan, as the PM seeks to reset his team after the Mandelson scandal.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Sir Chris was \"the latest person Keir Starmer has thrown under the bus to save his own skin\".Dave Penman, head of the FDA Union, which represents senior civil servants, said the treatment of Sir Chris was \"a new low for this government and its relationship with the Civil Service\", following \"days of open speculation\".\"Wormald had barely started in the cabinet secretary role before the anonymous briefings started to scapegoat him and undermine his authority,\" he added.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey posted on X: \"Very worried about who Keir Starmer will blame when there is literally no one else left in Number 10.\"In a statement, Sir Keir said: \"I am very grateful to Sir Chris for his long and distinguished career of public service, spanning more than 35 years, and for the support that he has given me over the past year. \"I have agreed with him that he will step down as cabinet secretary today.\"Sir Chris said: \"It has been an honour and a privilege to serve as a civil servant for the past 35 years, and a particular distinction to lead the service as cabinet secretary. \"I want to place on record my sincere thanks to the extraordinary civil servants, public servants, ministers, and advisers I have worked with.\"Getty ImagesDame Antonia Romeo has held senior roles at the Department for International Trade, the Ministry of Justice and the Home OfficeThe government's favoured successor is Dame Antonia, who was on the four-person shortlist for the role when Sir Chris was appointed.If given the job, she would be the first female head of the Civil Service.However, on Wednesday evening Lord McDonald, the former head of the Foreign Office, told Channel 4 News that if this was the case then \"in my view, the due diligence has some way still to go\".He called for a \"full process\" to appoint a new cabinet secretary that \"starts from scratch\".This has been interpreted as a reference to an investigation Dame Antonia faced over allegations about her spending in 2017 when she was the government's consul-general in New York, and Lord McDonald was her boss.In response to Lord McDonald's interview, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \"There is absolutely no basis for this criticism.⁠\"Antonia Romeo is a highly respected permanent secretary with a 25-year record of excellent public service.\"The allegations all come from a single grievance made some time ago by a former employee. All the allegations were dismissed on the basis there was no case to answer.\"The Cabinet Office said the appointment process would be agreed by the First Civil Service Commissioner, who is currently Baroness Stuart, former Labour MP and Brexit campaigner Gisela Stuart.Sir Keir has promised to tighten up vetting for senior roles, after the appointments of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador and Lord Doyle as a peer, despite their links to convicted sex offenders.As cabinet secretary, Sir Chris had been overseeing the government's release of documents demanded by Parliament about Lord Mandelson's appointment.Badenoch had called for Sir Chris to be kept in the role until this process was complete and for a \"full new process\" to select his replacement.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJemma CrewBusiness reporterReutersTesco intends to make its Clubcard available to under-18s this year, the supermarket said.Its loyalty scheme allows shoppers to get discounts on thousands of products, including its popular meal deals, and collect points which can be turned into vouchers.The supermarket did not say why it has decided to widen eligibility to younger customers, or elaborate on how this might work.It follows campaigning from Which? urging supermarkets to lift what it called \"unfair restrictions\" on who can access loyalty schemes.The UK's competition regulator has said that, while supermarkets' eligibility requirements are unlikely to breach consumer law, some could do more to broaden access, including allowing under-18s to benefit from schemes. Loyalty cards are a way for retailers to collect data on what customers are buying and offer them more at lower prices. It allows them to compete for customers as rising food prices squeeze margins.The average person has loyalty cards for three supermarkets, data from research firm Kantar suggests.Most of the biggest UK supermarkets require shoppers to be 18 or over to sign up for their rewards schemes. Some, such as Morrisons, allow younger customers to log into their parent or guardian's account to access discounted prices.The Co-op says those aged 16 and over can sign up for its loyalty scheme, while younger customers can become a junior member if their parent or guardian purchases and registers a temporary card for them. A Tesco spokesperson said: \"We are actively reviewing Tesco Clubcard with the intention of making Clubcard available to under-18s this year.\"Those customers who do not have a Clubcard can still get great value from Tesco due to our combination of Aldi Price Match and Everyday Low Prices.\"Which? said millions of customers are excluded from getting discounts at big retailers because of age, address and digital access requirements.The consumer outlet, which has just released its annual customer satisfaction survey, said Tesco had twice missed out on being awarded \"Recommended Provider\" status because its Clubcard discounts were not available to everyone.Reena Sewraz, Which? retail editor, said Tesco's Clubcard savings can be \"really significant, which is why access to them matters so much for shoppers trying to make ends meet\".She added: 'We're glad Tesco has listened – this is a big step in the right direction, provided it moves quickly to fully implement these changes.\"Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of the Grocer, told the BBC he expects other supermarkets to take similar steps.\"When Tesco moves others follow. It's not the first loyalty card to become available to younger people but it's the biggest, and if it's okay by Tesco others will find a way,\" he said. Asked why most big UK supermarkets don't already allow under-18s to sign up to these schemes, he said there had been concerns about data protection for minors.But he added that if people younger than this can hold bank accounts, access social media and the internet, drive a car and get married, \"they should also be able to buy food for themselves and those they may care for, at the most competitive prices\".

    "body": "8 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterEPAThe BBC's total public service spending last year was more than £4bnThe BBC is making cuts amounting to about 10% of its costs in the face of \"substantial financial pressures\".The broadcaster said the savings needed to be made over the next three years.A spokesman declined to put a figure on the amount, but it is expected to be hundreds of millions of pounds. The BBC's total public service spending last year was more than £4bn.No details have yet been given about any programmes or services that will be affected.The new cuts come on top of about £150m that must still be found by March 2028 as part of an existing savings programme.A BBC spokesperson added: \"Over the last three years we have delivered more than a half a billion pounds worth of savings, much of which we've been able to reinvest into our output across the BBC.\"In a rapidly changing media market, we continue to face substantial financial pressures.\"As a result we expect to make further savings over the next three years of around 10% of our costs.\"This is about the BBC becoming more productive and prioritising our offer to audiences to ensure we're providing the best value for money, both now and in the future.\"The announcement comes as the BBC negotiates with the government about its future, and that of the licence fee, ahead of the renewal of its royal charter at the end of 2027.The corporation gets most of its income from the licence fee, but the number of TV licences sold has been declining in recent years.The BBC has said it accepts that the licence fee needs reform, but that any changes must \"safeguard the BBC as a universal public broadcaster\".",

    "body": "Can a pulse of electricity to the brain make us less selfish?1 hour agoVictoria GillScience correspondent GettyScientists have discovered how to make people less selfish - at least temporarily - by stimulating two areas of their brain.In a new study carried out at the University of Zurich, 44 volunteers were asked to decide how to split an amount of money between themselves and an anonymous partner. During the experiment, an electrical current was applied to the frontal and parietal areas of the brain - situated at the front and towards the back. When these areas were stimulated at the same time, the participants gave away more money. \"The effects were not huge, but they're consistent,\" said Prof Christian Ruff, one of the lead authors who carried out the experiments. Changing behaviour \"Statistically, we really see an increase in their willingness to pay.\"As well as revealing something about the mechanisms behind fundamental human behaviour, the findings, researchers say, could be useful in treating some brain disorders.\"There are people who have profound problems with social behaviour, because they can't take other people's perspective into account and are constantly behaving selfishly,\" Prof Ruff told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science. \"That's when we could use this.\"In the case of this experiment, the effects were short-lived. \"To really change behaviour in the longer term, you would have to do it repeatedly,\" said Prof Ruff. He compared the potential effects to going to the gym. One workout will not improve your fitness, \"but if you go to the gym twice weekly for a period of two months, your body changes. This is the same.\"Nicolas ZonviThis new discovery builds on their previous study, which monitored brain activity while participants played the same money-sharing game.In that study, the researchers pinpointed the two brain areas that appeared to be \"talking to each other\" - with brain cells firing at the same frequency - when players gave away more money.Those two brain areas are known to play a role in decision-making and in empathy, or distinguishing the feelings of others from our own. When a more selfless decision was made, the empathy region and the decision region appeared to communicate.So for this study, the researchers wanted to find out if they could use electrical stimulation to \"nudge\" people towards more selfless decisions.One anonymous volunteer, who tried out the brain stimulation test, said the experience felt \"like a warm shower or small drops of rain\" on the scalp.\"Immediately after starting the stimulation, I was making the decisions displayed on a screen. At no time did I have the sensation that the stimulation was impacting my decisions.\"Identifying this selfless decision brain activity, in multiple people, strongly suggests that altruism is hardwired in our brains; that it evolved to make us take care of others.Being able to influence and change that mechanism, Prof Ruff explained, \"is what makes this discovery clinically relevant\".Prof Ruff's co-author, Dr Jie Hu from East China Normal University, said: \"What's new here is evidence of cause and effect.\"When we altered communication in a specific brain network using targeted, non-invasive stimulation, people's sharing decisions changed - shifting how they balanced their own interests against others.\"But should we be concerned - or unsettled - by an experiment that influences behaviour in this way? Prof Ruff says \"absolutely not\".\"This is medically regulated specifically for these experiments,\" he explained. \"It goes through an ethics committee and people give informed consent, which they can withdraw at any time.The neuroscientist compared that to the influences on our behaviour from social media and advertising. \"There you have no control over what you're exposed to [and how your brain responds to it],\" he said.",

    "body": "9 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesNHS staff in England and Wales are to get a 3.3% pay rise in the next financial year, the government has announced.The award covers around 1.5 million health staff, from nurses and midwives to physios and porters – the entire workforce apart from doctors, dentists and senior managers.The rise is more than the Department of Health and Social Care had initially put forward to the independent pay review body, but it said it had accepted the recommendation of 3.3% to demonstrate its commitment to NHS staff. The Welsh government has done the same.But a number of health unions said they were disappointed with the award.Royal College of Nursing (RCN) general secretary Prof Nicola Ranger, said it was below the current level of consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 3.4%, which measures how prices have risen in the past year.\"A pay award below the current level of inflation is an insult. Unless inflation falls, the government is forcing a very real pay cut on its NHS workers.\"This knife-edge game-playing is no way to treat people who prop up a system in crisis.\"She said she would wait to see what the rest of the public sector and doctors received before deciding what to do.Last year the RCN reacted angrily after resident doctors in England got 5.4% compared to nurses 3.6%, calling it grotesque.\"Nursing staff will not tolerate the disrespect of other years, when we were bottom of the pile,\" added Ranger.AngryHelga Pile, head of health at Unison, the biggest health union, said: \"Hard-pressed NHS staff will be downright angry at another below-inflation pay award.\"Yet again, they're expected to keep delivering more while effectively being given less, as pay slides behind living costs.\"The pay review body recommendation of a 3.3% rise also applies to Northern Ireland, but there has been no decision made yet on what will happen there although ministers have indicated they want to give the pay rise if the budget allows.The government in England said it did represent an above-inflation award, saying the forecast for the coming year was around 2%.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"This government hugely appreciates the incredible work of talented staff across our NHS.\"The government said it would be in pay packets by the start of April.But it gave no indication when the announcement about doctors pay would be made – it is thought the pay body that makes recommendations about pay for them has yet to deliver its report to ministers.The government is currently in talks with the British Medical Association about the pay of resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors.BMA members recently voted in favour of strike action, giving them another six-month mandate for walkouts. There have already been 14 strikes so far in the long-running dispute.",

    "body": "5 hours agoBethany BellGermany reporterOlympic ShopThere are calls in Germany for the sale of the shirts to be stoppedThe official online fan shop of the Olympic Games has been selling T-shirts with designs from the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936, which were used by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis for propaganda.There are calls in Germany for the sale of the shirts to be stopped, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has defended it as being part of its Heritage Collection, celebrating styles from all editions of the Games.The T-shirts, which are emblazoned with the original poster design for the Berlin Olympics by Franz Würbel, are currently out of stock.The 1936 Games were used by Hitler as a chance to promote his ideals of racial supremacy and to glorify Nazi Germany on an international stage.The Berlin T-Shirt shows a male figure wearing a laurel wreath. Over his head are the Olympic rings. Underneath him is the Brandenburg Gate and the words \"Germany Berlin 1936 Olympic Games\".\"The 1936 Olympic Games were a central propaganda tool of the Nazi regime,\" Klara Schedlich, spokesperson for sports policy for the Green Party faction in the Berlin House of Representatives, told the German press agency, DPA.She accused the IOC of \"clearly not reflecting sufficiently on its own history\" and said \"the choice of image is problematic and unsuitable for a T-shirt\", without context.The IOC told the BBC that while it \"of course acknowledge[s] the historical issues of Nazi propaganda\" it wanted to also remember that the Berlin 1936 Games saw \"4,483 athletes from 49 countries compete in 149 medal events\". \"We made an Olympic Heritage Collection available to the public that celebrates 130 years of Olympic art and design. For this series, emblems, pictograms, posters and mascots from all editions of the Olympic Games are featured,\" a spokesperson said.\"Many of them stunned the world with their athletic achievements, including Jesse Owens.\"Jesse Owens, an African-American track and field athlete, won four gold medals at the 1936 Games, crushing the Nazi myth of Aryan racial supremacy.The spokesperson said that the historical context of the Berlin Games was explained at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, and that only a limited number of 1936 T-Shirts had been produced and sold.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesThe USS Iwo Jima, seen docked in Puerto Rico in JanuaryA US Marine who fell overboard from an attack ship in the Caribbean has become the first known American casualty in the Trump administration's operation targeting drug-trafficking boats.Lance Cpl Chukwuemeka E. Oforah, 21, fell from the USS Iwo Jima on 7 February and was lost at sea. He was pronounced dead after a lengthy search, which ended 10 February.His death was announced on Wednesday and remains under investigation by the military.The Florida native was assisting Operation Southern Spear, which has carried out 38 lethal strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean since September. It played a key role in the capture of Venezuelan president Nicholas Maduro.A statement from the US Marines contained no details regarding how he may have fallen from the ship. \"We are all grieving alongside the Oforah family,\" said Col Tom Trimble, commanding officer of the Marine Expeditionary Unit known as Special Operations Capable.\"The loss of Lance Cp. Oforah is deeply felt across the entire Navy-Marine Corps team. He will be profoundly missed, and his dedicated service will not be forgotten.\"A news release from the military branch said the sprawling search for Oforah involved five ships and 10 aircrafts.The USS Iwo Jima was used to transport Maduro after his capture in a US raid. Maduro's capture came after weeks of a military build-up in the region, along with frequent strikes on vessels that the Trump administration said were carrying drugs headed for the US. The pace of the strikes has notably ebbed since US forces in early January captured Maduro - who has been accused by the Trump administration of working with drug trafficking groups.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said Operation Southern Spear is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".But some legal experts have said the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.US officials have faced bipartisan scrutiny over a follow-up strike - or \"double-tap\" - on 2 September that targeted an alleged Venezuelan drug boat in the Caribbean Sea.The families of two Trinidadian men killed in the 14 October strike have since filed a lawsuit against the American government, alleging the strike amounted to \"lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theatre\".",

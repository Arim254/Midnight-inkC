    "body": "Icon, trailblazer & Wales hero - Fishlock's seismic legacyImage source, FAWImage caption, Midfielder Jess Fishlock is the most capped Wales international of all timeByIan MitchelmoreBBC Sport WalesJess Fishlock's Wales chapter is poised to come to an end following a glorious international career that has boasted 165 caps and 48 goals.She will make her 166th and final appearance for her country when Rhian Wilkinson's side host Australia at Cardiff City Stadium on 25 October.The 38-year-old Fishlock was a monumental figure in the growth of a side that played in a major tournament for the first time in their history earlier in 2025.The record goalscorer then netted the first ever goal for the women's side on the grandest stage, although her remarkable impact went way beyond her on-pitch exploits.Destined for greatnessFrom the word go, there was always something special about Fishlock.She started her playing career with hometown club Cardiff City Ladies, now Gwalia United, and swiftly caught the eye - making her first-team debut at 15.Having captained Wales Under-19s, Fishlock earned her senior bow against Switzerland - a nation where almost two decades later the final touch of gloss would be dabbed on what was to be a glittering career - in 2006.Only two years later, Fishlock made the decision to join Dutch side AZ Alkmaar and became the first overseas player in the Eredivisie.Her boldness typified that of a woman who was as relentless as she was ambitious from the very beginning of her time as a footballer.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Midfielder Jess Fishlock scored her 48th Wales goal at Euro 2025Despite some struggles in the Netherlands, Fishlock was part of a side that claimed back-to-back Eredivisie titles, and it was a sign of things to come at club level. Upon returning to Bristol, she was named Women's Super League (WSL) Players' Player of the Season in her second campaign and enjoyed even more success in Australia soon after.Having joined Melbourne Victory, Fishlock starred as the Victoria-based side reached two Grand Finals - winning their first title in 2013.An eye-catching move to Seattle Reign in 2013 proved to be the catalyst in making Fishlock a star on the global stage.She has helped the club win three NWSL Shield titles, and even during her loan stints away from the American side, of which there have been six in total, success still followed.Indeed, the midfielder tasted further league glory with Glasgow, Melbourne City, Frankfurt and Lyon - winning the Champions League with each of the latter two sides.But the glut of honours were never replicated on the international stage.Fishlock wasted no time in becoming a key cog under Andy Beattie, Adrian Tucker, Jarmo Matikainen, Jayne Ludlow, Gemma Grainger and most recently Wilkinson.Though for all of her mesmerising showings, goals, assists and endeavour, tournament qualification proved one hurdle too many with Wales for the majority of her career. Although, thankfully, not for all of it.Media caption, 'She's the best player in the world'Finally achieving a dreamThe date 3 December 2024 will be forever etched into Wales history.Following a 1-1 draw between the sides in Cardiff four days earlier, goals from Hannah Cain and Carrie Jones earned Rhian Wilkinson's side a 2-1 victory over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin to ensure Wales would at long last break their tournament duck.It was the pinnacle for a team who had seen icons including Laura McAllister, Jayne Ludlow and Helen Ward - and Neville Southall, Ryan Giggs, Ian Rush and Mark Hughes to name a few on the men's side - all fail to achieve their tournament dream with Wales.On the eve of the 2025 Euros, Fishlock told BBC Sport Wales: \"A big narrative around my entire career internationally has been, 'Can I get to a major tournament?' and 'Can we get to a major tournament?' We've been so close so many times.\"When you want to achieve something and you get to do it with some of your very closest friends, there's really no comparison to that feeling.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jess Fishlock netted for Wales in a 4-1 loss to France at Euro 2025Even in the aftermath of their humbling 3-0 defeat by the Netherlands in their competition opener in Switzerland, Fishlock was intent on ensuring further progress was the target.\"This is the level now, right?\" she said. \"We've got to get used to this real fast.\"Not content with adding one more piece of history to her ever-increasing list of achievements, Fishlock again took centre stage as she netted a 13th-minute equaliser in Wales' second group stage match against France in St Gallen - the first  goal the women's side had scored in a major tournament.Aged 38 years and 176 days, the strike made Fishlock the oldest scorer in women's Euro finals history.It was as fitting as it was deserved, given the weight of expectation she had carried on her shoulders for the vast majority of her time in the red of Wales. It also demonstrated there was immense quality to go with her commendable longevity - with Fishlock playing in 67% of the 245 international matches ever played by the Welsh women's side.Recent Welsh success has brought with it increased expectation and stronger opposition - with Wales' nine-game winless run across their Euro and Nations League A fixtures in 2025 serving as proof that they are now on a whole new level when it comes to competing with the world's big guns.But Fishlock simply would not have it any other way.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, USA star Megan Rapinoe (L) and Wales great Jess Fishlock made a point to support LGBT rights after a friendly matchFishlock has never shied away from using her profile to speak out on her beliefs having come out as gay.In 2018, Fishlock - who married former team-mate Tziarra King in 2023 - was awarded an MBE for services to women's football and the LGBT community.Before the men's World Cup in Qatar, Fishlock opened up on the importance of visibility amid concerns over the 2022 tournament host nation's record on gay rights.It came after she had described her experience at school as \"hell on earth\" because of abuse she received over her sexuality.Nevertheless, Fishlock remained determined to use her platform to help educate others.Speaking in 2019, Fishlock said: \"I'm not the only one that gets abused. I am not the only one that gets comments thrown at them. \"It's come round to my family and my sisters and my mum and my dad, so when I made that decision, you know I have to think about other people as well otherwise it's very selfish of me.\"But there really is a big picture, and the bigger picture is generations of kids looking at a role model, looking at what they've achieved and understanding whatever they are going through.\"Following the friendly between Wales and the United States of America in July 2023, Fishlock embraced USA icon and Seattle Reign team-mate Megan Rapinoe - who is also openly gay.The pair wore each other's national team shirt and posed for photographs - making sure their support for LGBT rights was front and centre of the pictures' message.Such has been Fishlock's impact on the game itself, a mural covering the playing area of a five-a-side football pitch in Splott, Cardiff, was unveiled in June to celebrate her impact on football, equality and representation.The Red Wall will get the chance to celebrate Fishlock's efforts when Wales host Australia and Poland in friendlies later this month.One thing is for certain, the void left by Fishlock is unlikely ever to be filled, or her achievements surpassed.But Wales are unquestionably in a far better place thanks to the truly astonishing efforts of a player who gave her all, and more, to ensure she leaves behind a legacy like no other.",

    "body": "Funeral director admits 36 charges and denies others9 hours agoKevin Shoesmith andStuart HarrattEast Yorkshire and LincolnshirePA MediaRobert Bush leaving Hull Crown CourtA former funeral director has pleaded guilty to 36 charges of fraud after a major investigation into human remains found at his premises, including four babies lost in pregnancy. Robert Bush, 47, admitted 35 offences of fraud by false representation and another of fraudulently running a business, Hull-based Legacy Independent Funeral Directors relating to the sale of funeral plans.He also denied 30 counts of preventing lawful and decent burials and one charge of stealing money from charity collection boxes, during a hearing at Hull Crown Court.Bush, formerly of Kirk Ella, East Yorkshire and now living in West Yorkshire, will face a trial at Sheffield Crown Court on 5 October 2026.Humberside Police began its inquiry into Legacy Independent Funeral Directors following a report of \"concern for care of the deceased\" in March 2024.The force said four of the fraud by false representation counts related to \"ashes provided to families following loss in pregnancy\".It took the court clerk 22 minutes to put all 67 charges to Bush, who wore a grey three-piece suit, a white shirt and purple tie.There were gasps from the packed public gallery each time a not guilty plea was entered.A woman heckled Bush from the gallery as he was ushered out of the courtroom at the end of the hearing. Bush was bailed until his next court appearance.Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devices",

Thank God. Continue mission!\"BBC Verify tracked the plane, and found that it began losing altitude off the south-west coast of Ireland. It then headed back east, having dropped to an altitude of 10,000 feet, accoring to FlightRadar24.At this time, the plane started broadcasting a \"7700 squawk code\" on its transponder. These are relayed to signify a general emergency onboard, ranging from engine failure to depressurisation to a medical emergency.In February a government plane carrying Secretary of State Marco Rubio had to turn back due to a crack in the window of the cockpit, as well.Defence ministers had gathered in Belgium on Wednesday to discuss security in Ukraine.

    "body": "5 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and legal Correspondent, at Westminster Magistrates' CourtReutersProtesters in London's Trafalgar Square on 4 October for a demonstration against the ban on Palestine ActionTwenty-eight people have pleaded not guilty after being charged under anti-terrorism laws with allegedly supporting the banned group Palestine Action. In the first of a series of complex hearings on Wednesday, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard about 2,000 people are likely to be charged with showing support in demonstrations for the group proscribed as a terrorist organisation in July.Judges face trying to find time and courtrooms to hold 400 trials of those accused of taking part in protests.While the judge began setting provisional trial dates for March, there is no certainty they can take place before the end of 2026 because of the ongoing legal battle over the group's proscription.The government proscribed Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation in July, after activists broke into an RAF base and damaged two military aircraft earlier in the year.Since that ban more than 2,100 people have been arrested at demonstrations in England and Wales. Each of them has been accused of holding up a placard reading: \"I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action\".So far, some 170 of them - many of them pensioners - have been charged with displaying an item supportive of a banned organisation. This is a low-level terrorism offence which can be dealt with in a magistrates' court and can lead to six months in jail.The first of two days of dedicated hearings to manage the cases dominated Westminster Magistrates' Court, as district judge Michael Snow set out how the courts would deal with all of them.Most of the 28 defendants appearing, who were among those arrested at the first protests in July, did not have a lawyer. That meant many were often unclear about what was going on or had not had an opportunity to read the basics of the accusations they face.Many complained to the court that their prosecution was unjust.Anthony Harvey, 59, travelled from his home in Oban, in the Scottish Highlands, to deny supporting a proscribed organisation.He told the judge: \"Protesting against genocide is not terrorism, I'm not guilty.\"The oldest defendant was 83-year-old the Reverend Susan Parfitt, from Bristol, who is partially deaf.She gently held onto a hand rail in the courtroom as Judge Snow came down from the bench to sit next to her, so she could hear him.When he asked her for her plea, she replied: \"I was objecting against the proscription of Palestine Action and I therefore plead not guilty.\"David Kilroy, 66, from Plymouth, wearing a Just Stop Oil t-shirt, told the court: \"When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes a duty. Not guilty.\"During the day, prosecutor Peter Ratliff told the court that there were difficulties in fixing firm trial dates from early next year for what could end up being 2,000 defendants because of the ongoing legal challenge to the banning of Palestine Action.If that challenge overturns the ban, the prosecutions would almost certainly be scrapped. But if the ban remains there could still be complex questions over how the suspects can defend themselves.Three lead cases, which came to court in September, are being prioritised to try to decide those questions - but any of these legal standoffs could end up before the Supreme Court.If that happened, trials would have to be delayed, perhaps into 2027.Judge Snow acknowledged the risk of having to revise plans for 2,000 defendants if the Supreme Court ultimately gets involved in the case – but he said he had to nevertheless set timetables. Courtrooms at Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London are being set aside to manage the cases.That plan involves at least two trials a day of a total of 10 defendants, starting from 23 March. If the 2,000 defendant figure is correct, that would require at least 400 trials - or 200 full days of court time.But on Wednesday defendants and a lawyer told the judge there was a risk the trials would be too short to be fair.Katie McFadden, acting for some of the defendants, said that a half-day trial of five defendants at a time raised questions about whether that was enough time for them to individually give evidence, present their free speech arguments and be cross-examined.Another suspect, 72-year-old Deborah Wilde, told the court: \"I don't think I can get a fair trial on the [time] limit that you have allocated to me. I would like to seek leave to appeal.\"Judge Snow told her that was not legally possible.\"I'm satisfied that the time is sufficient,\" he said. \"I'm not allowing more time for the trial. Your only remedy is the High Court.\"Another 30 defendants are due in court on Thursday to continue allocating trial dates. On Friday, the Court of Appeal will rule on a government attempt to stop the challenge to Palestine Action's ban. Separately in November, the first trial is due to begin of alleged Palestine Action members who are accused of offences, including violence, relating to the targeting of an Israeli defence firm.",

    "body": "5 minutes agoAFP/Getty ImagesChristopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of spying for ChinaThe government's deputy national security adviser warned in 2023 that China was carrying out \"large scale espionage\" activities against the UK when asked to provide evidence in the now-collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China.A second witness statement written by Matthew Collins in February 2025 as evidence for the case of two men accused of spying on MPs, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, said China's spying threatened \"the UK's economic prosperity and resilience\". A third witness statement published in August restated the UK's view of the challenge posed by China.But the second two statements made clear the government was \"committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China\". All three statements were published by Downing Street on Wednesday night as the government continued to face questions after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly dropped charges against Mr Cash and Mr Berry last month, prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. The first of the three statements by Collins was given to prosecutors in December 2023, when he was serving under a Conservative government.The second and third statements were submitted this year after Labour had taken power.Previously, the director of public prosecutions said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.Earlier on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer said he would publish the deputy national security adviser's statements after Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of a \"cover-up\".The documents show that in December 2023, Collins concluded: \"The Chinese Intelligence Services are highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK and other international partners to advance the Chinese state's interest and harm the interests and security of the UK.\"In February 2025, he said: \"China is an authoritarian state, with different values to the UK. This presents challenges for both the UK and our allies. China and the UK both benefit from bilateral trade and investment, but China also present the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security.\" And in a third statement this August, he said China's \"espionage operations threaten the UK's economic prosperity and resilience, and the integrity of our democratic institutions\".He pointed to a number of actions which UK authorities believe Beijing was behind, including a cyber-attack on the UK electoral commission between 2021 and 2023.In his 2025 statements, Collins made clear the government sought a good economic relationship with China, writing: \"It is important for me to emphasise, however that the government is committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China.\"The government believes that the UK must continue to engage with international partners on trade and investment to grow our economy while ensuring that our security and values are not compromised.\"The government originally said the February 2025 statement, the second of three, had been made when the document was originally signed by Collins.BBC News understands that Collins assumed he had given enough evidence for the prosecution to continue when he submitted his third witness statement in August 2025.A government source pointed to comments made by him where he described \"the increasing Chinese espionage threat posed to the UK\" as an example of why he believed he had said enough to satisfy the CPS's threshold for prosecution.It is also understood that the CPS contacted Collins after his first witness statement to ask for further clarification on the threat posed by China, but that they were not explicitly clear what the official would need to say in subsequent statements, in order to meet the CPS's threshold.New details of alleged spyingIn his first statement, Collins writes in detail about the allegations made about Mr Cash and Mr Berry, which he said was based on information provided to him by counter terrorism police.Both men have denied the allegations against them.Collins said in this 2023 statement \"it had been assessed that the Chinese state recruited Mr Berry as an agent and successfully directed him to utilise Mr Cash\" who had access to the Commons China Research Group (CRG) and other MPs.Mr Cash worked as a parliamentary researcher and was involved with the CRG, which was set up by a group of Conservative MPs looking into how the UK should respond to the rise of China.In his statement, Collins said that in July 2022, Mr Berry met with a senior Chinese Communist Party leader and that he understands Mr Cash was made aware of the meeting by Mr Berry.Collins said Mr Cash responded to Mr Berry with multiple messages, including one reading: \"You're in spy territory now\".Collins also said information gathered was passed to an individual named \"Alex\" who was believed to be an agent of the Chinese state.He said in assessing whether this was prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state, he had proceeded on the basis the facts, as alleged, by counter terrorism police were true.This included information about the prospect of Tom Tugendhat MP being made a minister and the likelihood of Jeremy Hunt pulling out of the Conservative leadership race.In a new statement released on Wednesday evening, Mr Cash said he was \"completely innocent\". He said: \"I have been placed in an impossible position. I have not had the daylight of a public trial to show my innocence, and I should not have to take part in a trial by media.\"The statements that have been made public are completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial.\"House of CommonsSir Keir Starmer committed to urgently publishing the documents in the Commons on WednesdayMr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.The director of public prosecutions has said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.The Conservatives have claimed the government did not provide sufficient evidence because it does not want to damage relations with Beijing.However, the Labour government has argued that because the alleged offences took place under the Conservatives, the prosecution could only be based on their stance on China at the time.Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Under this government, no minister or special adviser played any role in the provision of evidence.\"The publication of the documents followed pressure from the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who had called for them to be released.On Tuesday, senior government figures had suggested that the CPS had told them publishing the witness statements would be \"inappropriate\".But the CPS later made clear it would not stand in the way if ministers chose to put the government's evidence in the public domain.",

Videos appeared to show a man, who has been widely named as Samuel Williams, telling demonstrators that the chant had been \"workshopped\" in Oxford.The University of Oxford said a student had been arrested in the early hours of Wednesday, but said it had not been told why. It is understood the student has been suspended by the university. The man was arrested at an address in Oxford, police said, and remains in custody. The force did not name the man. In videos he appears to tell the crowd: \"A steadfast and noble resistance in Palestine and in Gaza to look to, to be inspired by and - I don't want to yap for too long - but a chant that we've been workshopping in Oxford that maybe you guys want to join in.\"It goes 'Gaza, Gaza make us proud, put the Zios in the ground'.\"A university spokesperson said: \"An Oxford University student was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday, 15 October.\"The precise basis for the arrest has not yet been disclosed to the university.\"While the university cannot comment on individual student cases, it has the power to take immediate and proportionate action including, as appropriate, suspending a student from membership of the University, whenever serious concerns are raised.\"Oxford University is unequivocal: there is no place for hatred, antisemitism or discrimination within our community, and we will always act to protect the safety and dignity of our students.\"Last week, the prime minister said the government could consider pursuing more curbs on protest laws, including targeting some of the chants used at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",

    "body": "'I never used the word retirement' - Daniel Day-Lewis is back on screen after a seven-year break17 hours agoLizo MzimbaEntertainment correspondent, the London Film FestivalPA MediaDaniel Day-Lewis at the premiere of his new film AnemoneDaniel Day-Lewis may have returned to acting after a seven-year absence, but the actor has said he has not been inundated with new scripts.The 68-year-old was last seen on film in 2017's Phantom Thread, after which his agent released a statement saying he \"will no longer be working as an actor\".But he was tempted back to the screen by the opportunity to work with his son Ronan, who directed and co-wrote his new film Anemone.Asked if he had been swamped with new scripts now that he's returned, Day-Lewis told BBC News: \"No, there's been no inundation. I'm definitely open to the idea of working. \"And just to put the record straight, I never used the word retirement. People have happily used it on my behalf. \"But I felt I needed to work at something else for a while, which I did. I'm glad to be back doing this, and I'm certainly open to doing it again.\"Before stepping back from acting in 2017, Day-Lewis was one of cinema's most sought-after actors, having won three Oscars and starred in films such as Gangs of New York, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.The actor and his son Ronan, 27, co-wrote the script for Anemone, which premiered at the London Film Festival on Tuesday.Universal PicturesDaniel Day-Lewis and director Ronan Day-Lewis discussing a sceneDay-Lewis plays Ray, a former soldier living in isolation in the woods, who is sought out by his brother during a family crisis.\"It was just the idea of working with Ronan,\" the actor said. \"We just thought we'd find a way of doing something together. So it was a very open and unspecific impulse that started it.\"Daniel says he and Ronan quickly found that their ideas were well aligned early in the writing process.\"We very soon found our way into some common ground. The idea of a story about brothers, and it went on from there.\"'Brotherly love'The film sees the three-time Oscar winner's character Ray dealing with his difficult past in the military by cutting himself off from society. Years later, his brother finds him, and tries to persuade him to come home to reunite with his ex-wife and son, who is in trouble after assaulting another young man.That kind of fraternal family dynamic was something that Ronan Day-Lewis was keen to explore, when writing the script with his father.\"I have two brothers,\" he explains. \"And for a few years before we had started working together on anything, I'd had the vague idea of wanting to find a way into that, as a kind of archetype in the story.\"Once we both locked into that and realised that we independently had that interest. It was really just a matter of finding these characters and then just following them into the dark.\"Universal PicturesSean Bean and Daniel Day-Lewis in AnemoneRay's brother Jem is played by Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings star Sean Bean. The British actor says it was a pleasure acting opposite someone of the calibre of Day-Lewis, whom he matches beat for beat in some of the film's most intense scenes.\"Yeah, I was alright,\" laughs Bean. \"He's great to work with. He's very welcoming, he's very generous. \"He's very focused, obviously. We all know his approach to acting, which is admirable. And I just felt very comfortable with that relationship we had together.\"'New themes and emotions'Throughout his career, Day-Lewis has demonstrated his range with a wide variety of roles. Did this one have new themes or emotions that he hadn't tackled before?\"That's a really interesting question,\" he says, pausing to consider it for a few moments. \"I'd say yes, for sure. I think what happened inadvertently was it also became an exploration about the generations of relationships between fathers and sons.\"And that's something, for my own personal reasons, has preoccupied me since childhood. And so I think that certainly became something that was really new and interesting to me.\"Anemone is released in UK cinemas on 7 November.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editorGetty ImagesSenior bankers will be able to pocket bonuses more quickly under a relaxation of rules brought in after the financial crisis of 2007/2008.Senior bankers have had to wait up to eight years to collect their bonus in full to make sure the deals they were being rewarded for turned out to be profitable longer term.From Thursday, that deferral period will be cut to four years and partial payments will be allowed to start in the first year rather than in year three as previously permitted.Regulators insisted that the rules would still discourage reckless risk taking but boost competitiveness by bringing the UK closer into line with other financial centres around the world.Big bonuses for bankers were blamed for encouraging a culture of reckless risk taking which contributed to the great financial crisis which crashed markets and pushed many economies into recession 17 years ago.The decision represents a further relaxation of rules that saw the UK scrap an EU-wide bonus cap that limited payouts to twice bankers base salaries.Regulators at UK financial watchdogs the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) insisted that the rules would still discourage reckless risk taking but bring the UK closer into line with other financial centres around the world - particularly New York which requires no deferrals at all.Sam Woods, chief executive of the PRA, said: \"These new rules will cut red tape without encouraging the reckless pay structures that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. These changes are the latest example of our commitment to boosting UK competitiveness.\"Chancellor Rachel Reeves summoned a number of key regulators to 11 Downing Street earlier this year to urge them to find ways to reduce unnecessary regulation and make the UK more business friendly.The new rules come into effect from Thursday - in plenty of time for the January bonus season. Many financial firms have had a bumper year as market volatility has boosted the money they make from buying and selling shares, government bonds, commodities and currencies.\"The new rules also mean senior managers will continue to follow our high standards and remain on the hook where poor decisions affect consumers and markets\", said Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive at the FCA.",

    "body": "8 hours agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterGetty ImagesWomen and Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson has been urged to speed up her approval of new guidance on the use of single-sex spaces by trans people.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) says its new code of practice must be brought into force \"as soon as possible\" because some organisations are using old guidance, which is unlawful.The updated code sets out how gyms, clubs and hospitals must judge certain spaces in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling in April.The watchdog shared the guidance with Phillipson six weeks ago, but it has yet to be implemented. The government says it is taking its time to study the 300 page document. EHRC chairwoman Baroness Falkner has written to Phillipson, who is also education secretary, for the approval process to be speeded up to prevent organisations relying on outdated advice. The revised guidance can only gain legal force after it has been signed off by ministers, and laid in Parliament for 40 days.\"We have been told by some organisations that they intend to continue using this now unlawful code until the revised code is published, therefore allowing practices inconsistent with the law to persist,\" Falkner says in her letter.\"Our updated code of practice accurately reflects the law and is informed by the two public consultations we ran to ensure it is as clear as possible.\"Baroness Falkner asked that the current code be revoked \"as soon as possible\" now that Parliament has returned from its party conference recess, so \"that courts, tribunals and duty bearers are clear that it is no longer to be relied on\".Approval of an updated code was \"particularly urgent considering the spread of misinformation and misleading information on the law following the Supreme Court judgment which continues to circulate widely,\" she added.Draft guidanceAccording to the draft EHRC code, a birth certificate could be requested by a sports club or hospital if there is \"genuine concern\" about what biological sex a person is.It also said trans people can be excluded from competitive sport \"when necessary for reasons of safety or fair competition\", and gave an example of how some services might be able to adapt to \"offer toilets in individual lockable rooms to be used by both sexes\".The Conservatives have accused Phillipson, who is running to be Labour's deputy leader, of delaying publication of the guidance to avoid losing support during the contest.Shadow women and equalities minister Mims Davies has accused Phillipson of putting \"her own career opportunities ahead of women's rights\".A source close to Phillipson described claims that the timing of publication was politically motivated as \"utter nonsense\".\"Our only consideration is ensuring this guidance protects the dignity and wellbeing of everyone in society,\" the source added.'Robust conversation'Thirty two Labour MPs have written to the EHRC urging it to reconsider its draft guidance, which they say will \"open the door to discrimination and harassment against trans people\".Lucy Powell, Phillipson's deputy leadership rival, has said she believes the EHRC guidance goes too far - and has called for MPs to be given a vote on it. Speaking at a fringe event Labour's annual conference last month, Powell said: \"I think we have got some of the language not right on this, and particularly around some of the guidance that's coming forward.\"I really strongly feel like we need a robust and transparent parliamentary conversation about that, because when we're looking at applying the law as parliamentarians, we should have a say on that and that's something I'll be pushing for as well.\"A government spokesperson said: \"The government is considering the draft updated code and, if the decision is taken to approve it, the minister will lay it before Parliament.\"The proposed code of practice is over 300 pages long, so it is important that the correct process is followed.\"Labour members have begun voting in the contest to replace Angela Rayner as deputy leader. The vote will close on 23 October, with the result to be announced on 25 October.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterThe chancellor should be \"bold\" in next month's Budget or risk future spending cuts and tax rises, an influential think tank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is projecting Rachel Reeves will need to find £22bn to make up a shortfall in the government's finances, and will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes. Finding this amount would allow the government to maintain the £10bn of headroom it has built into the system - but the IFS says there is a \"strong case\" for trying to increase it beyond this amount. IFS director Helen Miller said the lack of a bigger buffer brought with it instability, and could leave the chancellor \"limping from one forecast to the next\".  \"A key challenge is ensuring that fiscal groundhog day doesn't become a twice-yearly ritual,\" Ms Miller said. She said the position the chancellor finds herself in was \"to a large extent, a situation of her own making\".\"When choosing to operate her fiscal rules with such teeny tiny headroom, Ms Reeves would have known that run-of-the-mill forecast changes could easily blow her off course,\" Ms Miller added.The think tank pointed to rising borrowing costs, weaker growth forecasts and spending commitments made since the spring as reasons for the government's tight position. It said Reeves needs to make up that shortfall so she can meet her own fiscal rules, which she has called \"non-negotiable\". The two main rules are:Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliamentTo get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliamentMs Miller added that the \"constant obsession with the headroom\" was a distraction from important debates on how policy could bolster economic growth and the reform of the tax system. Speaking on Wednesday, Reeves gave the strongest indication to date that she is planning to raise taxes in the Budget. The IFS's green budget looks ahead to some of the decisions the government will have to make in its 26 November Budget. The report is funded by the Nuffield Foundation and produced in association with Barclays.In a chapter of its report published last week, the IFS urged said Reeves could raise tens of billions of pounds a year more in revenue without breaking manifesto promises, but this would not be straightforward.During last year's election, Labour said they \"will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of Income Tax, or VAT\" - which the IFS flags as the simplest ways to raise revenue.

    "body": "9 hours agoDavid GrittenBBCIt is difficult to identify bodies with just codes and numbers attached to the bags, Palestinian officials sayA health official in Gaza says a specialist committee is working to identify the bodies of 90 Palestinians handed over by Israel in exchange for dead hostages held by Hamas.If they were unsuccessful, photos would be posted online so families could search for relatives, said Dr Mohammed Zaqout, director general of hospitals for the Hamas-run health ministry.It is not clear whether the bodies - stored at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis - belong to Palestinians who died in Gaza or in Israeli custody. Footage filmed by a freelance journalist working for the BBC at Nasser's mortuary appeared to show the body of a blindfolded man. Another body seemed to have marks around the wrists and ankles.The BBC has asked the Israeli military and justice ministry for comment. They have previously rejected accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees.Under last week's ceasefire agreement with Hamas, Israel has agreed to hand over the bodies of 15 Palestinians in return for every deceased Israeli hostage.So far, the Israeli military has said the remains of six Israeli hostages have been returned.The body of another hostage - a Nepalese national - has also been returned from Gaza, along with the remains of another person who was not a hostage.Israel has called on Hamas to \"make all necessary efforts\" to recover the bodies of the remaining 21 deceased hostages as agreed.The last 20 living hostages were also handed over by Hamas on Monday in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Latest updatesHostage families confirm identities of three of four bodies handed over by HamasTrump demands Hamas disarm, as group moves against 'collaborators' in GazaBowen: Trump's role in Gaza ceasefire was decisive, but not a roadmap to peaceIsraeli authorities handed over 45 Palestinians' bodies to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Monday - with another 45 on Wednesday. The remains were transferred by the ICRC to Nasser hospital.Speaking outside the facility on Tuesday, Dr Zaqout said the first group of bodies had been kept by Israeli authorities in refrigerators, and that \"some are clearly recognisable, while others are difficult to identify\".\"Once confirmed, we will publish the names for the families so they can come forward to identify and bury their loved ones.\"However, Dr Zaqout said health officials had so far received no information to assist them, such as names or the circumstances of death.\"What we received are bodies with codes and numbers. However, we were promised that... we would be provided with the names. We are awaiting further clarification from our colleagues at the International Committee of the Red Cross.\"If we receive the names from [Israel], we will publish them. If not, we will be forced to create a link where photos of the identifiable martyrs will be posted.\"Gaza's health system has been devastated by the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, and lacks the specialist equipment needed for the identification of bodies, such as DNA testing.Rasmieh Qdeih said she was searching for her son, Fadi, who has been missing since the start of the warAlso outside Nasser hospital was Rasmieh Qdeih from Khuzaa, a town east of Khan Younis.She was searching for her son Fadi, 36, who has been missing since 7 October 2023, when the Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.At least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.\"I don't know whether he was imprisoned or martyred. I contacted everyone; no-one told me anything,\" Ms Qdeih said.\"Every time a prisoner is released, I ask them - have you seen Fadi?... Is he a prisoner, a martyr, or missing? They say 'no'. Everyone in Negev prison says they haven't heard that name. Each one tells me something different.\"She said the wait to learn her son's fate was the most difficult she had ever experienced.\"I'm not upset... I just want to know if my son is among them. If not, if they don't find my son among these martyrs, I will be shocked.\"\"If there's anything, I'll recognise him - my son's leg is amputated, and he has vitiligo... His hair is white. I'd know him,\" she added.It is not clear how many bodies of Palestinians from Gaza are being held by Israel.The National Campaign for the Recovery of Martyrs' Bodies, a non-governmental Palestinian campaign group, said last week the remains of at least 735 people, 99 of them from Gaza, were being held by Israel in its mortuaries or cemeteries.It also cited Israeli media reports from last year as saying Israel was holding the bodies of approximately 1,500 Hamas fighters at the Sde Teiman military base.",

The Trump administration has been defending its seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast.  In a dramatic video shared by the US Attorney General, armed camouflaged soldiers are shown swinging down ropes from low flying helicopters, and running along the vessel’s decks. \nThe US claims the tanker is used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\".  The Venezuela government in response has called the seizure blatant theft, claiming Trump is after the country’s rich oil and energy resources. \nIn this episode, Sarah and Justin unpack how far Donald Trump is willing to go in his ongoing campaign against the Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.   In recent months, the US president has accused Maduro of “forcing” criminals into the US and facilitating drug smuggling, which Maduro denies.  And this week, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the killing of over 80 people in US military strikes on alleged drug boats as the “Al Qaeda of our hemisphere”.  \nThe Americast team also look at how this fits in with other South American countries, with Trump recently offering Honduran ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández a ‘full and complete pardon’.   \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Just nowSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterBest-selling author Joanna Trollope has died aged 82, her family has announced.The writer was known as the \"queen of the Aga saga\" because her novels often focused on romance and intrigue in middle England.In a statement, her daughters Louise and Antonia said their \"beloved and inspirational mother\" had died \"peacefully at her Oxfordshire home\" on Thursday.Trollope's novels include The Rector's Wife, Marrying The Mistress and Daughters in Law.Trollope's literary agent James Gill said in a statement: It is with great sadness that we learn of the passing of Joanna Trollope, one of our most cherished, acclaimed and widely enjoyed novelists. \"Joanna will be mourned by her children, grandchildren, family, her countless friends and - of course - her readers.\"Trollope's books have been translated into more than 25 languages, and several have been adapted for television.Trollope was a writer for more than five decades, and one of the best known novelists in the UK.She authored 22 contemporary novels including 2013's Sense & Sensibility, the lead title in HarperCollins's Austen Project, as well as 10 historical novels published under the pseudonym Caroline Harvey. Trollope also occasionally wrote short stories and pieces for magazines, chaired book prizes, authored a 2006 study of women in the British Empire called Britannia's Daughters, and edited a 1993 anthology of rural life, The Country Habit.She received an OBE in 1996 for services to charity, and was made a CBE in 2019 for services to literature. Trollope was born in Gloucestershire, a fifth-generation niece of the English novelist Anthony Trollope.\"I'm not a direct descendent of his, although I'm from the same family, but another branch of it,\" she once told the Independent. \"I admire him hugely, and take several things he said about writing very much to heart.\"She read English at Oxford University and worked in the Foreign Office and as a teacher before becoming a full-time author in 1980.Her early novels were all written under her pseudonym until the release of her first contemporary novel, the choir, in 1987. Several of her later novels were adapted for the screen, including A Village Affair, The Choir, Other People's Children and The Rector's Wife. But the description of her books as \"Aga sagas\" caught on despite only two of Trollope's novels actually feature an Aga.She later admitted she was \"fairly tired of such an inaccurate and patronising tag\".\"Actually, the novels are quite subversive, quite bleak,\" she told the Guardian.Trollope said it was \"a great honour and an even bigger challenge\" to rework Austen's Sense & Sensibility in 2013.But, she had previously said that comparisons of her own work with Austen's \"make me fidget\".\"There is a huge gulf between being great and being good. I know exactly which category I fall into and which she falls into,\" she told the Independent.\"On a good day, I might be good. I think of my writing as contemporary accessible fiction and it really isn't for me to add the qualifying adjectives.\"",

I was heartbroken and I've been like that ever since.\" Mrs Hopkin now wants to raise awareness of the \"dangers of this horrible trend\".In addition to calling for lessons about solvent abuse, the petition also asks for regulations requiring manufacturers to add warnings on their packaging to be enforced.Mrs Hopkin said: \"We're hoping it can be taught in schools, not just the dangers of household chemicals, but the dangers of the internet as well.\"We just want people to be aware so no-one else has to go through this horrible tragedy.\" Sonia HopkinSonia Hopkin described her daughter, Tiegan, as \"outgoing and funny\"Mrs Hopkin also called on TikTok to do more to stop actions, such as chroming, from becoming trends. \"It's amazing that these videos aren't taken down,\" she said. \"I can't understand why anyone would want to share that kind of rubbish.\"One video would be bad, but the fact it has become a trend is unbelievable. It shouldn't be available on the internet.\"The British Aerosol Manufacturers' Association said products must already have several warning statements on packaging, but added a new message using \"better language\" to explain risks would be introduced in 2026.A spokesperson for TikTok said: \"We are deeply saddened by this tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family. \"Content promoting dangerous challenges is not allowed on TikTok, and we proactively removed 99.8% of videos that violated our policies on this issue before they were reported to us. \"Searches for this particular challenge are blocked and we have found no evidence of it ever having been a trend on our platform.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoSima KotechaSenior UK correspondentGetty ImagesChanging attitudes among boys and young men will be at the centre of the government's strategy to tackle violence against women and girls, the BBC has been told.Next Thursday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will unveil the long-delayed plan about how to combat what ministers call a \"national emergency\".It comes after the publication of the strategy has been delayed three times over the last year.The Labour government has pledged to halve the rate of violence against women and girls over the next decade - but critics have questioned its commitment to combating the problem.There are also likely to be concerns as to why the strategy is being published on the day Parliament breaks up for its Christmas holiday.BBC News has been told the violence against women and girls (VAWG) strategy will be built around three goals: preventing radicalisation of young men, stopping abusers, and supporting victims.Over the coming week, the government will announce a policy blitz to tackle what government sources have called \"the scourge of violence that has left the lives of women and girls shattered\".As part of the strategy, ministers will focus on prevention and tackling the root causes of radicalisation of young men in their schools, homes and online. They will work with teachers to challenge misogyny and promote healthy relationships.Government sources say more support will be provided to parents so they can intervene early.They say that is because violence against women and girls is happening at younger ages. Nearly 40% of teenagers in relationships are victims of abuse, according to domestic abuse charity Reducing the Risk.Critics have questioned the Labour government after delays to the strategyOnline influencers are partly blamed for fuelling this. It's been reported more than one in five young men hold a positive view of the self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate.Over the last year alone, one in every eight women was a victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault or stalking, according to Home Office figures.The statistics also show that every day about 200 rapes are recorded by the police, and many more go unreported. Hundreds of thousands of children are estimated to be sexually abused every year.Earlier this week, MPs on the justice committee wrote to the government complaining about the strategy being delayed.The letter was signed by the committee's chair, Andy Slaughter MP, who said: \"Repeated delays in publications sends the message that tackling VAWG is not a government priority, despite the ambition to halve VAWG within the next decade.\"The strategy will have a cross-government approach including collaboration between the Home Office, Department of Health and Social Care, Ministry of Justice, Department for Education, and Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, the BBC was told.\"There will also be a raft of new measures, so rapists and sex offenders have nowhere to hide.  We will track down abusers, empower police forces with the tools they need to do so and put abusers on a course to stop their offending\", a government source said.But it is not yet clear what these tools will be.'Proof in the pudding'Hayley Johns is a survivor of domestic abuse and said the \"proof will be in the pudding\".\"If you're going to be saying all these words, make sure it works. We're in absolute crisis when it comes to domestic violence. The actions must match your words otherwise it's pointless.\"There needs to be proof and statistics to show this strategy is working and in a year's time there needs to be a difference otherwise it's just rubbish.\"The government also wants to support victims who say failures by police and delays in court are worse than the offences themselves. More than half of rape and stalking cases collapse because victims drop out of the process.Many victims feel intimidated in their own homes and by economic abuse and coercive controlling behaviour, including stalking.The strategy will aim to better support them, while justice is done.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPeter Hoskins,Business reporterandLily Jamali,North America technology correspondentUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at blocking states from enforcing their own artificial intelligence (AI) regulations.\"We want to have one central source of approval,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday.It will give the Trump administration tools to push back on the most \"onerous\" state rules, said White House AI adviser David Sacks. The government will not oppose AI regulations around children's safety, he added.The move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America's goal of leading the fast-developing industry.AI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, with firms pouring billions of dollars into the technology.The BBC has contacted AI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic for comment.But the announcement has been met with opposition. The state of California, which is the home to many of the world's biggest technology companies, already has its own AI regulations.California's Governor Gavin Newsom, who is a vocal critic of Trump, issued a strongly-worded statement in response to the executive order, accusing him of corruption.\"Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology.\"Earlier this year, Newsom signed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit risks stemming from their AI models.States including Colorado and New York have also passed laws regulating the development of the technology.Newsom has said the law sets a standard that US lawmakers could follow. Other critics of Trump's executive order argue that state laws are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level.\"Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states' basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,\" said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement.But having individual states craft their own laws has created a patchwork of rules that can be harmful to the American AI industry, said Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School.\"It would be better to have one federal law than a bunch of conflicting state laws. However, that assumes that we will have a good federal law in place,\" he told the BBC.The tech lobby group NetChoice celebrated the executive order on Thursday. \"We look forward to working with the White House and Congress to set nationwide standards and a clear rulebook for innovators,\" said its director of policy Patrick Hedger.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJoe McFaddenHealth reporterRose StokesRose Stokes is a freelance journalist and mother of twoAfter giving birth to her second child, Rose Stokes was exhausted all the time. \"I couldn't really do anything more than the bare minimum in terms of looking after my kids. I'd put them down at seven and have to get straight into bed,\" the freelance journalist says.Rose thought it was just what being a mum of two young children was like.But being tired wasn't the only problem. \"I also had other symptoms, like my hair was falling out.\"I had a funny, metallic taste [in my mouth] all the time. I kept getting tongue ulcers as well and [experienced] breathlessness and dizziness.\"I went to the doctor's a few times and every time was told, 'oh well, you're a mum of small children, what do you expect?' - but the level of exhaustion was just so intense,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.After several visits to her doctor, Rose requested a blood test which showed low levels of the protein ferritin.While Rose's first doctor initially dismissed her ferritin levels as, in her words, \"not being that low\", she managed to see another doctor who eventually gave her a diagnosis - iron deficiency.It's a relatively common problem, especially in women. Around 8% of women have it, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, while far fewer men are affected  – only 3% in the UK.Pregnancy - like Rose had just experienced - is a common cause.Rose's symptoms - tiredness, dizziness and tongue ulcers - are just some of the things to look out for.Other common symptoms can include shortness of breath, heart palpitations, paler than usual skin and headaches, while some people could experience rarer symptoms like tinnitus, restless legs syndrome and hair loss.For her deficiency, Rose was initially prescribed iron tablets - the most common form of treatment - but, despite trying three different ones, found none of them agreed with her.Dr Sue Pavord, a consultant haematologist at NHS Hospitals Oxford, says taking iron tablets first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a glass of water or some Vitamin C is the best approach - otherwise you risk them not working effectively. After she responded badly to tablets, Rose's doctor referred her for an iron infusion - a way of quickly getting iron into your bloodstream.This can be \"transformative for women with severe deficiency\", Dr Pavord says, but she also stresses that tablets can work \"extremely well\" so it's important to try them first.But what you eat can also help limit your risk of becoming iron deficient in the first place, according to Dr Pavord.She suggests foods which contain absorbable iron like red meat, chicken, liver and fish. Vegetables like spinach, kale and broccoli also contain iron, but the body doesn't absorb it from these sources as effectively as meat.Two-and-a-half months on from her infusion, Rose says she feels like \"a completely different person\".\"I can do stuff. Initially it was just like getting to the end of the day and being like, right, we can sit and watch some TV or being able to get up with the kids in the morning and not feeling like I was dying.\"",

    "body": "47 minutes agoNaomi Clarke,BBC NewsbeatandChristine Nababan,BBC Indonesia, BaliEPATia Billinger, better known as Bonnie Blue, will be deported for an immigration violationAdult content creator Tia Billinger, better known as Bonnie Blue, will be deported from Indonesia after being cleared of breaking the country's strict anti-pornography laws.She was found guilty of a minor traffic offence, but was deported for an immigration violation due to working on a tourist visa.The 26-year-old was one of 34 people detained when police raided a production studio in Bali, prompting a police investigation.Bali - which is predominantly Hindu and visited by millions of tourists every year - is part of Muslim-majority Indonesia, which strictly forbids the production of pornographic material.Those found guilty of violating these laws face up to 12 years in prison and a fine of around $360,000 (£270,000).Ms Billinger was ordered to pay a fine of Rp 200,000 (about $12/£9) and will leave Indonesia on a flight set to depart just after midnight local time.Immigration officials said they would issue a statement on whether their request to blacklist the social media star, preventing her from re-entering the country, had been put into effect.Earlier this week, Badung Police reported that 16 foreign and 14 Indonesian witnesses said they had been in a studio in the Pererenan area, Mengwi, to take part in the production of an \"entertainment-themed reality show\", but they claimed \"no indecent material was produced\".Ms Billinger was among four other individuals who were identified as having \"dominant roles\" in the production.Badung police also said investigators looked into the purchase of a pickup truck which had \"Bonnie Blue\" and \"Bang Bus\" branded on it. Police said the four individuals confirmed they were aware of Indonesia's ban on producing pornographic content.Investigators also looked at videos recorded at a hotel in the Berawa area of the country, but \"found no elements of pornography or any unlawful distribution\".However, the four foreign nationals are suspected of \"misusing their stay permits\" to work on commercial content.Badung police chief M Arif Batubara said they are ensuring \"all processes are carried out based on legal facts\" and are working with prosecutors and immigration authorities to \"determine the next legal steps\".Ms Billinger is known to film controversial videos which have seen her tour universities looking for \"barely legal\" teenagers in a bus with the same name.The content creator, originally from Nottingham, had been driving around Bali during 'schoolies week', which is a tradition in Australia where high school graduates go on a holiday after their exams.Last year, she had planned to produce 'schoolies' porn, but her Australian tourist visa was cancelled.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoLucy HookerBusiness reporterNationwide has been fined £44m for not having the right processes in place for detecting financial crime between 2016 and 2021.The building society had \"ineffective systems\" for assessing risk and monitoring the transactions of its customers, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said.In one instance, Nationwide missed opportunities to identify unusual activity after £26m of fraudulent Covid furlough payments were paid into one personal account in the space of just eight days.Nationwide said it had fully co-operated with the regulator's investigation and since 2021 had invested in its crime control systems to ensure they were \"robust\".During the period in question Nationwide did not offer business accounts.The FCA said that even though the building society was aware that some customers were using personal accounts for business activity, it did not have an accurate picture of who presented a higher risk of financial crime. As a result money laundering risks were not effectively monitored, it said.The customer who banked the illegitimate furlough payments received £27.3m over 13 months. Most, but not all of it, has since been recovered by the tax authority.The FCA said Nationwide's controls should have prompted a review of the unusual activity more quickly than it did.The government provided furlough or Job Retention Scheme (JRS) funds to support firms during the Covid pandemic. The receipt of JRS funds was a strong indication that an account was being used for business purposes, the FCA said.In all, £64m of JRS funds were paid into more than 5,000 personal accounts at Nationwide, it said.\"Nationwide failed to get a proper grip of the financial crime risks lurking within its customer base,\" said Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA.\"It took too long to address its flawed systems and weak controls, meaning red flags were missed with serious consequences,\" she said.The Nationwide said it had identified the shortcomings through its own reviews and had brought them to the attention of the FCA.\"We are sorry that our controls during the period fell below the high standards we expect,\" a spokesperson said.\"Since 2021, Nationwide has invested significantly in all aspects of its economic crime control framework in order to ensure our systems are robust.\"We do not believe that these controls issues caused financial loss to any of our customers and remain committed to preventing economic crime and protecting our customers and the wider UK economy from fraud,\" they added.",

    "body": "24 minutes agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe UK's economy shrank unexpectedly in the lead up to the Budget, according to the latest official figures.The economy contracted by 0.1% in October, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, whereas economists had been expecting it to grow by 0.1%. The economy also shrank by 0.1% in the three months to October.The cyber-attack at Jaguar Land Rover continued to affect car production, with only a slight recovery in October from the previous month's fall, while analysts said uncertainty ahead of the Budget had slowed consumer and business spending.The weaker-than-expected figures strengthen the case for the Bank of England to cut interest rates at its meeting next week, analysts said.The government has made economic growth one of its key priorities.A Treasury spokesperson said the government was working to boost economic growth through reducing energy bills and major infrastructure investments. \"We are determined to defy the forecasts on growth and create good jobs, so everyone is better off, while also helping us invest in better public services,\" the spokesperson said.Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride blamed the Budget for the unexpected contraction, saying it was \"a direct result of Labour's economic mismanagement\".\"For months, Rachel Reeves has misled the British public. She said she wouldn't raise taxes on working people - she broke that promise again. She insisted there was a black hole in the public finances - but there wasn't.\"Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the surprise contraction in the economy was \"a further reason to expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates next Thursday.\"\"It's striking that the economy has only grown in one of the past seven months,\" she said.Over the three months to October, production output shrank by 0.5%, largely driven by a 17.7% fall in vehicle manufacturing.The cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover halted production at its plants across the UK for the whole of September, and there was a staged return to factory activity from early October.The resumption of vehicle manufacturing helped lift production output across the UK for that month, which grew by 1.1%.However, the ONS noted the rebound in vehicle manufacturing had been small, as it was still well below levels seen in August. The services sector, which makes up about three-quarters of the economy and includes areas such as professional services and retailing, did not grow at all in the three months to October.October's contraction comes after the economy shrank by 0.1% in September and was flat in August.The monthly GDP figures are more volatile than the rolling three-month data, which is considered to give a better underlying picture of growth.But Jack Meaning, UK chief economist at Barclays bank and a former adviser at the Bank of England, told the BBC's Today programme the latest figures showed the economy was \"unambiguously weak\".\"It's continuing the story we've seen more or less all the way through this year of growth decelerating from relatively strong numbers at the start to much weaker numbers now, and actually outright contraction,\" he said.\"Ultimately part of the story today is that we didn't see as much of a bounce-back of that Jaguar Land Rover closure as we had expected. We thought that would all bounce back pretty quickly; it looks like it might take a little bit longer.\"Mr Meaning added that data from Barclays indicated that the uncertainty ahead of the Budget weighed on the economy as people \"held off purchases and big spending decisions\".Scott Gardner, investment strategist at JP Morgan Personal Investing, said Budget speculation ahead of the chancellor's speech \"had a numbing effect\" on spending.\"Budget speculation and uncertainty around potential tax changes dampened the mood among businesses and consumers, leading some to delay key decisions until the Budget had been delivered,\" he said.Card and gift retailer Card Factory said on Friday it had been affected by pressures on consumers which had hit \"confidence and shopping behaviour\", adding it was cutting its profit forecast due to weaker than expected sales.Fergus Jimenez-England, associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the chancellor's increase to her financial buffer in the Budget \"should help reduce uncertainty over the coming year\", but it was unclear whether that would strengthen economic activity.But KPMG UK's chief economist Yael Selfin said investment from the private sector and government \"could help foster growth over the coming year\".\"As a result, we expect investment to remain a key contributor to growth going into 2026,\" she said.",

    "body": "6 hours agoYang TianReutersNemo made history by becoming the first non-binary performer to win Eurovision in 2024The winner of last year's Eurovision Song Contest, Nemo, has said they are returning their trophy in protest over Israel's continued participation in the event.The 26-year-old Swiss singer said there was a \"clear conflict\" between Israel's involvement in the competition and the ideals of \"unity, inclusion and dignity\" the contest says it stands for.Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said Eurovision was \"saddened\" by the decision and respected Nemo's views.Israel's presence at Eurovision has been an increasing source of tension, because of the war in Gaza and a voting controversy during this year's event.Five countries - Iceland, Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands - have announced they will boycott next year's event because Israel has been allowed to compete.Israel has previously called the decision to keep it in the contest a \"victory\" over critics who had tried to silence it and spread hatred.Nemo became the first non-binary performer to lift the Eurovision trophy with their song The Code, which is about the path to realising they were non-binary.After the win, Nemo told the BBC about the challenges they faced during the contest and their feeling that organisers had not done enough to support participants caught up in the row over Israel's inclusion in 2024.\"I felt very alone. I really hope they have things in place for the next year,\" Nemo said at the time. It prompted a series of new measures to be introduced to protect the mental well-being of Eurovision's artists and staff.In a statement posted to Instagram on Thursday, Nemo said they felt the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) decision to allow Israel to still take part in the event no longer aligned with its core values.\"Israel's continued participation, during what the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry has concluded to be a genocide, shows a clear conflict between those ideals and the decision made by the EBU,\" they said, referring to a report released in September.\"Even though I am immensely grateful for the community around this contest and everything this experience has taught me both as a person and artist, today I no longer feel this trophy belongs on my shelf.\"Nemo also posted a video of them placing the trophy in a cardboard box, saying it will be sent back to the EBU's headquarters in Geneva.In a statement sent to BBC News, Martin Green said: \"We're saddened that Nemo wishes to return their trophy which they deservedly won in 2024. \"We respect the deeply held views Nemo has expressed and they will always remain a valued part of the Eurovision family\"EPANemo performing at the 2024 Eurovision in Malmo, SwedenThe boycotts and protests over Israel's inclusion have been the biggest crisis Eurovision has ever seen.This year's competition also had a voting controversy and allegations that Israel's government tried to influence the public vote.This prompted some competition rules to be changed and tightened, after which a \"large majority\" of members agreed there was no need for a further vote on participation and that Eurovision 2026 could proceed as planned, the EBU has said.Israel's President Isaac Herzog has praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it an \"appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation\".Addressing the boycotts, Nemo insisted that their decision to hand back the trophy was not about \"individuals or artists\", but rather what they believed was the use of Eurovision to \"soften the image of a state accused of severe wrongdoing\".\"When entire countries withdraw, it should be clear that something is deeply wrong,\" they added.\"If the values we celebrate on stage aren't lived off stage then even the most beautiful songs become meaningless.\"The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 70,370 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Next year's Eurovision is due to take place in Vienna, for what is supposed to be a celebratory 70th anniversary edition of the contest.",

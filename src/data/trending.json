    "body": "26 minutes agoCaroline HawleyDiplomatic CorrespondentTelegramFootage shared on social media showed protesters breaking the gate of the governor's office in FasaProtesters in Iran have tried to break into a local government building in the southern province of Fars, on a fourth day of demonstrations sparked by a currency collapse.Officials said three police officers were injured and four people arrested in the city of Fasa.Confrontations were also been reported in the western provinces of Hamedan and Lorestan.The authorities in the capital, Tehran, had declared Wednesday a bank holiday - in an apparent effort to quell the unrest.In video that emerged on social media and was verified by the BBC, a crowd is filmed breaking the gate of the governor's office in Fasa.Then, in another post, security men are seen shooting in response. Clouds of tear gas rise in front of shuttered shops.Across the country, schools, universities and public institutions were closed because of the last-minute public holiday announced by the Iranian government.It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran on Sunday - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesTatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy, has died aged 35.Her family announced her death in a social media post shared by the John F Kennedy Library Foundation, writing: \"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts.\"In November, Schlossberg, a climate journalist, announced her diagnosis of an aggressive form of cancer. She said in an essay that she had been given less than a year to live.Schlossberg was the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy, and is survived by her husband George Moran and their two children, three-year-old Edwin and one-year-old Josephine.In an article published last month in The New Yorker titled, \"A Battle With My Blood,\" Schlossberg revealed she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in May 2024, after giving birth to her second child.\"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me,\" she wrote.Schlossberg described the treatments she received, including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, but shared that doctors did not give her a good prognosis.She also wrote of the pain she feared her passing would cause for her family, which has endured multiple personal tragedies. Her grandfather, President Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963 and her uncle, John F Kennedy Jr, died in a plane crash in 1999. Her younger brother, Jack Schlossberg, is running for Congress in New York.\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" Schlossberg wrote.\"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she said.In her essay, Schlossberg also expressed disappointment in her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr's appointment to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Another relative, Maria Shriver, a journalist and the former first lady of California, paid tribute to her \"sweet, beloved Tatiana\" as someone who \"loved her life\".\"She created a beautiful life with her extraordinary husband George, and children Eddie and Josie.

    "body": "Finnish police have detained a vessel suspected of damaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland.The cargo vessel, the Fitburg, was sailing from St Petersburg to the port of Haifa in Israel, under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.All 14 crew members were arrested after the cable owned by Finnish telecoms operator Elisa was damaged. The operator said in a statement that the damage had \"not affected the functionality of Elisa's services in any way\", and that its services had been re-routed.The Baltic Sea has seen a series of incidents in recent years in which underwater cables have been damaged or completely cut.Many experts and political leaders have viewed the recent incidents as part of a \"hybrid war\" carried out by Russia against Western countries. The issue has come under increased focus since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Police said they were investigating \"aggravated disruption of telecommunications\" and \"aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage\".The detained crew members were Russian, Georgian, Kazakh and Azerbaijani, police added.Undersea cables carry crucial electricity and data between countries, and keep people connected to the internet.On Wednesday morning, the Finnish authorities sent a helicopter and a patrol ship to the area, where they found the vessel was dragging its anchor in the sea, Finland's coastguard said.They said they had \"launched operations this morning to investigate the suspected cable damage\" after telecoms provider Elisa detected a fault.Finnish police said the authorities had \"taken control of the vessel as part of a joint operation\".\"At this stage, the police are investigating the incident as aggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications,\" the police added.\"Finland is prepared for security challenges of various kinds, and we respond to them as necessary,\" Finnish President Alexander Stubb said in a statement on social media. At a press conference, police were asked by journalists if the cable was damaged on behalf of another country, local media reported.Police Chief Ilkka Koskimäki replied that \"the police or other authorities do not speculate on these matters. The police's job is to investigate what happened.\"Eight Nato countries border the Baltic Sea - Finland, Estonia, Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden - which also borders Russia.Estonia's government said a second telecoms cable connecting it to Finland also suffered an outage on Wednesday. The country's President Alar Karis said \"hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify\".The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen posted on X, adding that it was prepared to counter \"hybrid threats\".\"We're already talking about national security. Critical infrastructure is the front line,\" the Finnish MP Jarno Limnell commented on the incident, in a post on X.Nato has identified deep-sea cables as part of the world's critical infrastructure and previously warned that adversaries could exploit them through sabotage or hybrid warfare, threatening both civilian and military communications.\"Hybrid warfare\" includes underwater sabotage, anonymous cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, and non-military tactics to destabilise adversaries.In December 2024, Finnish police said they were investigating whether a Russian ship was involved in the sabotage of an electricity cable running between Finland and Estonia.A month earlier, the German government said damage to two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea looked like an act of sabotage. A cable between Finland and Germany was cut, as well as another cable between Lithuania and Sweden's Gotland Island. ",

Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped \"between a bench and a table\". He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, \"I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me\".AFP via Getty ImagesThe UK Foreign Office said it was \"supporting a number of British nationals involved\" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured. After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.Niels HonkoopNiels Honkoop (right) described the accident as \"chaos\"\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.Watch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu PicchuMore on this story",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has made the first vetoes of legislation since retaking the White House nearly a year ago, setting up a potential showdown with US lawmakers.The two bills he vetoed passed Congress with bipartisan support, meaning lawmakers could muster enough votes to override him in the new year.A Trump ally, and well-known Republican, Representative Lauren Boebert, sponsored one of the bills, which was aimed at cutting the amounts that communities in her home state of Colorado are paying toward a new water pipeline.The other bill would have supported a flooding mitigation project for a Native American tribe in Florida that had sued to stop construction of \"Alligator Alcatraz\".In a message to Congress, Trump called the Colorado plan economically unviable.\"Enough is enough.  My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies,\" Trump said.He added the bill would have hurt repayments to the federal government for building the pipeline, which will bring fresh water to the eastern part of the state..Boebert, one of a handful of conservative lawmakers to break with Trump and push for the release of the Epstein files this winter, responded to the veto with a post on X, writing: \"This isn't over.\"\"I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation,\" she then said in a statement.Trump has also sparred with Colorado's political leaders over the imprisonment of Tina Peters, a 73-year-old county clerk who echoed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and was convicted by both the state and US government for election security-related offences.Trump, who pardoned Peters of her federal charges this month, has called on the Colorado's Democratic governor, Jared Polis, to release her. Polis has said it is up to the courts to decide her case, which has become a rallying cry for Trump's Make America Great Again wing of the Republican party.\"Free Tina Peters!\" Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday, and wrote about Colorado officials: \"I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell.\"The second bill he vetoed, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act, would have required the Interior Department to help the tribe in Florida prevent flooding in a part of their community that has vulnerable infrastructure.In his veto message, Trump wrote that the Miccosukee had conducted \"unauthorised\" development on the land in question.The White House also alleged the tribe \"actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.\"The Miccosukee tribe took legal action against the Trump administration's construction of an immigration detention centre in the Florida Everglades known as \"Alligator Alcatraz\".In court filings, the tribe had argued it was uniquely impacted by the construction of the site, and its construction posed environmental risks.",

The vacuum of space also means that contaminants can't sneak in.The purer and more ordered a semiconductor is, the better it works.\"The work that we're doing now is allowing us to create semiconductors up to 4,000 times purer in space than we can currently make here today,\" says Josh Western, CEO of Space Forge.\"This sort of semiconductor would go on to be in the 5G tower in which you get your mobile phone signal, it's going to be in the car charger you plug an EV into, it's going to be in the latest planes.\"Tony Jolliffe/BBC NewsVeronica Viera said seeing the images of glowing plasma from space was amazing  The company's mini-factory launched on a SpaceX rocket in the summer. Since then the team has been testing its systems from their mission control in Cardiff.Veronica Viera, the company's payload operations lead, shows us an image that the satellite beamed back from space.It's taken from the inside of the furnace, and shows plasma -  gas heated to about 1,000C - glowing brightly.She told us seeing the image was \"one of the most exciting moments of my life\".\"This is so important because it's one of the core ingredients that we need for our in-space manufacturing process,\" she explains.  \"So being able to demonstrate this is amazing.\"Space ForgeThe heat shield will need to be tested to see if it can safely return the materials The team is now planning to build a bigger space factory - one that could make semiconductor material for 10,000 chips.They also need to test the technology to bring the material back to Earth.On a future mission, a heat shield named Pridwen after the legendary shield of King Arthur will be deployed to protect the spacecraft from the intense temperatures it will experience as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.Other companies are also looking skywards -  to make everything from pharmaceuticals to artificial tissues.\"In-space manufacturing is something that is happening now,\" says Libby Jackson, head of space at the Science Museum.\"It's the early days and they're still showing this in small numbers at the moment.\"But by proving the technology it really opens the door for an economically viable product,  where things can be made in space and return to Earth and have use and benefit to everybody on Earth. And that's really exciting.\"",

    "body": "Leicester Tigers stalwart Dan Cole will leave the club after 18 years due to personal reasons.Cole, 38, played for the Tigers between 2007 and 2025 before taking up the role of recruitment and retention manager after hanging up his boots.The former prop turned out over 340 times for the club - breaking the record of league appearances for Leicester in 2023-24.\"I am leaving Tigers with a heavy heart,\" Cole said.\"This club means everything to me and it has been an honour to represent the badge. Unfortunately, a change in personal circumstances dictates that I cannot give the role the attention it deserves moving forwards so I am stepping away.\"I have no doubt that the club is on strong footing for 2026 and beyond and wish Geoff, the players and everyone at Mattioli Woods Welford Road the best of luck.\"Leicester-born Cole won four Premiership titles during his time at Welford Road.He also represented England on 118 occasions and helped them win three Six Nations championships.\"Dan leaves the club, but his legacy as a player, employee and most importantly as a person will remain,\" Tigers chief executive Andrea Pinchen said.\"He epitomises the toughness, passion and love for the badge that this club is all about.\"He will be missed.\"",

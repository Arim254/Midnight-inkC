    "body": "3 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterDisney/PixarA new trailer for the forthcoming Toy Story movie, the fifth in the US animated adventure comedy film franchise, has been released by Disney and Pixar.It shows the return of Buzz Lightyear, Woody, Jessie and the rest of the toys as they come face-to-face with the latest modern threat to their existence - a frog-like tablet called Lilypad.Pixar said the newcomer has \"her own disruptive ideas about what is best for their kid, Bonnie\", raising the question: \"Will playtime ever be the same?\"The short clip also teases a reunion between Buzz and Woody, following the latter's decision to leave the gang to help abandoned toys in the previous film, 2019's Toy Story 4.Disney/PixarThe new film will see the toys threatened by the arrival of a new frog-like tablet device called LilypadThe films, set in a world where toys come to life when humans are not present, have been hugely popular since the franchise launched in 1995. \"It's been too long cowboy,\" says space cadet Buzz - again voiced by Tim Allen - in the new trailer, released late on Thursday. He then embraces a now slightly balding Woody, as ever portrayed by Tom Hanks.The pair are later seen bickering just as they did in the old days. \"It's good to see them fighting again\" notes one of the other toys, Mr Potato Head - now voiced by Jeff Bergman following the death of Don Rickles.Joan Cusack reprises her roll as Jessie, while many other characters from the first four films return.They include the wisecracking piggy bank, Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Forky (Tony Hale) and Slinky Dog (Blake Clarke), as well as Keanu Reeves' Duke Kaboom.Disney/PixarJessie and Bullseye are among the old characters returning for the fifth instalmentAs for the newbies, Past Lives star Greta Lee voices Lilypad, while US chat show host Conan O'Brien plays a new character, Smarty Pants, opposite Anna Vocino as Mrs Potato Head and Scarlett Spears as Bonnie.Craig Robinson joins the cast as Atlas, a cheerful talking GPS hippo toy, and Ernie Hudson arrives as Combat Carl, alongside Shelby Rabara as Snappy, an excitable toy camera.Noting the changes in toy technology since the story first began more than 30 years ago, the tagline for the new film reads: \"Times may change but friends are forever.\"In the trailer for the new film - which will also feature another original score by Oscar winner, Randy Newman - we also hear Buzz declare: \"Our mission on this planet, is to make a child happy.\"Disney/PixarThe Toy Story franchise has spawned five films, as well as a Buzz Lightyear spin-offIt was a huge success, spawning several subsequent sequels, as well as a Buzz Lightyear spin-off.The films in the main series have all set new box office records on release, and combined they have grossed more than £3 billion worldwide, as well as garnering critical acclaim.The original movie received a special achievement Academy Award for having pioneered computer-animated filmmaking, while Toy Story 3 (2010) and Toy Story 4 (2019) both won the Oscar for best animated feature.Toy Story 5 is released in cinemas on 19 June.

Local authorities have been trying to step up efforts to get a grip on the issue by using methods such as surveillance cameras to catch culprits.\"Ingenuity can never become an alibi for incivility,\" the municipality of Catania said in a post on its official Facebook page.\"Respect for urban etiquette and the environment is everyone's duty,\" it added.The post did not say whether any action had been taken.",

    "body": "10 minutes agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterGetty ImagesMajor restaurant chains, including KFC, have ditched a commitment to improve chicken sourcing standards in the UK as poultry demand soars.Eight restaurant groups, which also include the owners of Burger King and Nando's, have left the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC), in which they pledged to stop using fast-growing chickens, for an industry-led plan without that commitment.Animal welfare groups say fast-growing \"franken-chickens\" mature quicker but also have higher rates of premature death and muscle disease.Trade body UKHospitality said the industry-led plan will help restaurant firms reduce emissions and meet surging demand for the lean protein while ensuring secure supply chains.Allen Simpson, CEO of UKHospitality, which represents some of the restaurant brands who have withdrawn from the BCC, said despite the change the businesses are \"committed to enhancing their ongoing work across welfare and the environment\".The eight businesses, owning or franchising 18 leading restaurant chains, have instead joined the industry-led Sustainable Chicken Forum (SCF).Some of the brands include include Popeyes, Wingstop, and Wagamama.The SCF said businesses \"no longer believe the BCC is the right framework to drive the next phase of progress on welfare due to the requirement to source only slower-growing breeds\".It argued that farming slower-growing breeds produce more greenhouse gas emissions than farming faster-growing breeds.UKHospitality said the SCF will focus on increasing welfare while limiting the environmental impact of chicken farming and keeping up with demand.The BBC understands the famous chicken chain owned by Yum Brands buys about 4% of the UK chicken supply. An industry source said there is not yet a large enough supply of slower-growing poultry in the UK.However, animal welfare group Anima International said the change was \"about money and nothing else\".Its UK chief executive Connor Jackson said the companies' explanation for leaving is rubbish.\"Franken-chickens pose the most serious animal welfare problem in the UK,\" Jackson said.He said that chicken farmers and poultry companies would produce more slower-growing, higher-welfare chickens according to orders.\"This is why the supply isn't there for them now: producers won't do it unless they have a contract in place because they are more expensive,\" he said.Claire Williams, campaigns manager at The Humane League UK, said it was clear to her animal welfare group why the chicken outlets had switched membership. \"Major food companies, with the combined worth of many billions of pounds, have decided that their profit margins cannot be threatened,\" Williams said.\"The Better Chicken Commitment was designed by scientists to help animals - the Sustainable Chicken Forum is a welfare-washing, PR-stunt designed to deflect criticism, and let these companies claim they are doing enough\".Richard Griffiths, head of the British Poultry Council, which represents poultry breeders and processors, said the news was \"most welcome\".He said that at a time of higher production costs and slow planning approvals the industry did not need added costs.Retailers such as M&S and Waitrose and cafe chains Pret and Greggs remain members of the BCC.",

The Cardiff Devils fan flew to Milan on Sunday to watch Canada play France in the men's ice hockey. The 27-year-old realised while it would cost him about £125 for the train and football in Conwy county - plus the cost of food and drink - his entire Italy trip would set him back £135.\"It was cheaper than me going to Llandudno to watch Barry Town,\" he said. The only potential glitch in his 24-hour trip was that he had to avoid forking out for a hotel, which could have added an extra £400 to his bill. McAllister, a full-time YouTuber from Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, landed in Milan at 11:00 GMT. He said: \"Being at the Winter Olympics was fantastic.\"There were people there from all over, though the two teams playing were heavily represented - there were 5,000 or 6,000 from Canada there. \"It was almost a party-like atmosphere, everyone was very excited, it was a massive event.\"Canada, who were the favourites, beat France 10-2. After the game McAllister, who supported Canada, took in the sights and enjoyed some pizza.John McAllisterHe previously spent more than a month travelling to a football game in KazakhstanIt was not McAllister's first time in Milan - he said he'd visited the \"fantastic\" city a couple of times before. \"Once I was watching football and the other times I was taking a long train to Sicily,\" he said.By 23:00 he was back at the airport where he caught 40 winks before his 06:00 flight the next day.\"I found a corner and put my head down,\" he said, proving that a bargain trip to the Winter Olympics can be done.\"It says a lot about why people don't tend to use public transport in the UK. It costs so much money.\"He has also watched rugby in New Zealand, ice hockey in Canada and football in Singapore.His girlfriend, Beth, does not always join him on his sports trips. \"It's safe to say she thinks I'm slightly mad,\" he said.More top stories",

    "body": "We traded our London terraced home for an 80-acre nature reserve in Wales10 hours agoAmelia Shone-AdamsBBC WalesLou BournsAdam and Lou have always been passionate about being in the outdoors, making many trips to west Wales in their campervanIt was a decision that shocked their friends - quitting life on a busy terraced street in London for rural Wales. But after being continually drawn back in their campervan, Adam and Lou Bourns decided to leave their life in Brixton and start afresh in Carmarthenshire. They have spent 14 years turning their nature reserve into an award-winning sustainable glamping retreat.Everything has been built from scratch, and as they share the hills with Exmoor ponies, their busy fast-paced lives in London seem like a distant memory.\"We just kept on getting drawn over the bridge [to Wales],\" said Lou.\"Every opportunity we could dash out of London in our campervan and come west, we would.\"It's a very special place.\"Adam grew up in rural Norfolk and worked as a sound engineer, while Lou was born in the Netherlands and had a career in arts education in London.Despite both being successful in their chosen jobs, and having young children growing up surrounded by the buzz of the city on a London terraced street, they felt something was missing.\"The business was always part of the dream,\" said Lou. \"It was kind of our way of changing our pace of life, having something a bit more gentle for the kids, living closer to nature.\"Lou added: \"We just kind of had this strong feeling that it felt like a time for change.\" Under Starry SkiesAdam and Lou moved to west Wales from London in 2012After spending a few years looking at properties, the couple, who bonded over their love of nature, camping and outdoor activities, came across the 80-acre piece of land in the Carmarthenshire countryside.While family and friends were initially shocked the couple were moving to Wales to open a glamping retreat, Lou and Adam felt they were vindicated in making the life-changing decision when their new neighbours started popping around to introduce themselves and offer a hand with unpacking. \"Moving from a big city where you quite often don't know anyone, this has just been so precious,\" Lou said. Under Starry SkiesFamily and friends were initially shocked that the couple were moving to Wales to open a glamping retreatSince then Adam has slowly built everything from scratch over the years, with help from friends and family. There are now two cabins, a shepherd's hut and a barn. \"The whole thing's been really slow and organic, but it works well that way,\" he said. It has all been made as eco-consciously as possible, with the cabins completely off grid including tanks for collecting rain water, solar panels for power, and gas bottles for cooking.The couple do all the cleaning, washing and maintenance - with the help of four Exmoor ponies who live on the land. Their grazing helps with land conservation and encouraging wildflowers to grow.Under Starry SkiesRosemarie, Jasper, Nora and Bear live on the land full time.Since 2017, the land has also been home to several beehives.These are cared for by a local beekeeper, with their honey available at the on-site honesty shop.In 2020, Marsh Fritillary butterfly larvae webs and Brown Hairstreak butterfly eggs were laid at the retreat and continue to thrive there. Both species are in decline due to habitat loss, making their presence even more important.Under Starry SkiesThe land is also home to several beehives, with their honey available at the on-site honesty shop.The retreat has won awards over the years for their sustainability.In 2018 they were named Silver Sustainable Tourism Business of the Year by the Carmarthenshire Tourism Association, and in 2025 they won an award for being the best stargazing accommodation in Carmarthenshire.  The couple couldn't imagine living anywhere else.Lou added: \"I can't believe we actually lived in such a busy, fast-paced place because I don't know that I would be happy there now.\"But do they miss anything at all about London?Adam, who used to cycle to and from work regardless of the time of day, something that isn't always possible in Wales, said: \"You get a bit more headspace if you're on your bike rather than being jammed in the Tube with someone's armpit in your face.\"More top stories",

    "body": "15 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterAFP via Getty ImagesEMI Records was one of the major players of the music industryWarning: this article contains offensive and derogatory languageJeffrey Epstein considered investing in music company EMI after his associate David Stern appeared to suggest it potentially offered access to women, recently released emails suggest.Epstein replied that he was interested, adding: \"Do we need help - mandelson? [sic]\"Stern and Lord Mandelson did not reply to requests for comment.Many of his emails to Epstein flagged potential deals, and in February 2010 he forwarded a short news article about the financial woes of EMI at the time. EMI is a now-defunct conglomerate that included EMI Records, formerly one of the major players of the music industry. It was acquired by Universal Music in 2012.\"Troubled industry but related to P,\" Stern wrote to Epstein.\"P\", which Epstein apparently used to refer to women, is believed to be an abbreviation of the word \"pussy\", another term Epstein often used.For birthdays and New Year greetings, Stern wished Epstein \"lots of P\", according to the recently released files. He once offered to get Epstein fashion show tickets \"to review Chinese P\". He would send Epstein a \"P factor\" for the places he visited, giving the Spanish island Ibiza 9/10, and Sarah Ferguson's 50th birthday party 0.2/10.The emails have been newly released by the US Department of JusticeAt the time Epstein had considered asking Stern for his help in an EMI investment, Lord Mandelson was First Secretary of State and Business Secretary in the UK government.Stern said it was \"too early to get Mandelson involved before i know more\".Epstein appears to have emailed Lord Mandelson a few days later, saying: \"please email me bens contact info.. or havehim cal me re emi. [sic]\"In reply, Lord Mandelson appears to say: \"Gave to [redacted]. Email is [redacted]. Talk re EMI ??\".It's not clear exactly who \"ben\" is.Epstein sent another reply to Stern, suggesting that if the deal went ahead, he would put US businessman and former Sony Music company CEO Tommy Mottola in charge of it.He wrote, \"my friend is tommy mottola former head of sony I'd like him to be brought in to fix it\".Mottola did not reply to a request for comment. US Department of JusticeAn image from the Epstein files showing David Stern at the opening of a new office for his company Asia Gateway in Beijing in 2011Epstein's proposed deal did not go ahead – and EMI's main lender Citigroup ended up taking control of the company.However later on, in 2011, Epstein's circle were still discussing a bid for EMI.Kevin Law, a businessmen in the US state of Connecticut who was often in touch with Epstein, apparently wrote: \"Tell your buddy Andrew from the UK if he's interested in EMI as we discussed I can put him in the syndicate w KKR.\" It is not clear if Epstein's \"buddy\" referred to here is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.PA MediaDavid Stern sits to the left of the Queen at a Pitch@Palace event at St James's Palace in London, in November 2016Law has said he \"never bid on EMI with any group nor did I ever do a business deal with Epstein,\" and said he did not know the former prince.The giant private equity firm KKR declined to comment. At the time KKR had a controlling stake in a rival record company, BMG.Stern was apparently still keen on acquiring a record company in 2011. He wrote: \"EMI may now come up for sale. Could actually be of interest to Chinese if structured properly. Also, most certainly great asset to have for P!\"However Epstein did not buy it then either.In November 2011, Citigroup split EMI into two parts and, the following year, sold it to Universal and a consortium involving Sony and record executive David Geffen.The DOJ files show other discussions between Epstein and associates about buying model agencies and fashion-related businesses, which also did not go ahead.French prosecutors have previously suspected that Epstein used his contact in the fashion industry, Jean-Luc Brunel, to house and transport young girls.More on this story",

    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge51 minutes agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a key-note speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Centre months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the west, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the United States had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation, and his, had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules, a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the United States to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the Imperial Citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the Barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity… And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at Davos last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" that young Pakistani student admitted all those years ago. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"\"Don't you find it interesting,\" he asked, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a WhatsApp group that included Vice President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were \"insulting and frankly appalling\"We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the United States from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the United States will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have, ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention, to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength: a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's Prime Minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu\".Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Colombia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the United States, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial Shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing president Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them: the US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the Doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"In the Guatemala coup, in 1954, that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini.\"The coup on Chile in 1971 [against the left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende] wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup.\"During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the United States would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary General of Nato Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president had receivedBut Trump's approach to towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden also believed the European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act: in response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around two per cent of GDP to five per cent, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos he said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Chanel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I too make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, AI.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder: democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena; they are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the country strikes a trade deal with China. \"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" Trump said on Truth Social. It is unclear what deal Trump is referring to in his social media post. Last week, Canada's Prime Minister Carney announced a \"strategic partnership\" with China, and agreed to reduce tariffs. At the time, Trump called the move \"a good thing\". But tensions between the US and Canada have grown in recent days, after Carney said in a speech in Davos that the US-led world order had been ruptured.Carney also urged other \"middle powers\" to band together in the face of economic coercion by \"greater powers\", though he did not mention Trump by name.Trump responded to the remarks in his own speech the next day, saying: \"Canada lives because of the United States.\"The US president also withdrew an invitation for Canada to join his new Board of Peace.On Saturday, Trump said in his social media post that if Carney \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken\". The BBC has contacted the White House and Carney's office for comment.Canada's US trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement: \"There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China.\"\"What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues.\"LeBlanc said the government was focused on building a stronger Canadian economy and strengthening trade partnerships \"throughout the world\".Canada has been seeking to diversify trade away from the US, its largest trade partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs.Under the agreement reached between Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, China will lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will  tax Chinese EVs at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%.The deal was seen as a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat tariffs, and could see more Chinese investments in Canada.Carney said the progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesThe new body will buy technology such as facial recognition on behalf of all police forcesA new national police force is being created to take over counter-terror, fraud, and criminal gang investigations.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the new National Police Service (NPS), described as a \"British FBI\", would deploy \"world class talent and state of the art technology to track down and catch dangerous criminals\".It will bring the work of existing agencies such as the National Crime Agency and regional organised crime units under the same organisation, buying new technology such as facial recognition on behalf of all forces.Mahmood said policing was stuck \"in a different century\" and the new body will form part of a series of police reforms she will unveil on Monday.The NPS will cover England and Wales but be able to operate in the wider UK, setting standards and training. It will be led by a national police commissioner who will become the most senior police chief in the country.The Home Office said local police officers have been \"burdened\" with tackling major crimes without adequate training, leaving them unable to address everyday offences like shoplifting and anti-social behaviour.In the past week, the home secretary has announced a number of sweeping changes to policing, having described the current structures as \"irrational\".Counter terror policing, led by the Metropolitan Police, the National Air Service run by West Yorkshire Police, and National Roads Policing will also all be brought under the new organisation. Intelligence and resources will be shared across different forces in stages to ensure the public receive the same level of security \"no matter where they live\", the Home Office said in a statement.While the government claims facial recognition has led to a rapid reduction in crime - reportedly leading to 1,700 arrests in the past two years - campaigners have raised concerns over issues with bias and privacy.The Home Office says it will also look to hire new talent outside of the force for leadership roles. Labour wants to shake up the police - but will that solve 'everyday crime epidemic'?Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency, backed the new national force and said \"the overall policing system is out of date. Crime has changed, technology has changed, and how we respond needs to change\".He added: \"These are threats that affect us all locally, but need a national and international response.\"Mahmood has previously said the current policing structure is \"irrational\", announcing on Thursday that she intends to drastically cut police forces down from 43 to make way for 12 \"mega\" forces.And on Friday, the government announced details of a licence scheme for police officers, and increased powers for ministers to intervene where police and fire chiefs are deemed to be failing.The plans have drawn mixed reaction from senior figures in policing, with the Police Federation warning that \"fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities\".The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) also warned that the creation of regional forces would be expensive, time-consuming and risks separating police forces from their communities.In November, ministers announced plans to scrap police and crime commissioners in 2028 to save at least £100m and help fund neighbourhood policing.",

    "body": "A new NHS database of genes linked to cancer could enable patients and their families in England to find out whether they are at risk of developing the disease.People will be able to have their genetic information compared to the world-first register of 120 genes known to increase the likelihood of getting cancer, NHS England has said.Those identified as having an inherited risk will be offered routine check-ups and screening for certain cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. Patients could also be tested to see whether they would respond better to particular treatments, allowing for personalised care.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the \"life-changing and life-saving\" tool would fast-track screening and allow more cancers to be caught sooner.Tens of thousands of cancer patients and those with a family history of the disease already undergo genetic testing on the NHS every year. Those known to have a higher risk profile will be added to the new register.They will be given tailored information about what they can do to lower their chance of developing cancer or detect it early.The NHS said it was building the register as part of a 10-year plan to improve prevention and treatment of cancer. NHS England's national cancer director told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was \"the first time any health care system has brought together all the information about all the genetic risk into a single place.\"Prof Peter Johnson said it pulled together the tests patients were already offered to check their cancer susceptibility into a single register, \"so that we can contact people to offer them screening and in some cases preventative treatment\".This will allow practitioners to \"keep tabs on people\" and offer them new tests and treatments as they are rolled out, he added, while stressing it would be \"incredibly confidential and secure\".Johnson said that while it could be \"very daunting\" for people to find out their cancer risk, it meant the disease could be picked up as early as possible.The NHS National Inherited Cancer Predisposition Register follows a similar database for Lynch syndrome which saw more than 12,000 people offered routine preventative screening after they were identified as being at higher risk, according to the NHS.Charlie Grinstead, a 32-year-old diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2020, said his Lynch syndrome diagnosis gave him access to immunotherapy after unsuccessful chemotherapy - and proved to be the \"the key to my recovery\".Streeting said: \"One in every two people will get cancer in their lifetime but that does not mean the chances are random - many people face a higher risk through the genes they inherit.\"And while we cannot do anything about inherited genes, we can do something about what we do with that information.\"He said the \"world-leading genetic register\" would allow personalised and preventative care to be provided sooner.\"This register won't just supercharge innovation - it will be life changing and life-saving, allowing the NHS to develop individual care, fast-track screening and tailored information to enable more cancers to be caught earlier.\"Claire Rowney, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said the move would \"transform the lives of women who are at increased risk of breast cancer due to their family history or genetics\".She said it had to be accessible to all clinicians and designed to ensure those with an increased risk profile received \"joined-up care\".",

Alex Honnold, who scaled El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park without a rope in 2017, said on Saturday: \"Sadly it's raining in Taipei right now so I don't get to go climbing.\" The skyscraper in Taiwan's capital measures 508m (1,667ft) and is made of steel, glass and concrete. It contains eight sections, each with a slight overhang designed to resemble joints on a bamboo stick.Netflix - which will stream the event - says there will be a delay on the live feed should the worst happen.\"It's obviously a conversation that everybody has,\" Netflix executive Jeff Gaspin told Variety magazine. \"We'll cut away. We have a 10-second delay. Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen.\"The climb is now due to take place on Sunday.  Announcing the delay, Netflix said: \"Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding.\"Taipei 101 has been conquered before. In 2004, France's Alain Robert, who called himself Spiderman, climbed it in four hours using a safety belt and rope.Netflix said there will be three stages to Honnold's rope-free climb. First, there is an initital 113m section of sloping steel and glass followed by the eight \"bamboo\" boxes before reaching the final stage which includes scaling the spire at the very top of the tower. Getty ImagesTaipei 101's surfaces were deemed too wet for a climb on Saturday Honnold, 40, who is married with two children, said it was \"a lifelong dream\" to scale a skyscraper.His historic 2017 ascent of El Capitan without a rope was documented in the film Free Solo, which won an Academy Award.An enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915m), El Capitan is a major landmark in Yosemite and entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world.More from the BBC",

Megan was warned by doctors that stress can increase the risk of stroke, which prompted her to take up baking.\"I started making little boxes [of food] for people, which went crazy, started making a little bit more, and it hasn't stopped,\" she said.While being unable to work, she came up with the idea as a way to potentially support her family if she cannot return to her job.Since then, hundreds of people have visited the shed. Megan said she was working round the clock to bake and had been surprised by the support.BBC/Jim ScottMegan Jackson has been supported by husband Liam with the project She said the venture was a needed distraction after suffering poor mental health following her diagnosis in March, last year.As well as severe headaches, medics noticed one pupil was larger than the other, prompting a brain scan which revealed a 5mm-wide aneurysm.It poses a risk of rupturing and she has been told that, because of its size, it is too risky to operate.Megan said she and her husband Liam had cried when she got the diagnosis and her first thought had been who would look after her toddler \"if I die\". She manages the condition through baking and daily prescription medications, but is often left with confusion and fatigue.Baking brings her \"total peace\" and she said she spent time in the kitchen \"cracking on\". \"It just feels I haven't got the worry of the stress of the aneurysm. I totally shut off and my mind is focused,\" she added. ",

    "body": "6 hours agoKate WhannelPA MediaAndy Burnham has announced that he is seeking permission to stand in the upcoming Gorton and Denton parliamentary by-election.If he won and became an MP, Burnham could mount a leadership challenge against Sir Keir Starmer but the BBC has been told that allies of the prime minister may try and block him from standing in the constituency. Burnham is currently mayor of Greater Manchester and in a statement insisted that he wants to back the Labour government \"not undermine it\", adding that the decision had been \"difficult\".The seat in Greater Manchester is vacant after Andrew Gwynne stood down on Friday as an MP on health grounds.As a directly-elected mayor, Burnham has to get approval from Labour's ruling national executive committee before he can enter the race to be the party's candidate. That decision is expected on Sunday.Several Labour MPs have reacted angrily to the suggestion that Burnham could be blocked from standing in the by-election.Burnham had until Saturday afternoon to submit his application and on the dot of the 5pm deadline, he shared his letter to the NEC on social media, ending days of speculation over what he was planning. In his letter, Burnham said there was a \"direct threat to everything Greater Manchester has always been about from a brand of politics which seeks to pit people against each other\".\"I see this by-election as the frontline of that fight for the Manchester Way and I feel I owe it to a city which has given me so much to lead it from the front, despite the risks involved.\"He said he had left Westminster nearly a decade ago because he believed \"it wasn't working for people in our part of the world\" and that as mayor he had \"tried to pioneer a different way of doing things\".However, he added that he believed Manchester \"won't be able to be everything it should be without similar changes at a national level.\"This is why I feel the need to go back.\"There has been speculation that the prime minister could face a leadership challenge, after the May elections, which will see votes take place in the Welsh Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and in some local councils in England.Burnham has been touted as a possible leadership contender but can only mount a challenge if he is an MP in the Commons.In his letter to the NEC, Burnham insisted he would be in Parliament \"to support the work of the government, not undermine it\".\"I have passed this assurance on to the prime minister.\"Some senior Labour figures in the party have said they believe Burnham should be allowed to enter the contest. London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan said: \"If Andy Burnham wants to be a member of Parliament, Andy Burnham should be allowed to be a member of Parliament\".Indicating her support for Burnham, deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell said the by-election would be \"difficult\" and that she wanted \"to make sure we are putting the best team out on the pitch week after week\".\"I don't want to see [Erling] Haaland on the bench\" in a reference to the Manchester City football player. She also said Labour members should \"get behind Keir Starmer\" adding that she did not want to see the by-election develop into \"in-fighting and talking about ourselves\".Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Burnham would be \"a massive asset\" in Parliament and that he hoped Gorton and Denton party members would have \"the option\" of selecting him as a candidate.Burnham's fate now lies in the hands of the officers on the NEC which include Starmer and Powell alongside Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, party chair Ellie Reeves and trade union representatives.A decision to turn down his application risks infuriating those MPs in Parliament who support the Greater Manchester mayor.Blackpool South MP Chris Webb said blocking Burnham would have \"serious lasting consequences\" adding: \"When you're 2-0 down at half time, you bring on the super sub to help the team win.\"East Hull MP Karl Turner said it would \"cause the most raving row\".If he were to be selected and won the Gorton and Denton seat, Burnham would have to resign as Greater Manchester mayor, triggering a new election for that role.Several Labour sources have said the NEC could block Burnham's application on the grounds that a mayoral election would be expensive for the party. It would also be costly for the taxpayer with the last mayoral election costing around £4.7m. The area of Gorton and Denton has traditionally voted Labour and the party won the seat in 2024 with a majority of 13,000.However, since then the party's popularity has declined and Labour could face challenges from Reform UK and the Green Party who came second and third at the general election.Shortly after, Burnham made his intentions clear, Reform's Lee Anderson posted a picture of himself campaigning in Gorton and Denton with the message \"bring it on\".",

From a poker faces to genuine shock, Rachel's game face was on par to get her through some serious heat amongst fellow competitors. \"When it comes to a game... the competitive side comes out,\" she told BBC News NI. Faith in humanityRachel managed to deceive and conquer throughout the game with her right-hand man, fellow traitor and fellow winner Stephen, who was someone she trusted from the start. \"From the minute he dropped his hood… I thought aw he's lovely, really nice person. I felt relaxed,\" said Rachel. The element of the finale that struck the audience was more than likely the cliff-hanger of whether either traitor would betray each other to take home the £97,750 prize, or would they split it?But both stayed true to each other and restored our faith in humanity - by one promise, to never write each others names on the black slate at the round table.\"As we made our promise, I just fell in love with him in the castle. We have a really nice friendship.\"PA MediaRachel and Stephen were crowned the winners, splitting £95,750, after 12 episodes of treachery and deceptionWhy does she think she won?Apparently, it's playing the game Mafia, where a group of people are split into two groups, with one group being killers that can kill during a so-called 'night-phase' and the other group can debate and vote to eliminate a player during 'day-phase'.\"I played Mafia growing up... I played that for 15 years. I became very good at any game where I had to play a straight face.\" 'Lying is tiring'PA MediaRachel grew close bonds with some of the players, forming a particular friendship with Amanda, who was a faithfulRachel's fate was sealed in a small chest, after the round table had voted for her and James in a tie that led to sudden death, Rachel had one chance to stay in the game. By what some would say was luck, Rachel found herself in the final, to the dismay of anyone backing the faithfuls. \"I'm alright with that. I've 47 grand. I think I can take that one on the chin... I'll be alright.\"But Rachel said she did notice watching back that the lying was taking its toll. \"I can see watching the episodes… the bags under my eyes getting a little heavier.\"Rachel said she had to push the energy to stay in the game but finding the energy was \"exhausting\" as a traitor. \"You're lying to people you like…staying up late in the turret... we had less sleep than anyone else.\"Homecoming for the Newry traitor? Friends and family of Rachel watched the Traitors finale at the Canal Court in NewryRachel's family watched the Traitors finale biting their nails. She watched the video of her family's reaction: \"I cried my eyes out, it's lovely to have a lot of support.\"The filming of the season happened months ago but the secret had to be kept until the final moment of the show. \"They kept saying... just tell me tonight (before the finale). My brother... he had to go for a walk every round table and kept asking me what happened and I said 'but I can't tell you'.\"None of the cast knew the ending. None of my family knew the ending.\"Rachel woke up after the finale feeling like the weight of all those lies had been lifted. \"A sense of relief, it's been so many secrets. Forget the lies, it's the secrets, holding on to that... I feel lighter, I feel I've no secrets. No more lies!\"She laughed about how she'll have to be a hypocrite now:\"I've to go home now and tell my children by the way its not nice to lie.\"What will Rachel do with the money? When the last players got a chance to take down their cloaks, daggers and suspicions they had the opportunity to ask each other what they wanted to do if they won. For Rachel, it was all for her family and her mother in particular, who suffers from Parkinson's Disease and also dementia. \"I rang my mummy this morning… I can't wait to come home and give her a big hug and say what will we do? Anything you want lets go do it.. so yeah as long as I get to spoil my family that's all I care about.\"She (Rachel's mum) didn't get all the twists and the turns but she's enjoyed watching it. She's very proud.\"Rachel will spend the money on her family but before all that she said there's one thing she needs to do first. \"Sleep. I'm gonna put my feet up and relax… January has been crazy… I just want to get home. In February we can think about what we want to do with the money.\"",

    "body": "Pentagon to offer 'more limited' support to US allies in defence strategy shift17 hours agoClaire KeenanReutersHomeland security is the top priority in the Pentagon's new National Defense StrategyThe US will offer \"more limited\" support to allies, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy.In a significant shift to its security priorities, the US Department of Defense now considers security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere - not China - as its primary concern.Previous versions of the strategy -  published every four years - named the threat posed by China as the top defence priority. Relations with China will now be approached through \"strength, not confrontation\", the report says.The defence strategy reinforces recent calls from President Donald Trump, including for greater \"burden-sharing\" from allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea.The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described \"revisionist powers\", such as China and Russia, as the \"central challenge\" to US security.The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been \"content\" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards \"isolationism\".\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says.Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\". Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".Late last year, the US announced a vast arms sale to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.The strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds. In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, carried out strikes against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to acquire Greenland. The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon \"will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland\".The document says the Trump administration's approach will be \"fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations\". It adds: \"Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism.\"At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had \"never gotten anything\" from Nato and \"we've never asked for anything\".He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming \"the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato\".Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is \"not coming back\" and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. \"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting. That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\". ",

    "body": "11 hours agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringUkraine is now living through its most difficult winter in recent memory. With January temperatures plummeting below -15C, Russia has been attacking energy infrastructure, leaving about a million Ukrainians without heating.The capital, Kyiv, is the main target of such attacks. Following the latest Russian bombardment overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. \"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. \"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither? And of course missiles and drones come on top of all that.\" She says she has to go to bed wearing a hat and several layers of clothing.What is making things much worse for Ukraine and easier for Russia is the widespread prevalence of apartment blocks that rely on communal central heating - where water is heated up elsewhere and then pumped into their radiators.Heating plants in Ukraine are huge and many thousands of people are affected when they are targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services. It said it could not share the exact number for security reasons.In Zaporizhzhia, a frontline city home to 750,000 people, almost three-quarters of residents rely on central heating, according to Maksym Rohalsky, the head of the local association of apartment block dwellers.Before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022, about 11 million households in Ukraine relied on central heating, compared to seven million autonomously heated households, Ukrainian energy expert Yuriy Korolchuk said. Cities across the Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, were the focus of huge construction programmes launched in the 1950s to mass produce cheap housing.The landscapes of cities in the former USSR are dominated by ubiquitous nine-storey residential buildings made from pre-fabricated concrete panels, known as \"panelki\", or smaller five-storey blocks of flats known as \"khrushchevki\", after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who oversaw their construction in the 1950s and 1960s.Heating to such houses is supplied by large plants known as TETs - an acronym that stands for \"heat and electricity centrals\" in Ukrainian as they generate electricity as well as heat.Detached houses occupied by a single family, known as \"private houses\" in Ukraine, are normally found in rural areas and are rare in cities.\"Ukraine inherited the Soviet heating system and it hasn't changed anything, it stays predominantly centralised,\" Korolchuk told the BBC. \"These heating plants were not designed to be attacked with missiles or drones, that's why these vulnerabilities came to the fore during the war.\"According to him, this is a new tactic used by Russia.\"During the previous winters, there were no such strikes against the heating system. They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.",

    "body": "1 day agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseCanada's Arctic is a massive, treacherous, and largely inhospitable place, stretched out over nearly 4 million square kilometres of territory - but with a small population roughly equal to Blackburn in England or Syracuse, New York.\"You can take a map of continental Europe, put it on the Canadian Arctic, and there's room to spare,\" Pierre Leblanc, the former commander of the Canadian Forces Northern Area told the BBC. \"And that environment is extremely dangerous.\"Standing at the defence of that massive landmass is an aging string of early warning radars, eight staffed military bases and about 100 full-time Coast Guard personnel covering 162,000km of coast, about 60% of Canada's total oceanfront.The Arctic region is the scene of intense geopolitical competition, bordered by Russia and the US on either side of the North Pole - and increasingly attractive to China, which has declared itself a \"near Arctic state\" and vastly expanded its fleet of naval vessels and icebreakers. Standing in the middle is Canada, whose population is a small fraction of the larger Arctic players. Nearly four years after Arctic security was thrust into the headlines following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the defence of Canada's far north has again been brought to the forefront of public consciousness by Donald Trump's designs on Greenland, a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark that the White House says is vital to safeguarding the US from would-be enemies abroad.Canada's Arctic has not gone unnoticed by the Trump administration, which has reportedly become increasingly concerned by perceived vulnerabilities to US adversaries, and in April signed an executive order underscoring American \"commitment to ensuring both freedom of navigation and American domination in the Arctic waterways.\"The Canadian government, for its part, has sought to reassure the US and Nato allies that it is doing its part to protect the region.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada is working to secure \"our shared objectives of security and prosperity in the Arctic\" through \"unprecedented\" investments in radar systems, submarines, aircraft and \"boots on the ground\" in the region.Col Leblanc, who spent a total of nine years in the Canadian Arctic, said those investments have marked a \"major shift\" in Arctic security, noting that increases in Canadian defence expenditure  - from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035 - have meant \"real action\" in terms of additional over-the-horizon radar and aircraft dedicated to the Arctic.Much of this focus, he added, has been prompted by the Trump administration's renewed focus on the Arctic and Greenland.\"[That] certainly helps the Canadian government move in the right direction,\" Leblanc added. Still, challenges persist, including limited port facilities and difficulties resupplying far-flung bases that are sometimes thousands of cold, empty miles apart.While Canada and other US Nato allies have opposed the Trump's administration bid to \"take over\" Greenland to protect the Arctic, several experts who spoke to the BBC agreed with the administration's broad assessment that additional defences in the region are urgently needed.Troy Bouffard, the director of the Fairbanks, Alaska-based Center for Arctic Security and Resilience, said that while on-the-ground cooperation between the US and Canada in the Arctic \"remains the envy of the world\", much of the existing defence infrastructure was designed to combat Cold War-era threats, rather than existing ones.In particular, he warned of the prospect of hypersonic missiles that travel at least five times the speed of sound, making them much harder to detect and intercept than traditional ballistic missiles, which would follow predictable arcs over the North Pole.Such a threat is no longer theoretical. Russia has used hypersonic missiles in combat in Ukraine, including a January strike that saw the first operational use of the nuclear-capable \"Oreshnik\" missile that carries multiple warheads at approximately 10 times the speed of sound.\"That technology has changed everything for us. We have to relook at the entire North American defence system and re-do it,\" he said. \"What exists right now cannot defend against hypersonic cruise missiles, at all. Like 0%.\"Traditional ground-based radar systems, he added, \"are not going to work\" against these emerging technologies. Space-based satellites must also contend with coverage gaps in high latitudes, prompting a renewed focus and investments in over-the-horizon radar.Notably, over-the-horizon technology - along with space-based sensors - form a key part of the Trump administration's planned Golden Dome missile defence system for North America.For now, it is unclear what role Canada will play in the Golden Dome, a project Trump said at Davos Canada should \"be thankful for\".On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Canada was opposed to having the Golden Dome over Greenland \"even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada. Instead, they voted in favor of doing business with China, who will 'eat them up' within the first year!\". The BBC has contacted Carney's office for comment.Those negotiations have been strained by the often antagonistic relationship between the US and Canada, with Trump in May posting that Canada could pay $61bn to join the programme or become the 51st US state and join for free.Trump's remarks prompted Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, to compare it to a \"protection racket\". Despite tensions, Michael Byers, an expert in Arctic security at the University of British Columbia, said that American concerns over Arctic security, and their threats of tariffs, have helped prompt Canada's government to re-focus on the Arctic.\"Whether or not American concerns are justified, there is a feeling in Ottawa that we have to satisfy [them],\" he said. \"No one takes the 51st state issue seriously, but what we do take seriously are the economic pressures that the US is able to impose.\"\"The Canadian government is very aware of that possibility,\" he added.High level tensions between Ottawa and Washington, however, have yet to turn into tensions on-the-ground in the Arctic - with those there expressing confidence that the US and Canada are cooperating for the time being.\"That's the business of politicians,\" Bouffard said. \"It has complicated things, but the practitioners are still going to work together until they're not allowed to. Everyone's going to have to rise above the rhetoric.\"",

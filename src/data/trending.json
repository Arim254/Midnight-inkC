    "body": "When Aston Martin's new Formula 1 car first appeared in testing at the end of January, it drew admiring glances up and down the pit lane.In its all-black temporary colour, the car not only looked menacing, but also noticeably different from all its rivals. It included the sort of innovations that have become famous from design legend Adrian Newey, installed as managing technical partner at Aston Martin since March last year.But reality bit hard as soon as the car started to run. It was already late, and it managed just four laps on its first day in Barcelona before conking out at the entrance to the pit lane.Aston Martin's fortunes have barely improved since.The car was the slowest in the field by the end of pre-season testing last week, and had done the fewest miles.Team owner Lawrence Stroll looked like the bottom had fallen out of his world as he stalked the paddock in Bahrain, his face betraying a combination of anger and despair.The few times the car was out on track amid myriad reliability problems, it looked a handful for the drivers. Publicly, Aston Martin and Honda were saying little. Privately, no-one was trying to hide the reality. They were in trouble, they knew it, and whatever was wrong - and it was a lot - would take time to fix.It all looked so promisingNo Formula 1 team looked towards the 2026 season with greater expectations than Aston Martin.On paper, Stroll had put together a dream combination, one that seemed guaranteed to produce success.The signing of Newey in September 2024 seemed to be the final piece of the jigsaw the Canadian billionaire was creating to turn his team into championship contenders.In the previous years, Stroll had already inked a deal to become the factory engine partner of Honda, who won four consecutive drivers' titles with Red Bull and Max Verstappen from 2021-24, and two constructors' championships.He had funded a sparkling new factory, including a state-of-the-art wind tunnel and driver-in-the-loop simulator.He had put together an enviable sponsorship portfolio of boundless resources, including the full financial might of the state of Saudi Arabia, through its national oil company.And in the cockpit was another legend, Fernando Alonso. Ageing, certainly, now he is in his mid-40s, but still without question a major force behind the wheel.The past few years have not been easy for Aston Martin. A major step forward at the start of 2023, when Alonso first joined the team, led to six podiums in the first eight races and what could have been a win in Monaco, lost only to a wrong tyre choice during a late shower of rain.But in the second half of that season the team slipped back, as they failed to keep up with the development rate of their rivals. The same happened in 2024, from a lower starting point, and in 2025 they were simply uncompetitive, slipping to seventh in the championship from fifth the previous two years.Newey's arrival was supposed to herald the start of the turnaround, especially as historically he has aced regulation changes, producing design philosophies that were followed by rivals - in 1998 with McLaren, and again in 2009 and 2022 with Red Bull.The biggest rule change in F1 history for 2026 gave him the chance to do it again, this time for Aston Martin.But the first car produced under his leadership has fallen far short of expectations, and a glance at the context makes this less of a surprise than it appears on the surface.In F1, success comes from stability, and that is the last thing Aston Martin have had in the past few years. There has been major leadership churn, and right at the top, too.This has included new recruits, such as chief technical officer Enrico Cardile, who finally arrived in July after a year on gardening leave from Ferrari.But also casualties. The most recent was Andy Cowell, the architect of the success of the Mercedes engine in the hybrid era. He was installed as chief executive officer only in October 2024, but just over a year later, after a clash with Newey, was demoted to a different role.Cowell is now spending much of his time in Japan, trying to help Honda sort itself out.Aston Martin were already playing down expectations when they had their official team launch in early February, emphasising the project would need time to become successful.Newey has explained that his starting in March left them some months behind other teams in terms of development.The new 2026 aerodynamic regulations were finally officially published on 2 January 2025, two months before Newey officially started work at Aston Martin.In reality, teams have been working on their 2026 cars for much longer than that. The basics of the cars' layouts in the rules had been known for some time, and the teams had all been in working groups refining the detail with governing body the FIA, so knew where they were going.The word is that when Newey arrived in March 2025, he effectively ordered a redesign of the car on the basis of his ideas. So the current car is several months, at least, behind all its rivals in terms of development. With that sort of deficit, even he cannot work miracles.Newey has described the Aston Martin as \"one of the more extreme interpretations\" of this year's new rules.Right now, in its under-developed form, there is no question it is uncompetitive - slow and unpredictable. It may yet turn out that it can be developed into a good car, but until Honda sorts itself out, it will be hard to tell.Honda's plight has brought back painful memories of a decade ago. When it returned to F1 in 2015 with McLaren, it was underprepared, and spent three difficult seasons with engines that were underpowered and unreliable. The similarities with now are unmistakable.Why it is so unprepared this time is less understandable.Honda officially pulled out of F1 at the end of 2021, when Max Verstappen took a Red Bull powered by their engine to his first world title.It announced its return to F1 with Aston Martin in May 2023.The argument given to explain now being so far behind is that Honda's F1 engine project was essentially disbanded and the engineers involved reallocated to other areas of the company in the 15 months between the two dates.However, it's not like Honda went away. Both Red Bull teams continued to use its engines until the end of last year.Although there was a development freeze, the engine was still being upgraded each year because F1's regulations allowed modifications for reliability reasons. Every manufacturer in F1 uses this loophole to produce performance upgrades in the name of improved reliability.If Honda had not been doing this, it would have fallen behind progressively from 2022 to 2025, which it did not.On top of that, Honda representatives were involved in meetings about the new engine rules all the way through - hence their U-turn on involvement in early 2023.Still, the argument is that without a fully dedicated F1 engine department, Honda lacked a team designing and building a new engine to the revised rules for this year, and had to build one up again more or less from scratch.But so did Red Bull. In 2020, when they announced their decision to build their own engine factory, they had nothing. The original plan was to go into partnership with Porsche, but that deal foundered by late summer 2022.Considering Red Bull had to build a powertrains factory from literally nothing in this period, and recruit an entirely new staff, their timeline is not that dissimilar from Honda's.So why is Honda so far away from where it wants to be? No answer to that has been provided.A new car and engine partnership with Honda that struggles for reliability and performance and has Alonso as one of the drivers. If that sounds familiar, it's because it is.In 2015, Alonso joined McLaren from Ferrari wooed by the promise of Honda's potential. That potential was eventually realised - but not until 2020-21, by which time Honda and McLaren had long since split and Honda had joined forces with Red Bull.Alonso's career, meanwhile, became a kind of living purgatory. One of the greatest drivers the sport has ever known reduced to fighting for scraps, making up his own targets for motivation, rather than what he should have been gunning for - wins and titles in F1.He last won a race in May 2013, and he is now 44. But his performances have continued on a high level, and the respect he has from his peers on the grid is higher than ever. For his talent, and his ability to keep up his motivation in the face of everything.The Newey-Honda-Aston Martin combination on paper promised Alonso something positive, a last hope of a return to success with which to bring his storied career to a close. Either this year, when his current contract runs out, or perhaps after one more, if glory seemed tangible.Instead, he has found himself transported back in time 10 years.Alonso has waited an entire career to work with Newey, the excellence of whose cars - and some terrible luck - have denied the Spaniard at least two further world titles that he should have won.Alonso won't doubt Newey can sort this out. Who would? But after his experiences with Honda last time, can he really convince himself it can turn this around in the limited time he surely still has available?In public, Alonso is staying hopeful, just as he did with McLaren and Honda, bar one or two public slips when it all got too much.\"Everything can be fixed, for sure,\" he says. \"Short and medium term. I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\"We will try to fix everything we can before Australia and after that we try to fix as many things as possible in the first couple of races. Because [otherwise] it's too late in the championship. But no, I'm optimistic. I think there is a solution in place.\"Alonso's partner Melissa Jimenez is expecting their first child in late March.The emergence of the unfolding catastrophe that is Aston Martin-Honda is so recent he has not yet been asked about his thoughts on his future. But he will already be considering what to do.Does he roll the dice one last time, try to summon the energy and commitment to go again after what will doubtless be a very trying year? Or call it quits?",

    "body": "Lord Mandelson released on bail after arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office3 hours agoOlivia IrelandWatch: Peter Mandelson arriving at home after being released on bailLord Mandelson has been released on bail, the Metropolitan Police says, hours after his arrest on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in public office.The force said a 72-year-old-man was released pending further investigation. The BBC saw Lord Mandelson returning to his London home at 02:00 GMT. Lord Mandelson was arrested at an address in Camden, north London, on Monday and taken to Wandsworth police station for interview. The force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a government minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.The arrest on Monday followed search warrants at two addresses in Wiltshire and Camden, the police statement added.Lord Mandelson has not publicly commented in recent weeks on the Epstein files, but the BBC understands his position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The government has said it expects to release the first documents relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment in \"early March\".Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Breakfast that the government's \"intention is to disclose documents but we have to tread with some care in making sure that any documents we release don't jeopardise an ongoing police investigation\".\"There is a live investigation and when that happens it would be totally irresponsible to do anything that might put at risk their important work, but yes we are committed to transparency around all of this,\" she added.On Monday afternoon, Lord Mandelson was seen being led away from his London home by plain clothes officers who put him in the back of an unmarked car.The BBC understands his arrest was carried out by officers from the Met's central specialist crime division. Consultations between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service are ongoing.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.An email from 2009 appears to show that Lord Mandelson passed on an assessment by an adviser to the then prime minister Gordon Brown about policy measures, including an \"asset sales plan\". He also appeared to discuss a tax on bankers' bonuses and confirm an imminent bailout package for the Euro on the day before it was announced in 2010.Responding to Lord Mandelson's arrest, the family of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor of sexual abuse, said they \"commend the British authorities for taking meaningful action and treating the Epstein files with the urgency they demand\". Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein.In a statement, Sky and Amanda Roberts said: \"The contrast with the continued inaction in the United States is undeniable. Survivors deserve transparency, swift investigation, and real justice, no matter who is implicated.\"BBC News understands the government will continue talking to police about which documents can be released, after it was previously suggested an arrest could have implications for that process.The government still wants to be able to publish documents, which it hopes will back up Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's claim that Lord Mandelson had \"lied\" during his vetting process.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Lord Mandelson's arrest was \"the defining moment of Sir Keir's premiership\".Badenoch, who said the prime minister was \"weak\", added: \"Watching the man who he appointed to the highest position in our diplomatic service getting arrested by police is an image which I think is going to stay with us for many, many years to come.\"Pool/BBC NewsLord Peter Mandelson being escorted by a police officer outside his homeLord Mandelson has been urged by US politicians to answer questions as part of a Congress investigation into Epstein.He began working for Labour in the 1980s, playing a key role in the New Labour movement and Sir Tony Blair's landslide election victory in 1997.",

Police believe she was abducted.The FBI previously released doorbell camera footage showing a masked person carrying a backpack, who it said was investigators' prime suspect.The source told CBS that the same man was on her doorstep on another occasion. However, local police have not confirmed that the appearances were on different days. FBI via CBSImages appear to show a masked man without a backpack captured by Guthrie's doorbell cameraThe broadcaster carried images, credited to the FBI, that appear to show a masked man, this time without a backpack, which were captured by Guthrie's Nest doorbell camera sometime prior to the date of the suspected abduction.It is unclear when exactly the images were taken. The story was first reported by ABC News.Arizona's Pima County Sheriff's Department said in a statement on X: \"There is no date or timestamp associated with these images. Therefore any suggestion that the photographs were taken on different days is purely speculative.\"The investigation was ongoing and \"will be guided by verifiable evidence and established facts\", the sheriff's office added. Police have said they believe Guthrie was the victim of a targeted kidnapping. The Guthrie family has made several public pleas for her safe return, and asked for proof that she is alive. But so far, the disappearance remains a mystery. The footage released by the FBI on 10 February shows a masked and armed subject the night she disappeared.The suspect in the video - who the FBI said appears to be a male between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) - was thought to be wearing a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack and covers the camera with some plants.Detectives have appealed to the public for help and have received close to 40,000 tips from the public, police have said.

    "body": "28 minutes agoJamie WhiteheadBBC News ReutersHong Kong has formally complained to the government of Panama after it took control of two ports on the Panama Canal. It accused the Panamanian authorities of taking them over by force.The ports had been run by a Hong Kong-based company, CK Hutchison, for more than two decades.Last month, Panama's Supreme Court annulled the contracts which allowed the firm to operate the container ports, saying they were \"unconstitutional\".The ruling followed claims by US President Donald Trump that China was operating the canal. There is no public evidence to suggest this.Hong Kong's government said, in a statement, it was lodging a \"strong protest\" after Panama's \"blatant act\" undermined both the \"spirit of the contracts\" and  \"international trade rules\". Last year, the Hong Kong-based company agreed to sell most of its stake in the two ports to a group led by the US investment firm BlackRock. The move by the Panamanian government could disrupt the $22.8bn (£20.75bn) sale, according to the Reuters news agency.President Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Central American canal is under Chinese control.During his inauguration address last January, he said: \"China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back.\"The following month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also demanded that Panama make \"immediate changes\" to what he called the \"influence and control\" of China over the canal.There is no public evidence to suggest China exercises control over the canal, though Chinese companies have a significant presence there.Up to 14,000 ships use the 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal each year as a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific.The waterway, which handles about 5% of global maritime trade volume, is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government.From October 2023 to September 2024, China accounted for 21.4% of the cargo volume transiting the canal, making it the second-largest user after the US.",

    "body": "16 minutes agoJonathan GeddesBBC Glasgow and West reporterGetty ImagesControversial plans to build a £40m holiday park on the banks of Loch Lomond have been rejected by the Scottish government.The decision comes after years of often bitter debate between theme park operator  Flamingo Land and people living in the area who campaigned against the plan to build a waterpark, monorail, hotel and restaurants.The Scottish government said its decision was due to \"flood risk, woodland loss and wider policy conflicts\".Loch Lomond and the Trossachs Park Authority initially rejected the plan in September 2024, only for the Scottish government to overturn that decision after an appeal. However, it then recalled the plans due to the impact on the local area.The decision to reject the development goes against the recommendation of the government's own adviser, who said it should be approved.Lomond BanksThe Flamingo Land proposal dated back to 2018Ministers said that although they accepted his findings, they reached a different conclusion regarding the possible risks in the development, particularly regarding flooding and the loss of historic woodland in the area.The report says it was \"a finely balanced decision\" and that allowing the resort would bring economic benefits to the area.However, it says the \"significant concerns relating to flood risk and woodland loss are of such importance that, when taken together with the other development plan conflicts identified, the proposed development does not comply with the development plan overall\".The other conflicts raised in the report include ministers believing that the plan would clash with the \"ongoing aim of conserving and enhancing the natural and cultural heritage of the area\". Scottish Greens co-leader Ross Greer, a vocal opponent of the development,  called the decision \"a huge victory for the local community\".He added: \"This mega resort would have had a devastating impact on the iconic local environment, the community and the local economy. \"My message to Flamingo Land today is simple; walk away. This community and the people of Scotland have told you time and again that your destructive plans are not welcome.\"Flamingo Land first submitted plans to develop the site in 2018, but withdrew them the following year after a wave of negative reaction.It later submitted updated plans in 2020, insisting the proposal - titled Lomond Banks -would be a \"major step away\" from its other resorts, which include a popular theme park and zoo in Yorkshire.However, the Loch Lomond park authority board ruled that the updated scheme still conflicted with both regional and national environmental policies, and unanimously rejected back the plan.There was particular concern over the increased risk of flooding of the River Leven.Locals were also concerned about the impact on the area's natural beauty, with more than 174,000 people signing an online petition against the project.An appeal to the Scottish government's planning reporter - who handles most appeals on behalf of the Scottish government's planning and environmental division - was successful last year.But weeks later the Scottish government's Minister for Public Finance, Ivan McKee, decided to recall the plans because of the overall impact on Loch Lomond - meaning the final decision would be down to ministers.That decision prompted Jim Paterson, Lomond Banks' development director, to say opponents of the plan had run a campaign with \"baseless and offensive\" claims about the plan, claiming this was rooted in \"hysteria and mistruth\".",

It's really hard to face this reality about an old friend.\"Born on 24 March 1954, Carradine was the youngest son of John Carradine and a brother of actors David and Keith Carradine.Encouraged by his brother David, Robert Carradine auditioned for 1972's The Cowboys, a John Wayne film that became his first screen role. He went on to appear in and Martin Scorsese's 1973 film Mean Streets, Oscar-winning Coming Home (1978), alongside Jane Fonda, The Long Riders (1980), with Mark Hamill, The Big Red One (1980) and Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained in 2012.AlamyCarradine (second right) played Hilary Duff's father in the early-2000s Disney Channel series Lizzie McGuireBut he was best known for playing the head nerd, Lewis Skolnick, in Revenge of the Nerds - which became one of the most popular film franchises of the 1980s, and the father of Lizzie McGuire in the noughties Disney Channel series.Paying tribute, Lizzie McGuire star Duff said: \"There was so much warmth in the McGuire family and I always felt so cared for by my on-screen parents. \"I'll be forever grateful for that. I'm deeply sad to learn Bobby was suffering. My heart aches for him, his family, and everyone who loved him.\"In a statement, Carradine's family announced his death \"with profound sadness\", adding that the US actor was a \"beloved father, grandfather, uncle, and brother\".\"In a world that can feel so dark, Bobby was always a beacon on light to everyone around him,\" they said.\"We are bereft at the loss of this beautiful soul and want to acknowledge Bobby's valiant struggle against his nearly two-decade battle with bipolar disorder. \"We hope his journey can shine a light and encourage addressing the stigma that attaches to mental illness.\"The statement added: \"At this time we ask for the privacy to grieve this unfathomable loss. With gratitude for your understanding and compassion.\"In his own separate statement to Deadline, Carradine's brother Keith added: \"It is an illness that got the best of him, and I want to celebrate him for his struggle with it, and celebrate his beautiful soul. \"He was profoundly gifted, and we will miss him every day. We will take solace in how funny he could be, how wise and utterly accepting and tolerant he was. That's who my baby brother was.\"",

    "body": "Labour MP Dawn Butler asks BBC for explanation over racial slur during Baftas broadcast3 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterGetty ImagesLabour MP Dawn Butler has written to the BBC asking for an \"urgent explanation\" over the airing of a racist slur during the Bafta Film Awards on Sunday.John Davidson, a guest with Tourette syndrome who was the inspiration behind the film I Swear, shouted out when two black actors, Delroy Lindo and Michael B Jordan, were on stage.On Monday, a BBC spokesman said: \"We apologise that this was not edited out prior to broadcast and it will now be removed from the version on BBC iPlayer.\"But in a letter to the corporation, the MP for Brent Central said the BBC \"could have prevented\" the slur being broadcast \"given the programme was aired on a two-hour delay.\" Butler said the N-word \"should never have been aired\", describing its broadcast as \"painful and unforgivable\".The ceremony started at 17:00 GMT, two hours before the TV broadcast began.The shout was audible in the broadcast, although many viewers would have struggled to make out the word.The BBC has been asked for a response to Butler's letter. BBC News understands the producers overseeing the ceremony for the BBC were doing so from a TV truck and simply did not hear the slur.Several other incidents of inappropriate language were cut out, but that moment was said to have been missed.How the Bafta racial slur controversy unfoldedThe moment initially remained on BBC iPlayer before the ceremony was removed from the streaming service on Monday morning.Butler also questioned why the BBC removed a portion of Bafta winner Akinola Davies Jr's acceptance speech, which included the line \"Free Palestine\" and also referred to the importance of migrants' stories.The My Father's Shadow director made the remark as he ended his speech to accept the prize for best debut by a British writer, director or producer.Davies Jr and his brother Wale, the film's writer, spoke on stage for two-and-a-half minutes, but their speeches were edited to about one minute for broadcast, which the BBC said was due to time restrictions.Butler said: \"I understand that the BBC has since edited the iPlayer version to remove the racist slur, I would appreciate a written explanation as to why this was not addressed before the delayed broadcast, who was in the editing room, who made the overall decision and why Mr Davies Jr's remarks were deemed unsuitable while the racist slur was initially left in.\"A BBC spokesperson told Deadline on Monday: \"The same happened to other speeches made during the night and all edits were made to ensure the programme was delivered to time. All winners' speeches will be available to watch via Bafta's YouTube channel.\"Meanwhile Jonte Richardson, who was on the Bafta emerging talent judging panel, has said he is stepping down from that role \"after considerable soul-searching\".\"The organisation's handling of the unfortunate Tourette's N-Word incident last night at the awards was utterly unforgivable,\" he said.\"I cannot and will not contribute my time energy and expertise to an organisation that has repeatedly failed to safeguard the dignity of its black guests, members and the black creative community.\"In a statement on Monday, Bafta said it acknowledged the \"harm this has caused, address what happened and apologise to all\".\"Michael B Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage at the time, and we apologise unreservedly to them, and to all those impacted. We would like to thank Michael and Delroy for their incredible dignity and professionalism.\"Bafta also thanked Davidson for his \"dignity and consideration of others, on what should have been a night of celebration for him\".Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said on Monday that the BBC had made \"a horrible mistake\" by not editing the N-word out at the time, adding: \"I think an apology is important, they need to explain why it wasn't bleeped out.\"In its statement issued on Monday, the BBC added: \"Some viewers may have heard strong and offensive language during the Bafta Film Awards.\"This arose from involuntary verbal tics associated with Tourette syndrome, and as explained during the ceremony it was not intentional.\"The corporation declined to comment further on why it wasn't initially edited or bleeped out.After the ceremony, Lindo told Vanity Fair, that he and Jordan, who were handing out an award \"did what we had to do\" as they carried on presenting, but also said he wished \"someone from Bafta spoke to us afterward\".Getty ImagesJohn Davidson's tics could be heard several times during the ceremonyDavidson, a Tourette's campaigner from Galashiels in Scotland, who was made an MBE in 2019, shouted loudly several times before and during the Bafta ceremony.He said on Monday that he was \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning\".\"I have spent my life trying to support and empower the Tourette's community and to teach empathy, kindness and understanding from others and I will continue to do so,\" he said in a statement.\"I chose to leave the auditorium early into the ceremony as I was aware of the distress my tics were causing.\"During the ceremony, host Alan Cumming referred to \"some strong and offensive language\" from someone with Tourette's who therefore had \"no control over their language\", adding: \"We apologise if you were offended.\"Speaking to BBC News after the ceremony, Robert Aramayo, who won best actor for playing Davidson in I Swear, said: \"They're tics, he [Davidson] is ticking, and we have to understand that the way we perceive Tourette's is a joint responsibility.\"It's not shouting obscenities, it's not being abusive, it's Tourette's and they're tics.\"If it can lead to a deeper understanding of Tourette's syndrome and what tics actually are, if our movie is a part of that conversation, then that's a really incredible thing.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesGP practices in England are to be paid an average of £3,000 a year in bonuses to prescribe patients weight loss drugs.The government is adding the incentive payments to the GP contract starting in April.GPs will also get extra money – worth about £1,000 a year - for referring patients on to weight loss programmes.Ministers said it was important that patients who could benefit from weight loss support were able to access it.But obesity experts warned the scheme would have limited impact because the drugs were still being tightly-restricted on the NHS – and this move would do nothing to widen eligibility.The incentive payments will only apply to Mounjaro.This drug started being available on the NHS in 2025 but not all GPs are yet prescribing it as often as expected.The other new generation weight loss drug available on the NHS – Wegovy – is not prescribed by GPs but instead is given by specialist NHS weight loss services.More than 1 million people are estimated to be using weight loss drugs, given as injections, with nine in 10 paying for them privately.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Weight loss drugs can be a real game changer for those who need them. I'm determined that access should be based on need, not ability to pay.\"Outside the NHS, we've seen those who can spare the cash buying privately, and the proliferation of rogue prescribers peddling dangerous unlicensed drugs that are putting patients at risk.\"Investing in general practice will help bring this modern medicine to the many, not just the few, and help shift the focus of the NHS from treatment to prevention.\"Incentive payments are a normal part of the GP contract and in the past have been paid for a variety of other things to improve everything from dementia care to boosting vaccination rates and to prescribe statins to lower the risk of heart disease.This will be the first time weight loss drugs have been made part of the contract with the £3,000 available for prescribing the maximum number of eligible patients Mounjaro. The sum is the average available with the size of the bonus dependent on the size of the practice.The drug only started being prescribed by GPs during this financial year – and access has been restricted to those severely obese with both a BMI of over 40 and certain health conditions.Next year that will be widened to those with a BMI of over 35 with the expectation that by 2028, 220,000 patients will be on Mounjaro provided by the NHS. The eligibility thresholds are lower for certain ethnic groups.However, rollout so far has been reported to be patchy.Katharine Jenner, director of Obesity Health Alliance, said the incentives were a welcome step.But she added: \"This doesn't mean weight loss drugs will suddenly be available to everyone who wants them.\"NHS access will remain very limited and focused on those with the greatest clinical need, and these treatments are most effective when combined with sustained support.\"And she added: \"If we're serious about moving from sickness to prevention, expanded treatment must go alongside stronger action to improve the food environment and prevent obesity in the first place.\"Dr Katie Bramall, of the British Medical Association, said: \"While the headlines promise much, in reality there will be no change to NHS England's eligibility criteria for patients to access injectable weight‑loss medication on the NHS. \"These proposals will do nothing over the next year to address the divide between those able to pay and those left waiting unable to afford private self-funded treatments\"And Prof Victoria Tzortziou Brown, of the Royal College of GPs, added: \"GPs do not withhold treatment or prescribe based on financial incentives. Decisions are guided by clinical judgement and what is safest and most appropriate for individual patients.\"Widening the roll-out of these medications in general practice could end up increasing workload in a way that may not be sustainable and risk raising unrealistic expectations among patients who may not be eligible or for whom these medicines are not suitable.\"",

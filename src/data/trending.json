    "body": "33 minutes agoThe fallout after a former asylum seeker who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl was mistakenly released from prison dominates Saturday's papers. The Sun calls the blunder \"one out... by mistake\", playing off the government's \"one in, one out\" asylum scheme. The paper reports Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was due to be deported before being released after an \"astonishing error\" by prison staff.The Daily Telegraph says police are scrambling to track down the sex offender who was let out of HMP Chelmsford after being wrongly categorised as a prisoner due to be freed. Justice Secretary David Lammy says he is \"furious\" and has ordered an \"urgent investigation\" into the error, the paper reports. Elsewhere, a picture of Boris Johnson's ex-wife Marina Wheeler is front and centre, who poses the question \"I'm over him, surely Britain is too?\"\"A blunder that beggars belief\" is the Daily Mail's take. Police say Kebatu was last seen asking for directions from locals before boarding a London-bound train at Chelmsford station on Friday, the paper reports. Sharing the front page, the Mail says that Prince Andrew could be asked to leave the Royal Lodge by King Charles III.The Mirror also leads with Prince Andrew's \"advanced talks\" with the King to leave the Royal Lodge after the fallout from his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \"Dislodged\" is the paper's headline over an aerial view of Windsor's sprawling Royal Lodge mansion.A \"stark warning for Starmer\" after Labour suffered a \"crushing\" by-election defeat in its traditional heartland of Wales on Friday, the Guardian reports. The paper says the result highlighted the \"striking collapse\" of the party's vote, with MPs warning a repeat loss in the 2026 May local elections \"could spell the end\" of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's premiership. Alongside, the Guardian previews Claudia Winkleman's \"next steps\" after she and fellow Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly announced they were leaving the show.\"Starmer in firing line\" echoes the Independent's headline on the government's \"historic by-election defeat\" in Caerphilly. The paper reports the PM saying he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the result. Also sharing the top spot is the King's \"royal welcome\" for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday ahead of a summit with European allies in London.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to give more than a million low-paid workers a pay boost in the budget, the Times reports. The paper says Reeves has been warned by businesses the move would risk \"pricing jobs out of existence\".The i follows with more warnings from economists for the chancellor, who say raising the higher rate of income tax would hit \"ordinary workers\", including teachers and junior doctors. The paper reports Reeves is considering \"breaking Labour's manifesto pledge to give herself some breathing space on public spending\".\"Trump sets off fresh tariffs alarm\" is the Financial Times' lead, after Donald Trump \"cleared the way for new tariffs\" on China and halted trade talks with Canada on Friday. The paper says the decisions come ahead of Trump's upcoming trip to Asia, which includes a summit in South Korea with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Finally, the Daily Star is asking their readers who they want as Strictly Come Dancing's next hosts. The top names in the running include presenters Rylan Clark and Zoe Ball, with \"Lettuce Liz Truss\" also making a surge with 8% of the vote.Many papers feature the Epping asylum seeker jailed for sexual assault who has been released from prison by mistake.The Daily Telegraph calls it a \"jail blunder\", with the Daily Mail saying the error \"beggars belief\".The Times quotes the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accusing Labour of \"putting predators back on the streets\", and highlights Sir Keir Starmer's response on X in which he said he was \"appalled by the mistake\".Prince Andrew still features prominently in many newspapers.The Guardian is among those reporting that he is in advanced talks with Buckingham Palace about leaving his 30-room mansion, Royal Lodge, as pressure grows following fresh revelations about him in the posthumous memoirs of Virgina Guiffre.\"Dislodged,\" says the Daily Mirror's headline. Prince Andrew has consistently denied claims by Ms Guiffre that he sexually abused her.The Times reports that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to give more than a million low paid workers a pay rise in next month's budget by increasing the national living wage.But the paper says economists and the hospitality industry have warned it could lead to job losses and it quotes the Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, Simon Roberts, saying it could result in price rises for shoppers.Labour is planning to let trade unions \"barge\" into workplaces under the new employment rights bill, according to documents seen by the Daily Telegraph.  It says a Department of Business and Trade consultation paper states employers with more than 21 workers will face big fines if they block access to officials. A spokesman for the department says it is not true that the bill would allow unions to turn up when they wanted.And a pledge by the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, to abolish business rates for a quarter of a million retailers is the main story for the Daily Express. It says the promise - part of a four-pronged plan - will kickstart a High Street boom if the party were in power to implement it.  Labour says it is also creating a fairer business rates system.Related Internet Links",

Cuts to the tax-free allowance were unlikely to have the intended effect of promoting an investment culture in the UK, the Treasury Select Committee said in a report.Reeves is expected to announce tax rises or spending cuts in next month's Budget, and is reportedly considering changes to cash Isas.The chancellor said: \"My understanding is that the report says that changes to Isas shouldn't be made in isolation of other policies. I'll be setting out any tax changes in the budget in November. And of course we need to get that balance right.\"Reeves added: \"At the moment, often returns on savings and returns on pensions are lower than in comparable countries around the world, and I do want to make sure that when people put something aside for the future, they get good returns on those savings.\"Earlier this year, the chancellor was thought to be mulling a reduction to the allowance for tax-free cash savings in a bid to encourage people to put money into stocks and shares instead and boost the economy.Those plans were put on hold after strong opposition from banks, building societies and consumer campaigners.Savers can put up to £20,000 a year in Isas in savings and investments, to protect the returns from being taxed. The chancellor has said she intends to keep this limit in place, and it can currently  be spread across products including cash Isas and stocks and shares Isas. The proposed change specifically relates to cash Isas, and earlier this month the Financial Times reported the chancellor was considering reducing their tax-free amount to £10,000. The purpose behind this would be to encourage investment. The chancellor is facing a Budget shortfall of about £22bn, according to a recent estimate.She is expected to raise taxes or cut spending in her November Budget in order to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules of not borrowing to fund day-to-day spending and to get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament.Cash Isas are the most widely used type of Isa. A total of £360bn is held in cash Isas across the country.The committee's report concluded that \"cutting the cash Isa allowance is unlikely to incentivise people to invest their cash in stocks and shares\".Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Dame Meg Hillier, said: \"This is not the right time to cut the cash Isa limit.\"\"The Committee is firmly behind the chancellor's ambition to create a culture in the UK where savers are sensibly investing their money and getting better returns through well-informed financial decisions,\" she said.\"But we are a long way from that point.\"Dame Meg said the government should instead focus its efforts on \"a comprehensive effort to genuinely improve financial education and establish accessible, high quality financial advice and guidance for people\".\"Without this, I fear that the Chancellor's attempts to transform the UK's investment culture simply will not deliver the change she seeks, instead hitting savers and mortgage borrowers.\"Reducing the tax-free allowance for cash Isas would likely be unpopular among many savers, particularly older ones who are less willing to take risks with their money.Instead of cutting the cash Isa tax-free limit, \"the focus should be on improving financial literacy ... so that people can make informed decisions with their savings\", the committee said.The report found that cutting the allowance would have negative knock-on effects for consumers, as building societies depend on cash Isas for their mortgage lending.\"If this was reduced, it would mean a less competitive market for financial products and consequently higher prices for consumers,\" the committee said.BBC News has contacted the Treasury for comment.",

    "body": "11 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterPA MediaChancellor Rachel Reeves has refused to rule out an income tax rise in next month's Budget, amid speculation she is considering breaking a key Labour election pledge.Asked about reports, first published in The Guardian newspaper, that the Treasury is in active discussions over raising the rate, Reeves said she would \"continue to support working people by keeping their taxes as low as possible\".Reeves' refusal to rule out a rise does not mean one is inevitable as Chancellors rarely confirm or deny specific tax measures ahead of a Budget.But her careful language contrasts with comments in September that \"manifesto commitments stand\" on not raising income tax, National Insurance or VAT.Labour's 2024 general election manifesto contained a pledge not to raise \"the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax\".The party also promised not to increase National Insurance - prompting a row last autumn when it announced a hike in the contributions paid by employers.Speaking to journalists in Leeds on Friday, Reeves said: \"Although I can't talk about individual measures at this stage, I understand that the cost of living is still people's number one concern.\"She went on to say that her aim was to \"ensure that we continue to support working people by keeping their taxes as low as possible\" but that she was still  \"going through the process\" of writing her Budget.She also said that although the inflation figures this week \"came in better than expected\" there was \"obviously much more to do.\"The chancellor has signalled she is likely to focus on wealthy individuals at the Budget, saying \"those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share\".This week, reports suggested officials are exploring a mix of measures, including higher taxes on partnerships used by lawyers and accountants.However, economists say such steps will not raise enough to close the hole in the government's finances, leaving Reeves under pressure to consider more politically sensitive options.Influential think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says Reeves will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes to make up a £22bn shortfall in the government's finances.The gap has been driven by the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) decision to downgrade productivity forecasts, wiping out much of the £10bn \"headroom\" Reeves set aside at the spring statement. Government borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - in September rose to £20.2bn, the highest for that month in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics.The effective interest rates on UK government debt has fallen sharply, but Reeves has been left with very little room to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules without increasing taxes. These rules mean her plans must be projected to get government debt falling as a share of national income by 2029-30, and day-to-day government costs must be paid for by tax income rather than borrowing.If Reeves increases income tax it will be the first rise in the rate since 2010, when Labour introduced a 50% additional rate on incomes over £150,000 which was reduced to 45% by the coalition government. Currently, Income tax is charged on earnings above the personal allowance of £12,570, which is tax-free. The basic rate of 20% applies to income between £12,571 and £50,270, while earnings from £50,271 to £125,140 are taxed at the higher rate of 40%. Income above £125,140 is subject to the additional rate of 45%. These thresholds apply to most taxpayers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, while Scotland has a separate system.The Guardian reported that Treasury officials are in \"active discussions\" about adding 1p to the basic rate of income tax, which could raise more than £8bn as well as looking at increasing higher rates for top earners. The basic rate of income tax has not been raised since the 1970s.",

    "body": "A  fourth Metropolitan Police officer has been fired for gross misconduct following a BBC Panorama investigation.PC Jason Sinclair-Birt was secretly filmed \"boasting about and revelling in the use of force\" on a detainee.He was dismissed without notice, after the hearing found he had given a \"false account\" of the incident to the undercover reporter for \"comedic effect\".On Thursday, three other Met Police officers were dismissed after accelerated misconduct hearings following the investigation. Setting out the case, James Berry KC, representing the Met, said: \"The Panorama footage demonstrates PC Sinclair-Birt boasted about and revelled in the use of force, and what he was describing was an excessive use of force, on a detainee.\"In the undercover footage, played to the panel, Mr Sinclair-Birt was seen describing the arrest saying he \"whacked....the back of his legs trying to get him to drop to the floor\".He went on to say, \"there's definitely a little bit of red mist there\".The officer was seen smiling during the incident, which the Met said indicated a \"troubling lack of remorse or concern for a member of the public\".The hearing was told the conduct of the officer breached the Met's standards of professional behaviour and the conduct amounted to gross misconduct.Mr Sinclair-Birt denied the allegation against him, but accepted he made the comments which appeared in the programme.In his statement, he said the comments made to the undercover reporter were \"empty words and not a true account of the underlying incident\".He said he was \"embellishing the account of an actual stop and search and he was doing so for comedic effect\".The hearing was played body-worn footage from the stop and search which took place in July 2022, and showed Mr Sinclair-Birt did not use his baton during the incident.The panel was told Mr Sinclair-Birt used \"lawful and proportionate force\" throughout the arrest to get the detainee to sit down.Giving his decision Chair Commander Jason Prins said: \"The officer has chosen to share a false account which revelled in the use of force.He added: \"In my view the false account was meant to be taken at face value.\"Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the Met was \"grateful\" for Panorama's investigation but criticised the BBC for waiting too long to disclose unaired footage of the officers. Sir Mark said it was \"extremely frustrating\" that the delays had resulted in adjournment applications and \"unnecessary complications\". Friday's scheduled hearing for Sgt Clayton Robinson will now take place on 28 October. Three others have been adjourned to a later date. The misconduct process was launched after the Panorama programme was aired on 1 October. An undercover BBC reporter heard officers at Charing Cross police station threatening to shoot immigrants, dismissing claims of rape, and using excessive force on detainees. On Thursday, Sgt Joe McIlvenny, PC Philip Neilson and PC Martin Borg faced expedited misconduct hearings over the footage. All three denied allegations of gross misconduct but accepted they made the comments aired in the programme.Chair of the panel, Cdr Jason Prins, described the conduct of the officers as a \"disgrace\".Ten former and current police officers at Charing Cross station are facing accelerated misconduct hearings over footage of the investigation.

    "body": "5 hours agoRuth CleggHealth and wellbeing reporterGetty ImagesIt's been described as the mineral of the moment.Millions of us are taking magnesium for a whole range of reasons. Can it help us sleep better? Sort our digestion problems? Give our busy brains a moment of peace?In the fast-moving world of supplements, it's magnesium's time to shine.And the industry is booming. The global magnesium market is worth nearly £3bn and that's set to nearly double over the next decade.In a small factory, nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, huge plastic barrels of white powder are stacked up next to giant whirring machines.Workers in hazmat suits carefully weigh out magnesium citrate - a compound made by mixing the mineral with citric acid - into shiny, steel containers.Ruth Clegg/BBCMillions of magnesium tablets are produced in this factory every day\"We are sending our supplies all over the world,\" Andrew Goring, manager director of Lonsdale Health, explains. \"Around the UK, obviously, but also to Australia, parts of Asia, Kuwait, Iraq.\"It's one of our biggest sellers and the market just keeps growing.\"He is shouting over the hum of the pill presser, a machine that resembles a Dalek, which pops out dozens of small white magnesium tablets a second.\"Do we actually need it?\" I bellow back. \"And why now, why has it become so popular?\"\"Influencers, social media - that's what's pushing it,\" Mr Goring explains. \"We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream.\"I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.\"Clever marketing schemes,\" Ms Jackson says, \"magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health.\"But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. The recommended daily amount for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.It might make up less than 1% of us but \"it is involved in over 300 different processes\", Ms Jackson explains.It is \"especially important for our brain and mood,\" she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.Katie CurranKatie says magnesium supplements have helped improve her sleep and calmed her racing thoughtsFor Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.\"A year ago, I was struggling,\" she confides. \"It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later.\"Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, an amino acid with limited evidence linking it to better sleep.After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.\"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle.\"While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with \"commission paid\" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation. The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.\"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die',\" Ms Stavridis says, \"'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.\"Many of us are not getting enough magnesium,\" she continues, \"around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the recommended daily intake.\"But just taking a supplement is not the answer.\"Getty ImagesSeeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are all rich in magnesiumTake sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also affect the absorption rate of magnesium.Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of \"take this\" and you'll be fixed.She recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.If healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in \"expensive urine\", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.For those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.Dietitian Kirsten Jackson also says most people should \"100% look at diet first\".Foods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.She warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.\"One magnesium supplement is not going to sort all that.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "11 hours agoZahra FatimaPA MediaWindrush Commissioner Reverend Clive Foster had been tasked with looking at how to improve the compensation schemeVictims of the Windrush Scandal will get 75% of their compensation in advance, as part of changes to the government scheme.The Home Office said applicants aged 75 and over, as well as those with serious health conditions, will be prioritised - in a effort to ensure speedier justice.For the first time, victims will also be compensated for lost contributions to pensions, as well as any immigration fees they have had to pay.The Windrush Compensation scheme - which was set up in 2019 - has faced intense criticism from campaigners and legal experts for ongoing processing delays, low offers and unfair rejections.The scandal first came to light in 2018 after it was revealed that the Home Office had failed to keep records of people with indefinite leave to remain in the UK - and had not issued paperwork needed to confirm their legal status.Thousands of Caribbean migrants who came to the UK between 1948 to 1973 and had the right to remain, were wrongly classified as illegal citizens and denied access to homes, jobs and NHS care. Many others were threatened with or faced detention and deportation.Official figures published last month showed that so far just over £116m had been paid in compensation since the scheme's launch.But 15,000 people were thought to be eligible when it was set up.In June, a damning report suggested that two-thirds of Windrush claimants had not received any compensation at all.Others have received significantly less than they might be entitled to due to lack of legal assistance, the report says. One woman previously told the BBC her father had been offered just £400.Under the new rules, victims who have appealed the government's offer will receive an advance payment of three quarters of the amount, while they wait for their review to be completed.\"It is unacceptable that many victims are still waiting for compensation all these years later. That changes today,\" said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Friday.Describing the scandal as a \"shameful stain on our history\", Mahmood added: \"I will leave no stone unturned until everyone affected receives the justice they deserve.\"In June, the government announced the first Windrush Commissioner, Reverend Clive Foster, who is responsible for speaking up for victims and looking at ways to improve the compensation scheme.Last month, he wrote to the government about why victims with the scheme, saying there was a perception that \"the Home Office is waiting for us to die off\".He added he did not feel himself this was the case, but wanted to reflect victims' views.Speaking after the announcement, Mr Foster said the changes will \"make a real difference, especially for those who don't have time on their side.\"But he warned rolling out the changes must be \"swift and sustained,\" adding \"trust will only be rebuilt through action, and I will continue to press for progress on all my outstanding recommendations\".The changes were announced by the Migration and Citizenship Minister Mike Tapp, who spoke at the Windrush National Organisation conference in Birmingham.Windrush is one of the few major state schemes that does not provide legal assistance and the Home Office has so far rejected calls for it to be introduced.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship2 hours agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a war\", after it sent the world's largest warship towards the Caribbean in a major escalation of its military build-up in the region.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which can carry up to 90 aircraft, to move from the Mediterranean on Friday.\"They are fabricating a new eternal war,\" Maduro told state media. \"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war.\"The US has been increasing its military presence in the Caribbean, sending warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft in what it says is a campaign to target drug traffickers.It has also carried out ten airstrikes on boats it says belong to traffickers, including one on Friday when Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed.That operation took place in the Caribbean Sea, against a ship Hegseth said belonged to the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation. The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. The Trump administration says it is conducting a war on drug trafficking, but it has also been accused by both experts and members of Congress of launching an intimidation campaign in an effort to destabilise Maduro's government.Maduro is a longtime foe of Trump, and the US president has accused him of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation which he denies.ANALYSIS: What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?\"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up is intended to \"strike fear\" in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.In its Friday announcement, the Pentagon said the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle TCOs\", or transnational criminal organisations, spokesman Sean Parnell said.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroThe carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela.\"We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" he said earlier this week.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.The aircraft carrier last publicly transmitted its location three days ago off the coast of Croatia, in the Adriatic Sea.Its deployment marks a significant escalation in the US military buildup in the region. It is also likely to increase tensions with Venezuela, whose government Washington has long accused of harbouring drug traffickers.The carrier's large aircraft load can include jets and planes for transport and reconnaissance. Its first long-term deployment was in 2023.It is unclear which vessels will accompany it when it moves to the region, but it can operate as part of a strike group that includes destroyers carrying missiles and other equipment.The US has carried out a series of strikes on boats in recent weeks, in what President Donald Trump has described as an effort to curtail drug trafficking.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike announced on Friday was the tenth the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic US senators wrote to the White House and alleged the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval.Trump said he has the legal authority to order the strikes, and has designated Tren de Aragua a terrorist organisation.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that \"if people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States\".The six deaths in the operation Hegseth announced on Friday brings the total people killed in the US strikes to at least 43.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has not appeared willing to challenge Trump on. \"The US is experiencing an Article 1 crisis,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back.\" ",

    "body": "Manhunt after jailed Epping hotel asylum seeker mistakenly released7 hours agoAndré Rhoden-Paul, Shivani Chaudhari and Ellena CruseVideo appears to show mistakenly released hotel asylum seeker in ChelmsfordPolice have launched a manhunt after a former asylum seeker who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl was mistakenly released from prison on Friday.Ethiopian national Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, was jailed for 12 months over the attack in Epping, Essex, last month. Prison sources said Kebatu was meant to be sent to an immigration detention centre from HMP Chelmsford ahead of a planned deportation. An investigation has been launched by the Prison Service, and an officer has been removed from discharging duties while it takes place.Essex Police said \"fast-paced inquiries\" showed that he boarded a London-bound train at Chelmsford station. Justice Secretary David Lammy said he was \"appalled\" and \"livid on behalf of the public that Kebatu is at large\". Speaking to the media, Lammy said Essex Police, the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police were working together on the case.\"Let's be clear Kebatu committed a nasty sexual assault involving a young child and a woman,\" he said. \"And for those reasons this of course is very serious.\"He added he has asked for a \"full and immediate investigation\" into the release of Kebatu, who he described as a \"dangerous individual\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Kebatu \"must be caught and deported for his crimes\".Essex PoliceKebatu was sentenced to 12 months in prisonA Prison Service spokesperson said: \"We are urgently working with police to return an offender to custody following a release in error at HMP Chelmsford.\"Public protection is our top priority, and we have launched an investigation into this incident.\"A spokesperson for Essex Police said at 12:57 on Friday it was informed by the prison services about \"an error\" to do with \"the release of an individual\". \"As a result of that, we have launched a search operation to locate them and are working closely with partner agencies,\" they added.\"These fast-paced inquiries have shown that the man boarded a London-bound train at Chelmsford Railway Station at 12:41.\"We understand the concern the public would have regarding this situation and can assure you we have officers working to urgently locate and detain him.\"Stuart Woodward/BBCEssex Police said the man had boarded a train heading into London at 12:41Kebatu's arrest had sparked protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, where he had been living.In September, Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu tried to kiss the teenage girl on a bench and made numerous sexually explicit comments on 7 July. The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her. He also sexually assaulted a woman who had offered to help him create a CV to find work. During the trial, Kebatu gave his date of birth as December 1986, making him 38, but court records suggested he was 41.In September, after being found guilty of five offences, he was sentenced to 12 months and given a five-year sexual harm prevention order, which banned him from approaching or contacting any female. He was also made to sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10  years.The court heard it was his \"firm wish\" to be deported.Watch: Bodycam footage shows Hadush Kebatu's arrestChelmsford's Liberal Democrat MP Marie Goldman called for a rapid public inquiry into how the mistaken release, first reported by The Sun, happened. \"This is utterly unacceptable and has potentially put my constituents in danger,\" she said. \"I expect answers from the Prison Service.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the \"entire system is collapsing under Labour\". \"Conservatives voted against Labour's prisoner release program because it was putting predators back on our streets,\" she said on X. \"But this man has only just been convicted. A level of incompetence that beggars belief.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"He is now walking the streets of Essex. Britain is broken.\"A report from His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service said 262 prisoners in England and Wales were released in error between April 2024 and March 2025, up from 115 in the previous 12 months.More on this story",

    "body": "9 hours agoDaniel Sandford,UK correspondent, the Old Bailey and Andre Rhoden-PaulMetropolitan PoliceJake Reeves, left, was brought into the plot by Dylan Earl Six men have been jailed for their parts in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse providing aid to Ukraine. The fire at industrial units in Leyton, east London, on 20 March 2024 caused £1.3m in damage. Ringleader Dylan Earl was recruited by the Wagner Group, a mercenary organisation that acts on behalf of the Russian state and is proscribed by the UK government as a terrorist organisation. He was sentenced to 17 years in prison plus a further six years on extended licence. Before his arrest, he was also plotting to kidnap a wealthy Russian dissident. Earl, 21, from Elmesthorpe, Leicestershire, admitted a National Security Act offence and aggravated arson, along with Jake Reeves, 24, from Croydon, who was given 12 years in prison plus one year on extended licence.Reeves helped Earl recruit a group of men to carry out the arson. The pair are the first to be convicted of offences under the National Security Act 2023. The act is designed to tackle threats that fall short of traditional spying and can involve third party actors not working directly for a hostile state, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says. Of the other four men sentenced:Nii Mensah, 23, from Thornton Heath, who streamed the attack, was convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for nine yearsAshton Evans, 20, from Newport, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, convicted for failing to tell police what he knew about a planned kidnapping, and jailed for nine years.Jakeem Rose, 23, from Croydon, who set the buildings alight, pleaded guilty to have a bladed article in a public place, convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for eight years and 10 months Ugnius Asmena, 21, of no fixed address, who arranged the getaway car and was there on the night, was convicted of aggravated arson and jailed for seven years All four each received a further year on extended licence.Earl contacted the Wagner Group on messaging app Telegram and told his handler he was keen to carry out a series of \"missions\", of which Leyton would be the first, the court previously heard. In the chat, Earl's contact instructed him to watch Cold War spy drama The Americans and use it as a \"manual\".Earl then brought in other men to carry out the arson attack. The Ukrainian-owned warehouse they targeted had been used to send goods to Ukraine, including Starlink satellite terminals, and it required eight fire crews with 60 firefighters to get the blaze under control. Earl was supposed to receive £9,000 for his role but was paid less because he carried out the plan early without his handler's sign-off.On Friday, Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described the case as a \"planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage\" in the interests of the Russian state. Police footage shows arson attack ringleader's arrestAfter the warehouse attack, Earl and Reeves set the group's sights on an arson attack on a restaurant and wine shop in Mayfair and the kidnap of owner Evgeny Chichvarkin, a critic of the Russian state.But before he could carry it out, he was arrested in a B&Q car park in Leicestershire, and videos of the warehouse fire being started were found on his phone. In a search of the drug dealer's home, police recovered a Russian flag, more than £20,000 in cash and cocaine with a street value of some £34,000.Evidence on his phone revealed details of a cryptocurrency account holding more than £58,000 and images of bundles of cash estimated to total £175,000.Earl also admitted possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of criminal property.Metropolitan PoliceThe fire caused about £1.3m worth of damage to the warehouseCommander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Policing, told the BBC Earl was \"somebody working absolutely as an agent of a foreign state to sow unrest and commit crimes in this country\". He added Russia presents \"a very real threat to our national security\" and it was not unusual now to see Russia contacting people online and then using them to conduct criminal activity on their behalf. Security minister Dan Jarvis said the sentences sent a clear message that the UK would not tolerate hostile activity by foreign states. \"To those acting for a foreign state, as the head of MI5 has said, you are disposable and you will not receive your reward, just as these individuals found out,\" he warned.

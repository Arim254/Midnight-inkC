    "body": "What growing up in war does to a child's brain - and how it really affects them years later13 hours agoFergal KeaneSpecial correspondent BBCContent warning: this article includes details about the impact of conflict on children in war zones and descriptions of injuries that some readers may find distressing.The first thing was that Abdelrahman's dad was killed. The family home was struck by an Israeli air strike. The boy's mum, Asma al-Nashash, 29, remembers that \"they brought him out in pieces\".Then on 16 July 2024 an air strike hit the school in Nuseirat, central Gaza. Eleven-year-old Abdelrahman was seriously wounded. Doctors had to amputate his leg.His mental state began to deteriorate. \"He started pulling his hair and hitting himself hard,\" Asma recalls. \"He became like someone who has depression, seeing his friends playing and running around… and he's sitting alone.\"When I meet Abdelrahman at a hospital in Jordan in May 2025, he is withdrawn and wary. Dozens of children have been evacuated to the Kingdom from Gaza for medical treatment.\"We will return to Gaza,\" he tells me. \"We will die there.\"Abdelrahman is one of thousands of traumatised children I've met in my nearly four decades of reporting on conflicts. Certain faces are embedded in my memory. Some as though I had only met them yesterday. They reflect the depth of terror inflicted on children in our time.AFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesHundreds of thousands of children have lived through more than two years of war in GazaThe first was on a hilltop in Eritrea in the mid-1980s. Adonai Mikael was a child victim of an Ethiopian napalm strike, crying in agony as the wind blew dust on to his wounds. The cries, the expression of pure agony in his eyes sent me fleeing from the tent where he was being treated. In Belfast a few years later, I remember a boy following the coffin of his father, blown up by the IRA. Never before had I seen such a distance in anyone's eyes.In Sierra Leone during the civil war, there was the girl whose hands were hacked off by a drunken militiaman; from Soweto there is the image of a child helping her mother mop the blood of a murder victim on their doorstep; and in Rwanda the boy who broke down when I asked him why the other children called him \"Grenade\" – a moment of insensitivity I will always regret.He had been wounded by an explosion that killed his parents.Figures underscore the sheer scale of the crisis. In 2024, 520 million children were living in conflict zones - one in every five children worldwide - according to an analysis by the Peace Research Institute Oslo, which pieced together conflict records with population data to arrive at the estimate.Prof Theresa Betancourt, author of Shadows into Light, a book about former child soldiers, calls this \"the largest humanitarian disaster since World War Two\".She warns trauma has an impact that lasts long into the future. \"[It can affect] the developing architecture of the brain in young children, with lifelong consequences for learning, behaviour, and both physical and mental health.\"But given how much time has been spent researching the impact of war on children's minds, what can help?This is a question that has never been more relevant following this period of multiple global conflicts that have affected millions of children: from those Sudanese children who, in October, saw their mothers and sisters raped by militiamen in el-Fasher, Darfur; the youngsters abducted from Israel by Hamas on 7 October, 2023, many having witnessed the slaughter of family and neighbours; the children of Bucha in Ukraine whose parents were among the people massacred by Russian troops in February 2022; and the hundreds of thousands of children like Abdelrahman who have endured more than two years of war in Gaza.AFP via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesSudanese refugees in 2025I should declare a personal interest. I suffered from post traumatic stress disorder – PTSD both as a child in a broken home, and later as an adult, witnessing war and genocide. Though different from experiencing war as a child, I know the symptoms all too well: the extreme anxiety, hypervigilance – being constantly on guard against threats - flashbacks, nightmares, and depression. The symptoms were severe enough to require several hospitalisations.Personal experience has made me intensely curious about how children respond and are treated.\"The evidence is quite solid across different studies that the exposure to war and displacement is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems,\" says Michael Pluess, a professor of psychology at the University of Surrey.He has carried out long-term research into the children of Syrian war refugees, and cautions against making assumptions. \"It's important to recognise that children differ in how they respond.\"A variety of factors can influence the outcome. How long was the child exposed to the traumatic events? Were they physically wounded? Did they lose an important person in their life, or see them killed or injured? Did they have physical security and emotional support in the aftermath?In a sample of 2,976 children from Bosnia-Herzegovina - all of whom had been exposed to war and were aged between nine and 14 - high levels of post-traumatic symptoms and grief symptoms were reported.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGetty ImagesBosnia-Herzegovina: Children in SarajevoBut there is the potential for long-term health damage – heart disease, autoimmune problems - linked to \"toxic stress\", where the body is flooded with hormones like cortisol and catecholamines, which produce adrenaline.There is also a developing field of research into epigenetics, which asks whether the experience of trauma by one generation can show up in later generations through changes in the way our genes behave.Are we more susceptible to, say, poor mental health, addictions or other health problems if our families have a history of trauma - and how much has this to do with genetics versus our family setups and everyday lives?The family drip-feed effectEpigenetics is a tentative and debated area of scientific research with much still to be learned.\"I think there is some evidence that there is a sort of intergenerational transmission of trauma,\" says Prof Pluess. \"Some of that or much of that will happen through social practice rather than biological practice, but there's some evidence to suggest that there are some epigenetic factors as well.\"Prof Metin Başoğlu, director of the Istanbul Centre for Behavioural Sciences, is sceptical. However, he says it is possible that certain temperament traits (for example, predispositions that are transmitted genetically across generations) might make some people more vulnerable to traumatic events.During research for a book on my own PTSD, I remember a conversation with one of Britain's most eminent experts in the field, Prof Simon Wessely, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. I wondered whether my own family history – great-grandparents born during the Irish famine, a grandmother who was traumatised by her war experiences in the 1920s – could have made me more genetically predisposed to PTSD?\"There is simply no way of knowing, without studying a representative sample group from the same area, with ancestors born in the same place and subjected to the same conditions,\" he told me. \"I can't do it on one person…\"What I think is much easier to understand - and, I think, is also the most powerful - is the influence of our background. And it's absolutely impossible for you to have grown up in the household that you did, with the interests that you have, for that not to have the same effect on you.\"AFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesProf Pluess has carried out long-term research into the children of Syrian war refugees, and cautions against making assumptionsThere is broader consensus that trauma is a family crisis. It isn't only a question of what a child witnesses or survives – there is also the impact on adults.\"Not only do children in war zones face the death of caregivers and traumatic separations,\" says Prof Betancourt, \"but caregivers experiencing their own trauma and distress may not be fully available to help protect and guide their children through the horrors of war.\"Prof Pluess's research among Syrian refugees supports this. Among the 80% of children found to be vulnerable to more than one psychological disorder, family circumstances were critical.Around 1,600 families took part in a study, published in 2022, of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Prof Pluess says that children's living conditions (such as access to safe housing, food, and schooling) were found to be \"about 10 times more predictive of their mental health\".Children who adapted more healthily may have \"had a social environment that was very protective, maybe the parents were able to shield them, maybe they had close friendships, relationships, maybe they have access to school, all those external things that sort of buffer the negative impact of war exposure.\"The roots of this knowledge in Britain go back to WW2 and the experience of children who lived through the Blitz – the eight months of German air attacks between September 1940 and May 1941.Getty ImagesHulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis via Getty ImagesFox Photos/Getty Images\"The evidence is quite solid [...] exposure to war and displacement is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems,\" says Prof PluessProf Edgar Jones, of King's College London, points to a study of 212 children treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children during the war. When researchers went back to the children in 1949 – four years after the conflict ended – they found only 21% had recovered. The role of parents – both positive and negative – emerged as an important finding.\"The severity of a child's reaction to bombing was judged to be influenced by their parents' response to the trauma either to accentuate or calm their anxiety,\" says Prof Jones.Overcoming fear and establishing controlIn my own experience, therapy and medication helped, but also the ongoing support of family and friends. Without the power of caring relationships I don't believe I could have emerged from the darkness.I was also encouraged to confront my avoidance of anything that might remind me of the trauma. For example, I went through a long period of avoiding travel to the continent of Africa, fearing that simply being there would trigger reminders of the Rwandan genocide. But my therapist gradually encouraged me to face the fear. It took several years but I did return, and continue to visit places there that are dear to my heart.Prof Başoğlu pioneered the use of what is called CFBT – Control Focused Behavioural Treatment - among survivors of the 1999 Turkish earthquake, which killed about 18,000 people.The idea is to encourage the individual to take control of their fear of the event recurring. In the case of children who were constantly clinging to their parents, this was attempted by encouraging them to get used to sleeping alone.\"Once they overcome their fear, all the traumatic stress reactions that are associated with fear also improve,\" Prof Başoğlu says.Israeli psychologists working with children released from Hamas captivity after the 7 October attacks also stress the importance of re-establishing a sense of control.Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGlobal conflicts have affected millions of children, including the young people abducted from Israel by Hamas on 7 October, 2023, those who witnessed the slaughter of family and neighbours that day, and those dealing with the aftermathIn a paper for the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health journal, a team of Israeli specialists wrote that this was achieved \"by providing survivors with information and space to express their concerns while ensuring that their needs and voices are heard\".But successful interventions depend greatly on creating a stable environment where the fear of being killed or maimed is not an ever-present reality.\"What they also need is that their parents are well, that they live in a safe place, that they have access to education, that they have a routine, that they have some predictability,\" says Prof Pluess.This is rarely certain in areas ravaged by war. Ceasefires break down. Front lines become frozen. The displaced are stuck in camps.'We were dehumanised'Still, those words about a safe place bring to mind my friend Beata and the difference stability made to her life.She was 15 years old when the Rwandan genocide – the worst mass slaughter since the Nazi Holocaust – erupted in 1994. Up to 800,000 people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority, were massacred over a period of 100 days.As a reporter I travelled on the convoy that evacuated dozens of orphaned children - Beata Umubyeyi Mairesse among them - through roadblocks manned by the murderous Interahamwe militia. It was a terrifying experience, but especially for the children whose families had been killed.From roadblock to roadblock, we did not know if the machete-wielding gangs would attack.Years later when she was researching her experiences (later published in a book, The Convoy), Beata got in touch. I remember being struck by her composure and openness. She is married with two children, lives in France and is now a successful writer.\"The first thing that helped me was exile to France, leaving the scene of the genocide. I found myself safe, in a peaceful place, with shelter, a foster family who took care of all my material needs, and the opportunity to see a psychologist. I went back to school in September, and that helped me too.\"VCG via Getty ImagesMirrorpix/Getty ImagesLiaison/ Getty ImagesGlobal conflicts that have affected millions of children - in 1994, up to 800,000 people were massacred in Rwanda over a period of 100 days Beata was joined by her mother who also survived. Her father had died before the slaughter.Composed as she was, there were lingering terrors. She panicked one night when classical music was played on the radio – similar to music played on Rwandan radio the night the genocide began. Fireworks or the sound of hunters shooting sent her hiding under a desk in class \"because I thought war had broken out in France\".I wondered if she makes a conscious effort to protect her children from the traumatic inheritance of genocide. \"There are things that are difficult to tell your children, how we were dehumanised, how I was almost raped. The term 'unspeakable' makes sense when passing on stories to children. We are afraid of contaminating them with our trauma.\"But for Beata, nuance is vital. \"Their only image of Rwanda should not be the genocide. I told them stories from my childhood and every time I went there I brought them back fruit so that they could also discover a country full of flavour.\"Although she lives a full and happy life, Beata still suffers from anxiety and takes anti-depressants to deal with insomnia. I also use medication, and like Beata I do not see it as a burden or a stigma. Rather I count myself fortunate to be able to access care and medicine.Fergal Keane (second from right) in Rwanda after the genocideCreating a safe community is also seen as critical by many experts.\"They're not just victims of mental health,\" says Prof Pluess. \"They're little people with interests and that's why they need to go to school, they need to have opportunities to play together - and that might be as important as dealing with the mental health problems that they're facing.\"Psychologists working in Gaza are well aware of these needs. Davide Musardo, who volunteered with Medecins Sans Frontieres, has written of trying to provide therapy against the background of drones and explosions.\"In Gaza, one survives but the exposure to trauma is constant. Everything is missing, even the idea of a future. For people, the greatest anguish is not of today — the bombs, the fighting, and the mourning — but of the aftermath. There is little confidence about peace and reconstruction, and the children I saw in the hospital showed clear signs of regression.\"It is possible, in devastated Gaza, that the current ceasefire will become a permanent peace, allowing rebuilding, and the restoration of family life and schooling. Possible but by no means certain. In Sudan there are attempts to re-start talks about peace but little optimism for their outcome. The war in Ukraine, and many other wars grind on every day.Trauma is as old as war itself. Politicians, journalists, and experts looking to the aftermath of a conflict often ask, \"What will happen when the killing stops?\" But somewhere else the killing will continue. That is the relentless tragedy of children caught in wars they did not start, over which they have no control. For all the knowledge gained about treating trauma, humanity is far from dealing with its root cause – war itself.Additional reporting by Harriet WhiteheadTop picture credit: EPA/ShutterstockMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery had an unhappy 18-month spell in charge of Arsenal that ended in 2019, but can he get the better of his old club on Tuesday?\"After the abuse he took from Arsenal fans, I'd love nothing more than Emery to go back to the Emirates and win,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\"He absolutely didn't deserve that. Some of those fans should take a long, hard look at themselves for the way they mocked him. I hope Villa go there and spank them, just because of that.\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.For week 19 - which includes the final games of 2025 on Tuesday, 30 December and the first matches of 2026 on New Year's Day - he takes on singer-songwriter Tom A Smith, who is a Sunderland fan.Smith's latest EP, Say What You Want, is out now. It reached number 14 in the UK record store charts at the end of November.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, Tom A SmithImage caption, Smith has played Glastonbury and BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend, and supported acts such as Sam Fender, Catfish and the Bottlemen and Elton John, who hand-picked him to open his Hyde Park show in 2022Smith is from Houghton-le-Spring, a town just outside Sunderland, and is a lifelong Black Cats fan who is enjoying seeing his side emerge as this season's surprise package.\"My word, it has just been amazing,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It's such a brilliant time to be a Sunderland fan, and also to be from Sunderland.\"I was saying this last season as well, because before then it had been such a long time since I felt so excited before the game every week, where I cannot wait for kick-off.\"Most of the time when I was growing up, it was the opposite. It was absolutely horrible then, but it could not be more different now.\"All you need to do is walk around the city, and go round Keel Square, and you can just feel how much of a buzz there is because of how well the team is doing. Culturally, it is having a massive impact on the city and everyone is in such good spirits all the time - everywhere is thriving.\"Sunderland have been playing Smith's songs at the Stadium of Light since they were still in the Championship, and he says hearing them at games is \"an incredible feeling\".\"Pretty much most matchdays I hear my songs come on now which is amazing,\" he added.\"Back in the Championship a couple of years ago I did notice that every time we got beaten one of my songs played at the end - thankfully they play it when we win now as well!\"Chris Sutton and Tom A Smith were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.Premier League predictionsTuesday, 30 DecemberTurf Moor, 19:30 GMTBurnley have drawn their past two games but they really need a win because they are a little adrift at the bottom, six points from safety.Scott Parker is under a bit of pressure and a few of their fans have called up 606, saying they want a change. I still think they have been competitive, though, even if they have not beaten anyone since 26 October.Newcastle could do with a victory as well, though. They are a strange side because they have been playing quite well but not really getting results. I keep backing them to win, so it is costing me too.I am not going to stop, though. I am going for a rare away win for Eddie Howe's side - and this time they will keep a clean sheet.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Tom's prediction: Burnley have picked up a couple of good points over Christmas but, as tough as it is for me to say this, Newcastle will probably have a little bit too much for them. 0-3AI's prediction: 1-2Stamford Bridge, 19:30Chelsea are fifth but they are on a sticky run at the moment, with only one win in six league games.When they got their draw with 10 men against Arsenal at the end of November, I thought they were in the title race, but they have completely fallen away.Bournemouth's poor run of results goes back even further, however. After climbing to second place at the end of October, they have not won any of their past nine matches.It is a concerning time for their manager, Andoni Iraola, because this might be Antoine Semenyo's last game for the Cherries. Maybe losing three of their first-choice defenders in the summer - Dean Huijsen (to Real Madrid), Milos Kerkez (to Liverpool), and Illia Zabarnyi (to Paris St-Germain) is catching up with them too.I am not sure what is going wrong for the Cherries because they are still so aggressive in the way they press and play, but they are conceding a lot of goals and Brentford played right through them in the first half at the weekend.It is only because West Ham have been so rotten that Bournemouth are still nine points clear of the relegation zone. I still always think Iraola's side will score, but I am backing Enzo Maresca's side to win the battle of two very patchy teams.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Tom's prediction: Bournemouth started the season so well and they have got a really exciting team with players like Semenyo. Everyone is trying to sign him at the moment but when he spent a few months on loan with Sunderland in League One in 2020 I must admit I didn't think too much of him.The Cherries are struggling for form and this is a tough game for them. Chelsea have been a bit shaky recently too but I'd still back them to win this at Stamford Bridge. 2-1AI's prediction: 2-1City Ground, 19:30Everton beat Nottingham Forest comfortably at the start of December, but that was with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Iliman Ndiaye and Jack Grealish in their team.It's possible Grealish is back from a virus to play in this game, but Dewsbury-Hall and Ndiaye will be much missed and we saw how much it affected Everton's firepower when they played without all three of them in their draw at Burnley.Forest were very good against Manchester City on Saturday and will feel they should have got something out of that game.Sean Dyche was unhappy with City's winner but, watching it back, you could see Morgan Gibbs-White hooked his leg around Nico O'Reilly and tried to drag him down with him, so it was good refereeing to suss that out and not give the foul to Forest.Even so, it was an impressive Forest display. Because of that, and because of who Everton will be missing, I am backing Dyche to get the better of his old team this time.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Tom's prediction: I've been surprised by Forest's drop-off in form this season and it just shows how European football can affect teams when they don't have a big enough squad - that's the one thing that worries me about Sunderland next season when we are in the Champions League! Sorry, I'm maybe getting a bit carried away there!Anyway, I am backing Forest to win this one at home. Everton have got a good side but they can sometimes struggle going forward - they need a centre-forward. 1-0AI's prediction: 1-1London Stadium, 19:30Things are turning uglier by the week for West Ham. They are in a real relegation battle now, and their boss Nuno Espirito Santo is absolutely desperate for a win, but it is hard to see where it will come from.Brighton are inconsistent but they have shown their quality by pushing Liverpool and Arsenal close in recent weeks. I don't see anything other than a Seagulls victory here.The Hammers are so low on confidence that even if this is a tight game, you get the feeling they will lose it, like they did against Fulham on Saturday.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Tom's prediction: If Brighton show up, they can beat anyone but they are just a little bit too inconsistent. West Ham are struggling but again I am going with the home team here.I don't think the Hammers will go down, either. They have got to find some form but, if they do, they have got too much quality for that to happen. 2-1AI's prediction: 2-2Emirates Stadium, 20:15I love what Villa are doing. You just keep thinking their winning run can't continue, which is why I had Chelsea down to beat them - and, again, I was wrong about that.Villa have the most points (18)  from losing positions in the Premier League this season and they just do not lie down.We saw that again against Chelsea, who pummelled them for an hour before Watkins came on to make it 11 Villa wins in a row.It was only this time last year that Arsenal put a bid in for Watkins, who supports them as well, but he stayed at Villa and if you were writing a script you would have him down as getting the winner again here.Even so, I just have a feeling Arsenal will find a way to win this. I am expecting the Gunners to find another gear or two very soon, but this might be more of a battle for them, that they have to get through.There will be some nervy moments for Mikel Arteta's side again, that's for sure, but I reckon they will hang on for the win, just about.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Tom's prediction: Wow, what a game this is. It is incredible that Villa just keep on winning and Morgan Rogers is such a fantastic player. Other than someone like Erling Haaland, if I could have any player for Sunderland at the moment, it would probably be him.Arsenal have to keep winning games to hold off City, but I can see them dropping points here. I think Pep Guardiola's side will win the league, too. The thing with Arsenal is that they do get nervy and you can see them having a dip, and drawing games like this. I don't see that with City now. 2-2AI's prediction: 2-0Old Trafford, 20:15Lots of Manchester United fans had a pop at me, again, for my negativity about their team before they played Newcastle United.I know Ruben Amorim's side proved me wrong by winning that game, but I think those fans would have to admit it was a very negative performance.Despite that, I am going to back United to win this week - so maybe that will bring some positivity back to the team, too. They need it.If it were down to me, though, I would relegate Wolves now and just chop them out of the league. They are more lambs than wolves at the moment and to have only picked up two points from 18 games is absolutely pathetic.They are still scrapping to get something for Rob Edwards but they are desperately poor.Edwards has lost all seven of his games since taking charge and has only seen his side score three goals. Surely he wishes he had stayed at Middlesbrough?Sutton's prediction: 2-0Tom's prediction: I really struggle to see Wolves picking up any points, whoever they play. They just lack so much quality and confidence too. United will have far too much for them. 3-0AI's prediction: 2-1Thursday, 1JanuarySelhurst Park, 17:30Crystal Palace have lost three league games in a row, while Fulham have won three in a row.It's not long since I was concerned Fulham could be getting dragged into a relegation scrap, but they are looking up the table now and are level on points with Palace after moving into the top half.I watched Palace's defeat against Tottenham on Sunday and they just looked knackered, but they still created some chances and were unlucky not to take something from the game.On form, you'd go with Fulham again here but I actually think Palace will deal with them much better than West Ham did.The Eagles could do with getting a break, as in a mid-season break, but they just need a bit of luck in front of goal too and they will be back to winning ways.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Tom's prediction: Fulham are decent and seem to stay in every game, but I am going with Palace here. On their day, they are one of the best sides in the league. 1-0AI's prediction: 1-1Anfield, 17:30I correctly backed Leeds to get a point when these sides met Elland Road a few weeks back, but this is at Anfield and, besides that, Liverpool look a lot more confident now.This is a different Leeds, too, of course. They have got real belief at the moment and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has scored seven goals in six games, is going to be hard to stop.But Florian Wirtz seems to be coming to the fore for Liverpool now and they are building their confidence back up.Arne Slot's side are back up to fourth place and although when you watch them you can see they have still got weaknesses in their team, I'm expecting them to make it four league wins in a row here.It is not actually impossible that they could be back in the title race soon, either. After this game, Slot's side travel to Fulham and Arsenal next week so let's see where they are then.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Tom's prediction: This finished 3-3 at Elland Road and it was an amazing game. Leeds have found a system that works and Calvert-Lewin keeps scoring goals, but it feels like Liverpool are starting to find a bit of form again at Anfield. 3-1AI's prediction: 3-1Gtech Community Stadium, 20:00Spurs have got the best away record in the Premier League again, thanks to their win at Crystal Palace on Sunday that saw them climb to 11th place, but Brentford are absolutely flying at home too.So, how do I call this one? Let's be honest, Spurs are not an attractive team to watch at the moment, and they are very stuffy and scrappy whether they win or not.Their form on the road will probably give Thomas Frank a bit of confidence going back to his old club, and he will get a good reception there, I am sure of that.But Brentford have snuck up to eighth after taking seven points from their past three games, and they won't lack belief either.Anyone can beat anyone in this part of the table, which doesn't help me when it comes to making a prediction. I can't pick a winner here, so I am going for a draw.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Tom's prediction: I saw Jordan Henderson make his debut for Sunderland and he deserves more recognition. He is up there with Granit Xhaka as one of the signings of the season, because of his influence on Brentford.The Bees are a good side, especially at home, but Thomas Frank and Spurs need something here. I don't think they will win it, though. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-2Stadium of Light, 20:00City did not have it all their own way when they beat Sunderland at Etihad Stadium, but they dismantled them in the end and they are capable of doing the same at the Stadium of Light.It is hard to see anyone stopping City at the moment, really. Rayan Cherki is a big talent, and with such quick feet. Phil Foden almost scored against Forest on Saturday, and when Haaland draws a blank, like he did in that game, you know a goal is not far away.Still, Sunderland have the aggression that saw them rattle Arsenal and they are so well organised defensively too.That's why they still haven't lost at home this season, and I feel bad for writing them off so often, but I am sorry to say I am going to do it again.I feel like City have found their flow so I can't back against them, but I am expecting Sunderland to put up one heck of a fight.Sutton's prediction: 1-3Tom's prediction: My heart is telling me one thing, and my head is telling me another!From my heart, this is the sort of game we just win. I don't know if we will, but even just the fact we are at home to City on New Year's Day again really gives me that feeling - I've got very good memories of Ji Dong-won getting our winner against them on 1 January 2012.With my head, though, it is going to be tough. We had chances at the Etihad a few weeks ago but, being realistic, I think we need a full-strength side to get anything from City and we don't have that at the moment because we have lost players to the Africa Cup of Nations.We definitely won't have enough to win the game, but I am never going to say we will get beaten - I can't do that. So, with my fingers crossed, I am going to say we will get our noses ahead but then City will pile on the pressure and I don't see us absorbing it and holding out. 1-1AI's prediction: 0-3How did Sutton do last week?The outcome of week 18, the festive fixtures on 26, 27 & 28 December, went down to the last of the 10 matches, Tottenham's 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace.With only that game left to play, Chris' guest, The Wellermen singer Jonny Stewart, was leading the way on 110 points and could only be beaten by AI, which was 10 points behind him.The BBC readers were another 30 points back and needed an exact score to tie, while Chris was already out of contention, on 50 points.Stewart went for a 2-2 draw, Sutton chose 0-0 and the readers backed Palace to win 2-1 - but it was AI who picked up 10 points by going for a 2-1 Spurs win.That meant AI and Stewart shared the weekly victory - they both got five correct results, including two exact scores, for a tally of 110 points.Chris also got five correct results but with no exact scores for 50 points, while the BBC readers got four correct results with one exact score, leaving them on 70 points.\"I've tried to change the rules so ties aren't worth anything but unfortunately that wasn't allowed,\" Sutton said.\"It means I'm off the top of the table - for now - but I still think I was unlucky with some of my predictions last week.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesOctopus Energy is set to spin off its Kraken Technologies arm as a standalone company after a deal to sell a stake in the platform valued it at $8.65bn (£6.4bn).The energy giant, Britain's biggest gas and electricity supplier, has sold a $1bn stake in the AI-based division to a group of investors led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners.The move paves the way for Kraken to be demerged from Octopus, and for a potential stock market flotation for the business in the future.Octopus founder and chief executive Greg Jackson told the BBC there was \"every chance\" Kraken would list its shares \"in the medium term\",  with the location of the flotation \"between London and the US\". Kraken uses AI to automate customer service and billing for energy companies and can manage when customers use energy, rewarding them for reducing consumption at peak times.It was initially built for use by Octopus but has since picked up a raft of other utilities clients, including EDF, E.On Next, TalkTalk and National Grid US. It now serves 70 million household and business accounts around the world.The majority of the $1bn investment will go to Octopus to fund its expansion, with Kraken receiving the rest. Mr Jackson said Kraken will be operating completely independently of Octopus \"within a few months\".Other investors in the business included Fidelity International and a unit of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, with Octopus maintaining a 13.7% stake in Kraken.Kraken chief executive Amir Orad said the spinoff would give it the \"focus and freedom\" to grow, with the company having previously struggled to do business with Octopus's rivals.Mr Jackson said that for a large tech firm such as Kraken, the location for its share  listing would be either London or the US.\"One thing about Kraken is we've got this global investor base... and so really the stock exchanges have got to kind of show why they are the right one for business.\"A London listing for Kraken's shares would reverse a trend of firms snubbing the UK in favour of floating in the US.Mr Jackson said Octopus had created 12,000 jobs in the UK, with 1,500 of these attributed to Kraken.He said the company would keep its headquarters in the UK, and that \"if London can be the right place to list, I would love that\".\"But it's down to be where you're going to get the most investor support and the most support from the stock exchange.\"The demerger comes amid the continued growth of Octopus Energy, which overtook British Gas to become the UK's largest energy supplier earlier this year, serving 7.7 million households.But it confirmed this year it was one of three retail energy firms that had not yet met regulator Ofgem's financial resilience targets.Octopus said the cash injection would \"almost double Octopus Energy Group's already strong balance sheet\".The deal was announced as Octopus published its results for the year to April, revealing it made a £260m loss before tax, compared with a £78m pre-tax profit a year earlier.That came despite overall sales rising by a tenth to £13.7bn. Octopus took a hit from lower energy demand due to warmer weather and the ending of energy crisis allowance payments in 2024.It said warmer weather hit profits by around £103m, blaming the UK's hottest spring on record since 1885, which saw gas usage slump by 11% in March and 25% in April.",

Some rural communities could also be cut off according to the Met Office.By the end of this week temperatures will be up to 3-5C at best with some parts of Scotland and northern England experiencing 'ice-days' where temperatures don't rise above freezing.More significant snow?Elsewhere across the UK there will be widespread overnight frosts and an increasing risk of snow showers affecting parts of Northern Ireland, northern England and North Wales by the end of this week.Meanwhile, the snow showers across Northern Scotland will continue into the weekend.Further snow and ice warnings are likely to be issued by the Met Office in the coming days, which you can keep up to date with here.Away from the snow showers there will be lots of crisp winter sunshine.With the colder weather expected to last into next week, forecasters are keeping an eye on a weather system that could bring more widespread snow even across England and Wales on Tuesday.As this is still a long way off in weather forecasting, stay up to date with the latest forecast on the BBC Weather website or app as details are likely to change.",

    "body": "15 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesScroll through social media and you'd be forgiven for thinking saunas and cold plunges are close to a miracle cure, boosting immunity, burning fat and fixing everything from sore joints to low mood.But the reality, experts say, is more nuanced.\"There are a lot of people who swear by hot and cold exposure, but we don't yet have sufficient evidence to say it's categorically good for you,\" says Dr Heather Massey, associate professor of extreme environments and physiology at the University of Portsmouth.She explains our bodies are \"incredible\" at keeping core temperature stable, usually between about 36.5C and 37C.In everyday life, many of us rarely challenge that system, spending long periods in heated or air-conditioned spaces.Heating or cooling the body creates a small stress, she says, which may trigger adaptive or protective responses.The science behind the saunaThat idea underpins the appeal of saunas, which nowadays at gyms and spas are rarely empty.  For some people it's a reward after exercise while for others, it's the main attraction and many regulars swear by it, convinced that 15 minutes of intense heat does wonders for their body and mind. And there's no doubt it can feel good.\"When you sit in a sauna and work up a sweat, you may feel looser, freer, a bit more mobile and your aches and pains may resolve themselves a bit,\" Dr Massey tells BBC's What's Up Docs podcast.\"So there's definitely some benefit to using the sauna but the question is whether that's a long-term health benefit or more of a psychological one.\"Getty ImagesDr Massey explains that a recent study put people repeatedly in hot tubs and the results showed changes in insulin and blood pressure.\"We're starting to explore whether heating the body could help people living with lifelong conditions.\"Still, she urges caution when it comes to bold health claims as robust scientific evidence is still limited.\"We've never really done a proper sauna trial,\" she says. \"I suspect we'll find benefits in the future, but we're not there yet.\"For now, she says, it's reasonable to enjoy the ritual for how it makes you feel, without assuming it's a guaranteed shortcut to better health.And if you do try saunas or hot tubs, Dr Massey advises caution, \"ease yourself in gradually\" and check with your GP first if you have any underlying health conditions or are pregnant.What about cold water swimming?Some people like to push things in the opposite direction. Cold-water swimming groups are growing in popularity, with early-morning dips now a familiar sight at beaches, lakes and rivers.Dr Massey, who has swum the channel and competed in the world ice-swimming championships, goes cold-water swimming once a week but only spends a couple of minutes in the water. She finds it \"painful\" at first, but that initial shock is exactly what people are chasing.\"When you first immerse, you get an involuntary gasp and rapid breathing,\" she explains. Heart rate and blood pressure jump and stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline surge. \"That response peaks at about 30 seconds and then drops away very quickly,\" she adds.Repeated exposure reduces the shock response and after several short swims, it can be cut by around 50%.As with saunas, the big question is whether the benefits come from the temperature itself, or everything wrapped around it.Cold-water swimming is usually done outdoors and with others. \"It's an activity with multiple mechanisms - nature, movement and social connection and they are all interlinked,\" Dr Massey says.Podcast host Dr Chris van Tulleken agrees it's difficult to separate those factors: \"We don't know if the benefit is the cold water itself or being with a group of fun people and doing something challenging together.\"Find something you enjoyFor Dr Massey, though, the starting point isn't temperature at all, but enjoyment.\"I speak to people who do Parkrun every week, and describe exactly the same kind of buzz as other people get from cold water swimming,\" she says.\"What matters is finding something you enjoy, can do regularly, and ideally can share with others, as building a friendship group around an activity can reduce psychological stress.\"That could be anything from gardening, birdwatching, joining a choir or simply walking with friends. So even if saunas and cold swims are not essential for good health, says Dr Massey, they may still offer something positive.Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "8 hours agoHelen Catt,Political correspondentandIan AikmanSayed Hassan/Getty ImagesForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper has launched a review into what she calls \"serious information failures\" in the case of British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah. In a letter to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Cooper said she, Sir Keir Starmer and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy \"were all unaware\" of Mr Abd El Fattah's historical tweets, which they consider to be \"abhorrent\".It comes after the Conservatives and Reform UK called for the activist to be stripped of UK citizenship and deported after social media posts emerged in which he called for Zionists to be killed.Mr Abd El Fattah has apologised, saying he understood \"how shocking and hurtful\" the posts were.Sir Keir Starmer has been criticised for saying he was \"delighted\" by Mr Abd El Fattah's arrival in the UK on Friday, three months after the democracy activist was freed from prison in Egypt.On Monday, Sir Keir said the resurfaced tweets were \"absolutely abhorrent\" and said the government was \"taking steps to review the information failures in this case\".\"With the rise of antisemitism, and recent horrific attacks, I know this has added to the distress of many in the Jewish community in the UK,\" he added.Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick, who led the criticism of Sir Keir's welcome for Mr Abd El Fattah, swiftly responded by renewing his call for the activist to be removed from the UK. On Monday evening, Reform UK said that it would change the law to ensure Mr Abd El Fattah could be stripped of his British citizenship and deported.The party's leader, Nigel Farage, said previous Conservative and Labour governments had \"opened our doors to evil people\".In her letter to the Foreign Affairs committee, Cooper said work started over the weekend revealed that previous foreign secretaries and prime ministers had made public statements on Mr Abd El Fattah's case \"without all relevant information\".She added that current and former ministers were \"never briefed on these tweets when they spoke publicly about the case\", and the civil servants in charge of the case \"were also unaware\" of them.Cooper said it was clear there had been an \"unacceptable failure\" and that longstanding due diligence procedures had been \"completely inadequate for this situation\".The foreign secretary added she was \"deeply concerned\" that the re-emergence of these tweets, alongside social media posts welcoming Mr Abd El Fattah's return posted by her and other members of the government, had \"added to the distress felt by Jewish communities in the UK and I very much regret that\".She told the committee she had asked the most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office to review the \"serious information failures in this case\" and the broader systems that were in place in the department for carrying out due diligence on high-profile consular and human rights cases to make sure they were working properly and that \"all necessary lessons are learned\".Former head of the UK Foreign Office, Lord Ricketts, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think where the inquiry need to look at, is in these cases where ministers are going to get involved, where officials are going to ask ministers to lobby on behalf of dual nationals then probably there should be background checks, there should be due diligence to try and avoid some of the problems that have cropped up in the last few days.\"In one resurfaced tweet, from 2012, Mr Abd El Fattah appears to say: \"I am a racist, I don't like white people\". In another, he appears to say he considers \"killing any colonialists and specially Zionists heroic, we need to kill more of them\".He is also accused of saying police do not have rights and \"we should kill them all\".Earlier on Monday, Mr Abd El Fattah \"unequivocally\" apologised for the tweets.He said he took allegations of antisemitism \"very seriously\" while arguing some of the posts had been \"completely twisted out of their meaning\".He added: \"I am shaken that, just as I am being reunited with my family for the first time in 12 years, several historic tweets of mine have been republished and used to question and attack my integrity and values, escalating to calls for the revocation of my citizenship.\"Mr Abd El Fattah 's sister Mona Seif described the situation as a \"never ending nightmare\".\"There is something incredibly heartbreaking and infuriating to be witnessing this vile campaign against him - and our family - with people portraying him as something completely opposite to who he really is, and while he paid a steep price for his convictions,\" she wrote on X.The Foreign Office said it had been \"a long-standing priority under successive governments\" to work for Mr Abd El Fattah's release.The 44-year-old was convicted in 2021 of \"spreading fake news\" in Egypt for sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.He was granted British citizenship in December 2021 through his London-born mother, when the Conservatives were in power.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp, who was an immigration minister until September 2021, said he was not aware of Mr Abd El Fattah's tweets at that time, but he now believed the activist \"should have his citizenship revoked\".\"There is no excuse for what he wrote,\" Philp told the Today programme on Monday.On the same programme, Labour's Dame Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Foreign Affairs committee, accused Philp of \"throwing ideas around that were just not based in law\".\"The bottom and top of it is that he [Mr Abd El Fattah] is a British citizen,\" she said.\"He was entitled to British citizenship, he claimed it, so he is a British citizen. The British government has been doing their utmost to get him back into the country and out of jail.\"A government source said Mr Abd El Fatteh arrived in the country as a British citizen and there were no legal avenues available to block his entry, even if officials had been aware of his previous social media posts.It is understood that Downing Street believes there is a high bar to someone having their citizenship revoked because they must have either obtained citizenship by fraud or be deemed to pose a significant national security threat - a test unlikely to be met in this case.On Monday, the PM's official spokesman said: \"We welcome the return of a British citizen unfairly detained abroad, as we would in all cases and as we have done in the past.\"\"That said, it doesn't change the fact that we have condemned the nature of these historic tweets, and we consider them to be abhorrent, and we've been very clear about that.\"A writer and software developer, Mr Abd El Fattah rose to prominence during a 2011 uprising that forced the former Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to resign.He has spent more than a decade of his life behind bars and his release in September after a presidential pardon followed a long campaign by his family and lobbying by the British government.In October, he said he was \"learning how to get back into life\" in an interview with the BBC from Cairo.",

    "body": "Saudi Arabia has backed a demand from Yemen's presidential council for the United Arab Emirates to withdraw within 24 hours, after a Saudi-led coalition bombed what it said was a weapons shipment for UAE-backed separatists at the port of Mukalla.The Saudi foreign ministry accused the UAE of \"pressuring\" the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks independence for southern Yemen, to launch recent offensives in the eastern provinces of Hadramawt and al-Mahra.The kingdom would take measures to confront what it considered such \"highly dangerous\" actions, it warned.The UAE's foreign ministry denied that the shipment contained weapons and expressed \"deep regret\" at the Saudi statement.It strongly condemned \"the allegations that it exerted pressure on, or directed, any Yemeni party to carry out military operations that would undermine the security of the sisterly kingdom of Saudi Arabia or target its borders\".The STC's leaders also said the ultimatum for the withdrawal of the UAE's forces had no legal basis, and insisted it would remain a \"main partner\" in the battle against the Iran-backed Houthi movement, which controls much of north-western Yemen.Earlier on Monday, the head of the eight-member presidential council - which includes STC representatives - announced that he was cancelling a joint defence pact with the UAE and ordering its forces to leave \"in the interest of safeguarding the security of all citizens, affirming commitment to Yemen's unity, sovereignty, stability, and territorial integrity\".Rashad al-Alimi also declared a state of emergency for a period of 90 days, which he said was necessary to confront the Houthis and what he described as \"the internal strife led by mutinous military elements that received orders from the United Arab Emirates\".Alimi's announcement came after the spokesman of the Saudi-led coalition - which includes the UAE - said it had carried out a \"limited\" air strike on weapons and military vehicles for the STC's forces in the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla which arrived on two ships from the UAE.The shipments had constituted \"an imminent threat and an escalation that threatens peace and stability\", Maj-Gen Turki al-Maliki asserted.An official at the port told AFP news agency that a warning to evacuate was received at 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT) and that an open area at the facility was struck about 15 minutes later.Pictures of the aftermath showed a number of burned out military vehicles and pick-up trucks parked in a walled-off area at the port, as well as damage to a nearby building. No casualties were reported.The UAE's foreign ministry said it had been surprised by the strike on Mukalla and that the coalition statement had been issued without consultation with member states.It insisted that the shipment in question \"did not include any weapons, and that the vehicles unloaded were not intended for any Yemeni party but were shipped for use by Emirati forces operating in Yemen\".On Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition called on the STC's forces to withdraw \"peacefully\" from Hadramawt and al-Mahra, a day after the Saudi air force reportedly bombed positions held by the separatists in the Wadi Nahab area of Hadramawt.The STC's forces launched offensives in the two provinces amid rising tensions earlier this month, putting in direct conflict with government forces.It said the operations were necessary to \"restore stability\" in the south and to combat the Houthis, as well as the jihadist groups al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS).Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that began in 2014, when the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from the capital Sanaa. The conflict escalated in 2015, after the Saudi-led coalition of Arab states intervened to restore the government's rule.The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.At the start of the war, the STC and other separatists seeking independence for south Yemen, which was a separate country before unification with the north in 1990, formed an uneasy alliance with the government to stop the Houthis capturing the southern city of Aden.However, in recent years the STC and its allies have turned on the government and seized control of Aden and much of the south of the country.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorCharly Hel/Prestige/Getty ImagesBrigitte Bardot died on Sunday aged 91 and had long shunned the limelight, preferring the company of animalsFrench right-wing figure Éric Ciotti has called for a national tribute to honour film legend Brigitte Bardot, prompting objections from political opponents on the left.\"France has a duty to honour its Marianne,\" said Ciotti, referring to the emblem of French liberty whose face Bardot was chosen to represent in the 1960s.Bardot died on Sunday aged 91. A petition launched by Ciotti since has attracted more than 23,000 signatures, and has the backing of some allies on the far right.But Socialist leader Olivier Faure has pointed out that national homages are for \"exceptional services to the nation\". Bardot was an iconic actress but she also \"turned her back on republican values\", Faure argued.Bardot has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as a \"legend of the century\" who embodied a life of freedom, and Ciotti, who leads the right-wing UDR party, has appealed to him to organise a national send-off.  Ciotti said France should recognise a woman who brought her country an extraordinary level of international recognition and actively helped in the fight for  women's liberty and abortion rights.Meanwhile, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, has announced that his city will name an \"iconic site\" in Bardot's honour. But Bardot is destined to remain controversial in death as she was during her life. Faure pointed out that she had been convicted five times for inciting racial hatred.Bardot starred in some 50 films, after bursting on to the scene in And God Created Woman in 1956. She then left the world of cinema in 1973 for a life devoted to animal welfare, and lived for decades in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, at her home called La Madrague.But she became as well known for her far-right sympathies as she was for her love of animals. Some of her remarks targeted Muslims, and others insulted the people of the French Indian Ocean island of Réunion.\"To be moved by the plight of dolphins and yet be indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean - what degree of cynicism is that?\" asked Green MP Sandrine Rousseau on social media.There are differing types of national tribute in France. Robert Badinter, who abolished the death penalty in France, was honoured with a national homage in the form of a solemn ceremony in 2024, as was singer Charles Aznavour in 2018. A more likely option for Bardot would be along the lines of the public farewell given to rock star Johnny Hallyday, when large crowds lined the streets of Paris in 2017.Not everyone on the left is opposed to the idea of a national homage to Bardot.\"Why not? We've done it for other figures, particularly Johnny Hallyday,\" Socialist MP Philippe Brun told French radio. \"If the president of the republic decides on it, I don't see why we should oppose it.\"MIGUEL MEDINA/AFPBardot will be buried near her family's graves in the marine cemetery in Saint-TropezBardot herself had shunned the limelight for decades and close friend Wendy Bouchard said she was not remotely interested in medals and ceremonies.\"It probably comes from a good place, but I'm not sure that she, who lived a life of simplicity and deprivation, would have wanted this national homage,\" she told French TV.Journalist Steven Bellery, who interviewed Bardot earlier this year, agreed she wanted something far more simple and intimate.Bardot had asked to be buried at her Riviera home at La Madrague, rather than in a public cemetery, where she feared \"a crowd of idiots might damage the graves of my parents and grandparents\".However, the town hall in Saint-Tropez has said she will have a private burial in the public cemetery that overlooks the Mediterranean as well as her home.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which is dedicated to animal welfare, says her funeral will take place on 7 January at the Notre-Dame de l'Assomption church and will be broadcast on screens across the town.",

    "body": "18 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterThe oldest surviving victim of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has been appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to justice after campaigning against wrongful prosecutions.Betty Brown, 92, ran the Annfield Plain Post Office in County Durham with her late husband Oswall from 1985. But they were forced out in 2003 after spending more than £50,000 of their savings to cover non-existent shortfalls.She recently received her long-awaited settlement from one of the government's compensation schemes.Mrs Brown told BBC Breakfast she accepted the recognition in the New Year Honours list on behalf of all the victims of the scandal.\"Every one of them should have an OBE,\" she said. \"Every one of them for what they've [Post Office] put us through and what we have stood solid and faithful for. I did it for justice.\"The Horizon IT system was responsible for more than 900 sub-postmasters being wrongfully prosecuted because of it providing incorrect information. Thousands more, like Mrs Brown, were forced to make up for the alleged losses at their branches across the UK.The scandal has been described as one of the widest miscarriages of justice in the UK.Mrs Brown said she was \"honoured and humbled\" to be made an OBE, adding she had finally \"been heard by the system\".Mrs Brown is not the first Post Office campaigner to be recognised in the New Year Honours list. A year ago four former sub-postmasters turned campaigners were honoured for their services to justice, and Sir Alan Bates - who was featured in the ITV drama \"Mr Bates vs The Post Office\" - was knighted in 2024.The 92-year-old was one of the original 555 victims who took part in the landmark group legal action led by Sir Alan against the Post Office.Her branch had been one of the most successful in the region but eventually she had to sell it at a loss.Talking about what happened, she previously said it \"absolutely destroyed my whole life\".Both Mrs Brown and Sir Alan were part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, and those claimants were offered the option of taking a fixed sum of £75,000 or pursuing their own settlement.After receiving her payout in November 2025, she told the BBC: \"At last, after 26 years, they've recognised justice,\" and added: \"pity they took so long.\"A government spokesperson said: \"We must never lose sight of the Horizon scandal's human impact on postmasters and their families, which the Horizon inquiry has highlighted so well.\"Betty Brown has been a fierce advocate for postmasters and this government has now paid out over £1.3bn to more than 10,000 victims.When the first report of the official inquiry into the scandal was published in July, the Post Office said it apologised \"unreservedly\" for the suffering \"caused to postmasters and their loved ones\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoAmy WalkerEPAPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has denied allegations by Russia that Ukraine launched a drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences, and accused Moscow of trying to derail peace talks. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Kyiv had launched an attack over Sunday night using 91 long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on Putin's state residence in Russia's northwestern Novgorod region.Russia said it would now review its position in peace negotiations. It is not yet clear where Putin was at the time of the alleged attack.Zelensky dismissed the claim as \"typical Russian lies\", intended to give the Kremlin an excuse to continue attacks on Ukraine. He said that Russia had previously targeted government buildings in Kyiv, and warned that its latest claim could signal further strikes on Ukraine.\"Everyone must be vigilant now. Absolutely everyone. A strike may be launched on the capital,\" Zelensky told journalists on Monday, adding that Russia's comments were a \"threat\".He said Russia was \"looking for reasons\" to continue its attacks on Ukraine and that it saw progress towards a ceasefire as a \"failure\".Zelensky added on X: \"It is critical that the world doesn't stay silent now. We cannot allow Russia to undermine the work on achieving a lasting peace.\"In a statement shared on Telegram on Monday, Lavrov said all of the 91 drones he claimed were launched at Putin's residence were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defence systems.He added that there were no reports of casualties or damage as a result of the attack.\"Given the final degeneration of the criminal Kyiv regime, which has switched to a policy of state terrorism, Russia's negotiating position will be revised,\" he said.But he added that Russia did not intend to exit the negotiating process with the US, Russian news agency Tass reported.On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it would not provide evidence for the alleged strike, with a spokesman telling journalists that Russia would now \"toughen\" its negotiating stance.Ukraine's foreign minister called on other countries to refrain from responding to Russia's \"false claims\".\"Almost a day passed, and Russia still hasn't provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine's alleged 'attack on Putin's residence'. And they won't. Because there's none. No such attack happened,\" Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X.Moscow's claim comes after talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida on Sunday, where Presidents Trump and Zelensky discussed a revised peace plan to end the war.Following the meeting, Zelensky told Fox News on Monday that there was a \"possibility to finish this war\" in 2026.But he said Ukraine could not win the war without US support.\"My feelings of President Trump's sanctions and economical steps, shows that he's ready for very strong steps,\" Zelensky said. \"In this situation, the United States can move the situation to peace quicker.\"The Ukrainian president told Fox News there was no indication that Putin wanted peace and that he did not trust Putin.\"I don't trust Putin and he doesn't want success for Ukraine,\" Zelensky added.Zelensky said the US had offered Ukraine security guarantees for 15 years, and Trump said an agreement on this point was \"close to 95%\" done.Ukraine's leader described territorial issues and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as the last unresolved matters, and there was little sign of progress on the future of Ukraine's contested Donbas region - which Russia wants to seize in full.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Russia has previously rejected key parts of the plan under discussion.The White House said on Monday that President Trump had \"concluded a positive call\" with Putin, following the US-Ukraine talks. Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy aide, told reporters on Monday that during the call, Putin had pointed out the alleged attack on his residence happened \"almost straight after what the US had considered to be a successful round of talks\".Ushakov said: \"The US president was shocked by this information, he was angry and said he couldn't believe such mad actions. It was stated that this will no doubt affect the US approach to working with Zelensky\".During a later press conference, Trump initially appeared to say he did not know about the alleged incident, but later told reporters that he was told about it by Putin and was \"very angry\" about it. Asked if the US had seen any evidence supporting Russia's claim, he responded: \"Well we'll find out. You're saying maybe the attack didn't take place - that's possible too, I guess. But President Putin told me this morning it did\". More on this story",

Has Donald Trump changed his mind on the Epstein Files?AmericastAvailable for over a yearOn Sunday night Donald Trump told Republicans in the House of Representatives to vote in favour of releasing files relating to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “because we have nothing to hide”. It’s a striking change in position from the president who has so far resisted pressure from Democrats and Republicans in his own party who have been demanding that all files relating to Epstein be released into the public domain. \nOne of the Republicans calling for their release is the conservative firebrand and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was once one of Trump’s most faithful supporters. After stepping up her demands to see the files released, she now appears to have lost the president’s backing who called her a “traitor” and a “disgrace” to the Republican Party. We answer your questions on why the pair have fallen out.\nAnd, we answer your questions on why there’s been another presidential pardon, this time for the UK billionaire Joe Lewis, whose family trust owns Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.

    "body": "Hewlett Packard (HP) is seeking $1.7bn (£1.3bn) from the estate of Mike Lynch - who died last year when his yacht sank - over HP's acquisition of his firm Autonomy, the tech giant's lawyers have told the High Court.HP, now known as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), bought Mr Lynch's tech firm Autonomy in 2011, but it says Mr Lynch and Autonomy's former chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, misrepresented the company's finances.In a 2019 trial, HPE had accused Mr Lynch of inflating Autonomy's revenues which it said forced it to announce an $8.8bn write-down of the company's worth.Mr Justice Hildyard ruled in 2022 that HPE had \"substantially succeeded\" in its claim, but that it was likely to receive \"substantially less\" than the $5bn it sought in damages.Earlier this year, he ruled that HPE suffered losses amounting to around £700m through the purchase of Autonomy.Mr Lynch and his teenage daughter Hannah were among seven passengers and crew who died when the Bayesian went down off the coast of Sicily last August during a storm which caused the vessel to capsize and sink.A hearing in London, which began on Tuesday, will now decide whether Mr Lynch's estate can appeal against the 2022 and 2025 rulings.In written submissions, Patrick Goodall, the barrister representing HPE, argued that Mr Lynch's estate was liable to pay $1.7bn, which includes around $761m in interest.He said that Mr Lynch had \"not only perpetrated an enormous fraud, but lied about it at every stage\".He said the claimants had spent almost £150m on the legal battle, and were seeking nearly £113m of their costs from Mr Lynch's estate.Mr Goodall also said that Mr Lynch's estate should not be allowed to appeal against either the 2022 or 2025 rulings.In written submissions, Richard Hill, the lawyer representing Mr Lynch's estate, said that the $761m in interest sought by the claimants was an \"excessive sum... based on a flawed analysis\" and that the \"legally and economically rational approach would provide for a materially lower figure\".The claimants' position that \"they were the victors in this litigation\" was \"overly simplistic\", he added.Mr Hill also said that Mr Lynch's estate should be allowed to appeal against the two earlier rulings, claiming that the judge \"erred in law\" and that there was a \"compelling reason for allowing the appeal to be heard\".A spokesperson for the Lynch family said: \"Today's hearing addresses technical matters that change nothing about the underlying substance of the case.\"The core facts remain that HP's claim was fundamentally flawed and a wild overstatement.\"In a separate case, Mr Lynch was extradited to the US in 2023 to face criminal charges, and he was cleared of fraud charges in 2024.He was celebrating being acquitted on his yacht when it sank.",

    "body": "11 minutes agoAimee DexterCambridgeshireGetty ImagesEmergency crews and police rushed to Huntingdon Station in Cambridgeshire after 999 calls from the London-bound trainA 32-year-old man accused of stabbing 10 people on a train has been charged with further offences related to the day before the attack.British Transport Police (BTP) said Anthony Williams, of no fixed abode, had been charged with seven other offences, including two counts of attempted murder, after an investigation. Mr Williams is already charged with 10 counts of attempted murder in relation to a mass stabbing on a Doncaster to London King's Cross service on the evening of 1 November, which stopped in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire.BTP said the further charges related to alleged incidents in Peterborough, Stevenage, and on a train travelling between Hitchin and Biggleswade on 31 October.Mr Williams is due to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court later, charged with the following:Attempted murder of a 14-year-old boy at Henry Penn Walk in PeterboroughAttempted grievous bodily harm of a 28-year-old man at Viersen Platz in PeterboroughAttempted murder of a 22-year-old man near Pleasure Fair Meadow Road in PeterboroughAffray and possession of a bladed article in connection to an alleged incident at Ritzy Barbers in PeterboroughTheft of knives from an Asda supermarket in StevenageCommon assault of a 31-year-old man onboard a train travelling between Hitchin and Biggleswade.Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Cundy, for BTP, said the investigation into the Huntingdon incident \"had also focused on other offences previously reported to police or identified by our investigation\".\"We have worked closely with our colleagues in Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Police, alongside the Crown Prosecution Service, to bring these charges,\" he said.Passengers on the 18:25 GMT LNER service on 1 November said a person brandishing a knife began stabbing people after it passed through Peterborough.It was diverted to Huntingdon - an unscheduled stop - which prompted a large emergency response.Mr Williams was previously remanded into custody by Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 3 November in relation to the train stabbing charges, and a count of attempted murder in connection with an alleged attack in London.He is due to appear at Cambridge Crown Court on 1 December in relation to those charges.Related internet links",

    "body": "A portrait by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt was sold for $236.4m (£179m) in New York on Tuesday, making it the second most expensive piece ever sold at auction. Six people took part in a 20-minute bidding battle for the Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer which was painted between 1914 and 1916. Auction house Sotheby's has not disclosed the buyer's identity.The portrait was looted by the Nazis and almost destroyed in a fire in World War Two, but was rescued in 1948. The artwork was returned to Lederer's brother, Erich, a friend and subject of Klimt's contemporary, Egon Schiele. The piece remained in Lederer's possession for most of his life, before he sold it in 1983, according to Sotheby's. The painting shows Lederer, an heiress and the daughter of one of Klimt's patrons, wearing a white robe and standing in front of a blue tapestry covered in Asian motifs. The Nazis, who annexed Austria in 1938, looted the Lederer art collection but left family portraits behind, says the National Gallery of Canada. Estée Lauder heir Leonard A Lauder made it part of his private collection in 1985, where it was displayed in his Fifth Avenue home in New York. Tuesday's sale shot past expectations, with the painting predicted to sell for  $150m before the auction. The second highest sale for a Klimt on record was Lady with a Fan, which sold for $108.8m in 2023 in London. Several other Klimt works in Lauder's collection were auctioned at the same event, including Flowering Meadow and Forest Slope at Unterach am Attersee, which fetched between $60m and $80m each. The most expensive artwork ever sold at auction was Salvator Mundi, attributed to  Leonardo da Vinci, which sold in 2017 for $450.3m.Tuesday also saw a sculpture of a fully functioning gold toilet by the conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan picking up $12.1m just an hour after the record-breaking Klimt sale.The 101-kg toilet received just one bid. Sotheby's said that the buyer was a famous American brand.",

    "description": "A Russian spy ship is on the edge of UK waters north of Scotland and has pointed lasers at pilots of surveillance aircraft monitoring its activities, ",
    "body": "A Russian spy ship is on the edge of UK waters north of Scotland and has pointed lasers at pilots of surveillance aircraft monitoring its activities, the defence secretary has said.Speaking at a press conference in Downing Street, John Healey said it was the second time in a year that the Yantar had entered UK waters.The ship is \"designed for gathering intelligence and mapping our undersea cables\", Healey told journalists.\"My message to Russia and to Putin is this: we see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,\" he added.Giving more details on the vessel, Healey said: \"It is part of a Russian fleet designed to put and hold our undersea infrastructure and those of our allies at risk.\"It isn't just a naval operation. It's part of a Russian programme driven by what they call the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research, or GUGI, and this is designed to have capabilities which can undertake surveillance in peacetime and sabotage in conflict.\"That is why we've been determined, whenever the Yantar comes into British wider waters, we track it, we deter it and we say to Putin we are ready, and we do that alongside allies.\"He said this was a demonstration of Britain's capability and \"readiness to act\".The defence secretary issued a warning in January about the ship after it was spotted in UK waters.At his Downing Street press conference, he said this was the first time Yantar had used lasers in an effort to \"disrupt\" RAF pilots, which he described as a \"deeply dangerous\" and something the UK took \"very seriously\".He said he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely \"when it's in our wider waters\".\"We have military options ready should the Yantar change course. I am not going to reveal those because that only makes President Putin wiser,\" he said.The Ministry of Defence has come under criticism from a committee of MPs for being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack.The committee said the UK and its European allies should be building up their capabilities to prepare for potential US withdrawal.Healey said the UK government \"takes a different view\" to the committee about America's commitment to Nato.\"The strength of Nato is not just about the defence of Europe. it's about the defence of America too,\" he told reporters.But he said the committee was \"right to say\" Britain should \"pick up the pace of our commitment\" and that was something Labour has been doing since it came to power last year.The report comes as British negotiators race to agree a deal with the EU to enable British defence companies to contribute to projects funded by a new €150bn (£130bn) EU defence loan scheme set to launch next year.The Labour government wants to conclude a deal in the coming weeks to allow British companies to take part in the first round of bids from EU countries, with applications due by the end of this month.Healey told reporters the UK wanted to be part of the programme, but not \"at any price\", amid reports the two sides are at odds over the entry fee the UK could pay to enable British firms to take part.He added that any financial contribution to take part would have to be \"good value for money for our taxpayers and our industry\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondent, BBC NewsGettyThe researchers found evidence of kissing in multiple species Humans do it, monkeys do it, even polar bears do it. And now researchers have reconstructed the evolutionary origins of kissing. Their study suggests that the mouth-on-mouth kiss evolved more than 21 million years ago, and was something that the common ancestor of humans and other great apes probably indulged in.The same research concluded that Neanderthals may have kissed too – and that humans and Neanderthals may even have smooched one another.The scientists studied kissing because it presents something of an evolutionary puzzle - it has no obvious survival or reproductive benefits, and yet it is something that is seen not just in many human societies, but across the animal kingdom. GettyThe scientists defined a kiss as mouth-on-mouth contact \"with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer\"By finding evidence of other animals engaging in kissing, scientists were able to construct an \"evolutionary family tree\" to work out when it was most likely to have evolved.To ensure that they were comparing the same behaviour across different species, the researchers had to give a very precise - rather unromantic - definition to a \"kiss\". In their study, published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, they defined kissing as non aggressive, directed oral-oral contact \"with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer\".\"Humans, chimps, and bonobos all kiss,\" explained lead researcher Dr Matilda Brindle, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Oxford. From that, she concluded, \"it's likely that their most recent common ancestor kissed.\"\"We think kissing probably evolved around 21.5 million years ago in the large apes.\"Getty ImagesIn this study, scientists found behaviour that matched their scientific definition of kissing in wolves, prairie dogs, polar bears (very sloppy - lots of tongue), and even albatrosses. They focused on primates - and apes in particular - in order to build an evolutionary picture of the origin of the human kiss. The same study also concluded that Neanderthals - our closest ancient human relatives that died out around 40,000 years ago - also kissed. One previous piece of research on Neanderthal DNA also showed that modern humans and Neanderthals shared an oral microbe - a type of bacteria found in our saliva. \"That means that they must have been swapping saliva for hundreds of thousands of years after the two species split,\" explained Dr Brindle.        GettyThe scientists say this behaviour is something 'we share with our non-human relatives'While this study pinpointed when kissing evolved it was not able to answer the question of why. There are already a number of theories - that it arose from grooming behaviour in our ape ancestors or that it might provide an intimate way to assess the health and even the compatibility of a partner. Dr Brindle hopes that this will open a door to answering that question. \"It's important for us to understand that this is something we share with our non-human relatives,\" she said.\"We should be studying this behaviour, not just dismissing it as silly because it has romantic connotations in humans.\"     Chester ZooMany great apes engage in kissing",

    "body": "Two Miss Universe judges have resigned days before the annual beauty pageant, with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the selection process.Lebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch, who announced his resignation from the eight-member jury on Instagram, alleged that an \"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the competition, set to be held on Friday in Thailand.Hours later, French football manager Claude Makélélé also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\".The resignations come two weeks after several Miss Universe contestants walked out of a pre-pageant event over controversial comments made by an official from host nation Thailand.\"An impromptu jury has been formed to select 30 finalists from among the 136 participating countries, without the presence of any of the real [eight] members of the jury, including me,\" Mr Harfouch wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday, saying he had discovered this via social media.The unofficial jury comprises \"individuals with a significant potential conflict of interest due to some personal relationships with some of the Miss Universe contestants\", he claimed.Mr Harfouch did not elaborate on how this \"impromptu jury\" would function, or how it would override the official jury's decision.Watch: Miss Universe contestants stage walkout after organiser berates Miss MexicoThe Miss Universe Organisation on Tuesday put out a statement to rebuff Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\". It suggested that Mr Harfouch may have been referring to the Beyond the Crown programme: a \"social impact initiative\" that operates independently from the Miss Universe competition, and has a separate selection committee. The Miss Universe Organisation announced the Beyond the Crown selection committee on Monday. In its statement on Tuesday, the organisation said that Mr Harfouch's allegations had \"mischaracterised\" the programme.Mr Makélélé, who also announced his resignation via Instagram, described it as a \"difficult decision\". \"I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard. The platform represents empowerment, diversity, and excellence - values I have always championed throughout my career,\" he wrote.The beauty pageant drew backlash earlier this month after its Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly berated Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch, at a pre-pageant event for not posting promotional content on her social media platforms.In videos that have since gone viral, Ms Bosch and several other contestants could be seen walking out of the event, and some could be heard shouting at Mr Nawat.Mr Nawat later claimed that some of his words were misunderstood - but his conduct nevertheless prompted a stern rebuke from the Miss Universe Organisation, which has since sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.",

    "body": "Just nowKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesWalking around your local supermarket and you'll struggle to find much that's healthy for your finances on the shelves - food price rises are accelerating.The cost of the weekly shop is, and will continue to be, a worry for millions of people.Beyond just food, prices of goods and services in general are going up, but the rate of that price inflation has slowed.And that is likely to bring better news for the cost of borrowing, in particular mortgage rates for homeowners and first-time buyers.Are prices going up or down?Prices pretty much always rise. Official statistics chart the movement in the cost of hundreds of goods and services in the UK.It is the rate of increase that is crucial, and that inflation rate is published every month by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).On Wednesday, the ONS said the rate of inflation had fallen to 3.6%, which means prices are rising more slowly than they were and will foster hope that inflation has peaked.Delve a little further into the data, and there are more details about what is behind the latest trends. For example, fish, vegetables, chocolate and confectionary were among the products that rose in price, although fruit prices fell slightly.Recent research by the Bank of England found that people on average are still buying the same amount of food, but paying more for it. That said, they are changing the way they shop.\"Concerns about rising food costs and utility bills still dominate conversations,\" it said.\"Households continue to change their shopping habits to reduce spending, such as buying more vegetables and reducing meat consumption.\"Getty Images\"Staples like bread, meat and potatoes all cost more than they did even a month ago,\" says Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at investment platform AJ Bell.But she does point to a silver lining - the dip in the inflation rate means the Bank of England is now more likely to cut interest rates in December.The Bank uses its benchmark interest rate - which heavily influences the cost of borrowing for households and businesses - to try to bring inflation to its target rate of 2%.\"Inflation remains well above the Band of England's happy place of 2%,\" says Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.But, she says, the latest figures could pave the way for a sixth interest rate cut since August last year.The prospect of an interest rate cut has seen lenders make changes already. In recent weeks, many major lenders have lowered their rates for people getting a new fixed-rate mortgage or renewing their current one.\"There has been particular emphasis placed on rates for home movers with some of the best rates available for purchases,\" says David Hollingworth, of mortgage brokers L&C.Data from the financial information service Moneyfacts shows that the average rate on a new two-year fixed deal has fallen to 4.88%, and is down to 4.93% for the average five-year fixed deal.Average rates for those only able to put down a deposit of 5% or 10% - often first-time buyers - are now looking at average rates lower than they have been at any time in the last two or three years.Why are lenders cutting rates now?Inflation is only one factor in lenders' decisions to cut mortgage rates now.Generally, Christmas is a quiet time for the housing market as potential buyers and sellers concentrate on turkey and trimmings instead.So, they may be lowering rates in a bid to stimulate custom. The same cannot be said for savings rates. \"Competition has been scarce,\" says Caitlyn Eastell, from Moneyfacts. That is compounded by the fact that many of those buyers, sellers and savers have put plans on hold until they find out what happens in the Budget delivered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves on 26 November.The Budget looms large over the housing market, with talk of taxation on high value properties, as well as over economic activity in general. Reeves wants to introduce measures to lower the rate of inflation, and help people with the cost of living. However, she also needs to bring in more money or cut government spending to meet her own fiscal rules.It is a delicate balancing act that will affect individual and family finances, affecting the money people have to spend in the supermarket and the appetite they have to save, as well as buy or sell a home.

    "body": "8 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says Saudi crown prince \"knew nothing\" about Jamal Khashoggi's murderUS President Donald Trump said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\".It was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing. \"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\" \"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\"The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\". A US intelligence report made public in 2021 - under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report. While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince.Hanan Khashoggi, Jamal Khashoggi's widow, speaks to BBC after Trump defends Saudi crown princeReacting to Trump's comments, Khashoggi's widow, Hanan, told BBC Newsnight the US president's defence of the crown prince did not match up with bin Salman's own acknowledgment of responsibility for her husband's murder.\"The crown prince himself, in 2019 and 60 Minutes interview, he did take accountability about and hold responsibility about this horrible crime,\" she said.In a post on X, she also called for a meeting with the crown prince and an apology along with compensation for her husband's murder.Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year. Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\". The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis. Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin. The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s. The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.\"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre.\"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added. The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday. Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - was also present at the dinner. Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoGetty ImagesTemperatures have fallen sharply across much of the UK in recent days. What is the best way to heat your home and keep yourself safe and well during periods of cold weather? Prioritise your healthKeeping warm over the winter months can help to prevent colds, flu and more serious health problems such as heart attacks, strokes, pneumonia and depression, according to the NHS.Pensioners, children under the age of five, people with health conditions and those who are pregnant are most at risk.Wearing multiple layers of clothing - including thick socks and fingerless gloves - can help keep you warm if you are not moving. Family, friends and neighbours can play their part by ensuring anyone who is more vulnerable is well stocked up with food and necessary medicines, and that they can safely get in and out of their property by keeping any steps or paths clear of snow or ice. Many charities and councils run free warm hubs in locations such as libraries and other community spaces. Heat your home efficientlyCheck whether there are any quick fixes to make sure you are not wasting energy or heat. That could include turning off radiators in unused rooms, switching off lights when they are not needed, and not leaving electrical appliances on standby.Curtains should be open during the day, then drawn at dusk.Limit heat loss by using draught excluders to block gaps under doors or around windows. You can add metal, plastic or adhesive foam strips to fill any gaps. You can cover external keyholes and add a flap or brush to your letterbox, or hang a door curtain. You can put a chimney draught excluder inside any unused fireplaces, or make your own by filling a black bag with scrunched up paper. The Energy Saving Trust points out that internal doors should not be draught-proofed to allow the proper circulation of air throughout a property. Rugs can cover gaps between floorboards, and warm hard floors. Getty ImagesExperts are divided on whether it is more efficient to keep your heating on permanently at a lower temperature or switch it on and off as required. Generally, using a thermostat to keep the room temperature between 18C and 21C is ideal for most. However, turning it down even one degree can save money, as can switching off radiators in unoccupied rooms. Older people and those with health conditions which limit their mobility are not advised to let temperatures drop below 18C in rooms they use regularly.Your heating system may have a timer function which lets you programme particular temperatures at different times of the day. Some wireless thermostats are connected to the internet and can be turned on remotely. Turning down your combi boiler's flow temperature can help the system run more efficiently, and save money. Make sure radiators are not blocked by curtains or furniture. Consider fitting reflector panels to those on external walls. If you are staying in one room for a long time, you may want to use a portable electric heater instead of turning on your central heating system. They should be plugged directly into a mains socket, placed on a flat surface, and be at least 3ft (1m) away from anything flammable such as curtains or furniture. Using gas heaters carries the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, so you should ensure you have a working carbon monoxide alarm in the same room.You can also use electric blankets or heated throws on a timer function to ensure they don't overheat. Eat, drink and wash well Experts argue it is essential to eat and drink properly during periods of cold weather. Keep moving as much as you can between meals.  Age UK recommends at least one hot meal a day such as soup or stew, and regular hot drinks like tea. Tinned soups, fruit and vegetables can be cheaper than fresh produce. You may be able to get support from your local food bank, although you might need to be referred first. Local community organisations can often arrange this.Don't overfill your kettle: only boil what you need. Batch cooking and freezing meal portions can also save money. Microwaves and air fryers can be cheaper to run than gas or electric ovens. Don't run your dishwasher unless it is full, and choose an eco-setting if you can. If your energy supplier offers discounts for off-peak use, try to use washing machines and other large appliances during the cheaper period. Wash clothes at 30C, not 40C.Limit your shower time to four minutes. Use a timer or make a playlist of four-minute songs. Get help with your heating bills ",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris Mason,Political editor and Georgia Roberts,Political correspondentWhen MPs, members of the House of Lords and their staff were warned about the threat from Chinese spies, in one office in Westminster, a quick check began.Simon Whelband is a Conservative councillor and also works for the Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, who was sanctioned by China in 2021.Simon went into his LinkedIn messages and there it was. A message from an account in the name of Shirly Shen sent some weeks earlier.He hadn't responded to the unsolicited message and reported it to Parliament's security services. He was then advised to block the account.The note comes across as pretty innocuous.He said: \"The message wasn't written in very good English, it was a message to say there was a job opportunity and was I interested, and to get in touch if I was. \"I've worked around Parliament for about 10 years now so I'm kind of used to this.\"But if you were more junior, you don't know what you're looking for. \"You might think it's a genuine offer that's made to you on LinkedIn, they might accept.\"Whelband added that he thought it was becoming more common for those working in Parliament to be targeted by China.\"They have realised the way to get to Parliamentarians is through their staff... it's deeply worrying,\" he said.And so, for the second time this autumn, Westminster is collectively wrestling with what to do about China.The growing influence of this vast superpower is one of the two stand out global changes of the last 30 years, alongside the growth of the internet. Some of the most acute challenges - or threats - from Beijing come when both of these mega-trends of the early 21st Century combine.Senior figures in government are worried, but express their worry carefully in public. MPs outside of government are much more willing to be blunt.Tuesday's debate in the Commons on this was an eye opener. The security minister Dan Jarvis was both circumspect in his language, but warm and accepting of the wide range of concerns expressed by MPs of multiple parties.Among them:Concern that buses manufactured in China but driving on British streets might be equipped with a so-called \"kill switch\" which allows someone in China to press a button and disable the bus – potentially causing chaosWorries about vehicles used by the military that are made in China and might be mobile listening devices – to such an extent that military figures have been warned to watch what they are saying when they are on board in case China is listeningDeep concern about China seeking planning permission for a huge new embassy in central London which critics say will be a spying centre and is located very close to sensitive data cables that serve the City of LondonLast month, Parliament was digesting the collapse of a court case involving two men accused of spying for China, one of whom had worked in Westminster. Both men always denied any wrongdoing. Now it is the warning that all MPs and members of the House of Lords have received from the security service MI5 that they might be Beijing's next target.It says it has identified two LinkedIn profiles used by Chinese security services to act as \"civilian recruitment headhunters\", targeting individuals working in British politics to solicit \"insider insights\".Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and his counterpart in the House of Lords, Lord McFall, circulated the warning to MPs and peers on Tuesday.The alert specifically identified two LinkedIn profiles set up with the names Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen.The BBC has contacted both for a response, although it is not clear if the women named and pictured on the networking site are the actual account holders.As Jarvis put it, China \"has a low threshold for information it regards as valuable\". This is because over time it builds up a wider picture by piecing together the morsels it may extract from a wide range of people.Labour, since they won the general election, have attempted to warm up the UK's relationship with China.The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been to Beijing, as has the Business Secretary, Peter Kyle, who was there in September within days of being appointed to the role. The most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office, Sir Olly Robbins, was there last month in the midst of all those headlines about the collapsed spying trial.But there has long been a vociferous collection of China hawks in Parliament, who have long worried about what they see as a collective naivety about Beijing. The question now is whether a moment like this, following MI5's intervention, persuades others to share their outlook.The government insists its approach to China is \"pragmatic\": it regards working with Beijing as inevitable but insists it is \"clear eyed\" about the risks.Will a growing number of MPs demand a more sceptical outlook?As one put it, rather colourfully, \"you can't reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth\".China is a vast superpower that is at once essential yet awkward, unavoidable yet dangerous.This the latest case study in those competing interests. There will be more to come.",

    "body": "2 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesAdverts by four of Britain's biggest hotel and travel firms have been banned for stating misleading minimum prices for rooms.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld complaints against the Hilton hotel group, Travelodge, Booking.com and Accor over their use of eye-catching so-called \"from\" prices.The watchdog found only a small number of rooms actually available to book at the promoted price and concluded the adverts overstated the deals.It said this was unfair on those looking for good deals or seeking to make informed choices about where to book.ASA operations manager Emily Henwood said: \"Advertised prices must match what's really available. If only a few rooms are actually offered at the price shown, or it only applies to a specific date, then this information must be made clear to avoid misleading people.\"People should be able to trust the prices they see in ads and these rulings show that we will take action if the rules are broken.\"The ASA used AI to identify the misleading adverts as part of a wider probe into the availability of advertised hotel prices.PA MediaThe Hilton hotel group was rebuked over two adverts, one reading \"Hampton by Hilton Hamilton Park From £68\", and the other advertising stays in Newcastle from £59.The ASA asked Hilton whether it could back up the claims, with the hotel offering evidence that rooms were bookable at the hotels on the respective dates the adverts were viewed.But the ASA concluded Hilton had exaggerated the availability of the advertised rooms, leaving potential customers at risk of being misled. It ordered the chain not to publish the adverts again and warned Hilton to ensure any future price claims reflect deals available for \"a significant proportion of rooms\".Travelodge had two adverts banned - one offering rooms in Nottingham Riverside \"from £25\" and the other rooms in Swansea \"from £21\".The ASA found that the advertised prices were only available for a single night's stay, warning Travelodge in future to ensure deals are available \"across a range of dates\".A Travelodge spokesperson said it recognised the need for clarity and transparency in pricing and is working with Google to ensure its adverts are clear and comply with the ASA's guidelines. It said the relevant advert was removed before the ASA's ruling.Similar findings were issued against Booking.com and hotel group Accor, while staycation chain Butlins was criticised for changing the deadline of a sale it promoted via email.Accor told the ASA it believed its adverts were accurate as rooms were available at or below the headline prices in the days following their publication.In a statement to the BBC, Accor said the specific advertisement criticised by the ASA had not been shown since. \"We are taking this opportunity to further strengthen our existing internal processes,\" a spokesperson for Accord said. Booking.com sent the watchdog a screenshot demonstrating that seven bookings had been made at the prices it advertised.A spokesperson told the BBC that Booking.com accurately displays price and availability at the time advertisements are shown and will work with the ASA \"to address any outstanding questions they might have\".The ASA also found Butlin's had breached its code by writing to customers that \"The big Butlin's sale ends in four days\" and \"Time is running out\".The deadline to participate in the sale was eventually extended by two weeks, which the watchdog said was unfair on those who had been put under pressure to book a break before the initial deadline.It urged the firm to ensure future promotions are fair to consumers. Butlins said no customers were disadvantaged by the extension of the sale window.The ASA's findings come after the Competition and Markets Authority on Tuesday launched a probe into eight companies over potentially misleading online price claims.

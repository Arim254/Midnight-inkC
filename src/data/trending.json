    "body": "'The second home ban has breathed new life into my village' 1 day agoJo LonsdaleBBC North East and Cumbria InvestigationsBBCMany generations of Jennifer Hall's family fished out of a now largely empty Beadnell Harbour Nearly eight years ago, Beadnell on the Northumberland coast became one of the first villages in the country to ban any homes built on new sites being used as second homes or holiday lets. The number of permanent residents has increased, bringing what some say is \"new life\" but others argue the policy is not enough to save rural communities or think it an unwarranted attack on tourism.Driving towards Beadnell harbour, 75-year-old Jennifer Hall nods one by one at the large houses overlooking the sea.\"Holiday let, second home, second home, holiday let, second home, holiday let,\" she intones. Clustered barnacle-like at the end of a glorious arc of sand, Beadnell, along with the neighbouring villages of Bamburgh and Seahouses, has long been a magnet for those seeking refuge from the madding crowd. According to the 2021 census, 64% of homes in Beadnell are second homes or holiday lets, up from 55% in 2011.Almost every house on Beadnell seafront is a holiday let or second homeHall's family has been in Beadnell since at least the 1700s. \"Fishing folk mainly,\" she says, but her great-grandmother opened the village's first hotel, an irony not lost on her given her years-long campaign against over-reliance on tourism. \"I don't hate holiday lets and I don't hate second homes at all,\" she says.\"But, in winter when there are no lights on, it can be very lonely.\" For much of the last half century, planning policy encouraged tourism. As recently as 2016, a new estate of 40 houses, Bernicia Way, was completed with a legal condition they could only be used as second homes or holiday lets. \"We were thinking there would come a point when there was nobody living here at all,\" Hall says.Among its policies was a requirement that all homes built on new sites would come with a legal restriction that they could only be used as a permanent residence. Planning policies previously supported tourism so the 40 homes in Bernicia Way, completed in 2016, can only be used as holiday lets or second homesAn estate of 45 houses called The Kilns was built and it included nine homes designated \"affordable\" - available for a set amount below market rate. The policy has been positive, Hall says, with the number of residents \"up by more than 10%\". \"It's really brought new life,\" she says. \"We have several new clubs in the village, and a fantastic new playground.\" Homes on The Kilns estate can only be lived in as permanent residencesAmong the newcomers to The Kilns determined to get \"stuck in\" to village life are Jacolyn Priestley-Jayes and Tim Jayes, both in their mid-sixties.They host a new monthly wine club, have joined Beadnell volunteers and Priestley-Jayes has begun a book club.  Jayes is also on the parish council \"for my sins\", he says with a wry smile. \"There's so much going on,\" his wife adds.Jacolyn Priestley-Jayes and Tim Jayes have begun a book club and a wine clubHall accepts the policy is \"not perfect\". Some houses in The Kilns remain unsold, and rumours abound that a few are being used as second homes despite the legal restriction.\"There are definitely some people who don't appear to be using their houses as their permanent residence, which is a shame,\" Priestley-Jayes says. Northumberland Estates, which was behind the project, said responsibility for enforcing the planning condition rests with Northumberland County Council and pointed out the residency requirement was \"very clearly communicated throughout the sales and marketing process\". The council said it would be inappropriate to comment further as the situation was \"part of an active investigation\".Getty ImagesBeadnell, NorthumbriaA further problem is the policy only applies to new sites.\"We've had developers buy up an old house, knock it down and replace it with a bigger property which has become holiday lets,\" Hall says. \"So that's a frustration.\"We've built The Kilns but there's not much space for more new houses.\" The parish council made a map using red and orange dots for holiday homes to demontrate how they dominate BeadnellDespite this, other villages have followed Beadnell in adopting the same policy. Helen Coyne, 72, has a flat in one of them, Alnmouth, with panoramic, ever-changing views of another of Northumberland's seemingly endless beaches. Although this is her second home, she says she understands the rationale behind the changes, and accepts the doubling of council tax since April last year. But she thinks second home owners contribute a lot to local businesses. \"We're here at least two or three nights every week, I use the lovely gift shop, we go out for meals, we drink in the pubs,\" she says.\"When family and friends stay, they do that even more.\"Helen Coyne, who has a holiday home in Alnmouth, says she tries hard to support local businessesBut Tim Farron, the MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale in Cumbria, says some second home owners visit \"just a couple of times a year\". \"They're definitely not sending their children to local schools either,\" he adds. The Liberal Democrat's constituency includes part of the Lake District National Park where one in four properties is a holiday home.Farron wants to go even further than applying restrictions to new-builds and is advocating a change in planning law.\"If I wanted to change my house into a fish and chip shop, I'd have to apply for planning permission,\" he says. \"But if I want to turn it into a second home or a holiday let, I can just do that. But it has a material impact on the community I live in.\"He wants separate categories of planning use for holiday lets and second homes, which would allow local authorities to limit their numbers.\"That way we can ensure rural communities don't die.\" The Lake District National Park Authority hopes to build affordable homes available only as a principal residenceThe Lake District National Park Authority's head of development management, Andrew Smith, agrees the current tools it has are \"quite limited\" and school populations continue to decline.The authority has set a target for 1,200 new permanent homes by 2035 but has no control over what happens to the existing housing stock.\"All you can do is approve or refuse new houses and try and facilitate new housing coming forward,\" he says. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it knew \"too many second homes and holiday lets can be harmful for communities\" and was taking action.Councils had the power to charge more council tax for second homes and the ministry was \"removing the incentive for landlords to prioritise short-term holiday lets over longer-term homes\", a spokesperson said.\"We'll continue to monitor impacts on communities and consider more powers for councils where needed,\" they added.PATourism revenue for the Lake District in 2024 was £2.3bnHowever, Richard Sayer, a former director of the North-East estate agents Rook Matthews Sayer, is wary of anything that might reduce the number of visitors.  \"An elderly person living permanently in a village has a perfect right to be there but is not hiring paddleboards and kayaks, or going to restaurants,\" he says.\"A holiday let with six people, they're spending thousands every week which is all going into the local economy.\"He has a holiday property near Keswick in Cumbria and thinks the doubling of council tax on second homes is already causing some to sell up. \"What is really needed is accommodation for the staff who work in the tourist industry, not fewer holiday homes,\" he adds. \"Every business in Keswick seems to have a sign up saying they are looking for staff.\"PAMore than half the properties in the Northumberland village of Bamburgh are second homes or holiday lets Back in Beadnell, on the kind of grey blustery day when the rain pecks at your face, the Craster Arms has a steady stream of windbent visitors. Owner Michael Dawson, who employs about a hundred staff across three cafes and pubs - \"young people, local people\" - also has little time for policies which deter second homes and holiday lets. \"The gift shops, ice-cream parlours, fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants,\" he says\"Make no mistake, we all rely on them.\"  Publican Michael Dawson would like to see even more holiday lets and second homes in Beadnell What everyone agrees on is rural communities need more young families amid falling birth rates and an ageing population.    There are about 750 properties in Beadnell but no school and only about 20 children. Esther Graham, 46, grew up in the village but could only afford to live there with her children by moving in with her parents, who extended their home to accommodate. \"There's nothing for the kids, no clubs, no brownies or scouts,\" she says.Like Hall, her family have been in Beadnell for centuries but she worries about future generations. \"What we need more than anything is affordable housing and more jobs,\" she says. Esther GrahamEsther Graham grew up in Beadnell but says she can only afford to live there because she shares a house with her parentsNorthumberland County Council said the provision of affordable housing was one of its \"top priorities\" and it had updated its Housing Allocation Policy so council houses were only offered to people with \"a very strong connection to Northumberland\". It said, between 2017 and the end of 2025, more than 1,700 affordable homes had been built across the county and planning permission had been granted for 1,369 more.Related internet linksRelated stories",

    "body": "7 hours agoBBCSenior MPs and peers will have the final say on whether sensitive information is published relating to Peter Mandelson's appointment and role as US ambassador.Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said it had confirmed with the government that it alone would make the decision.The committee said agreement had been reached on which papers would be published, with hopes some could be released \"shortly\".Additionally, the Metropolitan Police and government have \"agreed a framework\" to determine which documents can be released without prejudicing a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson.A UK government spokesperson said officials were \"proceeding at pace to publish the first tranche of documents in early March\" and \"working closely\" with the ISC to fulfil their requests.Lord Mandelson is under criminal investigation over allegations he passed sensitive information to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein when he was a Labour minister.The peer was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of misconduct in public office on Monday and later released on bail, pending further investigation.Lord Mandelson did not respond to requests for comment but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.The Metropolitan Police has told the government not to release certain documents that could undermine its investigation.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told MPs he wanted to release the documents but said he would not publish anything that could damage national security or diplomatic relations.The government is likely to start publishing documents relevant to Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US as soon as next week.But material the government considers damaging to national security or diplomatic relations will be sent to the cross-party ISC and the parliamentarians will decide what to publish.The government was forced to hand over control of that part of the process to the ISC following concern by MPs that Downing Street could have too much say in what is published.On Thursday, the ISC said it had received a written guarantee that neither the prime minister nor the government would have the final say on what is considered too sensitive to disclose.Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister, told MPs on Monday that the first tranche of Lord Mandelson documents would be published in early March.Jones said police had already advised ministers that certain documents, including exchanges between Lord Mandelson and No 10, should not be published in the first tranche.The BBC understands that one specific exchange police have blocked from being released next month includes three questions Sir Keir put to Lord Mandelson about his friendship with Epstein prior to his appointment as US ambassador. The questions were related to his continued contact with Epstein after his first conviction for soliciting prostitution with a minor, reports that he had stayed at Epstein's home while the financier was in prison, and his association with a charity founded by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.Sir Keir has claimed the documents will show Lord Mandelson lied to him about the extent of his friendship with Epstein, which continued after he had been convicted in 2008.The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.The request to the European Anti-Fraud Office (Olaf) was made last week, a Commission spokeswoman said, after communications between the peer and Epstein were among the published documents.",

Equally, a loss would point to the limitations of that momentum, albeit in a seat miles down their target list.You may remember they fell short in the by-election for the seat of Caerphilly in the Welsh Parliament last autumn, when Plaid Cymru managed to persuade the vast majority of voters who didn't want Reform to back them.If the anti-Reform vote splits more evenly in tonight's contest, it could allow them to nip through the middle to victory.The most newsworthy result would be a win for the Green Party of England and Wales.It would be their first ever victory in a parliamentary by-election if they took the seat. Unlike the others, they may still afford themselves some smiles if they lose, given they have clearly been competitive in this contest.And if Labour fail to win, it'll be awkward for them if Reform are the victors and arguably doubly awkward if it is the Greens - as it will illustrate the bind they are caught in between two insurgencies, one to their Right and one to their Left.Let's see how things unfold in the coming hours - the night is young.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLana LamSydneyTasmania PoliceCeline Cremer, 31, went missing in 2023 after going for a hike in a Tasmanian rainforestPolice have confirmed that human remains found in a Tasmanian rainforest are most likely those of a Belgian backpacker who went missing in 2023 after going for a hike.Celine Cremer, 31, was reported missing days after she went for a hike near Philosopher's Falls in Waratah, in Tasmania's northwest. Police spent months searching for her but failed to find anything.A private search involving dozens of volunteers in recent months uncovered her bones, teeth mobile phone and clothing, prompting police to renew their efforts. On Friday, police - with permission from her family - said the remains had been \"provisionally identified\" as Cremer's with expert reports providing \"compelling evidence\".Tasmania Police Commander Nathan Johnston extended his sincere condolences to Cremer's family and loved ones. \"While this provisional confirmation will not ease their loss, we hope the outcome will provide them with some measure of clarity and closure,\" he said. He also thanked all community members for their support and interest in her case, praising search and rescue personnel and volunteers who \"dedicated significant time and resources during the many search phases\".For months, Cremer's case had baffled many as initial police searches failed to lead to any clues about her whereabouts.Limited resources and extreme weather hampered police efforts, with searchers hindered by heavy rainfall, freezing conditions and snow. After police called off their search, Cremer's family hired a private investigator who trained a group of volunteers to scour the area of dense wilderness, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).Some of those volunteers had joined the search party after seeing videos posted by a local filmmaker who was closely following the case, the ABC reported.A report will be prepared by the coroner to officially determine the identity of the remains.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNick Eardley,Political correspondentandIan AikmanReutersThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) has launched a review into whether RAF bases were used by Jeffrey Epstein.It is expected the review, first reported by the Telegraph, will look into records and emails, while Defence Secretary John Healey was said to have ordered officials to turn over every stone to establish whether the late sex offender landed his private jet at military sites when visiting the UK.An MoD source said it would \"ruthlessly pursue any information that can shed light on this scandal\".It comes after former Prime Minister Gordon Brown demanded a police investigation into whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had used RAF bases to meet Epstein.Brown said he had submitted a five-page dossier to several UK police forces – including the Met, Sussex and Thames Valley Police – providing new and additional information from Epstein-related documents published in the US.Last Sunday, the Sunday Telegraph reported that the former prime minister was understood to be concerned about a flight Epstein took on a Gulfstream jet that landed at RAF Marham air base in Norfolk in December 2000. The base is around 20 miles (32 km) from the Sandringham Estate.Last year, a BBC News investigation established that around 90 flights linked to Epstein had arrived and departed from UK airports, some with British women on board who say they were abused.At the time, the Ministry of Defence said it was \"standard practice for spare capacity at RAF airfields in the UK to be used for private or commercial aircraft, subject to fees which cover all costs\".Mountbatten-Windsor has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, who died in a New York prison cell in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.An MoD spokesperson said: \"The defence secretary has ordered a review of all records that the department may hold relating to Epstein flights landing at RAF bases to ensure that any information which relates to Epstein's crimes is uncovered and provided to the relevant authorities.\"The MoD will support any civilian police investigations. Our thoughts are with all the victims of Epstein's vile crimes.\"Stansted Airport said in a statement that the terminals used for private flights are \"entirely independent\" and that \"no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal\".Immigration and customs checks for passengers arriving via private jets are carried out \"directly by Border Force\", it said, adding that it does not \"manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterNurPhoto via Getty ImagesNetflix has declined to raise its proposal to buy Warner Bros Discovery after the Hollywood studio deemed Paramount Skydance's rival offer \"superior\".Netflix has backed away from its proposal to buy Warner Bros Discovery, clearing the way for Paramount Skydance to win the months-long takeover battle.Warner Bros, which put itself up for sale last year, on Thursday said Paramount's latest bid was \"superior\" to Netflix's offer and called on the streaming company to raise its offer.\"At the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid,\" Netflix co-chief executives Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said.\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Sarandos and Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined.\"\"This transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price,\" the Netflix executives added.The announcement came just hours after Sarandos had visited the White House on Thursday.Last December, Warner Bros agreed to a takeover offer from Netflix for some of its assets. But Paramount, which is backed by tech billionaire Larry Ellison and led by his son David, made a rival offer as it looks to transform itself into a Hollywood heavyweight.Paramount previously found itself rebuffed by Warner Bros.On Thursday, chief executive David Ellison welcomed the Warner Bros board's decision in favour of Paramount's sweetened offer. The proposal, he said in a statement, offers Warner Bros shareholders \"superior value, certainty and speed to closing\".If Paramount's deal is approved by regulators, the company would fold Warner Bros' HBO Max streaming customers into its portfolio. It would also take ownership of CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings.Paramount's traditional networks already include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central.Many in Hollywood have viewed the bidding war between Netflix and Paramount as a battle with no good winner.Critics of a deal with Netflix voiced concern that the storied movie studio would be lost to the Silicon Valley streaming titan, paving the way for the depletion of cinema. But a merger with Paramount, which has touted itself among the last standing movie studios in Hollywood, also left critics unnerved over the company's perceived political connections with the Trump administration.Across the board, the selling of Warner Bros will have massive ramification across Tinsel town, with all but assured cuts to staff in a city that has been marred by continued production cuts.In December, the Warner Bros said it had agreed to sell its film and streaming divisions, including HBO, to Netflix in a deal worth $27.75 per share or roughly $82bn (£61bn), including debt.Warner Bros said it would spin-off the remainder of its business, including traditional television networks and the news channel CNN, as an independent company.But in a last-ditch push, Paramount this week agreed to pay more for a Warner Bros takeover. The company offered $31 per share in cash, up from $30 per share to take over the entire company.It also agreed to pay $7bn should the deal fall through and cover the $2.8bn fee Warner Bros had agreed to pay Netflix in the event of a break-up of the merger plan.This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

    "body": "Pakistan strikes Afghan cities as cross-border attacks escalate6 minutes agoUmer Draz Nangiana,Maia DaviesandAzizullah KhanAFP via Getty ImagesThis latest escalation comes days after Pakistan carried out air strikes inside Afghanistan following suicide blasts on its soil (file photo)Pakistan launched strikes on the Afghan cities of Kabul and Kandahar in the early hours of Friday, according to Pakistani government officials.The Afghan Taliban says it has responded with renewed attacks against Pakistani troops along their shared border.Pakistani authorities said that their \"counter strikes\" on the Afghan cities were a response to \"unprovoked Afghan attacks\" - though the Afghan Taliban said those were in response to earlier Pakistani strikes.The two countries agreed a fragile ceasefire in October after deadly cross-border clashes, but fighting has flared once again in recent days. Residents in Kabul heard loud blasts across the city on Friday, AFP reported.Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy losses on each other during recent clashes. People in Pakistan's border regions told the BBC they had heard explosions and were asked to move to safety.Pakistan earlier said that two of its soldiers have been killed after the Afghan Taliban launched an operation against military positions along their shared border late on Thursday.Three others were injured as Pakistani forces responded to the \"unprovoked fire\", Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said.The Afghan Taliban said it had launched the \"large-scale\" operation in response to strikes earlier this week, which it claimed had killed at least 18 people. Islamabad said it had targeted alleged militant camps and hideouts.Taliban military spokesman Mawlawi Wahidullah Mohammadi said the \"retaliatory operation\" had been launched at around 20:00 local time (15:30 GMT) on Thursday.The group's chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the offensive had killed \"numerous\" Pakistani soldiers and captured others.This was denied by a spokesman for Pakistan's prime minister, who also contested Mujahid's claim that 15 military posts had been captured.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's spokesman Mosharraf Zaidi dismissed claims of damage on the Pakistani side and said all aggression would receive an \"immediate and effective\" response.Mujahid wrote on X that \"in response to repeated border violations and insurgency by Pakistani military circles, large-scale preemptive operations were launched against Pakistani army centres and military installations\" along the border.Pakistan's government said the Taliban had \"miscalculated and opened unprovoked fire on multiple locations\" across the border in its north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which had been met with an \"immediate and effective response\" by Islamabad's security forces.\"Early reports confirm heavy casualties on [the] Afghan side with multiple posts and equipment destroyed,\" said a Ministry of Information & Broadcasting statement shared on X.\"Pakistan will take all necessary measures to ensure its territorial integrity and the safety and security of its citizens.\"Residents reported hearing a heavy exchange of fire along the border. Those living near Pakistan's border town of Torkham were asked to vacate the area. Officials suspended the repatriation of deported Afghan nationals back over the border in the town due to the clashes. The crossing was also closed to Afghan refugees.Islamabad had said it targeted seven alleged militant camps and hideouts near the border and that they had been launched after recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.Kabul meanwhile said civilian homes and a religious school had been targeted, with women and children among the dead.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border.",

    "body": "Image source, Joe Giddens/PA WireByBen RichLead Weather PresenterIf you have been hit by relentless rain and flooding this winter you might well be expecting the weather to have broken some records.Provisional statistics from the Met Office show that is not the case, with rainfall so far this season, for the UK as a whole, just 9% above average overall - wet, but far from the wettest.However those national figures mask some huge regional variations. Some parts of southern England are on course for their second-wettest winter on record, while much of north-west Scotland has been significantly drier than normal.It is largely down to a blocked weather pattern that sent rain into the same parts of the country repeatedly for much of the winter and left others predominantly dry.Relentless rain for some - but not allMeteorological winter runs until the end of February - so there are still a couple of days of potential rainfall to count.However, the Met Office has crunched the numbers up until 25 February and revealed that southern England has already had its seventh-wettest winter since records began in 1836.That figure may change with more rain in the forecast for the end of the season.England overall has had 35% more rainfall than it would expect in a typical winter, with Northern Ireland 25% wetter than normal and Wales 14% above its usual rainfall figure.But Scotland has actually had 16% less rainfall than in a normal winter - despite some parts of the east being very wet indeed.Image caption, Blue areas on this map show above-average rainfall, with below-average figures shown in brownThese variations in rainfall can largely be explained by a so-called blocked weather pattern which left our weather stuck in a rut for most of January and February.The jet stream sent areas of low pressure spinning in from the Atlantic, but their progress was blocked by an area of high pressure that became slow-moving across Scandinavia.Image caption, A blocked weather pattern with south-easterly winds has lingered for most of 2026 so farThat kept the UK in a feed of south-easterly winds, meaning relentless rain for areas exposed to those winds such as southern England and eastern Scotland - while keeping sheltered areas like western Scotland and north-west England drier than they would normally expected.That is why some places experienced seemingly relentless rain - including 55 consecutive wet days at Cardinham in Cornwall - while others were left wondering what all the fuss was about.Four named stormsWinter brought four named storms - Bram, Goretti, Ingrid and Chandra.Storm Bram brought widespread impacts but was described by the Met Office as a \"notable but not exceptional Atlantic winter storm\".Storm Goretti was a different story.Its most significant impacts were felt in the far south-west of England where it was one of the most impactful storms to affect Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly in decades. A rare Met Office red warning was issued triggering an emergency alert to be sent to thousands of mobile phones.A wind gust of 99mph (159km/h) recorded at St Mary's was the highest wind speed recorded in the Isles of Scilly for 47 years.Julie Luscombe from Redruth, Cornwall, explained that winds picked up suddenly and caused damage to her home as she told BBC Your Voice.\"Almost immediately it went from silence to all my fences being taken down.Media caption, Wind and rain from Storm Goretti caused significant damage to Julie Luscombe's property\"The tiles and the bathroom roof were literally lifting up and slamming back down - it was just so quick\".Julie says she felt \"disbelief that a storm could have caused so much damage, especially when the trees were ripped out of the ground\".Heavy rain brought flooding in parts of southern England with significant snow in parts of Wales, the Midlands and northern England as the storm bumped into cold air.Storm Ingrid and Storm Chandra then hit the south and south-west of the UK in the space of less than a week, adding to the flooding problems and bringing disruption to road and rail transport.A lack of sunshine - but snow for someSunshine was in short supply - as people in Aberdeen will confirm.The city spent three weeks under grey skies in the midst of what looks to have been Scotland's fifth dullest winter since 1910.Things were a little brighter for some places further south in the UK, but overall the country has only seen 80% of the sunshine it would expect in an average winter.Temperatures have been above average overall but there were colder interludes and some places have seen significant snow.Ski resorts in Scotland say they have had their best season in years.It is proof that even as the climate warms overall there will still be short-term spells of cold winter weather.What does climate change mean for UK winters?Our winters are already getting warmer and wetter.According to the Met Office, UK winters have already warmed by 1C (1.8F) since the 1950s due to human-induced global warming. Six of the ten warmest winters on record have occurred since the year 2000, with only one 21st century winter (2009/2010) featuring in the top ten coldest.This means we are seeing less snow and fewer frosts - in fact we now get around four weeks less ground frost than we did half a century ago.However, one thing we are seeing more of is rain.Out of nearly 260 years of records, six out of the ten wettest winter half-years - the period from October to March - have been since the year 2000.These changes are predicted to continue as the world continues to warm.In a situation where high levels of greenhouse gas emissions continue, the Met Office expects winters to be between 1 and 4.5C (1.8-8.1F) warmer than they were in 1990 - and up to 30% wetter.That is because a warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture, so when rain comes it will be heavier and more intense.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorGetty ImagesCollagen is a type of protein made naturally in the body but that declines with ageTaking daily collagen supplements can rejuvenate the skin by boosting elasticity and hydration or moisture - but it won't stop wrinkles, says a new scientific review. Experts looked at the available evidence and say they are highly confident that collagen pills or powder provide \"some legitimate\" skin gains if taken over time but are no quick fix. The supplements may also ease wear and tear, arthritis joint pain and stiffness, according to the results from 113 trials involving nearly 8,000 people. Collagen is a type of protein made naturally in the body but that declines with age. It supports and strengthens skin, nails, bones and connective tissues, including tendons and cartilage.'Collagen is not a cure-all'From early adulthood onwards, the body produces less collagen and existing collagen breaks down at a slightly faster rate.Smoking and sun damage make this worse.Around the menopause, when women stop having periods, skin loses even more collagen - about a third, say the researchers who have published their findings in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal Open Forum. There are several types of supplements people can take, including marine, bovine and vegan collagen. The review was unable to show if certain types worked better than others.Collagen supplements - The secret to perfect skin or marketing hype? Can eating collagen improve your skin and joints?Getty Images\"Collagen does have credible benefits when used consistently over time,\" says Prof SmithThe researchers from Anglia Ruskin University stress that many of the studies conducted with supplements have been funded by the supplement industry, and that \"bold claims\" have been made about collagen anti-ageing benefits. The review did not have any industry funding.One of the lead investigators, Prof Lee Smith, said: \"This study brings together the strongest evidence to date on collagen supplementation.\"Collagen is not a cure-all, but it does have credible benefits when used consistently over time, particularly for skin and osteoarthritis. Our findings show clear benefits in key areas of healthy ageing, while also dispelling some of the myths surrounding its use.\"Collagen may be best positioned not as an anti-wrinkle treatment, but for holistic maintenance for ageing and sun-damaged skin, say the researchers. Smith says: \"If we define anti-ageing as a product or technique designed to prevent the appearance of getting older, then I believe our findings do support this claim for some parameters.\"For example, an improvement in skin tone and moisture is associated with a more youthful-looking appearance.\"Skin-friendly diet Bridget Benelam, a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation, said diet was also important for skin health. \"Vitamin C helps with collagen formation and so ensuring you get enough from foods such as citrus fruits, berries, green vegetables, peppers and tomatoes may help. Zinc, found in meat, poultry, cheese, some shellfish, nuts, seeds and wholegrains, also helps the body produce collagen.\"Dietary sources of collagen and many collagen supplements are made from animal products and so not suitable for vegan diets. However, the body makes its own collagen from the amino acids found in dietary protein and so protein from sources such as beans and lentils can provide the amino acids needed for collagen production. There are also vegan supplements available.\"Dr Tamara Griffiths, president of the British Association of Dermatologists, welcomed the research but recommended more: \"Further data with targeted, robust dermatological studies are required to build on the promise raised by this systematic review.\"",

    "body": "Instagram investigating AI profiles 'fetishising' disabled people41 minutes agoJacob EvansBBC NewsReutersInstagram's parent company, Meta,  is investigating AI-generated social media accounts that sexualise disabled people appearing on its platform.It comes after the BBC flagged dozens of profiles showing AI-generated images of women with disabilities, including Down's syndrome or vitiligo.Some profiles post fake images and videos of women with missing limbs, visible scarring or in wheelchairs. Many are in sexualised positions, wearing revealing clothing. Some accounts have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in a matter of months. One profile, claiming to be conjoined twins, has about 400,000 followers, despite only joining Instagram in December 2025.Kamran Mallick, chief executive of Disability Rights UK, said the emergence of \"accounts that fetishise, mock, or monetise the identities of disabled people is nothing short of horrific\".He added: \"What we have here is technology weaponised to strip disabled people of their agency and dignity, turning our lived experiences into digital caricatures for the profit and titillation of others.\"Medical charities have also voiced concern. A spokesperson for Gemini Untwined, which funds specialist surgery for rare newborns joined by the head, said portraying conjoined twins as entertainment was \"morally reprehensible\".They added: \"We witness first-hand the medical challenges that these children and their families endure, which makes the portrayal of conjoined twins as a form of entertainment or spectacle especially problematic.\"Dr Amy Gaeta, from the University of Cambridge, told the BBC she researches how AI shifts power in relation to gender and disability. She said the internet is \"flooded\" with free and low-cost generative AI image-making tools. Generative AI is a type of software that creates new content based on patterns it has learned from existing data in response to a user's prompt.Gaeta said while some tools have restrictions on content, like banning sexually explicit prompts, others do not or can be easily bypassed. \"Sometimes, without my prompting or intent, hypersexualized images of disabled people will be generated. This clearly shows a bias in the datasets that these tools are trained upon,\" she said.ReutersThere are countless generative AI platforms, including one made by Meta itselfAn Ofcom spokesperson said it was \"tracking how AI is evolving, the risks that may emerge, and what actions may be needed to address them\".They said the watchdog's online safety rules require tech firms to tackle illegal content and protect children from harmful material - including abusive or hateful content.The Online Safety Act requires platforms like Instagram to apply terms of service consistently, including where content mocks people based on protected characteristics, like their disability.The Equality and Human Rights Commission said the accounts flagged by the BBC were \"deeply disturbing\", adding: \"It's vital there are robust regulatory powers in the digital space to protect people from harm.\"A spokesperson for Meta said it was investigating the content and that it removes material that promotes sexual exploitation or attacks people based on protected characteristics.While these accounts are generating fake personas, there is serious concern over the commands for the generative tools behind them.Alison Kerry, head of communications at disability equality charity Scope, said the practice amounted to \"discrimination dressed up as content\".She added: \"These AI images don't appear from nowhere – they're built from real disabled people's images, often without consent – and unmoderated comment threads turbocharge objectification and harassment.\"Gaeta said moderation on sites like Instagram is not strong enough.\"Even when safeguards are in place, it has been proven relatively easy to bypass these if someone is insistent enough on doing so,\" she said.\"Big tech needs to be held accountable just as much as misogyny and ableism need to be tackled.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoStar McFarlaneBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe UK unemployment rate among 16 to 24-year-olds is at the highest it's been in more than a decade.Careers experts say there are some specific things younger people can do to find work.Whether you're looking for a Saturday job or your first full-time role, here are some tips to get you started.1. Focus on skills, not the jobIt does not matter what your first job is - the transferable skills you learn are more valuable for your future career than the job itself, experts say.For example, many senior roles require strong interpersonal and communication skills, and there are plenty of entry-level jobs that offer the opportunity to develop these, says Ghislaine Dell, head of careers at Bath University.\"Your client might be a customer coming into the local shop you work in or they might be a client that wants you to develop a new piece of software for them,\" she says. \"Either way, being able to show your ability to communicate well and deliver what they're asking for is really important.\"You shouldn't overthink your first job, agrees Charlotte Bosworth, chief executive of apprenticeship provider Lifetime Training, which works with brands like Nando's and B&Q as well as the Department for International Trade.\"Just hit the market - you're more employable when you're employed,\" she says.2. Use AI to prepare Employers are increasingly looking to recruit the next generation of staff with AI skills, and there are ways to use it to help prepare your job applications too.Put the job description and company website into an AI system and ask specific questions like \"What are the top five things this employer is looking for?\" suggests Ghislaine Dell.You can use these points to help draft your application, create structure and showcase your skills in the best way, she says.If you are invited for an interview, AI can also help you prepare by generating questions you might be asked based on the industry, company and the role you're applying for, Dell says.However, she warns against using AI to write your application for you.\"Employers want you to sound like you. They don't want you to sound like the people 10 years older than you that programmed the AI,\" she says.\"It's better to sound like you with a few mistakes than a perfect clone.\"3. Introduce yourself in personFor smaller or independent businesses – local cafes, shops or pubs, for example – introducing yourself in person can help show your confidence and willingness to learn more about the business, says Charlotte Bosworth.It's also useful for you to take a look at a range of different workplaces to get an idea of what kind of environment you might want to work in.\"Even if you have already put in an application online, going in and introducing yourself in person... asking questions about the role and showing an interest in the company… might just be the thing that puts your [CV] to the top of the pile,\" she says.It's even worth visiting places that haven't got a job advertised to register your interest so they think of you if any future roles do come up.4. Let your personality shine in cover letterA cover letter can be a great opportunity to tell prospective employers who you are and what you're passionate about.It is also a \"signal\" that you've taken time to do the application, says Baz Ramaiah, research and policy director at social enterprise Youth Employment UK.\"It's an opportunity to let your personality shine,\" he says.There are many reasons employers want to hire young people and your cover letter can spell out what you bring, adds Bosworth.\"Don't underestimate the unique fresh ideas, energy and eyes you will bring to a role, regardless of how much experience you have,\" she says.5. Find resources aimed at young peopleSearch for free online resources and groups aimed at helping young people into work.\"There are lots of accessible local groups, charities and organisations that help young people who are struggling to find work. The problem is a lot of people don't know they're there,\" says Ramaiah.There are also lots of free online courses which is another way to help you skill up for applications, he says.One organisation offering such courses is the King's Trust. For people aged 16 to 30, it provides free courses including work placement programmes in a range of industries, personal development programmes, and short courses on important interviewing and CV writing skills.Youth Employment UK also offers assistance to young people including career guidance and free online courses to help build confidence and skills, and the UK government offers tips and advice to help young people build experience and confidence, and find the right career.",

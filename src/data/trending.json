    "body": "<div><div><p>11 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Daniel Sandford</span><span>UK correspondent</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>ID cards have always been viewed with suspicion in the UK. For some people they can conjure up images of authoritarian states like Germany in the 1930s, and men in jackboots barking \"May we see your papers please?\"</p><p>There were two periods when we had compulsory ID cards here in Britain. The first was during World War One. The second was from the beginning of World War Two until the early 1950s.  </p><p>When the system was abandoned in 1952, an editorial in the Guardian said: \"In this country we do not like this sort of thing. Better a little evasion and inefficiency than too much petty bureaucratic interference with the individual.\"</p></div><div><p>The last attempt to introduce an ID scheme, in 2006, was born through familiar concerns about immigration and illegal working, as well as worries about benefit fraud and terrorism. It was scrapped by the coalition government when they came to power in 2010.</p><p>Fifteen years on, Sir Keir Starmer is proposing something slightly different. Not an ID card, but a digital ID scheme. It is a way of proving your identity, and your right to work in the UK, using modern smartphone technology. </p><p>Though the government also says it \"will ensure that it works for those who aren't able to use a smartphone, with inclusion at the heart of its design\". How that would be achieved is not yet clear, though it might mean people without a smartphone have to use a physical ID card.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyl3lzzed2o\">What is the plan for digital IDs and will they be mandatory?</a></li></ul><p>Digital ID is being sold by Downing Street as a way of reducing illegal working by migrants who do not have the right to earn wages in Britain. </p><p>The rules are already - in theory - quite tough. Employers can be fined £60,000 per illegal employee if they have not done the correct checks.</p></div><div><p>The government says the proposed new digital ID - which will cost the user nothing - \"will be the authoritative proof of who someone is and their residency status in this country\".</p><p>It will include the holder's name, date of birth, photograph, and information on nationality or residency status. </p><p>Instead of involving a physical card linked to a National Identity Register, this new proposal is more a proof of identity scheme. As well as proving a person's right to work the government promise that it will in future \"make it simpler to apply for services like driving licences, childcare and welfare.\"</p><p>Ministers say that \"by the end of the parliament\" digital ID will be compulsory when checking someone's right to work. They claim that this will in turn reduce on of the \"key pull factors\" for people arriving in the UK in small boats.</p><p>\"You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID\", the prime minister said. \"It is as simple as that.\"</p><p>A more secure way of people proving their identity might reduce illegal working, and avoid the proliferation of fake documents in circulation. </p><p>At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy - but the idea is a picture would make it - in theory - harder to abuse that system.</p><p>But former Home Office official David Rennie said he did not believe the plan would have \"any bearing on people coming to this country illegally\". </p><p>\"It's the black economy - by its nature, they're not performing right to work checks,\" he told BBC Radio 4's the World at One.</p><p>Mr Rennie, who now works at Orchestrating Identity - a company that performs these checks - acknowledged the system had \"gaps\" and could be improved, with some people finding it difficult to prove they could work in the UK.</p><p>\"But that doesn't mean that you have to implement, at great expense to the taxpayer, a digital identity system for the whole country. They should really focus on improving what they've already put in place.\"</p><p>Jill Rutter, of the Institute for Government, has meanwhile emphasised the need for \"stronger Labour market enforcement\" alongside the scheme.</p><p>\"People are paying cash, people are working in what the prime minister calls the 'shadow economy',\" she said.</p><p>\"It means people won't have an excuse for not checking, saying 'I thought they were British', and people won't be able to use fake ID so easily. </p><p>\"So it will help, but I don't think it's an absolute panacea.\"</p><p>The scheme will also take time. The phrase \"by the end of the parliament\" is shorthand for 2028, when the next general election is most likely to take place. This is not something that can be done in a year.</p><p>Most EU countries have some sort of ID scheme. One of the most modern ones is in Estonia where the focus is less on preventing illegal working, and more on easy access to things like benefits and health records.</p><p>But in countries like France and Germany, which both have long-running ID schemes, illegal working is still a problem. Though the French have long-complained that one of the pull factors to the UK for people crossing the channel in small boats is that it is even easier to work illegally in Britain than it is in France.</p></div>"

Sir Keir was joined by his opposite numbers from Canada, Australia and Iceland.</p><p>And here's the thing: while they are all winners, they had the demeanour of those with pensive worry.</p><p>The rise of Reform here in the UK is far from unique.</p><p>There was a confessional vibe at times to the conversation, borne of a fear the left can exude a piety and loftiness off-putting to many.</p><p>Sir Keir's take on this was that Labour took far too long to recognise the deep-seated concerns from many about illegal immigration.</p><p>It was an observation some within Labour are weary of hearing about again, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32114331\">recalling the fuss a decade ago</a> when Labour had mugs printed with the promise of \"controls on immigration\".</p><p>Others say Labour cannot highlight its instinct to be tough too much, given the instinct of many, fairly or otherwise, is to assume they might be the opposite.</p></div><div><p>Amid the noise of this debate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn832y43ql5o\">comes the plan for digital ID</a>.</p><p>After two decades of rapid digitalisation, from the smartphone's invention to its near ubiquity, the prime minister reckons the centre of gravity around the whole issue of state-mandated ID - and our collective willingness to embrace it - has shifted.</p><p>Twenty years ago, Tony Blair was making the case for ID cards. The 'card' bit of the idea feels rather vintage, but the ID bit is back as an idea.</p><p>It is an idea still lacking in key detail, but one Sir Keir wants to enthusiastically embrace.</p><p>He told me a few weeks ago as he began to publicly toy with it that plenty of us are now much more used to handing bits of personal data to all sorts of institutions and companies we deal with online.</p><p>So, the logic goes, plenty will be comfortable doing the same thing with the government.</p><p>Let's see.</p></div><div><p>What is undoubtedly the case is that there is, again, noisy opposition to the idea.</p><p>A petition on Parliament's website has reached well over a million signatures. Only a handful have cleared that threshold in the last decade.</p><p>The prime minister will hope a quieter majority are won over by the idea – and he already has his political dividing line with Reform. And with the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, as it happens.</p><p>His challenge, against the toughest of backdrops - economic, political and international - is to prove he can deliver incremental, or better, improvements for voters, and convince enough that the embrace of Reform would be a big mistake.</p><p>Sir Keir is now unflinching and explicit, talking of what he calls the \"open fight\" he wants with Reform - a \"battle for the soul of this country\".</p><p>On that characterisation of the tussle ahead, at least, Reform agree that is precisely what it amounts to.</p></div></article>"

Musk has previously been quoted as saying that Epstein had invited him to the island but he had declined.</p><p>The partial records are from the third batch of documents produced by the Jeffrey Epstein Estate. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee say they include phone message logs, copies of flight logs and manifests for aircrafts, copies of financial ledgers and Epstein's daily schedule.</p><p>In addition to Musk and Prince Andrew, the files released publicly also contain the names of other prominent figures including internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon, a former advisor to Donald Trump</p><p>One line in the records dated 6 December 2014 reads: \"Reminder: Elon Musk to island Dec. 6 (is this still happening?)\"</p><p>A flight manifest records that Prince Andrew was on a flight with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell from Teterboro, New Jersey, to West Palm Beach, Florida, on 12 May 2000. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to traffic girls for sex.</p><p>On 11 May 2000, Buckingham Palace said on its website that Prince Andrew had flown to New York to attend a reception in New York for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Andrew returned to the UK on 15 May, a later entry said.</p></div><div><p>In the files, there is also an entry referring to a planned lunch with Peter Thiel in November 2017. </p><p>There is also an entry referring to a planned breakfast with Steve Bannon 17 February 2019.</p><p>The files also mention tentative plans for a breakfast party with Microsoft founder Bill Gates in December 2014. In 2022 Gates told the BBC that meeting Jeffrey Epstein had been a \"mistake\".</p><p>It is not suggested that those mentioned in the files were aware of the alleged criminal activity for which Epstein was later arrested.</p><p>Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>In 2008, he reached a plea deal with prosecutors after the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. </p><p>He was arrested again in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>Sara Guerrero, a spokesperson for the Democrats on the committee, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to release more files related to Epstein.</p><p>\"It should be clear to every American that Jeffrey Epstein was friends with some of the most powerful and wealthiest men in the world. Every new document produced provides new information as we work to bring justice for the survivors and victims,\" she said.</p><p>Republicans on the committee accused the Democrats of \"putting politics over victims\" and said they would release the full set of documents soon.</p></div>"

He then highlighted Israeli military operations across the past year against Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas in Gaza, and Iran.</p><p>He thanked US President Donald Trump for American involvement in bombing Iran's Fordo nuclear site in June, and drew parallels between Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel and the 9/11 attack on the US. He said the two countries were fighting the same enemies, pointing to chants of \"death to America\" by groups linked to Iran. </p></div><div><p>The Israeli prime minister repeated that Israel would not allow a Palestinian state to exist and said this position was supported by the vast majority of Israelis. </p><p>He went on to refute the conclusion of a UN commission of inquiry that<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go\"> Israel had committed genocide in Gaza</a>, claiming the charge was \"baseless\". </p><p>He also rejected statements by multiple UN agencies that Israel is deliberately restricting the amount of aid entering Gaza. In August, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4p90z1kxo\">UN-backed body confirmed that famine</a> was taking place in Gaza City.</p><p>Ahead of his speech, Netanyahu's office ordered that the Israeli military mount loudspeakers on trucks near the Gaza perimeter fence in order to broadcast his words live across the territory.</p><p>Netanyahu also claimed that Israeli intelligence had hacked the smartphones of people in Gaza and would stream his speech to them directly. BBC sources in Gaza said their phones had not been affected.</p><p>He said the intention of this was for a message to reach Israeli hostages there.</p><p>\"Our brave heroes,\" he read on the podium. \"This is Prime Minister Netanyahu speaking to you live from the United Nations. We have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you. We will not falter, and we will not rest until we bring all of you home.\"</p><p>There are 48 hostages remaining in Gaza, 20 of whom are thought to be alive.</p><p>Gaza resident Fadi told the BBC World Service's OS programme: \"What does he gain by broadcasting his speech forcibly to the besieged civilians inside the tents, except to further humiliate them?\" </p><p>Netanyahu devoted the latter section of his address to Israel's regional neighbours, saying it was close to a de-escalation agreement with Syria and calling on the Lebanese government to step-up its efforts to disarm Hezbollah.</p><p>He immediately came under fire within Israel, with opposition leader Yair Lapid writing: \"Today saw a weary and whining Israeli prime minister, in a speech overloaded with overused gimmicks\"</p><p>\"Instead of stopping the diplomatic tsunami - Netanyahu today worsened the state of the State of Israel,\" he wrote on X.</p><p>Yair Golan, leader of Israel's Democrats party said the speech showed \"only victimhood, sanctimoniousness, and complete blindness to the suffering of the hostages and the sacrifice of the fighters\". </p><p>He labelled the loudspeaker stunt \"invalid, childish, and insane\", saying it was \"propaganda show\". </p><p>A day earlier, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas said in his speech to the General Assembly that he is ready to work with world leaders to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdjgdnjnlgo\">implement a peace plan</a> for Israel and the Palestinians. </p><p>Shortly after Netanyahu finished speaking, Donald Trump separately told journalists: \"I think we have a deal on Gaza\". He did not provide further details, though speculation has been mounting that a ceasefire deal could be close.</p><p>International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering the Gaza Strip independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago, making verifying claims from both sides difficult. Some journalists have been taken into Gaza by the IDF under controlled access.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>At least 65,549 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. </p></div>"

They decided they wanted to screen out the gene that causes the disease. They had two options – either have a version of IVF whereby the embryo is tested for the gene before implantation, or conceive naturally and have the developing embryo tested.</p><p>They opted for the latter, but to be eligible for this couples have to agree to abort the foetus if the test is positive, as it was in their second pregnancy.</p><p>\"We thought carefully about what we wanted to do. In the Huntington's community not everyone agrees with screening it out. But we both knew we did not want our children growing up with the possibility of having this gene. It is such a cruel, cruel disease.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>'Hope where there was no hope'</h2><p></p><div><p>Matt, now 43, is still able to walk, but has become clumsy with his movement and also been affected mentally.</p><p>\"He has angry outbursts and has no empathy altogether. For example, if one of the children hurts themselves he will laugh. It's worse when he's tired. That's how Huntington's works – it alters your personality and that is incredibly hard for the children to understand.\"</p><p>Matt no longer works, having had to retire on health grounds when his symptoms started to develop.</p><p>\"In some ways we are lucky he got past 40 with no signs of it,\" says Gemma. \"His mother died from the disease when she was 40. And now we have the prospect of a treatment. We have got hope where there was no hope.\"</p><p>She says that is a sentiment that will be felt by the whole Huntington's disease community. </p><p>\"I work in the evenings as a counsellor, often with people with Huntington's disease. I trained partly to give something back to the community and because we needed the money as Matt is no longer earning.</p><p>\"I often support people just after they have been tested for it. Depression is the most common issue as they feel all is lost. That is why the news about the treatment is so important. It will give everyone a lift,\" she explains.</p><p>\"Our neighbours and friends are even talking about fundraising so we can pay for the treatment. I just hope it is made available on the NHS quickly.\"</p><p>That, of course, is the question on the mind of everyone who has been affected by the disease.</p><p>The BBC has been contacted by numerous families who have lost whole generations to the illness and others who have lost their loved ones to suicide because they were unable to face the inevitable decline that follows a diagnosis.</p><p>Dave, 73, from the West Midlands, lost his wife to Huntington's. His son now has the disease and he is worried the gene may have been passed on to his granddaughter.</p><p>\"It is horrible to see your loved ones suffer,\" he says. \"This treatment is desperately needed on the NHS.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>The path to the NHS</h2><p></p><div><p>Whether and how quickly the treatment will become available is not yet clear.</p><p>The company behind the therapy, uniQure, says it will apply for a licence in the US in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p>Once regulators there have assessed it and, if they approve it for use, the UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA), can piggyback off their work and put it through a quick regulatory process.</p><p>But that is only to decide if it is safe and effective. It will be up to another body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), to decide if it is affordable to be used on the NHS in England and Wales. A separate body makes that calculation for Scotland.</p><p>As a gene therapy involving brain surgery, it will be expensive. However, sources at NICE say that is not necessarily a deal-breaker. They point to the fact that a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2yg9yny0ko\">sickle cell therapy</a> that costs £1.65 million per patient and a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4nnn51rdrzo\">haemophilia B one</a> that cost £2.6 million have already been backed by the health assessment body.</p><p>Sources there said the earliest the Huntington's therapy could possibly be expected to be approved is the first half of 2027.</p><p>But that's only if everything else goes smoothly - and there are more hurdles to overcome.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8ecc/live/58f5c2c0-9ad8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8ecc/live/58f5c2c0-9ad8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8ecc/live/58f5c2c0-9ad8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8ecc/live/58f5c2c0-9ad8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8ecc/live/58f5c2c0-9ad8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8ecc/live/58f5c2c0-9ad8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8ecc/live/58f5c2c0-9ad8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8ecc/live/58f5c2c0-9ad8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp\" alt=\"A graphic showing how the gene therapy works\" /></p></div></figure><div><p>So far, just the headline findings have been released. Scientists say the full study needs to be published and assessed by independent experts to properly assess what has been achieved.</p><p>The study is also relatively small - there were just 29 participants who were followed for 36 months. This is not unusual for gene therapies, and others have made it onto the NHS off the back of small-scale trials. The case for this treatment is particularly strong given there are no current treatment options for the disease.</p><p>But even if this therapy is licensed, it is only going to help a small portion of Huntington's disease patients as it's aimed at those with early-stage symptoms or those who haven't developed any yet. The complex nature of the surgery also means only specialist centres will be able to perform it.</p><p>Some scientists have pointed out that it is not yet certain the benefits will last long-term.</p><p>But Prof David Rubinsztein, deputy director of the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, says the scale of this breakthrough should still not be underestimated. </p><p>He says it offers \"real hope\" for this devastating disease and if the approach is successfully validated in the coming months it could even have broader implications for treating other neurodegenerative diseases from Parkinson's disease and MND to dementia.</p><p>Gemma appreciates there is still some way to go before Matt can benefit, but she says for the first time in a long time she can be optimistic about the future. </p><p>\"It's like a dream - I can start thinking about growing old with my husband. That would mean the world to me and my children.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>What is Huntington's disease?</h2><p></p><div><p>Huntington's disease is caused by an error in part of our DNA called the huntingtin gene.</p><p>If one of your parents has Huntington's disease, there's a 50% chance that you will inherit the altered gene and will eventually develop Huntington's too.</p><p>This mutation turns a normal protein needed in the brain – called the huntingtin protein – into a killer of neurons.</p><p>The goal of the treatment is to reduce levels of this toxic protein permanently, in a single dose.</p><p>The therapy uses cutting edge genetic medicine combining gene therapy and gene silencing technologies.</p></div></article>"

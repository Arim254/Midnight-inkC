On the arduous trek lasting more than two weeks, he carried food, tents and equipment up to base camp - and was one of three Sherpas to make it past an altitude of 8,000m (26,247ft).Fellow Nepali mountain guides have described him as a legend and an inspiration.Kanchha Sherpa worked as an high-altitude porter in the Himalayan mountains for two more decades after the expedition, until his wife asked him to stop making the dangerous journeys.",

    "body": "3 hours agoChristal Hayesin Los Angeles The family of actress Diane Keaton has thanked fans for their \"extraordinary messages of love and support\" following the actress's death aged 79.The Keaton family said in a statement to People magazine that the Oscar winner's death was caused by pneumonia.Keaton shot to fame in the 1970s for her work in The Godfather films, and also starred in Father of the Bride, Something's Gotta Give, First Wives Club and Annie Hall - for which she won an Academy Award in 1978.The actress's death in California on Saturday led to an outpouring of tributes from Hollywood legends, including co-stars in some of her most popular films.\"The Keaton family are very grateful for the extraordinary messages of love and support they have received these past few days on behalf of their beloved Diane, who passed away from pneumonia on October 11,\" read the statement to People magazine, which first reported Keaton's death.The BBC has asked for comment from the actress's representatives. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can be caused by many different germs, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some people are considered to be at higher risk due to their age, or if they have any underlying health conditions.The Keaton family statement also asked that any donations or support be directed to causes that were important to the actress, primarily local food banks or an animal shelter. Among those who have paid tribute to Keaton in recent days are First Wives Club co-star Goldie Hawn, who said Keaton left \"a trail of fairy dust, filled with particles of light and memories beyond imagination\". Bette Midler, who co-starred alongside the pair in the film, called Keaton \"brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary\". Steve Martin, who starred with Keaton in Father of the Bride alongside Martin Short, reposted an excerpt of a magazine article in which Short is quoted asking: \"Who's sexier, me or Steve Martin?\" Keaton replies: \"I mean, you're both idiots.\" In his post, Martin wrote: \"Don't know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane.\"Throughout her more than five-decade career, Keaton starred in dozens of other films including The Family Stone, Because I Said So, And So It Goes, as well as a number of Woody Allen films, like Play It Again, Sam, Sleeper, Love and Death and Manhattan.For Annie Hall, Keaton won the Academy Award for Best Actress along with a Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award. Keaton was nominated for three other Oscars throughout her storied career - all in the best actress category - for her work in Something's Gotta Give, Marvin's Room and Reds.As well as her acting achievements, Keaton was known for her trademark style, and favoured wearing turtlenecks, hats and thick-rimmed eyeglasses. That style was even referenced in the film Something's Gotta Give, in which Keaton told Jack Nicholson's character that she's \"just a turtleneck kinda gal\". ",

    "body": "Australia's tropical rainforests have become the first in the world to release more carbon than they absorb, in a trend linked to climate change, a study has found. Rainforests are usually regarded as so-called \"carbon sinks\" as they absorb more emissions than they emit with new trees offsetting the carbon released by dead ones.But a study looking at data from Queensland forests found that extreme temperatures have caused more tree deaths than growths.The lead author of the study, which was published in science journal Nature, said the findings have significant implications for global emissions reduction targets which are partly based on how ecosystems - such as rainforests - can absorb carbon.\"Current models may overestimate the capacity of tropical forests to help offset fossil fuel emissions,\" said Dr Hannah Carle of the Western Sydney University.With fewer new trees, the report found that the trunks and branches of dead trees - known as woody biomass - became carbon emitters, rather than carbon absorbers, about 25 years ago.\"Forests help to curb the worst effects of climate change by absorbing some of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels, but our work shows this is under threat,\" said Dr Carle.Dr Carle added that said an increase in trees dying in recent decades was due to climate change such as more extreme temperatures, atmospheric dryness and drought.Based on 49 years of data from 20 forests in Queensland, the report also found a rise in the number of cyclones and the severity of them was killing more trees and making it harder for new ones to grow. \"We have in this study evidence that Australia's moist tropical forests are the first of their kind globally to to exhibit this [woody biomass] change,\" Dr Carle said. \"And that's really significant. It could be a sort of canary in the coal mine.\"Senior author Patrick Meir also described the results as \"very concerning\", telling news agency AFP that it was \"likely that all tropical forests [would] respond fairly similarly\" - but added that more data and research would be needed to make a fair assessment. Australia, one of the world's biggest polluters per capita, recently announced its new carbon reduction targets, pledging to cut emissions by at least 62% compared to 2005 levels over the next decade.The country continues to face global criticism for its continued reliance on fossil fuels, with the government allowing one of the country's largest gas projects -Woodside's North West Shelf - to keep operating for another 40 years.Last month, a new report into the impact of climate change found Australia had already reached warming of above 1.5C and that no community would be immune from \"cascading, compounding and concurrent\" climate risks.",

    "body": "17 minutes agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporter andJoshua NevettPolitical reporterPA MediaChinese state operatives present a daily national security threat to the UK, the head of MI5 Sir Ken McCallum has said.In a speech, he said MI5 had intervened operationally to disrupt Chinese activity of national security concern in the past week.Addressing a row over the collapse of a case involving alleged spying on behalf of China in the UK, McCallum said the alleged activity was disrupted by MI5 and that it was \"frustrating when prosecutions fall through\".The government and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are facing questions over the collapse of the case.The controversy over the collapsed China spy case explainedChris Mason: Digesting the key segments and changes in China documentsThe CPS dropped the case last month after deciding the evidence did not show China was a threat to national security.But witness statements from the UK's deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins - published late on Wednesday - are clear that the Chinese are carrying out spying operations against the UK, raising questions for the government and the CPS about why the prosecutions did not go ahead.In the documents, he said China was carrying out \"large scale espionage\" against the UK and was \"the biggest state-based threat to the country's economic security\".The Conservatives have accused the government of allowing the case to collapse to avoid jeopardising economic relations with China.This is firmly denied by the government, who blame the previous Tory administration who were in charge when Mr Collins sent his first evidence statement, for the collapse of the prosecution.The head of the CPS Stephen Parkinson is also in the firing line, with MPs suggesting there was sufficient evidence to put the case before a jury.He is reported to have told senior MPs on Wednesday that the evidence was \"5%\" short of what would have been required to stand a chance of getting a conviction.Labour MP Matt Western, who heads the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy - made up by senior MPs and peers, said he was launching an inquiry into the collapse of the case. Elsewhere in his speech, Ken McCallum said state threats, principally from Russia, China and Iran, are escalating. In the past year MI5 has seen a 35% increase in the number of individuals it has been investigating.On terrorism, he twice expressed his condolences to the victims of the recent attack at a Manchester synagogue. This year, he said, MI5 and the police had disrupted 19 late-stage attack plots and intervened in many hundreds of developing threats.In the first witness statement, sent in December 2023, Mr Collins outlines the case against  former parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and academic Christopher Berry, 33.The pair are accused of collaborating with a Chinese Communist Party leader who was deputy director of the Central National Security Commission, chaired by President Xi Jinping.In one message, Mr Cash is alleged to have told Mr Berry: \"You're in spy territory now.\" Both men deny any wrongdoing.The second witness statement, written by Mr Collins in February 2025, after Labour had taken power, said China's spying threatened \"the UK's economic prosperity and resilience\".A third witness statement published in August this year restated the UK's view of the challenge posed by China.But the two statements submitted under Labour made clear the government was \"committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China\".China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said: \"China's position is very clear: we firmly oppose peddling China spy narratives and vilifying China.\"PA MediaChristopher Berry (left) and Christopher Cash (right) were both accused of spying for ChinaIn a Commons debate, former Security Minister Tom Tugendhat, for whom Mr Cash was a parliamentary researcher, asked the government: \"Who the hell's side are you on?\"The Tory MP said: \"May I start by saying very briefly quite how this feels. My home has been broken into. My files have been ransacked. Somebody has been put into my office by a hostile state, and the two parties are playing politics with it.\"He accused the government of being obsessed with following the correct process, rather than doing everything it could \"to make sure the prosecution works\".\"Well, who the hell's side are you on?\" he asked Ward, who had been given the job of defending the government.Ward said he fully appreciated how the case had personally affected Tugendhat but the government's position was that \"there will be no interference with the CPS in the process of this\" and \"every effort\" would be made to support their case.In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Mr Cash said he had been placed in an \"impossible situation\" because he had not \"had the daylight of a public trial to show my innocence\".He added: \"The statements that have been made public are completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial.\"While Mr Berry has previously denied spying for China, he has not commented since the day the case ended.Tory MP Tom Tugendhat: \"Who the hell's side are you on?\"ReutersSir Keir said he would publish the statements after Kemi Badenoch accused him of a \"cover-up\"Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who previously employed Mr Cash as a parliamentary researcher, said Mr Collins's third statement includes language about China similar to that in Labour's election manifesto last year.The witness statement and the manifesto both include the words \"we will co-operate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must\".\"There's a direct lift from the Labour Party manifesto,\" Kearns said. \"It's very hard to believe there was no political interference and that a civil servant would have felt the need to do that.\"But she said there been \"misleading discussion\" about whether China was deemed a threat to national security at the time of the alleged offences in 2023.\"In my view, the Crown Prosecution Service should have proceeded with this,\" Kearns said.She added: \"The case law shows it's for a jury to decide if China is or could be a threat to our country.\"BBC News understands that Mr Collins assumed he had given enough evidence for the prosecution to continue when he submitted his third witness statement in August 2025.A government source pointed to comments made by him where he described \"the increasing Chinese espionage threat posed to the UK\" as an example of why he believed he had said enough to satisfy the CPS's threshold for prosecution.It is also understood that the CPS contacted Mr Collins after his first witness statement to ask for further clarification on the threat posed by China, but that they were not explicitly clear what the official would need to say in subsequent statements, in order to meet the CPS's threshold.Mr Cash and Mr Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.The director of public prosecutions has said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said the witness statements raised \"yet more unanswered questions\", adding: \"We clearly need a statutory public inquiry to get to the bottom of this whole fiasco.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoDearbail JordanWatch: Wreckage of the Titan submersible on the ocean floor OceanGate's Titan submersible imploded on its journey to the wreck of the Titantic because of poor engineering and multiple failures to test the vessel, according to an official report.Titan imploded in June 2023, killing all five passengers on board including OceanGate's chief executive.The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the engineering process behind the vehicle was \"inadequate\", resulting in faults which meant it failed to meet strength and durability requirements.The NTSB said because the firm did not adequately test Titan it did not know its actual strength. It was also unaware it was damaged and should have been removed from service before its last voyage.Titan footage shows wreckage of destroyed hull on sea floorWhat the Titan failure has taught us about exploring the deep oceanImplosion: The Titanic Sub DisasterTitan disappeared in the North Atlantic as it attempted to dive to the wreck of Titanic which lies some 372 miles from St. John's in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada.In August, the US Coast Guard released a damning report into the implosion which found that the incident was \"preventable\" and criticised OceanGate's \"critically flawed\" safety practices.Stockton Rush, OceanGate's chief executive and co-founder, operated the Titan on its final journey.The passengers, who paid up to $250,000 each to take part in the dive, deep-sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood and Hamish Harding.Designed and built by OceanGate, the Titan was 6.7m (22ft) long with a passenger compartment made of carbon fibre, with titanium used in its domes and some other segments.The doomed submersible which imploded at a depth of 3,363m (11,033ft) - the Titanic wreck is located at 3,880m - was the second version of the craft. OceanGate had condemned the first version following testing.During its investigation, the NTSB discovered issues with the safety culture at OceanGate.While some employees said safety was a priority, others, including a former director of marine operations and a technician, highlighted an environment \"where safety issues, particularly design issues, were ignored\".One technician at the firm said he had concerns about OceanGate's business model, in particular accepting paying clients as \"mission specialists\" as opposed to passengers.Under US regulations, it is illegal to transport passengers in an experimental submersible.The technician told the NTSB that he informed Mr Rush: \"… you can't just change the title of a person when you're receiving compensation.\" In a later conversation on the same subject, the technician recounted that Mr Rush said: \"If the [US] Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away\".OceanGate has permanently wound down its operations since the incident.In its report, the NTSB discovered that a contributing factor to the implosion was that US and international voluntary guidance and US small passenger vessel regulations \"were insufficient to ensure OceanGate adhered to established industry standards\".The NTSB has recommended that the US Coast Guard commissions a study into how so-called pressure vessels which carry people are assessed and, if changes are suggested, regulations be updated.

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterFood and beverage giant Nestle said it will cut 16,000 jobs over the next two years, as its new CEO Philipp Navratil pushes to focus on products with the \"highest potential returns\".The Swiss company must \"change faster\" to keep pace with a changing world and adopt a \"performance mindset\" that does not accept losing market share to rivals, said Mr Navratil. He replaced former CEO Laurent Freixe who was fired in September over a romantic relationship with an employee.The job cuts were announced on Thursday as Nestle reported better sales figures in the first nine months of 2025, selling more products across its major categories, including coffee and sweets.The world's largest packaged food and drink company, Nestle owns hundreds of brands, including Nescafe, KitKat and Maggi.Nestle plans to get rid of 12,000 white collar jobs on top of 4,000 other roles across the board within the next two years, it said in a statement.The lay-offs will save the food giant around 1bn SFr (£940m) annually as part of an ongoing cost-savings effort, it said.Nestle's share price was up 7.5% shortly after its trading update and job cuts were announced.Mr Navratil said: \"We are fostering a culture that embraces a performance mindset, that does not accept losing market share, and where winning is rewarded... The world is changing, and Nestle needs to change faster.Such change would include \"hard but necessary decisions to reduce headcount\", he said.Equity analyst Diana Radu said the update signalled that Mr Navratil wants to \"bring greater transparency to areas that were previously more opaque in Nestle's cost-saving plans\".The job cuts, she said, appear to be an effort to \"reset expectations and rebuild investor confidence through measurable actions\".Mr Navratil's predecessor was sacked by Nestle in early September after an investigation into whistleblower allegations that he did not disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate.The company's outgoing chair Paul Bulcke brought forward his departure date and left his post in the same month.It was reported at the time that investors blamed Mr Bulcke for the company's ongoing problems.Last year, an investigation found Nestle baby food products sold in low- and middle-income countries contained unhealthily high levels of sugar.The research, by a Swiss NGO and the International Baby Food Action Network, found that in many cases, the same products sold in wealthy countries had no added sugar.",

    "body": "29 minutes agoHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentHouse of CommonsThe witness statements published by the government last night are hefty, detailed and shed more light than ever before on what the two men were accused of.The disclosure followed a political row over the sudden collapse of the case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who were accused of spying for China.The controversy over the collapsed China spy case explainedIt is worth at the outset stressing that Cash and Berry have consistently denied wrongdoing, the claims against them have never been tested in court and the government's witness statements proceed explicitly on the basis that the allegations levelled by counter-terror police are true.The publication of the evidence has raised a series of new questions for the government and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to answer about the case, in addition to what might come next.Here's an examination of the key ones:Questions for prosecutorsFirstly, the witness statements provoke more questions for the CPS, which carries out criminal prosecutions on behalf of the state and ultimately took the controversial decision to drop the case.In the first witness statement Matthew Collins, the government's deputy national security adviser, said that there are areas where the Chinese state poses \"a threat to our people, prosperity and security\".In the second, he describes various ways in which the government believes it has been hacked by Chinese state actors.In the third, he talks of the \"active espionage threat\" posed by China to the UK, identifying specific activities they had carried out.Why was that not enough for the CPS to proceed with the case? Did they really believe that on that basis they would be unable to convince a judge to proceed, and a jury of the severity of the threat posed by China?Is the CPS position that the government's witness statement did not quite use the right formulation of words to make its point about the challenge of China? If so, did they specifically ask the government to use a different form of words? Would it even be appropriate to seek to shape a witness's evidence in such a way?These are questions that senior MPs asked the head of the CPS - Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Stephen Parkinson - about in a private meeting yesterday. It seems they were unimpressed by his answers.Questions for the governmentThere are questions for the government thrown up by the witness statements too. The first witness statement, which is by far the most extensive, was prepared and submitted when Rishi Sunak was prime minister. But the latter two were filed earlier this year after Labour came to office.Sir Keir Starmer's position over the past few weeks - and remember he used to run the CPS - has been that the only relevant point to this case is what the government's posture towards China was at the time of the alleged offences, which is to say when the Conservatives were in office.Yet, the very final paragraph of the third witness statement, from this August, says: \"It is important to emphasise that the UK government is committed to pursuing a positive relationship with China… we will co-operate where we can, compete where we need to; and challenge where we must.\"That final part is copied and pasted, essentially, from the Labour manifesto of 2024. It is, in other words, the Labour government position on China.If the government was constrained in the way that the prime minister has repeatedly said, then why was that in there?The answer from government sources on that is that Collins was merely offering wider context about the government's approach to China given that the case was set to be heard in open court in 2025 - nothing more than that. They argue that as a matter of law it is still the case that all that mattered to the case was the Conservative government's position at the time of the alleged offences and this paragraph does not change that.Other questionsAs interesting as these witness statements are, it's worth remembering that the core allegation being made by the Conservatives in recent days - furiously denied by the government - is that the latter two witness statements supplied by Collins were influenced by Labour ministers or Labour advisers in such a way as to make the case more likely to collapse.The witness statements do not do anything to substantiate that claim. That said, Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, is arguing today that the inclusion of the Labour policy towards China raises the question of whether this was suggested to Collins by a government minister or adviser. Again, government sources are adamant that the answer to this is no.It is worth remembering again that the first witness statement was filed under the Conservatives. The Conservative position now is, implicitly, that ministers should have tried to make the latter two witness statements as strong as possible because of the seriousness of the allegations. It would be interesting to know what involvement, if any, Conservative ministers or advisers had with the original witness statement.What happens next?It seems inevitable that Mr Parkinson will be called to give evidence to a parliamentary select committee so that MPs can pursue in public view the question of why he decided to drop the case.It also seems likely that somebody from government will have to give public evidence to a select committee about this case, beyond a private evidence session scheduled for late November with Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser.The most significant ramifications of this row may prove to be unrelated to the specifics of this case.It has provoked serious allegations from Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's former chief adviser, about Chinese penetration of sensitive British data - which have only been partially denied. It has precipitated the publication of witness statements describing at length serious concerns held by the UK government about China's activities and intentions.Questions about the threat posed by China are now at the heart of British political debate in a way they have not been for some time.All this while Olly Robbins, the head of the diplomatic service, is in China for long-planned meetings, months after Chancellor Rachel Reeves led a trip to the country to seek deeper trade ties, with Starmer still expected to become the first prime minister to visit the country since Theresa May in 2018, and with a decision looming over China's application to build a new embassy in central London.Has this row made the government's intended diplomatic and economic approach to China politically unviable - is a hardening of the UK's stance now inevitable? That may be the most important unanswered question of the lot.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterA nervous fart cuts through tension in the TraitorsSpoiler warning: This article reveals details from the third episode of The Celebrity TraitorsThere were murders, betrayals... and a fart.The third episode of The Celebrity Traitors has taken place, and veteran British actress Celia Imrie releasing wind at a tense point in the game was one of the moments that got viewers talking.\"What just happened?\" presenter Claudia Winkleman demanded to know.\"I just farted, Claudia. It's nerves, but I always own up,\" responded Imrie, sparking howls of laughter.Winkleman then had to tell the celebrities to settle down, before they launched into a tough challenge.Murder, betrayal and lies - why we're attracted to The Traitors' dark sideCelebrity contestant Kate Garraway told ITV's Good Morning Britain: \"It was so loud! How could somebody so elegant, so petite, so gracious, let off that huge sound?\"And it was so nerve-racking in a serious moment. It was my favourite, favourite moment in that cabin, which was deeply unpleasant.\"She's adorable, we salute you.\"Fans online were left in hysterics, with one X user calling it \"the TV highlight of the year\", while another said we'd \"peaked as a nation\".\"Critically acclaimed thespian Celia Imrie farts like the rest of us folks,\" noted showbiz reporter Catrina Rose.But the latest episode wasn't all fun and games.Before long, two of the younger celebrities had been forced to leave the show.BBC/Studio LambertSome fans raised concerns that Niko Omilana was banished because he was an \"outsider\"First up, Youtube star Niko Omilana, who was thought to be a Traitor by celebrities including actor Sir Stephen Fry.After his banishment, the 27-year-old revealed that he had, in fact, always been a faithful.His departure sparked a backlash online by some fans, who were unhappy to see him go.\"They've all been cowards there,\" wrote one X user, adding: \"Niko has been voted because he's an outsider and he's not in their celebrity world. Nothing to do with the game.\"In a TikTok video posted later, Omilana seemed to address the speculation by showing him being shunned and spat on by groups of friends. He captioned it: \"POV: You try and make friends in the Traitors.\"\"Niko being eliminated has sent shockwaves through social media,\" said entertainment journalist Indigo Stafford.\"For many viewers, his elimination came out of nowhere. And now a new theory is spreading online about the real reason Niko was voted out... which is that the other contestants didn't know him well,\" she said.\"Since many of the celebs tend to move in the same circles, some fans are convinced that him being an outsider is what unnerved them.\"Who are the two big dogs on Celebrity Traitors?The episode also saw Olympic diver Tom Daley, 31, murdered by the traitors.He said he was \"gutted\", but TV presenter Jonathan Ross - a traitor - quipped, \"gold medals don't count as shields do they\".Wednesday's action-packed episode concluded with actress and comedian Tameka Empson being banished at the roundtable, following suspicions that she too could be a traitor (spoiler - she wasn't).'Tom's been murdered. Deal with it'Elsewhere, the third episode marked a shift in character for comedian - and Traitor - Alan Carr.Gone was the nervously giggling Carr, who we were all a bit worried for. Instead, he seemed to be embracing being a Traitor.In the turret, when plotting over who to murder next, he quipped: \"I've got a taste for it now,\" following his earlier murder of singer Paloma Faith.Later on, at breakfast, he appeared to roll his eyes at the other celebrities' reactions to Tom Daley's death.\"People couldn't believe it, 'Where's Tom? Why Tom?' Well he's been murdered. Deal with it.\"\"Alan has happily become a killing machine,\" observed Rose.Once again, fans were left with a cliffhanger, as the Traitors weighed up whether to murder actress Ruth Codd, singer Charlotte Church, or historian David Olusoga.But the episode ended on a lighter note, as Carr admitted to Imrie why he'd voted for her to be banished.\"Can I be honest with you?,\" he said. \"It was that fart in the hut.\"The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer. There will be nine episodes.More on The Celebrity Traitors",

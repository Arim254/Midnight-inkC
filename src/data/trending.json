    "body": "A fracture in a straight section of track \"occurred prior to the passage\" of a high-speed train that derailed, causing last Sunday's rail disaster in which 45 people died, an initial report has found.A train run by private company Iryo derailed last Sunday and its rear carriages crossed on to the opposite track into the path of an oncoming train run by state-owned Renfe.The CIAF rail investigation commission said not only did Iryo train's front carriages which stayed on the track have \"notches\" in their wheels, but three earlier trains that went over the track earlier did too.A gap of almost 40cm (15in) in the track has become the focus of the investigation into the crash.Sunday's deadly collision occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the Iryo train left Málaga for Madrid.The train's last three carriages - carriages six to eight - derailed and collided with the Huelva-bound Renfe train. \"Carriage six derailed due to a complete lack of continuity in the track,\" the preliminary report finds.Most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the state-operated train.Earlier this week, Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente confirmed reports that grooves were found on the wheels of the Iryo train's carriages, which had passed over the track safely.\"These notches in the wheels and the deformation observed in the track are compatible with the fact that the track was cracked,\" the CIAF preliminary report said.It added that three trains that had gone over the tracks at 17:21 on Sunday, 19:01 and then 19:09 had similar notches \"with a compatible geometric pattern\".Similar grooves are found on carriages two, three and four of the Iryo train, the report says, but carriage five  - the last that did not derail -  had a groove on its outer edge, suggesting the rail was already tilting outwards before carriage six derailed.The CIAF called its report a \"working hypothesis\", adding that it \"must be corroborated by later detailed calculations and analysis\".The transport minister appeared before reporters again on Friday to say that it was too early to have definitive answers, but that if the cause of the crash was the fracture, then it occurred in the minutes and hours before the derailment and could not have been detected.The Adamuz disaster is is the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade. In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured.",

    "body": "52 minutes agoEmma SimpsonBusiness correspondentPost Office and Fujitsu have been accused of driving up legal costs and delaying a former sub-postmaster from suing them for £4m in damages over the Horizon IT scandal, the High Court heard.Lee Castleton OBE was pursued by the Post Office to recover £25,000 of cash it alleged was missing from his branch in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, in 2007. His two-year legal fight saw him declared bankrupt following legal costs of £321,000.At the first hearing in his claim on Friday, the court was told that Fujitsu, the company responsible for the faulty software, had already racked up more than £700,000 in legal costs.Mr Castleton is the first individual to take legal action against both organisations.Friday's preliminary hearing was about how the case should proceed.The court heard that \"hurdles\" were being put in front of Mr Castleton to make his claim as \"difficult, time-consuming and expensive as possible\".His legal team allege the Post Office's decision to pursue its 2007 civil claim against him was an \"abuse of process of the court\", and that the eventual judgment was obtained by fraud.They also all claim the state-run institution conspired with Fujitsu to pervert the course of justice by \"deliberately and dishonestly\" withholding evidence.Mr Castleton was one of 555 sub-postmasters who took the Post Office to court in an epic legal battle, led by Sir Alan Bates.They won their case in 2019 and agreed a settlement but they never received proper compensation because the money they received was largely swallowed up by the huge costs to fund their case.Mr Castleton wants that settlement to be set aside, alleging it was fraudulently obtained involving  \"sharp practice\" by the Post Office.Both Post Office and Fujitsu are yet to file a defence to Mr Castleton's claims but called for his case to be split into two trials.They want a court to decide if the settlement agreement bars the former sub-postmaster from proceeding with his own individual claim and if it does, this would \"dispose of the proceedings in their entirety\". Doing it this way, they argued, would save time and money.But in written arguments on behalf of Mr Castleton, the court heard the reverse would be true and that his claim was of the \"utmost simplicity.\"His barrister, Paul Marshall KC, rejected the need for a separate trial.But at the conclusion of the hearing, Mr Justice Trower and Judge Francesca Kaye ordered for the trials to be split in two, saying they would give the reasons for their decision at a later date.The Post Office, which is owned by the government, said it had made every effort to engage with Mr Castleton to overturn his civil judgment and remained more than willing to do so, but it did not accept his current claim was \"a good one and it had a duty to its shareholders to defend it\".Mr Castleton wants \"vindication\" that the judgement against him, that had \"blighted\" his and his family's life for 20 years, was obtained dishonestly by the Post Office and for a judge to decide what he is owed.Speaking outside of court, Mr Castleton told the BBC: \"We know what we need to do and we're very happy where we are. \"We'll get a defence and that's what we've been waiting for. The facts aren't going to change. It's just the money.\"Mr Castleton's case is one of the most high profile in the scandal in which hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongfully convicted after faulty software made it look like money was missing from their branch accounts.While other victims have seen their convictions overturned, Castleton's civil judgement against him still stands.",

    "body": "The trial of alleged Rochdale grooming gang members collapsed after a judge was told about a WhatsApp group involving jurors.The case being heard at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court involved six men accused of rape and other sexual offences against two teenage girls between 2003 and 2006. Proceedings were halted in December after jurors, instructed not to conduct their own research or discuss the case outside of the jury room, were found to have been messaging each other about a broadcast on grooming gangs. Judge Matthew Corbett-Jones agreed with defence barristers that the matter raised \"real concerns\" the jury would not follow legal directions. The court heard that in one chat exchange, a member of the group warned that viewing the broadcast was contrary to the judge's directions, but one responded: \"I'm going to watch it anyway,\" followed by a smiley emoji. Another juror messaged that they too would watch the broadcast.The matter came to light when another juror reported the WhatsApp group to court officials, and an investigation was launched. The two jurors who said they would watch the broadcast were questioned but claimed they had not actually viewed it.Defence barristers suggested the pair may not be telling the truth and the prosecution invited the judge to further question the two jurors.However Judge Corbett-Jones agreed with an application to discharge the jury, telling the court: \"With considerable regret and disappointment, I have reached the conclusion that the multiplicity of problems which have now arisen and the uncertainty as regards these issues means that whatever course of action I take, unanswered questions remain.\"In light of that, no course of action that I can reasonably take can cure the position that now exists because of these multi-layered difficulties.\"Reporting restrictions on the reasons for the discharge of the jury were lifted on Friday following an application from the Manchester Evening News.A re-trial is set to take place in August.Tahir Rashid, 54, and Mohammed Saleem, 46, both from Rochdale; Iftaq Hussain, 45, of Shawforth; and Sucklane Shah, 46, of no fixed abode, all deny rape.Arshad Mohammed, 55, of Rochdale, denies rape and assault by penetration, while Amjad Mahmood, 53, also of Rochdale, denies rape, indecent assault, indecency with a child and assault by penetration.Rashid also pleaded not guilty to the rape of another young girl in the late 1980s.Listen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on BBC Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram, and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

    "body": "Danish PM in Greenland for 'show of support' after Trump threats52 minutes agoAdrienne MurrayCopenhagenReutersFrederiksen (left) said there was now a \"diplomatic, political track\" to pursue after a difficult weekDanish PM Mette Frederiksen is visiting Greenland's capital Nuuk for talks with the territory's leader, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, after a rollercoaster week that saw US President Donald Trump roll back his threats to forcibly take over the Arctic island and agree to further negotiations.Tensions had risen precariously over the past couple of weeks, until a stunning turnaround on Wednesday, when Trump suddenly ruled out military action, and withdrew his threats to slap tariffs on several European allies.Trump posted on social media that a \"framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland\" had been reached, following his meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in Davos.However, few details have been given, and there are questions about what exactly was agreed between the US president and the secretary general.The Danish prime minister travelled directly from Brussels, where she also met face-to-face with Rutte earlier on Friday morning. According to Rutte's post on X, they agreed \"to enhance deterrence and defence in the Arctic\".After landing at Nuuk airport, Frederiksen was greeted on the tarmac by Nielsen, who gave her a hug.\"I am first and foremost in Greenland today to show our strong Danish support for the Greenlandic people,\" she told reporters. \"It's a very difficult time, everyone can see that.\"\"It is a serious situation we are in. Everyone can see that. Now there is a diplomatic, political track that we will pursue,\" she said. Her trip was a \"working\" visit to prepare their \"next steps,\" she said.On Thursday, Trump told Fox News that the US \"gets everything we want at no cost\" and that a \"piece\" of his planned \"Golden Dome\" missile defence system would be placed on Greenland.When asked if this was an actual \"acquisition\", he answered: \"It's total access. There's no end, there's no time limit.\"Previously the New York Times reported that one idea under discussion was Denmark ceding sovereignty over small pockets of land where the US would build military bases.Danish and Greenlandic officials have  pushed back strongly against giving up any form of ownership, and repeatedly stated that sovereignty is a \"red line\".Ahead of an emergency European summit in the Belgian capital on Thursday evening, Frederiksen said that Greenland's sovereignty was non-negotiable, though Denmark was willing to work on \"security\".ReutersFrederiksen (centre-left in light-brown) has described Greenland's sovereignty as a \"red line\"The US has around 150 military personnel at its single Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory.Under a defence pact with Denmark, dating back to 1951, the US can already build up its military presence and deploy further troops.That was updated in 2004, jointly with the Bush administration, to include Greenland as an equal partner to the deal.AFP has reported that sources familiar with talks had said the US and Denmark would renegotiate the 1951 agreement.Danish national newspaper Berlingske also writes that a renegotiation is possible, that the Danish and Greenlandic sides have not ruled out revising that deal. However, mineral rights or the surrender of territory have never been on the table.The BBC has reached out to Denmark's Ministry of Defence, which declined to comment.Meanwhile Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Friday there had been no detailed plan, but that negotiations would start soon, focusing on \"security, security, and security\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoChris MasonPolitical editorThe prime minister's condemnation of Donald Trump's remarks about the war in Afghanistan are his strongest public criticisms of the president yet.They come in a week where circumstances have led Sir Keir Starmer to conclude three times that it was necessary to publicly rebuke a man he has ploughed so much effort into building a strong relationship with.I am told Sir Keir, on returning to Downing Street on Friday afternoon, saw it as essential to make his views clear in the most direct terms.His tone and body language conveyed his anger, as did his words, in which he said what President Trump had said was \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The president had claimed that the Nato defence alliance, of which the UK is a member, had sent \"some troops\" to Afghanistan, but they \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"The comments, which are factually inaccurate, have been widely seen as crass and deeply offensive.Four hundred and fifty-seven British service personnel died in the conflict and many more suffered life changing injuries.The prime minister's team tell me Sir Keir sees standing up for and defending the armed forces as a first order duty of his role, as both those serving and those killed in conflict can't speak publicly for themselves.Sir Keir's response to the president is the third time in five days he has had to reach a quick judgement on how to calibrate a public response in defending what he sees as first principles under attack from the White House.The first came on Monday morning, with his case for the sanctity of the sovereignty of Greenland and a plea for \"calm discussion\".Within 24 hours, the president was lobbing around insults about the government's deal over the Chagos Islands.Little wonder, perhaps, that No 10 approached Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday with a sense that what he planned to say there wasn't without risk.His language and tone on the president's then ambitions for Greenland hardened, as he said the UK \"will not yield\" to pressure from Washington.While the prime minister's interventions on Monday and Wednesday were seen by officials through the prism of diplomacy and the reaction they might provoke, his remarks on Friday were approached with a different mindset. I'm told the judgement was more simple: it was categorically the right thing to do, the prime minister concluded, given the gravity of offence the president had caused.If Sir Keir manages a moment over the weekend to reflect on the last seven days, you have to wonder if he may judge it was a turning point in his relationship with President Trump.It is a relationship he prizes and cherishes. Plenty have praised him for pulling it off, others have criticised him for hugging a deeply controversial President too close.His argument has long been a close relationship is in the national interest.The question now is how typical weeks like the last one might become, if the president's penchant for what many see as outrage, insult and provocation becomes ingrained.",

    "body": "1 hour agoKayla EpsteinandNatalie ShermanHundreds of businesses in Minnesota will shut their doors on Friday as part of an economic protest against the immigration crackdown in their state.Organisers called for residents to skip work or school, if possible, and refrain from shopping, in a show of opposition to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).They also planned rallies in St Paul and Minneapolis, two cities that have seen intense immigration enforcement activity.The Trump administration characterises the immigration enforcement as a public safety operation aimed at deporting alleged criminals who are in the country illegally. Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained too.Thousands of federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota as part of \"Operation Metro Surge\". On Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the government had arrested \"10,000 criminal illegal aliens in Minnesota,\" since President Donald Trump returned to office one year ago.But the killing of 37-year-old Minneapolis woman Renee Good earlier this month has sparked widespread protests across the state and condemnation from local officials.While many protests remain peaceful, some have led to violent clashes between demonstrators and federal officers. \"We want ICE out of Minnesota, and we want ICE out of every state, with their extreme overreach,\" said Bishop Dwayne Royster, whose organisation Faith in Action is supporting local partners in Minneapolis during the strike. \"We want Congress to stand up and provide oversight to ICE.\"On Friday morning, Minneapolis resident Corey Lamb closed his business, Harriet Grove Botanicals, and headed to a protest. He objected to the presence of ICE agents in his city, and was outraged by Good's death in early January.He also saw the immigration raids as an economic threat to his business, and others in his community.\"We have a lot of friends that we rely on, we have a lot of businesses that we rely on, in order to make our business work,\" Lamb told the BBC. \"When those individuals are struggling because they're afraid of being detained or disappeared, it has an effect not only morally but economically on what's going on here, and also in the greater Midwest.\"Mr Lamb's business is expected to be joined by hundreds of others, from restaurants and tattoo parlours to toy stores.Kim Bartmann is the owner of six restaurants in Minneapolis, including four that remain open in the winter but will be shut on Friday. While she supports the cause, she said the decision to participate had been a tricky one, given the costs.\"Everyone is in solidarity, but everyone needs to buy groceries and pay their rents,\" she said, noting that staff at one of her locations had initially asked to stay open, before deciding the risk of backlash over not participating would be too great.\"Economically, it is a severe blow to my business,\" she said.She said sales at her restaurants, which include Barbette and Gigi's Café, have already dropped more than 30% over the past three weeks as a result of the ICE operation, which has prompted her to limit her opening hours as customers and staff stay home.\"We have a lot of employees who are US citizens or have paperwork to work in the US who are still terrified to leave their homes,\" she said.ICE's presence has outraged many of Minnesota's residents, who have protested against their operations and other federal officers operating in their city.This week, school officials in the suburb of Columbia Heights announced that four of their students had been detained by ICE, ranging from ages five to 17.In a speech on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance called for local Minnesota law enforcement to coordinate with federal officers to carry out immigration enforcement.Minnesota, and some of its cities, have so-called \"sanctuary\" policies, which limit the ways that local government and law enforcement cooperates with ICE. The Trump administration has criticised these policies as a threat to public safety.\"There are a lot of things all of us could do better to lower the temperature,\" Vance said. \"But the number one thing that I learned today, is the best way to facilitate reasonable enforcement the law, but also to lower the chaos in Minneapolis, would be for state and local officials to cooperate.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterFormer deputy prime minister Angela Rayner does not want Andy Burnham to be blocked from standing in the Gorton and Denton by-election, the BBC understands.As first reported in The Times, Rayner is expected to publicly make her announcement at Labour's north west regional conference on Saturday. If Burnham did contest and win the by-election in Greater Manchester, it would enable him to mount a leadership challenge against Sir Keir Starmer. The BBC has been told that some of Sir Keir's supporters on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) will seek to block him from standing. The Greater Manchester mayor has until 5pm on Saturday to let the NEC know if he wants to stand or not - and he will find out on Sunday whether he will be allowed to.Under Labour rules, elected mayors must get permission from the NEC before seeking nomination as Labour Parliamentary candidates.The by-election could happen as early as next month after ex-Labour minister Andrew Gwynne formally resigned from the House of Commons, saying he had been advised by his GP not to return to work.Burnham has not said if he will go for the seat, telling reporters on Thursday that he was \"focused\" on his role as Manchester mayor and that people shouldn't \"rush to conclusions\". He has since refused requests for interviews. The tight timetable puts pressure on Burnham to make a quick decision which could make or break his political career.Rayner was forced to resign as deputy prime minister and housing secretary last year after the PM's ethics adviser concluded she had breached the ministerial code. However, she retains strong support among backbench MPs and party members and her backing for Burnham could make it harder for the NEC to block his progress. Several Labour sources have said they expect the committee to object to Burnham's candidacy on the grounds that it would trigger an election for the Greater Manchester mayoralty, which would be seen as a drain on party funds as well as politically risky.The NEC could also insist that there should be an all-women shortlist of possible Labour candidates for a by-election because the majority of the party's MPs are currently men.Opinion among Labour MPs is divided over whether Burnham should come back to the Commons.In a social media post appearing to back Burnham, Jo White, MP and leader of the Red Wall group said: \"A London stitch up will be a disaster for Labour.\"However, Graham Stringer, the MP for Blackley and Middleton South in Greater Manchester, said Burnham was \"entitled to be ambitious but this isn't the right opportunity\".\"I think it's very high-risk. By-elections are a nightmare for any candidates standing on behalf of a sitting government. I don't think Andy should take that risk.\"Labour won the Gorton and Denton seat at the 2024 election with a 13,000 majority. Reform UK came second with 5,000 seats narrowly beating the Greens candidate into third place.The area has traditionally been considered a safe seat, but Labour's drop in popularity since the general election means the party are not guaranteed a win. As the prime minister's popularity has declined, speculation has grown that he could face a leadership challenge after the local elections in May, at which Labour is expected to perform poorly. Alongside Burnham, Rayner and Health Secretary Wes Streeting have also been touted as possible challengers. Speaking to the BBC's Political Thinking, Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy said: \"I don't know if Andy really wants to get back into Westminster politics.\"He may do, and there's much merit to him. \"But I would caution those often around that start to destabilise the ship and say that we can have a new leader. \"No, we can't. Because immediately you'd be forced to have an election.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoSarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent , KyivGetty ImagesUkraine wants peace more than anyone in this processNegotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the US have been meeting in Abu Dhabi for their first trilateral talks since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the United Arab Emirates Foreign Ministry says.Senior officials from all three nations are involved, but it is unclear whether they will be in the same room together at any point. And whilst the talks take a new format, the core differences remain the same.The stakes are high, but expectations are limited.Donald Trump is pushing hard for a peace deal in Ukraine – the one he promised but hasn't yet delivered – and he said this week that the two sides would be \"stupid\" if they couldn't agree.But despite some intense shuttle diplomacy by his own envoys, they are hosting the first trilateral talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators with some major issues still unresolved.Ukraine is engaging with the process because it wants peace more than anyone, but also because it needs to keep the US onside. It learned that lesson the hard way last year, when Donald Trump briefly suspended intelligence sharing and military aid.Now, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his talks with Trump in Davos were \"really positive\" and he hopes for more air defence support against Russia's relentless attacks as a result.Often grim-faced after his encounters with the US leader, this time Zelensky seemed unusually upbeat.But he remains cautious on the outcome of talks in the United Arab Emirates.He's described the meetings, which may last two days, as \"a step\", but shied away from calling it a positive one.\"We have to wish it will push us a bit closer to peace,\" is how he put it.For a while, Zelensky has talked about being 90% of the way to producing a framework deal for peace, but the final 10% was always going to be the hardest - and Russia could still reject the whole thing.\"It's all about the eastern part of our country. It's all about the land. This is the issue that's not resolved yet,\" he explained, spelling out the biggest obstacle that he says still remains.Russia insists that Ukraine should hand over the big slice of the eastern Donbas region, which it has failed to win on the battlefield. Ukraine refuses.Politicians often talk about their red lines, but for this country the line in the Donbas is drawn with the blood of the soldiers who died defending it.Zelensky can't cross it.As I write this, the music from another soldier's funeral is drifting up from a church in the street.On my way back into Ukraine this time, we drove past so many military graves in roadside cemeteries, all marked with flags.The other big issue up for discussion in the UAE is what the US would do, militarily, if Russia were to invade Ukraine again someday. That's what Ukraine calls its \"security guarantees\", and says are essential.Zelensky says the deal between the US and Ukraine is done, but we have no real details.Russia's response also remains a wide-open question.There's also the giant new doubt about how good a guarantee from Donald Trump really is: the US president's fixation on \"acquiring\" Greenland has severely undermined Nato.He's also undermined the very principle of protecting a nation's sovereignty, the whole basis for Western support for Ukraine.So can Kyiv trust him to come to the rescue in the next crisis? For now, it doesn't have much choice.As for trusting Vladimir Putin, no one here is under any illusions that his aims have changed.\"He really doesn't want it,\" is what Zelensky said in Davos about Putin and peace.The Kremlin has said that if it doesn't get what it wants at the talking table, it will \"achieve its aims on the battlefield\" - though it's failed so far, despite sacrificing a huge number of soldiers.So once again, it's targeting civilian infrastructure across the country - but in a more deliberate, sustained, and devastating way than ever before.In the depths of a bitter winter, that's left people freezing in their homes.Today, the mayor of Kyiv again called on city residents to leave if they have somewhere to go.\"The enemy will most likely continue to attack the critical infrastructure of the city and the country,\" Vitali Klitschko warned.After repeat attacks, the system is very fragile.\"I address the residents and say honestly: the situation is extremely difficult and this may not be the most difficult moment yet.\"",

It could be a long, slow descent with the lights out on an RAF jet, or a rapid, corkscrew down in a C-130 transport plane. In both cases the aim was to avoid being blown out of the air by a Taliban surface-to-air missile.Over the course of 20 years thousands of servicemen and women, as well as civilians, from dozens of countries deployed to Afghanistan, answering the US call for assistance. That call came in the form of invoking Nato's Article 5 of its charter – the only time it has ever happened in Nato's 77-year history – which states that an attack on one member shall be deemed an attack on all.America was reeling from the devastating 9/11 attacks when al-Qaeda, which was being sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan, murdered nearly 3,000 people by flying packed airliners into New York's Twin Towers and the Pentagon in Washington.The Taliban were swiftly driven from power in a joint effort by the US military, the CIA and Afghanistan's Northern Alliance. Then it was all about trying to hunt down the remnants of al-Qaeda as Britain's Royal Marines, together with UK Special Forces, pursued them over the mountains but many escaped to safety to regroup in Pakistan. It was not until ten years later that the US Navy's Seal Team Six commandos tracked down the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan.The first two years of the US-led \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" as it was called, were relatively quiet. By late 2003, as America's attention switched to Iraq, US servicemen we met even started referring to Afghanistan as \"Op Forgotten\". But it was still dangerous. From a rain-soaked Kandahar airbase we watched Romanian troops edge nervously out on patrol in their Soviet-era armoured vehicles, wary of the next ambush. Flying into a remote US-manned firebase in the mountainous Paktika province in a Blackhawk helicopter, my BBC crew and I were told cheerfully: \"You've come to the worst place in the world\". Sure enough, the Taliban launched Chinese-made rockets at the base after dark, planted there, we were told, by farmers who had been either bribed or coerced into doing so.Everything changed after 2006, when the UK deployed in force to Helmand province, a part of Afghanistan that had been relatively peaceful until then. The Taliban made their intentions clear. If you come, they said, then we will fight you. And yet the UK government at the time appeared shocked at the ferocity of the fighting 3 Para now found themselves engaged in, with British paratroopers calling in mortar and artillery fire so close to their positions it was termed \"danger close\", in an effort to stop their bases from being overrun.Over the next eight years, until the end of combat operations in 2014, it was not just Americans who were risking life and limb to serve in Afghanistan. Brits, Canadians, Danes and Estonians were among those who saw the toughest fighting in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. It would also be churlish to ignore the bravery and sacrifice of so many Afghans who fought and died over two decades.I say \"fighting\" but most soldiers' biggest fears stemmed from the hidden IEDs, those expertly concealed Improvised Explosive Devices. The Taliban, who of course knew every inch of their terrain, were often able to guess correctly exactly where troops would need to cross an irrigation ditch or canal and so place the bomb accordingly. In the space of a split second, in a blinding flash and puff of black smoke, a fit, healthy, 20-something individual would have their life either ended or catastrophically changed, facing amputation and a host of other complications. So prevalent were these IEDs that soldiers were going out of the gates of their FOBs - Forward Operating Bases - on patrol praying that if they got hit it would result in a below-the-knee amputation, not one above the knee.The courage and resilience of the people I have met since, who have managed, despite terrible loss and adversity, to turn their shattered lives around, is both humbling and awe-inspiring. These are just some of the people who answered America's call for help after the 9/11 attacks. It is little wonder there has been such nationwide outrage at that country's President suggestion that they somehow dodged the fighting.",

    "body": "Alleged drug kingpin and ex-Olympian Ryan Wedding arrested after years on the runFormer Canadian Olympic snowboarder and alleged drug kingpin Ryan Wedding has been arrested in Mexico and will be extradited to the US after years on the run, FBI Director Kash Patel has said.Wedding, who had been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, is accused of running a transnational drug trafficking operation that moved tonnes of cocaine across international borders.Wedding, 44, was also wanted on murder charges. US officials had said they believed Wedding was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection.The head of Canada's federal police force, which assisted in the investigation, spoke alongside Patel on Friday to praise the law enforcement operation.\"No single agency or nation can combat transnational organised crime alone,\" said Mike Duheme, Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). \"We can finally say that our communities, our countries, are much safer with the arrest of Ryan Wedding,\" he added.Wedding is expected to make his first court appearance on Monday.Wedding is accused of running a vast drug trafficking operation responsible for importing some 60 metric tonnes of cocaine a year.The organisation operated across North America, as well as several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and was also the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, bringing in an estimated $1bn a year. Before he was arrested, Wedding was accused of killing a federal witness in a case against him. Officials say he has also ordered the murders of several others.Wedding is now facing a slew of felony charges, including witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking.The FBI had previously placed a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest. Patel declined to comment on whether anyone would be claiming the reward money.US officials have not released any information regarding how Wedding was captured, except to say that his arrest took place on Thursday night in Mexico City. Mexico's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, said in a post on X that Patel had visited Mexico City on Thursday, and departed with two fugitives on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. He did not name the men arrested, but said one was a \"Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered\" at the US embassy in Mexico. The Associated Press, citing an unnamed Mexican Security Cabinet member,  reported that Wedding is the Canadian who turned himself in at the US embassy. In his remarks at a news conference, Patel described Wedding as a \"modern-day Pablo Escobar\", referring to the Colombian cartel leader. US officials have also compared him to Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán in Mexico.\"When you go after a guy like Ryan Wedding, it takes a united front,\" Patel said, thanking Canadian and Mexican authorities for their help in the investigation.Wedding's aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\", the FBI said. He has reportedly had plastic surgery to change his appearance while on the run.Officials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution.Authorities allege he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America.Officials say he had been living in luxury in Mexico. In December, Mexican authorities announced that they had seized $40m in racing motorcycles owned by Wedding. They also seized other valuable items, including luxury paintings, artworks, drugs and two Olympic gold medals.It is unclear to whom the medals belong. Wedding competed for Canada in the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, but did not win any medals. He came in 24th place in the men's giant parallel slalom ski event.In November, the FBI seized his rare 2002 Mercedes CLK-GTR, which had been valued at $13m.Patel also spoke about the recent arrest of another man in Mexico who had been on the FBI's most wanted list. American man Alejandro Castillo was wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend. According to the FBI, he has been in hiding in Mexico for nearly 10 years, and will now be extradited back to North Carolina for trial. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoMaria CassidyandRachel Broome,BBC WalesBloomberg via Getty ImagesSouth Wales Police wrote to Tesla Financial Services in a bid to identify the driver of a Tesla which had been speeding at 80mphTesla has been convicted at least 18 times and ordered to pay more than £20,000 for repeatedly failing to co-operate with UK police forces.The British arm of Elon Musk's electric car giant has faced multiple criminal court proceedings over the past two years linked to alleged road traffic offences.Tesla offers its vehicles on long-term leases, and in such a scenario the leasing company is typically the registered keeper of the car.Drivers of rented or company cars caught speeding have to be named before they can face prosecution and companies which fail to return paperwork to police can be prosecuted instead.Almost 4,000 defendants have been convicted in courts in England and Wales in the last two weeks for failing to identify the driver of a vehicle under police investigation, leading to fines ranging from £1 to £1,000.In one incident, South Wales Police wrote to Tesla Financial Services in a bid to identify the driver of a Tesla which had been speeding at 80mph (128km/h) on the M4 near Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in July 2025.  Court papers show a Tesla company director, Becky Hodgson, pleaded guilty for the firm by email in late November, saying it had tried to enter the plea online but \"encountered a technical issue on the Online Plea Service portal\".Although the company admitted the criminal charge, Hodgson suggested in her email that it had complied with the police request, adding that its internal processes were followed and the nomination was sent via post.A conviction was handed out at Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court on 6 January and ended in Tesla receiving a £1,000 fine, an order for £120 costs and a £400 victim surcharge. Getty ImagesThe British arm of Tesla has faced multiple court proceedings linked to allegations of road traffic offencesAt least 18 convictions recorded against Tesla Financial Services have been identified by the Press Association since the start of 2024, including prosecutions brought by the Metropolitan Police, Hampshire Constabulary and Thames Valley Police.Seventeen cases have already been sentenced, while Tesla Financial Services pleaded guilty last week to failing to identify a driver. That case is set to be sentenced at a later date at Bath Magistrates' Court.In one of the concluded cases, a Tesla driver was caught on a speed camera doing almost 100mph (160km/h) on the A3 in Petersfield in Hampshire.But due to police letters going unanswered, the speeding driver was not identified and the company received a conviction with a fine instead.Another Tesla driver was caught speeding three times, potentially putting them on the cusp of a disqualification - if they had been identified.Letters from police which went unanswered have been addressed to Tesla Financial Services at offices and a service centre in London, as well as an office in Manchester.In the cases identified, fines, costs and court fees totalling £20,686 have been imposed by magistrates sitting in the single justice procedure, which deals with minor offences.Tesla have been asked to comment.

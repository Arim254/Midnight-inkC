    "body": "Rift at top of the Taliban: BBC reveals clash of wills behind internet shutdown2 hours agoBBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIt was a piece of audio obtained by the BBC that revealed what worries the Taliban's leader most.Not an external danger, but one from within Afghanistan, which the Taliban seized control of as the previous government collapsed and the US withdrew in 2021.He warned of \"insiders in the government\" pitted against each other in the Islamic Emirate the Taliban set up to govern the country.In the leaked clip, the supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada can be heard giving a speech saying that internal disagreements could eventually bring them all down.\"As a result of these divisions, the emirate will collapse and end,\" he warned.AFP / Universal Images Group via GettySupreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada (centre) has \"absolute power\", his spokesman said - but ministers including Sirajuddin Haqqani (left) and Mohammad Yaqoob (right) have questioned decisionsThe speech, made to Taliban members at a madrassa in the southern city of Kandahar in January 2025, was more fuel to the fire of rumours which had been circulating for months - rumours of differences at the very top of the Taliban.It is a split the Taliban leadership has always denied - including when asked directly by the BBC.But the rumours prompted the BBC's Afghan service to begin a year-long investigation into the highly secretive group - conducting more than 100 interviews with current and former members of the Taliban, as well as local sources, experts and former diplomats.Because of the sensitivity over reporting this story, the BBC has agreed not to identify them for their safety.Now, for the first time, we have been able to map two distinct groups at the very top of the Taliban - each presenting competing visions for Afghanistan.One entirely loyal to Akhundzada, who, from his base in Kandahar, is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate - isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society.And a second, made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which - while still following a strict interpretation of Islam - engages with the outside, builds the country's economy, and even allows girls and women access to an education they are currently denied beyond primary school.One insider described it as \"the Kandahar house versus Kabul\".But the question was always whether the Kabul group, made up of Taliban cabinet ministers, powerful militants and influential religious scholars commanding the support of thousands of Taliban loyalists, would ever challenge the increasingly authoritarian Akhundzada in any meaningful way, as his speech suggested.After all, according to the Taliban, Akhundzada is the group's absolute ruler - a man only accountable to Allah, and not someone to be challenged.Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills.Listen: Audio obtained by the BBC of Taliban supreme leaderIn late September, Akhundzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world.Three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why.But what had happened behind the scenes was seismic, say insiders. The Kabul group had acted against Akhundzada's order and switched the internet back on.\"The Taliban, unlike every other Afghan party or faction, is remarkable for its coherence – there have been no splits, not even much dissent,\" explains an expert on Afghanistan, who has been studying the Taliban since they were established.\"Bound into the movement's DNA is the principle of obedience to one's superiors, and ultimately to the Amir [Akhundzada]. That's what made the act of turning the internet back on, against his explicit orders, so unexpected, and so notable,\" the expert said.As one Taliban insider put it: this was nothing short of a rebellion.A man of faithOnly two confirmed pictures of Akhundzada exist; this one, showing the supreme leader on the left, has been verified by BBC AfghanHibatullah Akhundzada did not begin his leadership like this.Indeed, sources say he was chosen as the Taliban's supreme leader in 2016 in part because of his approach of building consensus.Lacking battlefield experience himself, he found a deputy in Sirajuddin Haqqani - the feared militant commander, then one of the US's most wanted men with a $10m (£7.4m) bounty on his head.A second deputy was found in Yaqoob Mujahid, Taliban founder Mullah Omar's son – young, but bringing with him his Taliban bloodline, and its potential to unify the movement.The arrangement continued throughout negotiations with Washington in Doha to end the 20-year war between Taliban fighters and US-led forces. The eventual agreement, in 2020, resulted in the sudden and dramatic recapturing of the country by the Taliban, and the chaotic withdrawal of US troops in August 2021.Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesThe unexpected fall of Kabul in August 2021 saw thousands rush to the airport in the hope of being evacuated with US and other troops as they withdrewTo the outside world, they were a united front.But both deputies would find themselves quietly demoted to ministers as soon as the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, with Akhundzada now a lone power centre, insiders told the BBC.Even Abdul Ghani Baradar - the powerful and influential co-founder of the Taliban who had led negotiations with the US - found himself in the role of deputy prime minister instead of prime minister as many had expected.Instead, Akhundzada - having shunned the capital where the government sits in favour of remaining in Kandahar, a base of power for the Taliban - began surrounding himself with trusted ideologues and hardliners.Other loyalists were given control of the country's security forces, religious policies and parts of the economy.\"[Akhundzada], from the outset, sought to form his own strong faction,\" a former Taliban member - who later served in Afghanistan's US-backed government - told the BBC.\"Although he lacked the opportunity at first, once he gained power, he began doing so skilfully, expanding his circle using his authority and position.\"Akhundzada has filled his cabinet with loyalists in line with his vision, but those considered the \"Kabul group\" maintain their positions. Here, arguably the most influential members of each group are shownEdicts began to be announced without consultation with Kabul-based Taliban ministers, and with little regard for public promises made before they took power, on issues like allowing girls access to education. The ban on education, along with women working, remains one of the \"main sources of tension\" between the two groups, a letter from a UN monitoring body to the Security Council noted in December.Meanwhile, another insider told the BBC that Akhundzada, who had started out as a judge in the Taliban's Sharia courts of the 1990s, was becoming \"even more rigid\" in his religious beliefs.Akhundzada's ideology was already such that he not only knew but approved of his son's choice to become a suicide bomber, according to two Taliban officials after his death in 2017.And he is convinced that making the wrong decision could have implications beyond his lifetime, the BBC has been told.\"Every decision he makes he says: I'm accountable to Allah, on judgement day, I will be questioned why I didn't take an action,\" one current Taliban government official explained.Two people who have been in meetings with Akhundzada described to the BBC how they were faced with a man who barely spoke, choosing to communicate mainly through gestures, interpreted through a team of elderly clerics in the room.In more public settings, other eyewitnesses said he obscures his face - covering his eyes with a scarf draped over his turban, and often standing at an angle when addressing an audience. Photographing or filming Akhundzada is forbidden. Only two photos of him are known to exist.Getting a meeting has also become increasingly difficult. Another Taliban member told the BBC how Akhundzada used to hold \"regular consultations\", but now \"most Taliban ministers wait for days or weeks\". Another source told the BBC the Kabul-based ministers have been told to \"travel to Kandahar only if they receive an official invitation\".At the same time, Akhundzada was moving key departments to Kandahar - including distribution of weapons, which had previously come under the control of his former deputies Haqqani and Yaqoob.In its December letter, the UN monitoring team noted Akhundzada's \"consolidation of power has also involved a continued build-up of security forces under the direct control of Kandahar\".Reports suggest Akhundzada issues direct orders all the way down to local police units - bypassing ministers in Kabul.One analyst argues the result is that \"real authority has been transferred to Kandahar\" - something Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied to the BBC.\"All the ministers have their power in their ministerial framework, undertaking daily works and making decisions - all the powers are delegated to them and they carry out their duties,\" he said.However, \"from a Sharia perspective, he [Akhundzada] has the absolute power\", Mujahid added - saying \"to avoid God-forbidden division, his decisions are final\".Men 'who have seen the world'APKabul (pictured) is the capital, and the seat of government for AfghanistanAmong the Kabul group, unhappiness was growing and alliances were strengthening.\"They [the Kabul group] are people who have seen the world,\" one analyst told the BBC. \"Therefore, they believe that their government, in its current form, cannot last.\"The Kabul group want to see an Afghanistan which moves towards the model of a Gulf state.They are concerned about the concentration of power in Kandahar, the nature and enforcement of virtue laws, how the Taliban should engage with the international community and women's education and employment.But despite advocating for Afghan women to have more rights, the Kabul group is not described as moderate.Instead, insiders see them as \"pragmatic\", unofficially led by Baradar - the Taliban founding member who still commands great loyalty. He is also thought to be the \"Abdul\" referred to by Donald Trump as the \"head of the Taliban\" during a 2024 US presidential election campaign debate. In fact, he was the group's chief negotiator with the US.The Kabul group's shifting positions have not gone unnoticed.\"We remember that they [the Taliban leaders based in Kabul] used to destroy television sets, but now they appear on TV themselves,\" one analyst said.They also understand the power of social media.Former deputy Yaqoob - whose father led the Taliban during its first rule, when music and television were banned - finds himself increasingly popular with young Taliban members and some ordinary Afghans, evident in gushing TikTok videos and merchandise adorned with his face.But no one has been more effective in rebranding themselves than his fellow former deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani. His ability to evade capture as his network orchestrated some of the most lethal and sophisticated attacks in the Afghan war against US-led forces - including a 2017 truck bombing in Kabul which killed more than 90 civilians near the German embassy - elevated him to near-mythical status among supporters.During this time, only one known photograph of him existed - taken by a BBC Afghan journalist.FBIThe bounty on Sirajuddin Haqqani - pictured in his wanted FBI poster, before the Taliban returned to power - was dropped last yearBut then, six months after the US withdrawal, Haqqani marched out in front of the world's cameras at a graduation ceremony of police officers in Kabul, his face uncovered.It was the first step towards a new image: no longer a militant, but a statesman - one with whom the New York Times would sit down in 2024 and ask: is he Afghanistan's best hope for change?Just a few months later, the FBI would quietly drop the $10m bounty on his head.Yet analysts and insiders repeatedly told the BBC that openly moving against supreme leader Akhundzada was unlikely.Arguably the most visible opposition to his edicts had been minor and limited - for example not enforcing regulations like the ban on shaving beards in regions controlled by Kabul group-aligned officials. But larger acts of rebellion have always been considered unthinkable.One former Taliban member emphasised to the BBC that \"obedience to [Akhundzada] is considered mandatory\".Haqqani himself, in his interview with the New York Times, played down any chance of an open split. \"Unity is important for Afghanistan currently so we can have a peaceful country,\" he said.Instead, one analyst said, the Kabul group is choosing to send \"a message to both the international community and Afghans\", one which says: \"We are aware of your complaints and concerns, but what can we do?\"At least, that was the case before the order came to shut down the internet.A breaking pointAFP via Getty ImagesThe internet switch-off began in carefully selected provinces and then expanded to the whole country in late SeptemberThe Taliban's supreme leader is a man with a deep distrust of the internet; he believes its content to be against Islamic teachings, and is so dedicated to his belief that an aide reads out the latest news or social media posts to him each morning instead, his spokesman once explained to the BBC.The Kabul group believe that a modern country cannot survive without it.The supreme leader's internet shutdown order began in provinces controlled by Akhundzada's allies, before it was expanded to the whole country.Sources close to the Kabul group and within the Taliban government described what happened next - an almost unprecedented moment in the Taliban's history.\"It surprised many members of the movement,\" one source said.In short, the Kabul group's most powerful ministers came together and convinced  Kabul-based Prime Minister Mullah Hassan Akhund to order it switched back on.In fact, the group had already made its unhappiness with the edict known before the internet was cut across the country: the group's de-facto leader, Baradar,  travelled to Kandahar to warn one of Akhundzada's most loyal governors that they needed to \"wake him up\" - adding they had to stop being the supreme leader's \"yes\" men.\"You don't tell him the truth openly; whatever he says, you just implement,\" he was reported as saying by a Kandahar insider.His words, the source said, were dismissed. On Monday, 29 September, an order came into the telecommunications ministry directly from the supreme leader to shut everything down. \"No excuses\" would be accepted, a source in the ministry told the BBC.On Wednesday morning, a group of Kabul group ministers - including Baradar, Haqqani and Yaqoob - gathered at the prime minister's office, joined by the telecommunications minister. Here, they urged the Kandahar-aligned prime minister to take charge and reverse the order. According to one source, they told him the full responsibility lay with them.It worked. The internet returned.But perhaps more importantly, within those few days, it was as if what Akhundzada had hinted at in that speech months earlier had come to pass: insiders were threatening Taliban unity.AFP via Getty ImagesThe decision to reverse the order took many by surprise - including Kabul group supportersBut why this order? One expert points out Taliban members have been happy to follow Akhundzada despite disagreeing with edicts like the ones on girls' education.Meanwhile, many of those who had challenged him openly before had paid a price.In February 2025, the then-deputy foreign minister had to flee the country after warning publicly the leadership was straying from \"the path of God\" in \"committing injustice against 20 million people\" - a reference to the female education ban.UN monitors point to at least two others who have been arrested after questioning Akhundzada's decrees on girls' education, in July and September 2025.But there is also evidence of Akhundzada and his allies moving to keep figures like Haqqani close - despite the latter's public criticisms of the supreme leader's consolidation of power.Even so, tipping over from words into actions and so decisively disregarding an order was arguably another step all together.As one expert points out, this time it may have been worth the risk.Their positions come with power and an \"ability to make money\", the expert says. But both depended on the internet, now crucial to both governing and commerce.\"Turning off the internet threatened their privileges in a way that keeping older girls out of education never did,\" the expert points out.\"Maybe that's why they were 'brave' that one time.\"APBeyond primary school, girls and women are denied an education under the TalibanAfter the internet was turned back on, speculation was rife about what would happen next.A source close to the Kabul group suggested the ministers will be slowly removed or demoted.However, the Kandahar insider suggested it might be the supreme leader who backed down \"because he fears such opposition\".As the year drew to an end, it appeared publicly that nothing had changed.The letter to the UN Security Council noted some UN member states \"have downplayed the division between leaders in Kandahar and Kabul as akin to a family dispute that would not alter the status quo; all senior leaders are invested in the success of the Taliban enterprise\".Zabiullah Mujahid, the senior Taliban government spokesman, has categorically denied any split.\"We will never allow ourselves to be divided,\" he told the BBC in early January 2026. \"All officials and leadership know that a split can be harmful for all, for Afghanistan, religiously prohibited and forbidden by Allah.\"However, he did also acknowledge that differences in \"opinion\" exist among Taliban members, but equated it to \"a difference of opinion in a family\".Half way through December, those \"differences\" had appeared to surface once more.Haqqani was filmed addressing a crowd in his home province of Khost during Friday prayers, warning that anyone who \"gets to power through the nation's trust, love and faith and then abandons or forgets the same nation... is not a government\".The same day, Akhundzada loyalist Neda Mohammad Nadem - the higher education minister - made his own speech to graduating students at a madrassa in a neighbouring province.\"Only one person leads and the rest follow orders, this is a true Islamic government,\" he said. \"If there are too many leaders then problems will emerge and this government that we have achieved will be ruined.\"After the dispute over the internet, these recent comments are set against a very different backdrop to those made by Akhundzada in the leaked audio at the start of 2025.Yet whether 2026 will be the year that the Kabul group move to make meaningful change for the women and men of Afghanistan is very much still up for debate.\"As ever… the question remains after apparent disagreement within the Emirate's top tier – will words ever lead to action?\" says one expert.\"They haven't yet.\"Edited and produced by Zia Shahreyar, Flora Drury and the BBC Afghan Forensics team.

    "body": "25 minutes agoHenry ZeffmanChief Political CorrespondentPA MediaThe government is to announce new powers making it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former armed forces personnel to prepare for war.New rules will mean reservists remain on call for an extra decade, and lower the threshold for them being called into service.The changes will form part of legislation for the armed forces being published in parliament later.While some of its provisions are technical measures the government has to renew at regular intervals, other parts of the legislation are seen by ministers as a crucial part of the conversation about Britain's readiness for conflict.The measures affect the segments of the armed forces reserve who are former service personnel rather than volunteers - known as the strategic reserve.Currently, the age limit for the strategic reserve is 55. This will change to 65.The threshold for members of the strategic reserve to be mobilised will change too. Under existing rules they are called upon in the scenario of \"national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK\". That threshold will be lowered to \"warlike preparations\", which is already the threshold for reservists who have left active service in the past few years.The changes will come into force next year, if passed by parliament.The government estimates that there are around 95,000 members of the strategic reserve.Last year the Strategic Defence Review called on the government to \"reinvigorate the relationship with the strategic reserves\".Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "41 minutes agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentGetty ImagesWest Sussex is among the councils requesting an elections delay A third of eligible councils in England have asked to postpone their elections due in May, according to BBC research.Last month ministers told 63 local authorities they would authorise delays to the polls if there were \"genuine concerns\" about delivering them alongside the government's overhaul of local government.Twenty-two councils have asked to postpone their ballots ahead of a Thursday deadline, while 34 will not, and seven are yet to confirm their position.Ministers are expected to approve the requests in the coming days.Most wanting a delay are Labour-led, but three are Conservative-led and one is Liberal Democrat led. Some of the councils that have asked for a delay are run by more than one party, or independents.The government's rejig of local government will replace the two-tier system of district and county councils that exists in many parts of England with new 'unitary' councils responsible for delivering all councils services in their area.It means some of the councils up for election this year will be folded into new unitary councils in 2027 or 2028, so councillors could only be in office for a year.The BBC contacted the 63 councils who could request a delay to their May elections to ask for their decision.Among those to say they will ask for a postponement are East and West Sussex County Councils, Suffolk County Council, Exeter City Council, Preston City Council, Norwich Ciity Council and Peterborough City Council.Other smaller councils to request a delay include Cheltenham, Hastings, Nuneaton and Bedworth, Ipswich, and Redditch Borough Councils.Ministers say their reorganisation of local council will be the biggest in a generation, removing duplication and simplifying local government.Writing for The Times, Local Government Secretary Steve Reed said: \"Running a series of elections for short-lived zombie councils will be costly, time consuming and will take scarce resources away from front-line services like fixing pot holes and social care.\"The Conservatives and the Lib Dems have both criticised Labour's decision to allow elections to be postponed, whilst Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice told the BBC that authorities wanting a delay were \"terrified\" his party would win.Conservative shadow local government secretary accused Labour of \"running scared of voters,\" with the government struggling in the polls.\"We are clear that these elections should go ahead. Ministers should treat voters with respect instead of disdain, stop undermining our democratic system and let the people of this country make their own decisions,\" he added.Council protestsLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who has previously suggested delaying elections breached human rights, called for a change in the law so \"ministers cannot simply delay elections at the stroke of a pen\".He said: \"Both Labour and the Conservatives are running scared of the electorate, allowing councillors to serve terms of up to seven years without a democratic mandate.\"Despite their parties' official positions, the Conservative leaders of Suffolk, West Sussex, and East Sussex County Councils, and the Liberal Democrat controlled Cheltenham Borough Council are among those requesting a delay.Protests erupted at some councils over decisions to ask for a delay, with police called to a meeting in Redditch where the Labour-run district council in Worcestershire discussed asking for a postponement.Some councils have yet to announce their decision.The Conservative leader of Essex County Council told the government there was \"huge strain on our systems\" on top of the planned restructure. But he said it was up to the government whether this year's elections would go ahead, and said he would not call for a delay. ",

    "body": "Ofwat launches investigation into South East WaterJust nowJacob PanonsSouth EastGetty ImagesSouth East Water is set to operate bottled water stations again on ThursdayRegulator Ofwat has opened an investigation into South East Water (SEW) after repeated loss of water supplies across Kent and Sussex.At the height of the problem, 30,000 people had no water and about 10,000 properties remain without a supply.The Ofwat investigation will consider whether the company has complied with its licence condition to provide high standards of customer service and support.SEW said: \"The company will always fully co-operate with any investigation by our regulators and provide any information required.\"Lynn Parker, Ofwat's senior director for enforcement, said: \"The last six weeks have been miserable for businesses and households across Kent and Sussex with repeated supply problems. \"We know that this has had a huge impact on all parts of daily life and hurt businesses, particularly in the run up to the festive period. \"That is why we need to investigate and to determine whether the company has breached its licence condition.\"Watch: Starmer quizzed at PMQs over South East Water disruptionsThe investigation was started after the prime minister said the situation, which affected 30,000 customers at its height, was \"clearly totally unacceptable\" and asked Ofwat to review the company's licence.SEW said some customers might not see supplies return until Friday after issues first began on Saturday in the wake of Storm Goretti and a power cut at a pumping station.The company said it would be using 26 tankers to pump water directly into its network while working \"around the clock\" to fix leaks and bursts.Ofwat already has an open investigation into SEW's supply resilience to determine whether it has failed to develop and maintain an efficient water supply system.As of 17:30 GMT on Wednesday, SEW said it had implemented a new recovery plan for Tunbridge Wells that involved keeping local booster pumps switched off for a further 36 hours.The aim was that customers would wake up to a consistent supply by Friday morning.SEW said its local drinking water storage tanks had not refilled at the speed required, so it had to extend the \"outage\" to allow it to recover fully.Speaking on Wednesday night, incident manager Desmond Brown said supplies had returned to 15,500 properties in East Grinstead and the company was hoping the remaining 1,000 impacted in the area would see their water return overnight.There was also a separate issue in the Loose and Coxheath areas on Wednesday evening that affected about 2,000 properties.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "12 minutes agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterThe UK economy grew by a faster-than-expected 0.3% in November after car production rebounded and the services sector got a boost.Growth was driven by an increase in industrial output, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, helped by the return to production at Jaguar Land Rover's facilities following the cyber-attack at the carmaker.Manufacturing output increased in November thanks to a big 25.5% increase in the output of motor vehicles as JLR production continued to pick up.With the Budget on 26 November, there was also an increase in services driven by activities such as accounting and tax consultancy.Businesses across the construction, industrial production and services sector also told the ONS in November that they were waiting to see the outcome of the autumn Budget before making decisions.Despite the Budget uncertainty, November's growth figure was stronger than analysts' expectations of a 0.1% increase.The monthly GDP figures are more volatile than the rolling three-month data, which is considered to give a better underlying picture of growth.In the three months to November the economy grew by 0.1% compared with the previous three months, the ONS said.Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the figures showed economic activity had accelerated despite uncertainty in the lead up to the Budget.\"Despite the relatively mooted consumer sentiment so far and consumer-facing services output declining in November, there are some tentative signs of a pick-up in household spending,\" she said.\"With the worst of the uncertainty behind businesses, we expect growth momentum to continue over the coming months.\"Construction output fell by 1.3% in November, and the ONS said the sector also registered \"its largest three-monthly fall in nearly three years\".Ruth Gregory, deputy chief economist at Capital Economics, said the fall in construction was probably due to \"unseasonably wet weather\" and was likely to rebound in December.However, Gregory said the increase in services output did \"little more than reverse the big declines in the past few months\".\"So we think November's strength is more likely to be a rebound rather than a sign that the economy is fundamentally stronger than we thought,\" she said.A Treasury spokesperson said the government was making the economy \"work for working people\" by \"reversing years of underinvestment\" in infrastructure as well as putting through planning reform.The spokesperson said the government was working to get bills and inflation down, but acknowledged there was still more to do to tackle the cost of living.",

    "body": "10 hours agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterWatch: Moment Crew 11 undocks and begins early journey back to EarthFour astronauts have left the International Space Station a month early, in the first medical evacuation since the station was put into Earth's orbit in 1998.The astronauts, known as Crew 11, are expected to splash down off the coast of California in the early hours of Thursday local time.Their journey was cut short because of medical issue involving one crew member, Nasa said. The agency did not provide details about the crew member or the nature of the medical issue, but said they were in stable condition. Control of the ISS has been handed over to Russian cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and two other crew members.The astronauts, Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japan's Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, arrived on the ISS on 1 August expecting to complete a standard six and a half month stay. They were due to come home in mid-February.But last week, a scheduled spacewalk by Fincke and Cardman was called off at the last minute. Hours later, Nasa revealed a crew member had become ill. \"It's bittersweet,\" said Mr Fincke when he handed over the keys to the ISS to Kud-Sverchjov on Monday.  In a social media post, he stressed that all crew members on board were \"stable, safe, and well cared for\".Orbiting Earth at an altitude of 250 miles, the International Space Station (ISS) makes 16 orbits of our planet a day, travelling at a speed of 17,500 miles per hour. It is run by five space agencies and carries out wide-ranging scientific research about space and the effects on humans, animals and plants of living in microgravity.Watch: Nasa Astronauts Medically Evacuated from ISSThe ISS carries some medical equipment and astronauts are trained to deal with minor medical issues, but it does not have a doctor on board.The early departure leaves the ISS with a slim crew of just three astronauts - Nasa's Chris Williams and cosmonauts Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev - until another four arrive in February.\"Despite all the changes and all the difficulties, we are going to do our job onboard ISS, performing all the scientific tasks, maintenance tasks here, whatever happens,\" Kud-Sverchkov said on Monday. He then issued his first command - a group hug.NASAOleg Platonov, Mike Fincke, Zena Cardman and Kimiya Yui will end their ISS stay one month earlyThe incident is unprecedented in the history of the ISS, which has been permanently crewed for 26 years.Space missions have ended early due to health issues just twice before.In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin and his colleagues returned four months ahead of schedule from a mission to the Salyut 7 space station due to a urological issue. And in 1987, a heart arrhythmia caused Soviet cosmonaut Aleksandr Laveykin to leave the Mir space station early.As more and more humans travel into space, including for tourism and a possible occupation of the Moon or even Mars, space experts say doctors will need to travel on missions.NASAThe International Space Station has been continuously inhabited since the year 2000",

    "body": "3 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA labour rights organisation claims it has found evidence of worker exploitation in a Chinese factory that makes the viral Labubu dolls.China Labor Watch (CLW), a US-based non-governmental organisation, alleges that its investigation found that one of Pop Mart's suppliers made employees work excessive overtime shifts, sign blank or incomplete contracts and did not give them paid leave.The furry Labubu dolls have surged in popularity around the world in recent years and are best known for selling toys in \"blind boxes\", which hide its content from buyers until it is opened.Pop Mart told the BBC that it is investigating the claims.The Beijing-based toy retailer said it appreciated the details from the review and that it will \"firmly\" require companies making its toys to correct their practices if the allegations are found to be true.Pop Mart added that it conducts regular audits of its suppliers, including yearly independent third-party reviews carried out by internationally recognised inspectors.CLW said in its report that it had carried out the in-depth probe into Labubu-maker, Shunjia Toys Co Ltd, in the southern Chinese province Guangdong.The BBC has been unable to contact Shunjia Toys Co Ltd for comment.CLW said its researchers conducted 51 in-person interviews with the factory's employees to discuss matters of recruitment, contracts and their working conditions. The factory is a \"core manufacturing facility\" of Pop Mart toys and employed more than 4,500 workers, according to CLW.The organisation flagged labour issues at Shunjia Toys Co Ltd's factory in Xinfeng County, including what it said were illegal overtime hours, unclear contract practices and a lack of safety training and protections.No child labour was identified at the factory, but it had employed 16-year-old workers who were subject to the same working conditions as adults, without special care that is required under Chinese law, said CLW.It urged Pop Mart to take \"immediate action\" to address the issues in its supply chain. The non-profit said the firm should compensate affected workers and ensure that its production line complies with Chinese labour laws and internationally recognised labour standards.Such facilities, called original equipment manufacturers (OEM), make products according to pricing and production schedules set by the client.\"As a result, labour conditions in OEM facilities are closely shaped by brand sourcing practices,\" said CLW.Labubus - the fictional elf-like creatures with a row of jagged teeth have become hugely popular. The craze has sparked long queues in shops worldwide.Celebrity endorsements from the likes of Kim Kardashian and Lisa from K-pop group Blackpink have helped Pop Mart to become a major toy retailer.",

The paper features Trump saying that he has been informed on \"good authority\" that the killing of protesters in Iran has stopped.  The UK is preparing for a possible US strike on Iran by withdrawing military personnel from its Qatar base, according to the i Paper. It says the move is in anticipation of expected retaliation from Iran on US bases and allies should Trump decide to intervene in the anti-regime protests.The Guardian leads with Donald Trump's continued interest in \"conquering\" Greenland. The paper reports on talks between Denmark, Greenland and US officials on Wednesday over ongoing tensions, with the Danish foreign minister saying they failed to solve a \"fundamental disagreement\".Moving to domestic news, the Daily Telegraph says four million people are to be denied the right to vote in May's local elections as the government is expected to cancel at least 27 council elections. The Tories and Reform have accused the PM of \"running scared\" of the public, the paper reports.The Daily Mail shifts its focus to calls for the chief constable of West Midlands Police to step down after the home secretary said he no longer had her confidence.

The paper reports that yesterday's talks between officials from the US, Denmark and Greenland failed to resolve what the Danish foreign minister called a \"fundamental disagreement\". The i Paper says Denmark and the US have \"agreed to disagree\" after \"frank but constructive talks\".The Times reports that a US plan to attack the Iranian regime appears to be on \"pause\" after Trump said he'd been assured that the killing of protesters had stopped. But Trump also told reporters that he'd be \"very upset\" if that turned out to be false.  The paper has a striking photograph of a woman with a painted gunshot wound on her forehead during a rally in support of Iranian protests in Rome. The Daily Mirror refers to tensions in Iran and the situation in Greenland in its front page headline: \"World on the brink.\"The government's decision to allow some councils in England to postpone elections due in May is the main news in the Daily Telegraph.

    "body": "6 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentTwo alleged Palestine Action activists who are awaiting trial have ended a hunger strike protest in prison, seemingly bringing to an end protests that have taken place for 73 days.In a statement issued by their supporters, Heba Muraisi and Kamran Ahmed said they had ended their protests at their respective prisons where they are being detained on remand.The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has not commented on the action over the last two months, but it has not previously disputed accounts from supporters that the hunger strikes were taking place.Four other detainees who - along with Muraisi and Ahmed - began their strikes in early November, ceased their protests last month.All of them have been objecting to the time on remand ahead of trials, which are up to a year away due to the unprecedented court backlogs.The BBC understands that Ahmed was taken to hospital earlier on Wednesday in a very poorly condition.Supporters say the pair have now joined Teuta Hoxha, Jon Cink, Qesser Zuhrah and Amy Gardiner-Gibson, also known as Amu Gib, in receiving medical re-feeding treatment overseen by doctors, as set out in guidelines for the management of hunger strikes in prisons.A seventh detainee, who had decided to refuse food every other day due to an underlying health condition, has also ended his protest.During the protest the group had made five demands including that the UK government lifts the ban on Palestine Action, closes down an Israeli-owned defence firm and addresses complaints about their prison conditions and treatment.The ban on the organisation was already being considered independently by senior judges. Bail decisions are taken by judges not the government, with ministers having no role in deciding who is remanded ahead of a trial.Shortly before Christmas, lawyers for the hunger strikers had threatened legal action over their treatment.Ministers said neither they, nor MoJ officials, would meet the protesters, but the government offered to facilitate a meeting between the protesters' representatives and medical professionals inside the jails to brief them on the care being offered.The protesters took up that offer two weeks after it was made.The MoJ has vehemently denied clams of medical mistreatment and the Care Quality Commission, a watchdog, has not opened any investigation. It confirmed to the BBC its experts had spoken to medical staff at HMP Bronzefield, one of the prisons where the protest was taking place.There are about 200 hunger strikes a year in prisons and nine people have died as a result of the protests since 1999. Hunger strikes are deemed to be part of the right to protest under human rights law, which means the state no longer has any power to forcibly feed a prisoner, unless doctors conclude they lack the mental capacity to understand the consequences of their actions. If a prisoner understands the risk that they may die and has made their wishes clear, doctors will not give them food, even if it would save their life.",

    "body": "The son of a British couple detained in Iran has expressed his concern for their welfare after the UK's embassy was closed in Tehran amid the deadly crackdown on anti-regime protests.Joe Bennett's parents, Craig and Lindsay Foreman, were on a trip around the world when they were arrested by Iranian authorities in January last year and charged with spying.Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, Bennett said the couple are in a \"dangerous position\" and that there was \"overcrowding\" in the jail due to the protests.He added that the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) told him they were still \"assessing the situation\".The FCDO previously told the BBC it continued to raise the case of the Foremans directly with the Iranian authorities.The UK government announced the the temporary closure of its embassy in Tehran on Wednesday, saying it would now operate remotely. \"We have temporarily closed the British Embassy in Tehran, this will now operate remotely. Foreign Office travel advice has now been updated to reflect this consular change,\" a government spokesperson said.Britain's ambassador and all consular staff were evacuated based on a security assessment and concerns for staff safety.Bennett said if his parents were released, they had planned to go to the British embassy. \"The trouble is, their plan was to go to the embassy, was to try to get to the embassy because they feel that that's safe ground and now... Where do they go? What do they do?\" he said.Bennett, who last spoke to his parents on Wednesday, said during the brief communication he's been able to have, they've told him of the \"unsafe\" and \"frightening\" conditions of the prison.\"There are vermin in the kitchen and in beds. It is overcrowded, it's even more overcrowding now that these protests have gone on in Tehran,\" he said.He added there were \"fights that break out pretty much daily\" which he could hear in the background during the phone calls with his mother. Last year, Scottish National Party MP Brendan O'Hara told the BBC the couple were being used \"bargaining chips\" between Iran's government and the West.Bennett also expressed the family's \"frustration\" with the perceived lack of support from the government to secure his parents' release.\"I look at other nations, France for example, US, Italy, when their citizens are put in a similar situation, there's an advocacy from them at the highest level of government... and the UK haven't done that,\" he said.The family just wanted the government to show \"a sign of solidarity\" with their plight, Bennett added.The Foreman's legal representatives in Iran formally submitted an application for bail this week.Both of their Iranian defence lawyers have also written to the court, stating that the pair were innocent and that there was no lawful basis for their continued detention, according to the family.As Iran continues its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests which has killed at least 2,400 people according to a human rights agency, Bennett said he just wants to ensure his parents' safe return.\"My mum and Craig are two innocent UK citizens that are caught up in the middle of all of this. So for us, it's about their safety and prompt return home however that comes,\" he said.",

    "body": "Zelensky declares energy emergency as biting cold persists5 hours agoTabby WilsonWatch: Inside Kyiv's 'invincibility train' for residents left without powerUkraine has declared a state of emergency in the country's energy sector, with a particular focus on Kyiv, as ongoing Russian strikes continue to leave thousands of residents without power. President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of deliberately exploiting the harsh winter conditions as part of its war strategy, with overnight temperatures in Kyiv recently dropping to around -20C.The declaration comes as Zelensky's US counterpart Donald Trump said he was holding up efforts to secure a peace deal to end nearly four years of war with Russia.He told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Ukraine \"is less ready to make a deal\" than Russian president Vladimir Putin. When asked why peace talks have not yet resolved the conflict, Trump responded: \"Zelensky\".The two leaders are both expected to attend the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week, although Trump suggested no formal plans were arranged for them to meet. In recent weeks, Russian attacks on Kyiv have left thousands of homes without regular power, heating or running water. After one particularly heavy night of missile and drone attacks last week, 70% of the capital was left without power for several hours.Following a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Zelensky said a round-the-clock task force would be set up to fix damage caused by Russian strikes and worsening weather conditions. He said the new measures would include procuring vital energy equipment and resources from abroad to replace damaged installations. \"The First Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Energy of Ukraine has been assigned to oversee work supporting people and communities under these conditions,\" he wrote on X.He also ordered an increase in the number of emergency help points around Kyiv to provide heat and power for residents, a move which could see a relaxing of current midnight curfew in the capital.ReutersA government-run humanitarian aid point in KyivRussian attacks on energy infrastructure have not been limited to the capital.Last week, Ukrainian officials said that more than one million people in south-eastern Ukraine spent hours without heating and water supplies as a result of Russian air strikes. DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its CEO, Maxim Timchenko, told the BBC last month.As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and the company had found it difficult to cope.He added that the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".DTEK currently provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians.",

    "body": "10 hours agoChris Bell,BBC News Investigations,Joshua Nevett,Political reporterandIain Watson,Political correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesThe families of victims of the Manchester Arena bombing say they cannot support the current form of a new law being designed to stop cover-ups.Campaigners met Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday in Parliament to press their case that the Hillsborough Law should apply to individual employees of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ and leave no public authority exempt.Last week, families bereaved by the arena attack in 2017 wrote to him saying MI5 had failed them and argued that the proposed law must apply fully to security services.But following their meeting, they said the PM had failed to address their concerns.A public inquiry found MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held on the suicide bomber who carried out the arena attack, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds.The Hillsborough Law Now campaign has warned that the draft legislation in its current form could allow intelligence chiefs \"to hide serious failures behind a vague claim of national security\".The government has tabled amendments to the draft law, formally known as the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, that would place the same \"duty of candour\" on security service personnel as other public servants.But MI5, MI6 and GCHQ chiefs would have the power to \"review and determine whether or how\" to provide any information supplied by agents to inquiries or investigations, under the amendments.Government sources said while they had the deepest respect for the families, they had gone as far as they could without compromising national security and that the security services would be subjected to unprecedented scrutiny.A government spokesman told the BBC: \"We have listened to their concerns on how the duty of candour will apply to the security services and we will continue to work with them to make the bill as strong as it can possibly be, while never compromising on national security.\"Ruth Leney, who chairs the Manchester Arena Support Network, said the PM had \"listened\" during their meeting on Wednesday, but added: \"It's not the outcome that we expected.\"It's got to be all or nothing, they can't water down anything, especially with the security services.\"She added: \"We can't trust the bill if not everybody is accountable to it.\"Caroline Curry, whose son Liam Curry, 19, was killed in the bombing, said she was \"devastated\" about amendments to the bill and felt like she had been misled.\"We can't bring our children back, they're gone,\" she said.\"But what we can do is try to stand up for other people and try to protect their children.\"\"It's not what they agreed and what they promised,\" said Lisa Rutherford, whose daughter Chloe Rutherford, 17, was also killed.\"They have said that they will go away and have another look but we are not hopeful,\" she added. \"All we want is honesty.\"\"The government is in danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Pete Weatherby KC, a director of the Hillsborough Law Now campaign which is assisting with the bill.At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour MP Anneliese Midgley accused MI5 of spending \"six years misleading the public and concealing information\" about the arena bombing.In response, Sir Keir said he is determined not to \"water down\" the legislation and argued that the amendments tabled by the government would \"strengthen\" it.\"It is right that there are essential safeguards in place to protect national security, and we've got that balance right,\" Starmer said at PMQs.The bill follows campaigning by families affected by the 1989 Hillsborough disaster that claimed 97 lives.Police leaders were found to have spread false narratives about that disaster, blaming Liverpool fans, and withheld evidence of their own failings.The government has confirmed the remaining stages of the bill will take place next Monday, instead of Wednesday, allowing time for changes to be considered.Liverpool Labour MP Ian Byrne - a long-standing Hillsborough campaigner - said he plans to press ahead with his own amendment, which would fully apply the law to the security services, unless the government was willing to change its position.He told the BBC it was \"soul-destroying\" that the government appeared to be giving the security services a veto and that families of victims he met had been \"distraught\".About 30 Labour MPs have so far publicly backed Byrne's amendment.",

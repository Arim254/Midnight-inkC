The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.

The two boys who were stabbed are in a stable condition in hospital, the Met said. Det Ch Supt Helen Flanagan, from the force, described the charges as \"extremely serious against a young boy\".She added: \"We continue to support the victims and their families, as well as the wider school community following this shocking incident.\"While we have now charged the boy with these offences, our investigation is ongoing and detectives will continue to carry out enquiries in the local area.\"We are working closely with local policing colleagues in the Brent area and I would also like to thank the school and the wider local community for their support in recent days.\"A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said prosecutors had worked to establish that there was \"sufficient evidence to bring this case to court and that it was in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings\".The 13-year-old will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court later.Kingsbury High School remains closed for pupils in Years 7 to 9 but is expected to reopen fully on Friday.",

Results are expected on Friday.Voters were also casting their ballots in a referendum on constitutional change proposed by the interim government to fix what it has called a completely broken political system.Nearly a million police and soldiers have been deployed to maintain law and order.Speaking after voting, interim leader Muhammad Yunus said the country had \"ended the nightmare and begun a new dream\".He voted in the capital Dhaka, as did the two leading candidates, Tarique Rahman for the BNP and Jamaat's leader Shafiqur Rahman.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLebo Diseko and Anna LamchePA MediaConstance Marten (left) and Mark Gordon (right) were sentenced to at least 14 years for manslaughter and gross negligence over baby Victoria's deathRegistered sex offenders should inform police about their new partners and share details of any pregnancies, a review into the death of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon's daughter has found.Baby Victoria's body was found in a shopping bag in Brighton in 2023, after her parents concealed her birth and went on the run in an attempt to avoid contact with social services.Marten and Gordon, a convicted rapist, were both sentenced to 14 years for gross negligence manslaughter last year.The review, chaired by Sir David Holmes, sought to identify missed safeguarding opportunities, and to learn lessons from what the review called the \"extreme case\" of baby Victoria's death.Family court documents show how over the years the couple moved around the country to avoid contact with social services when Marten was pregnant, refused antenatal and newborn healthcare and repeatedly missed contact sessions with their children once they were in care.Given the repeating pattern of concealed pregnancies and child removals in the family, the authorities should have anticipated another pregnancy was likely, the review found. Had authorities known earlier that her parents were expecting another child, more could have been done to save baby Victoria. There is no legal duty for a woman to disclose her pregnancy. The report suggested social services would have had an earlier opportunity to intervene had Gordon, a registered sex offender, been required to share details of his partner's pregnancy with the authorities. The review also suggested better support was needed for parents whose children are taken into care.No single agency or professional had specific responsibility for supporting the couple when their children were removed, or \"helping them process their likely sense of loss and grief\", the review found.It suggested the \"successive removal\" of Marten and Gordon's children \"may have reinforced their perception of harm caused by children's social care, making the concealment of Victoria feel subjectively 'rational\"'.Marten, who provided written responses to questions from the panel, said that the impact on parents of having a child removed is not properly understood. She described seeing her children at a contact centre as \"one of the most painful experiences for a parent to endure\".More than 1,400 unborn infants were subject to child protection plans (CPPs) on 31 March 2025, while around 3,930 children aged under one were subject to CPPs on the same date, the report said.The review said agencies such as health and housing authorities needed to work together more effectively to help women who present a high risk to their children.Domestic abuse, Gordon's criminal past, and the parent's refusal to engage with authorities, as well as multiple moves around the country, were among the challenges the authorities faced in protecting the couple's children.A press release published by the panel said better communication with Marten and Gordon, as well as \"earlier coordinated action\" from the authorities, \"might have made a difference\" in baby Victoria's case.Other recommendations from the review include:Clearer national safeguarding guidance that explicitly includes vulnerable unborn babies and infantsThe introduction of specific protocols for responding to concealed or late‑disclosed pregnanciesA \"trauma-informed\" approach to families who do not engage with the authorities, recognising the avoidance of social services is not always \"deliberate\" and \"often reflects grief and mistrust\"Improved information-sharing when families move around the country",

Judge Mr Justice Choudhury KC said Moulton chose Leo because he was a smaller boy.He added that after the attack, the teenager had cycled around Trittiford Mill Park telling people a boy had been stabbed.Moulton returned to the scene to observe what happened after he stabbed Leo and even spoke with police officers there.The defendant appeared to get \"pleasure from seeing the consequences\" of his actions\", the judge said.",

    "body": "AI researcher says 'world is in peril' and quits to study poetry25 minutes agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGetty ImagesAn AI safety researcher has quit US firm Anthropic with a cryptic warning that the \"world is in peril\".In his resignation letter shared on X, Mrinank Sharma told the firm he was leaving amid concerns about AI, bioweapons and the state of the wider world.He said he would instead look to pursue writing and studying poetry, and move back to the UK to \"become invisible\".Anthropic, best known for its Claude chatbot, had released a series of commercials aimed at OpenAI, criticising the company's move to include adverts for some users.The company, which was formed in 2021 by a breakaway team of early OpenAI employees, has positioned itself as having a more safety-orientated approach to AI research compared with its rivals.Sharma led a team there which researched AI safeguards.He said in his resignation letter his contributions included investigating why generative AI systems suck up to users, combatting AI-assisted bioterrorism risks and researching \"how AI assistants could make us less human\".But he said despite enjoying his time at the company, it was clear \"the time has come to move on\".\"The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment,\" Sharma wrote.He said he had \"repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions\" - including at Anthropic which he said \"constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most\".Sharma said he would instead look to pursue a poetry degree and writing.He added in a reply: \"I'll be moving back to the UK and letting myself become invisible for a period of time.\"Those departing AI firms which have loomed large in the latest generative AI boom - and sought to retain talent with huge salaries or compensation offers - often do so with plenty of shares and benefits intact.Eroding principlesAnthropic calls itself a \"public benefit corporation dedicated to securing [AI's] benefits and mitigating its risks\".In particular, it has focused on preventing those it believes are posed by more advanced frontier systems, such as them becoming misaligned with human values, misused in areas such as conflict or too powerful.It has released reports on the safety of its own products, including when it said its technology had been \"weaponised\" by hackers to carry out sophisticated cyber attacks.But it has also come under scrutiny over its practices. In 2025, it agreed to pay $1.5bn (£1.1bn) to settle a class action lawsuit filed by authors who said the company stole their work to train its AI models.Like OpenAI, the firm also seeks to seize on the technology's benefits, including through its own AI products such as its ChatGPT rival Claude.It recently released a commercial that criticised OpenAI's move to start running ads in ChatGPT.OpenAI boss Sam Altman had previously said he hated ads and would use them as a \"last resort\".Writing in the New York Times on Wednesday, former OpenAI researcher Zoe Hiztig said she had \"deep reservations about OpenAI's strategy\".\"People tell chatbots about their medical fears, their relationship problems, their beliefs about God and the afterlife,\" she wrote.\"Advertising built on that archive creates a potential for manipulating users in ways we don't have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.\"Hiztig said a potential \"erosion of OpenAI's own principles to maximise engagement\" might already be underway at the firm.She said she feared this may accelerate if the company's approach to advertising does not reflect its values to benefit humanity.BBC News has approached OpenAI for a response.",

    "body": "33 minutes agoMaia DaviesPATREBob was known to accompany funeral processions and comfort mourners at the siteA dog who spent 10 years living in the São Paulo cemetery where his owner was buried has inspired a new law permitting the burial of pets with their families in the Brazilian state.Nicknamed Bob Coveiro - meaning \"gravedigger\" in Portuguese - the loyal dog brought comfort to mourners and became a fixture at the graveyard until his death in 2021, when he was buried alongside his guardian.The law named after the canine came into effect on Tuesday and recognises the \"emotional bond\" between pets and their human families, the state government said.One of its authors, representative Eduardo Nóbrega, wrote on social media: \"What began as a story of love and loyalty has turned into public policy.\"Bob attended his owner's funeral at the cemetery in Taboão da Serra and refused to leave thereafter, Brazilian media reported - even returning when family members tried to take him home.He was given a green dog house to live in and was known to accompany funeral processions at the site, where he was eventually buried with his owner after being hit by a vehicle in 2021.Local animal protection charity Patre, which led a fundraiser for a statue in his memory, said Bob \"won the hearts of everyone who met him\".It said in a statement: \"People who were saddened by burying their loved ones would manage a smile when the little dog, who was crazy about balls, tried to play.\"Nóbrega said of the Bob Coveiro Law on Wednesday: \"Anyone who has lost a pet knows: it's not just an animal. It's a family. And this law recognizes this bond, bringing more respect at the moment of farewell.\"\"Love does not end at goodbye,\" he wrote on social media.It means cats and dogs can now be buried in family graves in the southeastern state - Brazil's most populous - provided sanitary standards are met, with local funeral services to determine the rules for doing so.Brazil has the world's third largest pet population, with 160 million animal companions, according to data from the Pet Brasil Institute.",

    "body": "10 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorPA Media/EPALeft to right: Lord Peter Mandelson, Sir Keir Starmer and Lord Matthew Doyle (composite image)We are currently witnessing the curious spectacle of two men, both of whom have served as the prime minister's director of communications within the last year, on opposite sides of a public row over the controversial appointment of one of them to the House of Lords.Tim Allan, who was in charge of Sir Keir Starmer's communications until he resigned on Monday, has issued a statement, first published by The Times, in which he says he spoke to Lord Matthew Doyle about his connections to a sex offender before the now peer was offered seat in the Upper House.It is a reminder of the staff turnover there has been in Downing Street in Sir Keir's first 18 months or so in office – and indeed just this week, as Allan refers to the also now departed former Chief of Staff, Morgan McSweeney.And it substantiates the argument Sir Keir himself made in the House of Commons.\"I was asked to speak to Matthew Doyle by Morgan McSweeney regarding Doyle's  relationship with Sean Morton. I accurately relayed what Doyle had told me to the PM. The PM is right to state that Doyle did not tell me about his campaigning in a council election for Morton. Doyle did however tell me that he had believed Morton's protestations of innocence prior to his conviction and had been supportive of him during that time.\"I have offered Lord Doyle a right of reply at each stage of this story over the last day or so and he has so far declined to comment. In an earlier statement he said he apologised for an \"error of judgement\" in choosing to campaign for a man who had been charged over images of child sexual abuse.And all this after the prime minister was told to his face by one of his own MPs, Emma Lewell, that the last few weeks had led to people \"screaming at me in the street that I am a member of the paedo protectors party\".The remarks, at a private meeting of Labour MPs and peers with the prime minister, hadn't been intended to be heard beyond the room in which they were made. But they are an insight into the fear that the noisy revelations of the last few weeks are cutting through to the wider electorate, are being noticed.This latest row has prompted fresh concerns within Labour about the prime minister's judgement, as there are striking parallels with the last one about Lord Mandelson.A prominent Labour figure is offered a job in the prime minister's gift, only for revelations to emerge that lead some to question the wisdom of the appointment. The prime minister then publicly criticises the person he gave the job to and criticises the vetting process for their appointment.Am I talking here about Lord Mandelson or Lord Doyle? As different as the two cases are in their specifics, I could be talking about either when it comes to how their jobs came about.There are now calls within the Labour Party for Lord Doyle to be stripped of his peerage, under the new law originally planned to remove Lord Mandelson's seat in the Lords.As for the prime minister, he must be mighty glad the half-term break is now imminent and Parliament will be in recess for a week.He could no doubt use a firebreak from the recent political heat.",

The warnings are for both river flooding and groundwater flooding. Areas experiencing river flooding should improve over the next few days but it is a different story in terms of groundwater.Some areas are experiencing flooding because of their geology, with porous chalk below the surface acting like an enormous sponge.That forms an aquafer that is a really important source of drinking water in southern England. But that layer of chalk is saturated and the groundwater flooding we are seeing as a result is likely to last a great deal longer, probably for many days or even weeks ahead.",

    "body": "1 hour agoHenry Zeffman,Chief political correspondentandBecky Morton,Political reporterPA MediaSir Chris Wormald was appointed as cabinet secretary just over a year agoKemi Badenoch has written to the regulator of civil service appointments urging them to stop Sir Keir Starmer from sacking the cabinet secretary until after documents relating to Lord Mandelson have been published.Sir Chris Wormald, who is head of the Civil Service, is understood to be negotiating an exit package from the job to which he was appointed by the PM in December 2024.The government's favoured successor is Dame Antonia Romeo, the top civil servant at the Home Office, who was on the four-person shortlist for the role when Sir Chris was appointed.Cabinet Office minister Chris Ward said the process of releasing documents was under way and would be \"unaffected by other matters\".Taking questions in the House of Commons, Ward said the papers would be published \"as soon as possible\" after MPs return from the parliamentary recess on 23 February.In her letter to the First Civil Service Commissioner, Badenoch said since the cabinet secretary is overseeing the government's release of documents demanded by Parliament about Lord Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador, his removal should wait until after that is complete.Badenoch described Sir Chris as \"the latest person to be thrown under a bus by this prime minister\" and said there should be a \"full new process\" to select his replacement.The First Civil Service Commissioner, who oversees appointments to the Civil Service, is currently Baroness Stuart, former Labour MP and Brexit campaigner Gisela Stuart.In her letter Badenoch also referred to an interview given to Channel 4 News on Wednesday evening by Lord McDonald, the former head of the Foreign Office.Lord McDonald said that if Dame Antonia was the favoured candidate to succeed Sir Chris then \"in my view, the due diligence has some way still to go\".This has been interpreted in government as a reference to an investigation Dame Antonia faced over allegations about her spending in 2017 when she was the government's consul-general in New York, and Lord McDonald was her boss.In response to Lord McDonald's interview, a cabinet office spokesperson said: \"There is absolutely no basis for this criticism.\"⁠\"Antonia Romeo is a highly respected permanent secretary with a 25-year record of excellent public service. \"The allegations all come from a single grievance made some time ago by a former employee. All the allegations were dismissed on the basis there was no case to answer.\"Sir Keir has promised to tighten up vetting for senior roles, after the appointments of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador and Lord Doyle as a peer, despite their links to convicted sex offenders.Getty ImagesDame Antonia Romeo has held senior roles at the Department for International Trade, the Ministry of Justice and the Home OfficeIf she was appointed, Dame Antonia would be the first female head of the Civil Service.Critics of the Downing Street operation, including Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, have claimed there has been a \"boys' club\" culture and called for more women to be given senior roles.Given the job just over a year ago, Sir Chris looks set to become the shortest-serving cabinet secretary in the history of the post.At the time of his appointment, the PM said Sir Chris would be tasked with \"the complete re-wiring of the British state to deliver bold and ambitious long-term reform\".However, as a career civil servant some questioned whether he was the best person to reform the Civil Service and reports that Downing Street was unhappy with his performance in the role have swirled for months.Sir Chris also had ultimate responsibility for the due diligence checks carried out before Lord Mandelson's appointment, although he took up the role only a few days before the appointment was formally announced. He would be the latest senior official to leave the government operation in the last week, following Sir Keir's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and his director of communications Tim Allan, as the PM seeks to reset his team following the Mandelson scandal.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesA mourner visits a memorial at a candlelit vigil in Tumbler Ridge.An 18-year-old has been named as the suspect in a shooting that killed eight people and injured dozens more in British Columbia, Canada.Police said Jesse Van Rootselaar was found dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot injury. The motive for the attack is not yet known.Six people were killed and at least 25 others were injured at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Two others - the suspect's mother, 39, and step-brother, 11 - were found dead at a nearby home. Hundreds of mourners gathered to exchange comfort and moments of silence in Tumbler Ridge's main square and outside the British Columbia legislature in Victoria on Wednesday night.Getty Images\"Schools should be safe,\" said Tumbler Ridge vigil attendee Gigi Rejano said, according to the AFP news agency, while others cried nearby and pictures of victims were laid near a tree.In Victoria, speaker of the legislature Raj Chouhan said, \"We can only pray together, hold hands together and send our love to all those people\", according to a local journalist. The shooting at the nearby home occurred first, then the suspect went to the school, McDonald said.The victims at the school were a 39-year-old female educator, three female students, all aged 12, and two male students, one aged 12 and the other 13. Authorities do not believe there are other suspects involved in the shootings.Police said they had attended the suspect's family home on multiple occasions over the past several years, with some calls related to mental health concerns.Authorities said Van Rootselaar was born a biological male but identified as a woman.\"I can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who approximately six years ago began to transition to female,\" Dwayne McDonald, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner, said. Van Rootselaar was known to police, and \"we've begun the process of reaching out to\" the public health care system to \"understand what interactions may have taken place,\" British Columbia Premier David Eby told a news conference outside the Tumbler Ridge town hall late on Wednesday evening.The suspect previously had a valid gun licence that had since lapsed, McDonald said.Police said Van Rootselaar had dropped out of Tumbler Ridge Secondary School four years ago. Around 13:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Tuesday, police received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Officers arrived on the scene within two minutes of the call, heard active gunfire and entered the school, McDonald said. Within minutes they located the shooter, who was deceased from what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities found two firearms - a long gun and a modified handgun - on the scene. But McDonald said it remains unclear the exact roles the firearms played in the shooting. Police then began searching for victims throughout the school. Two victims were taken to hospital by air ambulance and remain in hospital. Tumbler Ridge has about 2,400 residents, and its secondary school has 160 students in Grades 7-12.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the students and teachers \"bore witness to unheard-of cruelty\" during the shooting, noting that some victims remain in hospital \"fighting for their lives\".Tumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka told reporters late on Wednesday the close-knit community was \"one big family.\"\"Lend your ear when someone needs your ear,\" he said, growing emotional at times. \"Lend your shoulder when someone needs your shoulder. Give somebody a hug.\"Are you in Tumbler Ridge? Get in touch here",

The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it took a \"range of circumstances\" into account including her increasingly prominent public presence at official events\" in making this assessment.The NIS also said it would keep close tabs on whether she will attend the North's party congress later this month - its largest political event that is held once every five years.The party Congress is where Pyongyang is expected to give more details about priorities like foreign policy, war planning and nuclear ambitions for the next five years.On Thursday lawmaker Lee Seong-kwen told reporters that Ju Ae, who was previously described by the NIS as being \"trained\" to be a successor, was now at the stage of \"successor designation\". \"As Kim Ju Ae has shown her presence at various events, including the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army and her visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, and signs have been detected of her voicing her opinion on certain state policies, the NIS believes she has now entered the stage of being designated as successor,\" Lee said.Ju Ae is the only known child of Kim Jong Un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju. The NIS believes Kim Jong Un has an older son, but this son has never been acknowledged nor shown on North Korean media.News of Ju Ae's existence first emerged through an unlikely source: the American basketball player Dennis Rodman, who revealed to The Guardian newspaper back in 2013 that he \"held baby Ju Ae\" during a trip to the secretive state.Ju Ae - who is believed to be 13 - made her first appearance on state television in 2022. She was shown inspecting North Korea's latest intercontinental ballistic missile while holding her father's hand. She has since made frequent appearances on on state media, softening her father's image of a ruthless dictator.  She accompanied him to Beijing for China's largest-ever military parade, where she was seen stepping off his armoured train at Beijing Railway Station.She is often seen wearing her hair long, which is forbidden for her peers, and wearing designer clothes, which are out of reach for most in her country.Another lawmaker, Park Sun-won said the role Ju Ae had taken on during public events indicated that she has started to provide policy input and is being treated as the de facto second-highest leader. The North Korean power had passed down the three generations of the Kim family, and it is widely believed that Kim Jong Un will pass on the throne to Ju Ae.In recent months, she was shown standing taller than her father, walking beside him, rather than following him. In North Korea, where photos published by the state media are believed to carry a great symbolic weight, it is rare for individuals other than Kim Jong Un to be positioned equally prominently in the frame.EPAAlthough the South Korean spy agency now believes Ju Ae is the designated heir, it still raises questions.It is puzzling why Ju Ae, a daughter, would be selected as the heir above an older son in North Korea's deeply patriarchal society. Many defectors and analysts had previously dismissed the idea of a woman leading North Korea as an unlikely scenario, referring to the country's entrenched traditional gender roles. But Kim Jong Un's sister - Kim Yo Jong - does offer a precedent for female authority in the regime.Kim Yo Jong currently holds a senior position in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and is reported to have influence over her brother.However, it is also a mystery why Kim Jong Un, who is still young and appears relatively healthy, is already designating a 13-year-old child as his heir now.It is unclear what changes Ju Ae's succession may bring to North Korea. Many North Koreans hoped that Kim Jong Un, a Western-educated young man, would open their country up to the outside when he succeeded his father. Yet such hope was unfulfilled. Whatever plans this teenager may have for her country, she would likely have the singular power to shape it however she likes.",

    "body": "How have the big-name striker signings done so far in the Premier League?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Viktor Gyokeres (left), Alexander Isak (centre) and Benjamin Sesko all made high-profile transfers in the summer, joining Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United respectivelyByMichael EmonsBBC Sport journalistStrikers dominated the summer transfer window as a host of major Premier League sides looked to strengthen up front.Not a day went by without speculation as reigning champions Liverpool and last season's runners-up Arsenal were among the teams to bolster their attacking options, with Manchester United and Chelsea doing likewise.We had strikers going on strike, clubs gazumping their rivals and plenty more drama along the way.With the international break ongoing, clubs are left to reflect on their seven league matches so far.But how have the big-name forward signings got on? We have taken a look at nine of them to see how they have fared - and want you to have your say.Thierno Barry (Everton)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Among those to have played at least 180 minutes in the Premier League this season, no player averages more off-ball runs in behind per 90 minutes than Barry's 17.7Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 208. Goals: 0. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 0. Chances created: 1.Everton paid £27m to sign 22-year-old striker Thierno Barry from Villarreal after he scored 11 La Liga goals last season.But it has been a tough start at the Toffees for the France Under-21 international.He is yet to score in nine games in all competitions and five of his seven Premier League appearances have come as a substitute, with Beto often preferred by manager David Moyes.Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Leeds United)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Only Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo (17) and Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta (14) have recorded more flick-ons in the Premier League this season than Dominic Calvert-Lewin's 13Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 5. Minutes played: 357. Goals: 1. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 7. Chances created: 6.After scoring 57 Premier League goals for Everton in a nine-year spell, Dominic Calvert-Lewin left the Toffees on a free transfer and quickly joined newly promoted Leeds United.England international Calvert-Lewin, 28, had a chance to \"revive his career\", said Whites boss Daniel Farke, who has regularly used the striker - starting him in four of Leeds' Premier League matches so far.Calvert-Lewin got his first goal for the club, and his first since January, in Leeds' 3-1 win at Wolves on 20 September, but that remains his only goal of the campaign.Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hugo Ekitike has a shot accuracy of 40% in the Premier League this season and no summer signing has scored more than him so farStats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 6. Minutes played: 386. Goals: 3. Assists: 1. Shots on target: 4. Chances created: 4.France international Ekitike was a wanted man in the summer, with Newcastle United the first club to make a bid for him. With Liverpool initially being frustrated in their efforts to sign Alexander Isak from the Magpies, the Reds quickly made a move themselves - signing him for an initial £69m from Eintracht Frankfurt. To Newcastle's frustration, Liverpool also went on to sign Isak.The 23-year-old has proved an instant hit with the fans, although question marks remain around how he and Isak will fit into the champions' team together.Ekitike has scored three goals and has one assist so far, but was sent off after taking his shirt off while celebrating a late winner against Southampton in the Carabao Cup.Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Only Manchester United's Bryan Mbeumo (108) and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins (100) have made more off-ball runs in behind in the Premier League this season than Gyokeres' 86. He has also had the joint-third most touches in the opposition's box (45)Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 578. Goals: 3. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 5. Chances created: 5.Sweden international Viktor Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games in 2024-25 and helped Sporting win a second successive Portuguese league title before moving to Arsenal in the summer.The Gunners signed the 27-year-old in a deal that could be worth up to £64m, and he has been a vital part of the side that sits on top of the Premier League table.He has started all seven of their league games, scoring twice in the 5-0 win over Leeds and once in the 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, and has also started in both of Arsenal's Champions League victories. Alexander Isak (Liverpool)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Only Arsenal's Leandro Trossard (0.62) has a higher xG (expected goals) among players without a shot on target in the Premier League this season than Alexander Isak's 0.61Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 3. Minutes played: 181. Goals: 0. Assists: 1. Shots on target: 0. Chances created: 1.Alexander Isak's protracted transfer from Newcastle to Liverpool was the story of the summer window.The Sweden striker released a statement in which he said promises had been \"broken\" by Newcastle and that their \"relationship can't continue\" after Liverpool's first bid was rejected, before he finally moved on transfer deadline day for a British record of £125m.But, without much of a pre-season, Isak, 26, has made a slow start at Liverpool. He is yet to have a shot on target after his first three Premier League games, although he has registered an assist and scored in a 2-1 win over Southampton in the Carabao Cup.Igor Jesus (Nottingham Forest)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Among strikers with 10 or more aerial duels in the Premier League this season, only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (84.2% - 16/19) has a higher success rate than Igor Jesus' 60% (6/10)Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 6. Minutes played: 101. Goals: 0. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 2. Chances created: 1.Brazil international striker Igor Jesus joined Nottingham Forest in a £10m move from Botafogo in July.It has been a tough start to the campaign for Forest, who are without a win in nine games in all competitions and sacked Nuno Espirito Santo, replacing him with Ange Postecoglou in September.Jesus, 24, is yet to score in the Premier League but has scored four goals in cup competitions - two in the 3-2 Carabao Cup loss to Swansea City and then another double a week later, when Forest drew 2-2 with Real Betis in the Europa League.Joao Pedro (Chelsea)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (10) and Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo (nine) have more goal involvements in the Premier League this season than Joao Pedro's five (two goals, three assists)Stats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 586. Goals: 2. Assists: 3. Shots on target: 3. Chances created: 7.Chelsea completed a deal worth £60m to take Brazil forward Joao Pedro from Brighton on an eight-year contract, and he headed straight to the United States to play at the Club World Cup.His two goals in the semi-final helped beat Fluminense and he then scored against European champions Paris St-Germain as Chelsea won the final.In the Premier League he has scored twice and assisted three goals, although he has not scored in his past six games in all competitions. However, with Cole Palmer and another new Blues striker Liam Delap, a £30m summer signing from Ipswich Town, both injured, Joao Pedro, 24, is leading the Chelsea line every week.Benjamin Sesko (Manchester United)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, No player has scored more goals from inside the six-yard box in the Premier League this season than Benjamin Sesko's twoStats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 7. Minutes played: 385. Goals: 2. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 6. Chances created: 5.Manchester United completed the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko in a move worth £73.7m in August.The 22-year-old Slovenia international's first start came as United suffered a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby Town, who won 12-11 on penalties, with Sesko criticised as he was the last of 10 United outfielders to take a spot-kick in the shootout.However, he has scored twice in recent weeks, in the 3-1 loss against Brentford on 27 September and then again seven days later in the 2-0 victory over Sunderland.Nick Woltemade (Newcastle United)Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, No player has more headed goals in the Premier League this season than his two, which is as many as he scored in his 70 appearances in the BundesligaStats from Premier League 2025-26. Appearances: 4. Minutes played: 305. Goals: 3. Assists: 0. Shots on target: 3. Chances created: 2.With Alexander Isak making it clear he wanted to move from Newcastle to Liverpool, Eddie Howe moved to sign 23-year-old Germany striker Nick Woltemade.The 6ft 6in (1.98m) frontman joined in a club record deal worth up to £69m and has already made an impact.He scored the only goal on his debut in a 1-0 win against Wolves and has also netted against Arsenal, Union St-Gilloise in the Champions League and against Nottingham Forest.",

    "body": "Three players, 57 goals - who is the best striker?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe are all in irresistible form this seasonByEmlyn BegleyBBC Sport journalistHe is a striker in form, netting well over a goal a game, scoring in almost every match this season. He is leading his club's title charge and taking his country to the brink of the World Cup.Usually this would be a remarkable introduction for any one player.But this season it applies to not one, not two, but three of Europe's leading strikers.Kylian Mbappe has hit 17 goals in 13 matches for Real Madrid and France this season. But the 26-year-old is only Europe's third-most prolific striker.Harry Kane, 32, has bagged 19 goals in 12 matches for Bayern Munich and England.And Erling Haaland, 25, leads the way on 21 goals in 12 games for Manchester City and Norway. As you do.It is early in the season but it already seems to be a three-horse race for the European Golden Shoe - awarded on a points system to the top striker in European club football.And only about half their goals have come in the league.The three are currently far above any of their European competitors.Paris St-Germain's Ousmane Dembele, who won the Ballon d'Or recently, has only played five times this season because of injury.Alexander Isak has not found full fitness yet after missing the start of the season at Newcastle as he tried to force through his £125m move to Liverpool.And Robert Lewandowski, now 37, has more substitute appearances than starts for Barcelona this season.Viktor Gyokeres has not been able to keep pace either. Last season, he won the Gerd Muller Trophy - unlike the Golden Shoe, awarded solely on goals rather than a points system - scoring 63 goals for Sporting and Sweden. But he was never going to match those numbers playing at a higher domestic standard with Arsenal.How do the three compare this season?Haaland has been the most prolific of the trio this season with his 21 goals in 12 games coming at an average of one every 47 minutes.Kane's total of 19 in 12 equates to one every 52 minutes, and Mbappe is averaging one every 67 minutes with his 17 goals in 13 games.Mbappe has four assists, with the other two notching three each.In a comparison of their general play, the stats show - as you might expect - Kane and Mbappe are involved a lot more than Haaland.Mbappe (772) has touched the ball more than Kane (445) and Haaland (257) combined.A much higher percentage of Haaland's touches come in the penalty area too.Haaland has only created six chances for team-mates, compared to Mbappe's 38 and Kane's 27.It is a similar story when comparing the number of passes completed by each forward - 97 by Haaland, 456 by Mbappe and 231 by Kane.The Norwegian has won 25 aerial duels - with 12 for Kane and three for Mbappe.Kane is the most lethal goalscorer of the three this season with 42% of his 45 shots resulting in a goal, followed closely by Haaland's 39% of 54 shots - while Mbappe has netted 22% of his 77 efforts.In club football, Kane has been the most prolific this season - as he has just one goal for England, with Haaland netting nine for Norway and Mbappe scoring three times for France.All three nations are top of their World Cup qualifying groups with maximum points.Now BBC Sport will look at all three separately - and assess what records they could break.Media caption, 'Astonishing' Kane & Mbappe reaching record levelsKane chases league scoring recordEngland's top goalscorer Kane has notched 18 goals for Bayern in 10 games this season, including 11 in the Bundesliga and four in the Champions League - plus that one goal for his country.He has netted 47% of Bayern's 38 goals this season.Only Augsburg and amateurs Andorra have kept him out in his 19 matches for club and country so far.He has hat-tricks against Leipzig and Hoffenheim.If Kane kept this Bundesliga scoring rate up all season, he would end on 62 goals. Nobody has ever scored that many in any of Europe's major leagues.The Bundesliga record is the 41 that Lewandowski netted for Bayern in 2020-21.Tottenham's all-time top scorer has won Germany's version of the Golden Boot in both seasons for Bayern, with 36 goals and then 26 goals, to add to his three Premier League awards.A repeat this time around would make him only the second person to win three in a row in the Bundesliga after Lewandowski (who won five in a row).That would also put him joint third on the list of award winners, along with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Ulf Kirsten.Lewandowski and Bayern icon Gerd Muller won seven each. As Kane is 32, he is unlikely to reach that figure.Mbappe going for eighth consecutive Golden BootMbappe has struck 14 times in 10 matches for Real this season - and three in three for France.That is 54% of Real's 28 goals in all competitions. Only against Mallorca has he failed to strike - and he has one hat-trick in the Champions League against Kairat Almaty.If Mbappe kept up his scoring rate of nine goals in eight games in La Liga, he would end up with 42 goals.Only Lionel Messi (twice) and Cristiano Ronaldo have ever scored more in a Spanish top-flight season.He is chasing an eighth consecutive league Golden Boot after winning six in a row in Ligue 1 for PSG (for whom he is their all-time top scorer) and then last year's La Liga one at Real.In the Champions League, he has netted five goals in two games. That goal rate is clearly unsustainable over a whole season but it gives him a chance of hunting down Ronaldo's record of 17 in a Champions League season (2013-14).If Real were to get to the final (and not need the knockout rounds play-off) Mbappe would have another 13 matches in the competition.He will also hope to be France's all-time top goalscorer by the time this season is out. He has scored 53 goals, only four off Olivier Giroud's record.Hundred for Haaland?Even by Haaland's very high standards, this season has been something else.Norway's all-time leading goalscorer has scored 12 goals in nine games for City. Tottenham are the only team to keep him out.But for Norway, it is a sensational nine in three matches (including five against Moldova and three against Israel) to take them to the brink of a first World Cup since 1998, before he was born.He has scored 12 times during the whole World Cup qualifying campaign so far, twice as many as any other European player.He is the joint top scorer in qualifying worldwide - along with Qatar's Almoez Ali. Ali has played 13 games - to Haaland's six.Haaland has set the bar so high that his total of nine goals in the first seven Premier League games of the season is only his third best at this stage in his four seasons in England.He had netted 11 by now in 2022 and 10 last season.His current league scoring rate over the course of the season would bring him 49 goals. The Premier League record is the 36 he scored in 2022-23.Dixie Dean's record of 60 top-flight goals for Everton in 1927–28 will probably never be broken.If we only count his City stats this season, he is on course to score about 70 club goals in all competitions if they reach the Champions League final (without him even playing in the Carabao Cup or FA Cup).If you allow us to get a bit silly and including his overall goalscoring rate for club and country, he could end the season on more than 100 goals...Who do people think is the best?With three players in such good form, opinion on the best is bound to be divided.Former Scotland, Chelsea and Everton winger Pat Nevin, a BBC Sport pundit, said: \"It is no denigration of Erling Haaland, who is one of the great players in world football. \"In England, they admire Harry and all the rest of it, but he also should be considered one of the greats in world football. Maybe he's not seen as that in England, but he is.\"When you are watching a game when Haaland is at his best, your eye is always drawn to him. It seems like there are 21 footballers out there and Haaland.\"If you go and watch Harry Kane at Bayern, one of the top teams in the world, it is Kane and 10 others. He is a force of nature. And not just in Bundesliga games. I am talking Champions League games. He is a colossus.\"Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague, meanwhile, thinks Mbappe and Barcelona winger Lamine Yamal are the best two players of any position in the world right now.While Manchester City team mate Nico Gonzalez believes Haaland is \"the best striker in the world\".So what do you think?",

    "body": "22 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentiStock/Getty ImagesAre you ill? If not, you probably know someone who is - or at the very least someone who has just recovered. Coughs and colds, it seems, are rampant at the moment.And, if the anecdotes of people I know are anything to go by, the bug going round seems to be a particularly nasty one. Sore throat? Tick. Streaming nose? Tick. Sinus pressure? Double tick.What's going on?The perfect breeding ground\"This is normal, it's autumn after all,\" says Prof Jonathan Ball, from Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.He says a combination of children returning to school, adults back at work after the summer break and people spending more time indoors as the weather turns cooler creates a ripe breeding ground for respiratory viruses to flourish.\"Basically we have a big mixing pot of different viruses that are beginning to do the rounds. Immunity has waned and people are getting ill.\" There are actually more than 100 different viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, plus some bacterial infections. Is there more illness than normal?Data collection from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows Rhinovirus – what many of us would call the common cold – has been on the increase in recent weeks and seems to be the most common cause of illness at the moment.Covid is also doing the rounds, driven by two new variants – XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. But there is already a high degree of immunity built up in the population meaning, for most, it's a fairly mild infection.There are signs flu may be on the rise too – there has been an increase in the 15-25 age group over the past week - while RSV, which can cause serious illness in young children, also tends to take off in the autumn.\"There is often, although not always, a pattern,\" says Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA. \"You tend to see Rhinovirus take off first and then RSV,\" he explains. \"Flu tends to come later in December and January. But that's not always the case – and certainly the pandemic disrupted the traditional seasonal trends. What we've seen in the last year or so is those trends return to something like normal.\"He says the levels of illnesses at the moment are not particularly high.\"Covid is above baseline and there's a lot of Rhinovirus around. The uptick in flu in that younger age group has perhaps come a little bit earlier than we would expect, but it is still at a low level.\"Is it a cold, flu or Covid?The most common symptoms, according to the NHS, are:ColdsSymptoms appear graduallyMostly affect nose and throatEarly sign - pressure in your earsChestier, mucus coughFluComes on suddenlyFeel wiped outFever, muscle aches, exhaustionNeed bed restDry coughCovidTypical flu symptomsLoss of taste of smellDiarrhoea or tummy upsetMany of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid overlap.How can you protect yourself?Respiratory infections can, of course, be really dangerous for vulnerable people - in a bad winter tens of thousands of people can die of flu.But there is nothing to suggest the respiratory viruses circulating now are causing more serious illness this year in otherwise healthy people. \"We all react in different ways – and we don't really understand why,\" admits Prof Ball. \"Of course, age and fitness have a lot to do with it, but sometimes it is just your individual genetics or how tired and rundown you may be, or when you were last exposed to that particular virus.\"In terms of protecting yourself, the most important step to take, if you are eligible, is to get vaccinatinated. Shots are being offered for flu, Covid and RSV to protect those who are most at-risk of serious illness, which includes older people and those with certain health conditions.If you are ill, UKHSA says you can help protect others by washing your hands regularly, especially after coughing or sneezing, staying at home if you can and consider wearing a mask if you do have to go into public places.Prof Ball says it is right to take precautions to try to protect vulnerable people, but adds if you are healthy and young or of working age, getting the odd respiratory illness is pretty inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing.\"Most people will get one or two respiratory infections every year. In some ways, it's a good thing when you are a child or healthy adult.\"By getting exposed you are building up your immunity through natural infection - so when you are older you hopefully have enough immunity to not get severely ill.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "A mass shooting at a crowded bar in the southern US state of South Carolina has left four people dead and at least 20 injured, officials said. Hundreds of people were gathered at the popular bar on St Helena Island in the early hours of Sunday morning when gunfire broke out, leading multiple victims and witnesses to run to nearby businesses for shelter, according to the Beaufort County Sheriff's office. Four people were declared dead at the bar and at least 20 were injured, including four who were sent to local hospitals in critical condition, the sheriff's office said. The incident is still under investigation, and the sheriff's office is looking into possible suspects, it said. When police and first responders arrived, they found several people suffering from gunshot wounds, the sheriff's office said in a statement. It's not clear if the shooting was random or targeted, and a spokesperson for the sheriff's office declined to share more details. The bar where the shooting took place, Willie's Bar and Grill, offers Gullah-inspired cuisine and says on its website that it aims to spread the \"heartwarming spirit of the Gullah Geechee culture\". The Gullah Geechee people are descendants of Africans who were enslaved on plantations along the south-eastern US coast, including in South Carolina. \"COMPLETELY HEARTBROKEN to learn about the devastating shooting in Beaufort County,\" South Carolina Republican Representative Nancy Mace wrote on X. \"Our prayers are with the victims, their families, and everyone impacted by this horrific act of violence.\"Willie's did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.

    "body": "3 hours agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent in IstanbulAt least 27 people have been killed in fierce clashes between Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City, in one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave.Masked Hamas gunmen exchanged fire with clan fighters near the city's Jordanian hospital, witnesses said.A senior official in the Hamas-run interior ministry said security units surrounded them and engaged in heavy fighting to detain them. The ministry said eight its members were killed in \"an armed assault by a militia\".Medical sources said 19 Dughmush clan members and eight Hamas fighters had been killed since fighting began on Saturday.Eyewitnesses said the clashes erupted in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in southern Gaza City after a Hamas force of more than 300 fighters moved to storm a residential block where Dughmush gunmen were entrenched.Residents described scenes of panic as dozens of families fled their homes under heavy gunfire, many of them displaced multiple times during the war. \"This time people weren't fleeing Israeli attacks,\" one resident said. \"They were running from their own people.\"The Dughmush family, one of Gaza's most prominent clans, has long had a tense relationship with Hamas, and its armed members have clashed with the group on several occasions in the past.The Hamas-run interior ministry said its forces were seeking to restore order, warning that \"any armed activity outside the framework of the resistance\" would be dealt with firmly.Both sides traded accusations over who was responsible for triggering the clashes.Hamas earlier said Dughmush gunmen killed two of its fighters and wounded five others, prompting the group to launch an operation against them.However, a source from the Dughmush family told local media that Hamas forces had come to a building that once served as the Jordanian Hospital, where the family had taken refuge after their homes in the al-Sabra neighbourhood were destroyed in the recent Israeli attack.The source claimed that Hamas sought to evict the family from the building to establish a new base for its forces there.Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.Reports suggest armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police. The Hamas media office denied it was deploying \"fighters in the streets\".",

    "body": "58 minutes agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterBridget Phillipson says it's unacceptable that Jewish students feel they need to conceal their identity on campusUniversities must act to protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination on campuses, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said, as she set out measures to tackle antisemitism.Phillipson said there had been an \"unacceptable increase in antisemitism\" at universities and added that many Jewish students currently do not feel safe on campuses.She said the UK government was funding training to help staff and students at universities \"tackle this poison of antisemitism\".\"There can be no place for harassment and intimidation,\" Phillipson told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. \"Universities can and must act on that.\"Speaking on the programme, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said the Labour government should be \"gripping\" antisemitism in the UK, including what she branded \"hate marches where people are being so racist to the Jewish community\".She argued \"hatred\" was demonstrated on the streets of London on Saturday, when thousands of protesters gathered for a rally in support of Palestinians.Ahead of the march, organisers had said they wanted to show solidarity with the Palestinian people.There have also been regular protests staged at universities over the conflict in Gaza, including on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel earlier this week.The protests went ahead despite the pleas of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who urged students not to take part, warning of \"rising antisemitism on our streets\".The demonstrations came days after two Jewish men were killed in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur.A report by the Community Security Trust, a charity which provides security at sites like synagogues and Jewish schools, last year found a 117% increase in antisemitic incidents on university campuses in the 2022/23 and 2023/2024 academic years, when compared with the preceding two years.Phillipson said she had spoken to Jewish students who felt they needed to conceal their identity.\"On campus, Jewish students don't feel safe,\" she said. \"And often, parents worry about sending their children to university. We cannot accept that. There can be no place for it.\"The education secretary said she had written to university vice-chancellors urging them to take steps to protect Jewish students from harassment.The government said the Union of Jewish Students will deliver 600 training sessions to help university staff support students, identify harassment and hate.A £4m fund will support projects that teach pupils and students how to identify misinformation online and promote interfaith understanding.Separately, £2m is being put towards a scheme to teach secondary school pupils in England about the Holocaust - the genocide of Jews during World War Two.Patel said the Conservatives stood by the right to protest and freedom of expression.But Patel told Laura Kuenssberg that pro-Palestinian marches taking place in London were \"ugly protests\" which demonstrated \"division and hatred\" in our society.\"Look at what happened on the streets of London yesterday. Look at the level of hatred that was demonstrated on the streets of London to Britain's Jewish community,\" she said.Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in central London on Saturday, as well as a small group of pro-Israeli counter-protesters.The director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign - one of the groups that organised the march - said the group would \"never stop\" supporting Palestinians.Ben Jamal said: \"This is a movement supported by millions of people in this country and around the world who want freedom and justice for Palestine.\"During the march, which came a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began in Gaza, slogans such as \"stop arming Israel\" and \"free Palestine\" could be seen.The Metropolitan Police said it had made 14 arrests for offences including breaching Public Order Act conditions, affray and supporting a proscribed group.",

    "body": "4 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondent andNick Edserbusiness reporterDonald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods is \"a typical example of US double standards\", China's government has said.A commerce ministry spokesperson also said China could introduce its own unspecified \"countermeasures\" if the US president carries out his threat, adding it was \"not afraid\" of a possible trade war.On Friday, Trump hit back at Beijing's move to tighten its rules for rare earths exports, accusing it  of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\". He also threatened to pull out of a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping later this month.But on Sunday, Trump wrote: \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\" \"Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!\" Trump said in a post on social media, without elaborating further. Trump's comments on Friday rattled financial markets, with the S&P 500 share index closing down 2.7%, its steepest fall since April.The president's words renewed fears of a trade war between the US and China.In May, the two sides had agreed to drop triple-digit tariffs on each others' goods. which had raised the prospect of trade halting between the two countries.This left US tariffs on Chinese goods facing an added 30% levy compared with the start of the year, while US goods entering China face a 10% tariff.China's response - released by the commerce ministry in the form of written responses to journalist's questions - echoed language from the height of the recent trade conflict.They criticised US export restrictions on chips and semi-conductors as well as defending China's own export controls on rare earths as \"normal actions\" to safeguard national security and that of all nations.The spokesperson said that for \"a long time\", the US had \"overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures\" and \"adopted discriminatory practices against China\".\"Resorting to tariff threats is not the right way to engage with China,\" the spokesperson said.\"China's position on a tariff war has always been consistent: we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.\"Last week, China announced it was tightening export controls on rare earths and other materials critical for advanced tech manufacturing.This was seen as key move, as the country processes about 90% of the world's rare earths, which are used in goods such as solar panels and smartphones.The recent comments from Washington and Beijing are being seen by some as a means of strengthening positions ahead of future trade talks.It is unclear whether a meeting between Trump and Xi, expected at a summit in South Korea later this month, will still proceed.",

    "body": "A man has been charged with stalking after allegedly targeting leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey and his family over a period of several months.Inigo Rowland, who is also charged with possession of a flick-knife, is accused of turning up at the Kingston and Surbiton MP's south-west London home \"unannounced\" and on \"numerous\" occasions between June and October, according to a court list.The 58-year-old from Surbiton appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on 7 October and was remanded into custody, the Met Police said.Sir Ed, 59, and his wife Emily have a 17-year-old son called John, who has a neurological condition and learning difficulties, and a daughter, Ellie.Sir Ed won the south-west London constituency of Kingston and Surbiton in 1997 and lost his seat in 2015. He regained it in 2017 and became party leader three years later.A Met Police spokesperson said Mr Rowland was arrested on 6 October in relation to offences alleged to have taken place between June and October.He is due to appear again at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said: \"We cannot provide any details at this time; Ed's number-one priority is the safety of his family.\"",

    "body": "'In an instant, they were gone' - small town mourns after Tennessee explosives factory blast3 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduBucksnort, TennesseeBBCMourners gather for a vigil at the Maple Valley Baptist Church in Tennessee in memory of 16 people presumed dead after a blast at an explosives factoryIn Bucksnort, Tennessee, residents have spent a chilly autumn night heeding a simple message spraypainted on a concrete barrier by the side of the road: \"Pray for the AES families\". Community members gathered on Saturday for a candlelit vigil outside the Maple Valley Baptist Church after a blast at local explosives factory Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) left 16 people presumed dead.This community of Hickman and Humphreys Counties is \"not huge, so that's a lot of people to lose in an instant,\" Deacon Danny Bates said to the approximately 40 attendees, who comforted each other and sang hymns such as \"It Is Well With My Soul\".\"It was just another day at work, and then in an instant, they were gone. We have unanswered questions\".A concrete barrier on the side of a road reads \"Pray for AES families\".Vigil-goer Jerri Newcombe said her friend of more than 20 years was among the victims. The two met when Newcombe's granddaughter and the victim's daughter became close as little girls.\"They grew up together - we were in each other's homes,\" Newcombe told the BBC at the vigil. \"We celebrated birthdays together. It's just surreal, because she's gone and her babies are hurting,\" she said, referring to the victim's children and grandchildren. Local police have not publicly identified any of the unaccounted-for victims, who authorities presume have all been killed.Her friend was \"full of life\", Ms Newcombe said. \"She was the type of person that could make you laugh over anything, but you didn't cross her either, or she would tear into you,\" Ms. Newcombe added amid tears and laughter, as her granddaughter comforted her.Bucksnort is a close-knit town where the cell service is spotty and a gas station - adorned with a Confederate flag centrepiece - is the local watering hole, residents say. This tragedy has hit the area hard as the community mourns family, friends, neighbours and coworkers.The town had been holding out hope for good news after the explosion on Friday morning shook homes across the area, clouded the skies with smoke and drew a surge of hundreds of state and national first responders to an otherwise sleepy community tucked behind forests along a busy motorway.But after nearly two days with no sign of survivors and the explosion site still considered dangerous for first responders, even the previously optimistic Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said the time had come to switch to a recovery - rather than rescue - strategy.\"At some point in time, we have got to rip off the Band-Aid,\" Davis, who has held back tears at news conferences, said. \"We are dealing with remains.\"Hickman County Sheriff Jason Craft told the BBC on Saturday night that rapid DNA analysis was still ongoing, but that after a search by 300 first responders, authorities had enough confidence in their assessment of the scene to notify families that their loved ones were likely deceased. No cause of the blast has yet been identified, and agents from the national Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are investigating. It could take as long as a month for federal investigators to reach the main site of the explosion, ATF official Brice McCracken told the BBC. The volatile nature of the explosive materials has also hampered the emergency response, officials said, as controlled detonations to render the site safe are also expected in the coming days.Watch: Tennessee town comes together to confront tragedyTiffany Story says her cousin was also among the victims, along with four other people that she knew, including someone she once used to babysit for.\"Everybody knows everybody here,\" an emotional Mrs Story told the BBC. \"With everybody being so close, it's very comforting to have family. That's what we are - whether [by] blood, not blood, this whole community is family.\"\"There's probably never gonna be any answers\" to the tragedy, she said.Janie Brown said she also knew victims at the site. \"They were loved by their families and by the community,\" she said outside another prayer vigil at the Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church in nearby McEwen. \"It's just a sad, sad day,\" she said.Residents told the BBC the Accurate Energetic Systems (AES) company employed about 80 workers, and is one of the only private well-paying jobs around in these counties. For many here, the plant was known as a reliable first job for themselves or close friends.A recent job opening advertised a $19-per-hour salary for an entry-level manual labour job, more than double the state's minimum wage of $7.25.The factory has seen other difficulties, but none at such a scale as this.In 2014, an explosion at the company killed one person, and a 2019 workplace safety inspection led to relatively minor financial penalties, which the company settled, according to online records. Residents who spoke to the BBC had mostly positive feelings towards the company, and local police say they had no previous reports of unsafe working conditions.Hurricane Chapel Free Will Baptist Church Pastor Tim Ferris praised his congregation's response to the tragedy.\"One thing about a small community is that when something like this happens, they rally around each other, and they come close to be the hands and the feet of Jesus, to administer to these people, to care for them, provide for them. And that's a wonderful thing,\" he said.",

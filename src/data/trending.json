    "body": "The World Cup draw is here - this is how it will workImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Washington DC has been chosen for the World Cup draw, though the city will not host any matchesByFootball issues correspondentUpdated 4 hours agoPots, quadrants, confederation constraints, group position grids... the 2026 World Cup finals draw on Friday is not going to be a straightforward affair.  There's a lot to unpack so we're going to explain it as simply as we can.Luckily, Fifa will have a computer to do most of the heavy lifting and make sure everything runs smoothly. Though as Uefa found out in 2021, sometimes technology does go wrong. Let's hope there will be no gremlins in Washington once the draw ceremony kicks off.Here is how it will work, what to expect and a few key things to look out for. When will draw start and how long will it take?Media caption, Dan Roan reports from Washington before the 2026 World Cup drawThe ceremony gets started at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time) on 5 December, but there's going to be far more to this glitzy event than simply pulling the countries out of a hat. Supermodel Heidi Klum, comedian Kevin Hart and actor and producer Danny Ramirez will co-host.Before the draw there will be live music performances from Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger, while Fifa president Gianni Infantino and US President Donald Trump are both expected to make speeches.Then it is on to video clips of the finalists, introductions and the draw itself.Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand will conduct the draw.The 47-year-old will be joined by broadcaster Samantha Johnson and a host of sporting greats, including Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Aaron Judge and Shaquille O'Neal.Once the draw has been completed, the Village People will perform YMCA to bring the curtain down, with the entire ceremony expected to last about 90 minutes.How has Fifa seeded the draw?The 48 teams have been placed into four pots of 12 based primarily on Fifa world rankings.The exceptions are the three hosts who are automatically in pot one, and the teams who will qualify through the six play-off paths, who go into pot four.Given some of the teams involved in the four European play-off paths, they have the potential to create some strong groups.Italy and Denmark would have been in pot two because of their world rankings had they qualified directly, while Wales would have been in pot three.The six play-off paths are:Uefa Play-off A: Italy, Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern IrelandUefa Play-off B: Ukraine, Poland, Albania, SwedenUefa Play-off C: Turkey, Slovakia, Kosovo, RomaniaUefa Play-off D: Denmark, Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland, North MacedoniaFifa Play-off 1: DR Congo, Jamaica, New CaledoniaFifa Play-off 2: Iraq, Bolivia, SurinameHow will the draw work?The 12 groups will include one team from each of the four pots.Fifa will start by drawing the teams from pot one.Co-hosts Mexico (A1), Canada (B1) and the United States (D1) will have coloured balls with their flags on to denote their special status. Their group positions are pre-determined to make sure they play all their games in their own countries.The draw will then continue with pots two, three and four in order.What is this about the top four teams being kept apart?Fifa's big idea is to set up the best chance of blockbuster ties in the latter stages of the World Cup. So for the first time it is giving special seeding status to the top four in the world rankings - Spain, Argentina, France and England.Crucially, this status will only apply if the countries win their groups. Let's take a look at how it will work, using England as our example.Each of the four countries will be drawn into a group in a different coloured quadrant of the bracket, as shown in the image below. Spain (ranked 1) and Argentina (2) must be in opposite halves and cannot meet until the final, likewise France (3) and England (4). France and England would not be able to meet either Spain or Argentina until the semi-finals. Let's say that France come out first and go into Group C, placing them into the green quadrant on the right side of the draw. That means England can only go into the blue or turquoise quadrants on the left side, groups E, F, G, H or I.If Argentina then drop into the blue quadrant, that further restricts England only to turquoise - groups G or H.    Are the four seeds being given an easy ride? Not necessarily.Each quadrant has a potential last-16 tie between two group winners. For instance, the blue quadrant has a meeting of the winners of Group E and Group I. That means a seeded team could meet another pot one side, let's say perhaps Brazil.Being drawn into groups C, F, H or J looks potentially more favourable, as it is not possible to play another group winner until the quarter-finals.If one of the four seeded teams finishes as group runners-up, then they lose the ranking privilege. So if England were to finish second in Group H, they would move out of turquoise and into red - perhaps meeting Spain, Argentina or France as the winners of Group J in the first knockout round.Image source, FifaImage caption, If Spain, Argentina, France and England win their groups they will slot into separate quadrants for the knockout bracketWhat are the draw restrictions to watch out for?There can be no more than one team from the same confederation per group. So, for instance, Brazil and Uruguay (Conmebol) cannot be in the same group, nor can Panama and the United States (Concacaf). There is an exception for Uefa because there are 16 teams and only 12 groups. That means four groups will contain two European nations. It all seems relatively straightforward, but as we go on these constraints are going to cause some serious complications as countries skip groups to avoid clashes with teams from their own confederation. That means it will not just be case of teams slotting into Group A, and then Group B, and then Group C in order as they are drawn. When we get to pots three and four, it might seem like countries are being sent to random groups. Fifa needs to prevent something called deadlocking, which happens when it is no longer possible to complete the draw while following the regulations.  The major issue comes from the teams who can potentially qualify via the inter-confederation play-off pathways and will go into pot four. Pathway 1 has New Caledonia (OFC), Jamaica (Concacaf) and DR Congo (CAF)Pathway 2 has Bolivia (Conmebol), Suriname (Concacaf) and Iraq (AFC)Both pathways have a Concacaf team, so they are automatically blocked out of four groups (those containing the United States, Mexico, Canada and Panama). The first pathway is less of problem, because the only other Oceania team, New Zealand, are also in pot four. But the second pathway makes it complicated, because there are 17 deadlocking nations in pots one, two and three. So, the only way to complete the draw is for the team that qualifies via this route to go into a group with two European countries and an African nation.What will this look like in practice?When pot two is being drawn, the computer will have to ensure that there is at least one group with two European teams, or one European and one African country.When it comes to pot three, there will then be two possible draw routes. If there is one group with two European nations in it, then Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia or Ivory Coast must join it. If there is one group with an African and European nation in it, then Norway or Scotland must go into it. Both could happen, in which case the draw computer will ensure one is filled as necessary. If we get to pot four and there is only one group which meets this criterion, pathway two will have to go into it.The other pot-four teams - the four potential play-off winners from Uefa, two from Concacaf, two African and one Asian nation - will have their own deadlock restrictions. The Uefa play-off paths, which include Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, will have limited options because 12 European teams will already have been drawn.   It might be hard to keep up at this point. How will teams be allocated to their groups?Once a team has been drawn they will go into the first available group, adhering to the draw constraints, in alphabetical order. The draw computer will ensure Spain, Argentina, France and England are placed in groups in the correct quadrant of the bracket.To speed up the process countries will not be drawn into their specific group positions to set the order of the fixtures.Seeded countries will all go into position one, with a pre-determined grid for all the other pots, as shown in the image below.For instance, let's take Scotland in pot three. Their fixture order will be determined by the yellow box.If they are drawn first from pot three they will go into Group A with Mexico. The grid shows the team from pot three will go into position two. The first match is A1 v A2, so Mexico would play Scotland in the opening game of the World Cup.Image source, FifaImage caption, The group position by pot has been pre-determined and will not be decided by drawWhen will teams find out when and where they will play?While nations will know their opponents and match dates on Friday, 5 December they will have to wait 24 hours to find out venues and kick-off times.The exceptions are groups A (Mexico), B (Canada) and D (US), which contain the three host nations and already have venues for the fixtures, but not kick-off times.For all other groups, you'll know only the date and the order of matches when Fifa unveils the match schedule in a live broadcast on Saturday, 6 December at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time). Fifa president Gianni Infantino will be joined on stage by legends of the game to discuss the key matches.All 12 groups will play fixtures in this order:Match Day 1: 1 v 2, 3 v 4Match Day 2: 1 v 3, 4 v 2Match Day 3: 4 v 1, 2 v 3",

I literally jumped off my bed, put my clothes on and then I was just letting everyone know [they had to leave].\"Jacob King/PA WirePolice confirmed that the suspects arrested were Polish nationalsThe two men who have been arrested are Polish nationals, Derbyshire Police has said.A police spokesperson told the BBC it had released this information in line with national guidance around forces being encouraged to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects to combat misinformation.Derby City Council confirmed it had set up an assembly point at the Pakistani Community Centre in Harrington Street to support any affected residents, with a rest centre in place at The Salvation Army in Osmaston Road.\"A number of Derby City Council colleagues are on site to support with translations and help reassure any residents who have been evacuated. Accommodation has also been arranged for any residents that need any support overnight and the coming days,\" a council spokesperson added.Gary Robb, from the Salvation Army, said: \"We don't know whether it's going to be a few hours or longer.\"We're going to have a handful of volunteers here through the night.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

Mr Bashir was earlier charged with terrorism offences that are not directly related to the attack.Frank Ferguson, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said there was sufficient evidence to charge Mr Bashir with one offence of preparation of terrorist acts and three offences of sharing terrorist publications with Al-Shamie and others with the intent to encourage acts of terrorism.FacebookPolice say Mr Bashir took Al-Shamie, pictured, to an unnamed military baseAssistant Chief Constable Rob Potts, who holds operational responsibility for Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said the charges were not directly related to the synagogue attack \"but come as a result of enquiries conducted by our investigation team\".Chief Constable Potts said the investigation into the attack \"remains live\" and urged anyone with information to come forward.Mr Bashir is set to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoPA MediaReform UK leader Nigel Farage has accused the BBC of \"double standards\" after being asked about racist and antisemitic comments he is alleged to have made as a teenager.In an earlier BBC interview, the party's deputy leader Richard Tice dismissed the claims from Farage's former classmates as \"made-up twaddle\". Asked if he agreed with his deputy, Farage said the Today programme interview was a \"disgrace\" and demanded the BBC apologise for 1970s TV shows such as \"It Ain't Half Hot Mum\" and the \"The Black and White Minstrel Show,\" which he said were homophobic and racist. The BBC has been contacted for a comment. Last week, Peter Ettedgui, a former Jewish classmate of Farage's, told the BBC Farage had repeatedly said to him \"Hitler was right\" and \"gas them\" when they had been at Dulwich College together in the 1970s and early 1980s.The BBC has also spoken to two former pupils who backed up Mr Ettedgui's accounts. When previously asked about the comments, Farage has said: \"Have I said things 50 years ago that you could interpret as being banter in a playground, that you can interpret in the modern light of day in some sort of way? Yes.\"\"I've never directly racially abused anybody. No.\"During a press conference on Thursday, Farage was again asked about the accusations and whether he believed his old schoolmates were lying. He first attacked the BBC's Today programme for their interview with Tice, saying it was \"disgraceful\" to frame a question linking himself to dictator Adolf Hitler. He went on to accuse the BBC of \"hypocrisy\" saying: \"At the time I was alleged to have made these remarks, one of your most popular weekly shows was the Black and White Minstrel Show.\"The BBC was very happy to use blackface - not just in the Black and White Minstrels, they did it in It Ain't Half Hot Mum.\"I cannot put up with the double standards of the BBC about what I'm alleged to have said 49 years ago and what you were putting out on mainstream content.\"So I want an apology from the BBC for virtually everything you did throughout the 1970s and 80s.\"The Black and White Minstrel Show, a programme where white performers painted their face black, ran from 1958 to 1978, getting peak audiences of 16 million. Even at the time it was considered offensive with the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination submitting a petition for the show to be axed. Farage also attacked ITV, describing the broadcaster as \"the channel of Bernard Manning\", referring to the comedian often accused of making racist jokes.   During the press conference, Farage said he had received letters from people he was at school with including one former Jewish classmate. Reading out the letter, he said: \"While there was plenty of macho tongue-in-cheek schoolboy banter, it was humour, and yes, sometimes it was offensive... but never with malice.\"I never heard him [Farage] racially abuse anyone.\"If he had, he would have been reported and punished. He wasn't. The news stories are without evidence, except for belatedly, politically dubious recollections from nearly half a century ago.\"Back in the 1970s the culture was very different... especially at Dulwich.\"Lots of boys said things they'd regret today or just laugh at.\"Whilst Nigel stood out, he was neither aggressive nor a racist.\"Responding to Tice's depiction of his claims as 'made-up twaddle', Mr Ettedgui said: \"Well over 20 former Dulwich pupils have now spoken of Farage's vile racist, antisemitic behaviour.\"Each individual piece of testimony has been separately sourced by journalists working for several major news outlets and has been rigorously checked by lawyers.\"All these accounts paint the exact same picture of the teenage Farage. His and Richard Tice's denials today are as offensive as the original abuse.\"A Conservative spokesman said: \"Nigel Farage just called a press conference and used it to rant at journalists over historic allegations of racism and antisemitism - allegations he has just admitted are true.\"Reform's one-man band is in chaos once again.\"",

    "body": "President Vladimir Putin has said either Ukrainian troops will withdraw from the country's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it - rejecting any compromise over a major obstacle to ending the Ukraine war.\"Either we take back these territories by force, or eventually Ukrainian troops withdraw,\" Putin told India Today.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding territory, whether held by Russia or not.Putin's comments come after President Donald Trump said his negotiators believed Russia's leader \"would like to end the war\" after talks in Moscow on Tuesday. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who led the US side of the talks, is due to meet Ukraine's negotiators in Florida.Trump said the talks were \"reasonably good\", adding it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango.\"Russian forces now control some 85% of the Donbas. The original iteration of the US peace plan proposed to hand over areas of the Donbas still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Putin.In his India Today interview ahead of a state visit to Delhi, Putin also said that Moscow disagrees with parts of the US plan.\"At times we said that yes, we can discuss this, but to that we can't agree,\" Putin said.He did not name the sticking points. At least two significant points of contention remain - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.Putin said Moscow had not seen a modified version of the US peace plan before his nearly five-hour talks with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.\"That's why we had to go over every point, that's why it took so long,\" Putin said.Putin's senior foreign policy adviser and key negotiator Yuri Ushakov earlier said the Kremlin talks produced \"no compromise\" on ending the war.Ushakov also implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to what Moscow said were its recent successes on the battlefield.But Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia accused Putin of \"wasting the world's time\", while Ukraine's ambassador to the US said they do not \"need to wait for promises from Russia\".Zelensky has insisted on firm security guarantees for Ukraine in any deal.On Wednesday, he said \"the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war\", but negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\", which Kyiv and its European allies accuse of deliberately stalling any ceasefire agreements.Zelensky earlier said his top negotiators had managed to make some key changes in the original US peace plan - seen as strongly favouring Moscow - during last week's talks with an American delegation in Geneva.In a joint statement, US and Ukrainian negotiators said they had drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" - but provided no further details.Top negotiators from Europe - who had voiced concern over the original US plan - were also in the Swiss city, meeting separately with the Ukrainian and the US teams.In a separate development on Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel news website said it had obtained a confidential transcript of a conference call in which European leaders expressed concern over the US negotiations.\"There is a possibility that the US will betray Ukraine on the issue of territory without clarity on security guarantees,\" French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said, according to an English transcript of Monday's conference call.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was quoted as warning that Zelensky had to be \"extremely careful in the coming days\".\"They are playing games, both with you and with us,\" Merz reportedly said.Finnish President Alexander Stubb was also quoted as saying: \"We mustn't leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys.\"The BBC has not seen the reported transcript. In response to a Der Spiegel inquiry, France's Élysée Palace stated that \"the president did not express himself in those terms\". The presidential office declined to provide details on how Macron expressed himself, citing confidentiality.Stubb declined to comment to Der Spiegel, and Merz has not commented on the issue.The BBC has contacted the White House for comment.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.In recent weeks, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in south-east Ukraine, despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "German president compares UK ties post-Brexit to Oasis1 hour agoMaia DaviesReutersPA MediaFrank-Walter Steinmeier referenced the Manchester band in an address in Parliament on ThursdayEarly on Thursday, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, his wife Elke Budenbender and King Charles were shown Queen Victoria's sleighGermany's president has drawn a parallel between his country's ties with the UK post-Brexit to the recent reunion of the famously feuding Oasis brothers.Frank-Walter Steinmeier told MPs and peers that disappointment and uncertainty had followed the UK split from the EU but both sides had decided \"not to stay stuck in these feelings\".\"Don't Look Back in Anger, as one of the most famous songs by Oasis puts it so well,\" he said in Parliament on the second day of his state visit.He later visited the V&A Museum's David Bowie Centre, in a nod to the musician's strong ties to Berlin, and will meet German footballers playing in the Premier League.He began his visit - the first by a German leader in 27 years - on Wednesday with a ceremonial reception by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, and a star-studded festive banquet at Windsor Castle.He used remarks at this event and his trip to Parliament to stress the improving relations between his nation and the UK since Brexit in 2020.\"I think that is typically British, keep calm and carry on - look ahead pragmatically, move on,\" Steinmeier said in the House of Parliament's Royal Gallery on Thursday afternoon. He later returned to the riff on Oasis at the end of his speech, remarking on the band's sell-out reunion tour after 16 years of acrimony between frontman Liam Gallagher and his guitarist brother Noel.\"Cool Britannia is alive! Our relations may have changed, but, my dear Britons, our love remains,\" he said. \"So let us look not to the past, but rather together to the future.\"Steinmeier and his wife Elke Budenbender were then joined by UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy at the Victoria and Albert Museum's East Storehouse, where the museum's archive has been put on display - including some of pop star David Bowie's costumes and instruments.Bowie had strong associations with Berlin, having lived and worked in the city in the 1970s.Earlier in the day, the pair had left Windsor Castle for London - though not before being shown Queen Victoria's winter sleigh, designed by her German-born husband Prince Albert in 1842, and attending a charity reception.They visited Westminster Abbey and laid a wreath at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior, which symbolises those who died serving in World War One, particularly those who were not buried.The final day of his state visit on Friday will see Steinmeier visit the ruins of Coventry Cathedral, bombed by the German air force during World War Two, in a symbolic gesture of reconciliation.This mirrors a visit to Hamburg during the UK state visit to Germany, when King Charles laid a wreath remembering the civilian casualties of wartime Allied bombing raids.He will also receive an honorary degree from Oxford University, on a trip in which he will learn about medical research at the university.",

    "body": "9 hours agoTom Singleton,Technology reporterandLaura Cress,Technology reporterOfcom has told the BBC it has never heard from a porn company it has fined £1m for failing to comply with the UK Online Safety Act.It said it had been emailing AVS Group Ltd since it launched its investigation in July, but had not had a response at any point - so the firm had been fined an extra £50,000.The Act makes it a legal requirement for websites that host pornographic material to put in place what the regulator determines to be \"highly effective age assurance\" to prevent children from being able to easily access explicit content.Ofcom said AVS must now implement highly effective age assurance within 72 hours or face an additional penalty of £1,000 a day.In addition to the AVS fine, Ofcom also announced that one \"major social media company\" was going through compliance remediation with its enforcement team.The regulator has not named the platform but says there may be formal action if it does not see sufficient improvement soon.Ofcom said the fine showed the \"tide on online safety\" was beginning to turn.\"This year has seen important changes for people, with new measures across many sites and apps now better protecting children from harmful content,\" said Oliver Griffiths, Ofcom's online safety group director.\"But we need to see much more from tech companies next year and we'll use our full powers if they fall short,\" he added.Ofcom has already started issuing fines to some companies for not implementing proper age verification, including deepfake \"nudify\" applications. However, online message board 4Chan has so far refused to comply with a £20,000 fine issued by Ofcom over the summer.The Online Safety Act is being implemented in phases, and is intended to prevent past practices which Ofcom described as online platforms being \"unregulated, unaccountable and often unwilling to prioritise people's safety over profits\".Tougher age checks for porn websites were introduced in July, though some people have pointed out these could be easily avoided with a virtual private network (VPN), which reroutes internet traffic.In October, Pornhub's parent company told BBC News it had seen a 77% drop in UK visitors since the age checks had come in. Baroness Beeban Kidron, founder of 5Rights Foundation, told the Today programme the fines were \"nothing\" to tech firms.\"Business disruption is everything,\" she said.\"Unless we're prepared to use the law, they're not really doing what Parliament asked them to do.\"We need a whole different attitude about the level of intensity and robustness from the regulator to say - we've got the law and we're using it.\"The BBC has contacted a company called TubeCorporate, the adult content publishing platform behind AVS group Ltd sites, for a response. The address which the firm uses is in the central American country Belize, and appears to be the registered address of a large number of companies: although they do not have physical offices there.Also introduced this year were tougher guidelines on ensuring the internet was safer for women and girls, with Ofcom vowing to name and shame platforms that did not comply. Critics say the Act needs to be toughened to make the internet safer, particularly for women and girls.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHelen BriggsEnvironment correspondentGettyThe Black Death fundamentally altered medieval societyA volcanic eruption around the year 1345 may have set off a chain reaction that unleashed Europe's deadliest pandemic, the Black Death, scientists say.Clues preserved in tree rings suggest the eruption triggered a climate shock and led to a string of events that brought the disease to medieval Europe. Under this scenario, the ash and gases from a volcanic eruption caused extreme drops in temperature and led to poor harvests.To avert famine, populous Italian city states were forced to import grain from areas around the Black Sea - bringing plague-carrying fleas that carried the disease to Europe as well.This \"perfect storm\" of a climate shock, famine and trade offers a reminder of how diseases can emerge and spread in a globalised and warmer world, according to experts.\"Although the coincidence of factors that contributed to the Black Death seems rare, the probability of zoonotic diseases emerging under climate change and translating into pandemics is likely to increase in a globalised world,\" said Dr Ulf Büntgen of the University of Cambridge.He added: \"This is especially relevant given our recent experiences with Covid-19.\" Credit: Ulf BüntgenTree rings from the Spanish Pyrenees point to unusually cold summers in 1345, 1346 and 1347 The Black Death swept across Europe in 1348-49, killing up to half of the population.The disease was caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis spread by wild rodents, such as rats, and fleas.The outbreak is believed to have started in Central Asia, moving around the world through trade.But the precise sequence of events that brought the disease to Europe - killing millions of people – has been pored over by scholars.Now researchers from the University of Cambridge and the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe (GWZO) in Leipzig have filled in a missing part of the puzzle.They used clues from tree rings and ice cores to examine climatic conditions at the time of the Black Death.Their evidence suggests that volcanic activity around 1345 caused temperatures to drop sharply over consecutive years because of the release of volcanic ash and gases which blocked out some sunlight.This in turn caused crops to fail across the Mediterranean region. To avoid starvation, Italian city states traded with grain producers around the Black Sea, unwittingly enabling the deadly bacterium to gain a foothold in Europe.GettyFleas spread the plague from infected rats to humansDr Martin Bauch, a historian of medieval climate and epidemiology from GWZO, said climatic events met a \"complicated system of food security\" in what amounted to a \"perfect storm\".\"For more than a century, these powerful Italian city states had established long-distance trade routes across the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, allowing them to activate a highly efficient system to prevent starvation,\" he said. \"But ultimately, these would inadvertently lead to a far bigger catastrophe.\"The findings are reported in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",

Her behaviour was becoming more and more unacceptable.\"The hearing was shown CCTV from the rugby club showing PC Pritchard \"twerking\" on the dance floor in a series of suggestive dance moves.A female police officer, identified to the hearing only as \"Police Constable A,\" said: \"PC Pritchard came up from behind me, put both her arms around my neck, then put them under my armpits and grabbed my breasts and squeezed them.\"PC Pritchard apologised to PC A when giving evidence to the hearing earlier this week.She said: \"My behaviour that evening was inappropriate I've never acted like that before.\"I'm absolutely mortified at what's happened - I don't recognise the person I see on that CCTV - all I can do is apologise.\"She broke down in tears as she said: \"I feel I've let down the police, I've let down myself and I've let down my family.\"She said she has had \"panic and nightmares\" and felt \"people thought I was a sexual predator\".The panel chair, Assistant Chief Constable Chris Allsop, said on Thursday that \"all the allegations against PC Pritchard have been found proven\".\"Overall, the panel finds that the breaches of standards are of medium to high seriousness which could justify dismissal as gross misconduct,\" he said. Barrister Fiona Clancy, representing PC Pritchard, had argued she should be allowed to keep her job in the police.\"She accepts her behaviour was unacceptable.  This was a short-lived episode, of brief duration, and there is no risk of it happening again.\"PC Pritchard has been doing voluntary work while she has been waiting for this hearing, and has kept her fitness levels up – there is a genuine motivation to keep serving the community.\"North Wales Police's Deputy Chief Constable Nigel Harrison said PC Pritchard's behaviour \"fell far below the standard we expect of our police officers\".  \"There is no issue with officers when off duty relaxing and enjoying themselves but her behaviour that night was simply not acceptable by anyone's standards,\" he said.  \"She has rightly been dismissed, bringing to an end her very short career with us and preventing her from serving with any other UK force.\"More top stories",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterGetty ImagesThe government will commit to bringing in enhanced protections against unfair dismissal from the start of 2027, after watering down its plans last week.Labour ministers agreed to introduce the right to make a claim after six months in a job instead of on day one, after a backlash from business groups.This new qualifying period would still be shorter than the current two years.At the time of last week's climbdown, the business department did not specify when the amended six-month right would come into force. However, ministers are now expected to make a commitment to implement the new protection from 1 January 2027, when the legislation to deliver the change returns to the House of Commons on Monday.Such assurances, made from the dispatch box, are not legally binding but are seen as carrying additional political weight by MPs and peers. The move, which was first reported by The Guardian, followed talks this week between ministers and former deputy PM Angela Rayner and ex-employment minister Justin Madders, two key architects of the original proposals.Following the talks, Rayner agreed to withdraw an amendment she had planned to table, which would have made the start date 2026.Writing on social media, Rayner appeared to welcome the government's decision, saying a January 2027 start date would introduce protection for those hired after July 2026, bringing \"real change for workers\".Probation period shelvedCurrently, after two continuous years in a job workers gain additional legal protections against so-called \"ordinary\" unfair dismissal.It means employers must identify a fair reason for dismissal - such as conduct or capability - and show that they acted reasonably and followed a fair process.Until last week, Labour was planning to scrap this qualifying period completely at an unspecified point during 2027, with a new legal probation period, likely to have been nine months, introduced as a safeguard for companies.But following talks with unions and business groups last week, the qualifying period will instead be set at six months' service, and the legal probation period shelved.The U-turn has been widely welcomed by business groups, which had warned the original proposals would discourage companies from hiring.It has been condemned by some MPs on the left of the Labour Party, as well as the Unite union, a major donor through the affiliation fees its members pay to the party.The government still plans to bring in new day-one rights to sick pay and paternity leave rights from April 2026.Compensation capSeparately, the government is also expected to abolish the current limits on compensation for financial loss in ordinary unfair dismissal cases.Currently, awards to former employees who successfully bring a claim are limited to either their annual salary or £118,223, whichever is lower.But the government plans to amend its employment rights bill to abolish both these caps, as the bill goes through its final stages in Parliament.This would bring the process more into line with \"automatic\" unfair dismissal cases - where workers have been sacked for reasons such as discrimination and  whistleblowing - where financial loss awards are uncapped.Abolishing the caps did not feature in the original version of the bill unveiled in October last year, or in Labour's general election manifesto. But ministers committed to do so last week during talks to reach an agreed route forward between some unions and industry groups. ",

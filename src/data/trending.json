Little me would be going crazy right now.\"It showed me I'm on the right track.\"Speaking to DAZN, two-weight undisputed champion Taylor described Tiah-Mai as \"a seasoned pro\" after watching her defeat France's Lydie Bialic in September.\"I can't believe she's just turned 19. This is scary,\" said Taylor at the time.\"I don't think we've seen a talent like this in a long time.\"Being hyped up as \"the future\" by one of her heroes fuelled Tiah-Mai's desire to make Taylor's prediction come true.Tiah-Mai Ayton from Bristol won a world title in her fifth fight after turning professionalAs a child, the Bristol-born boxer's dad encouraged her and her sister to turn sibling squabbles into training in the ring.While fighting remained a hobby for her sister, it became Tiah-Mai's career.Her potential to turn professional was clear to those who watched her excel as a five-time national champion at youth level.As she racked up titles as a teenager, Team GB had Tiah-Mai on its radar as a future Olympian.\"I knew from a young age that I was going to be a professional boxer,\" she says.\"I didn't think about anything else.\"If I didn't have it, I would be so lost.\"'Better under pressure'Tiah-Mai dreams of following Taylor to the top and hopes doing so sparks the next generation of female fighters.\"I want to inspire them,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"Women's boxing is getting big but it could get better.\"Hopefully by the time I've finished my career, it'll be easier for women to be treated the same as men in the sport.\"Her similiarities with Katie Taylor go beyond having big reputations.They share a promoter after Tiah-Mai signed with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing.While she aims to be part of a main event in future, the teenager's on the undercard before Kieron Conway's title defence against George Liddard on Friday.She says she fights \"better under pressure\" and is eyeing her first knockout despite admitting she knows little about her opponent.\"No-one has ever stopped her,\" says Tiah-Mai.\"I think if I do stop her, it's going to be a big statement from me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "Shares recover after US banks cause a scare26 minutes agoBen KingBusiness reporterGetty ImagesShares are recovering after a warning of fraud from two US banks triggered a sell-off around the world.Two US regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank, said on Thursday that they had been hit by either bad or fraudulent loans, sparking fears of problems in the banking sector.Some of the UK's biggest banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered, saw their share prices fall more than 5% on Friday morning, before recovering slightly before the end of the day's trading. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares had dropped about 1.5% at one point before regaining some ground before close.The US S&P 500 benchmark was marginally up in early trading after Donald Trump appeared to indicate that high tariffs (export taxes) on China may not be \"sustainable\". On Thursday, Zions Bank said it would write off a $50m loss on two loans, while Western Alliance disclosed it had started a lawsuit alleging fraud.\"Pockets of the US banking sector including regional banks have given the market cause for concern,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\"Investors have started to question why there have been a plethora of issues in a short space of time and whether this points to poor risk management and loose lending standards.\"\"Investors have been spooked,\" he added, saying that while there was no evidence of any issues with UK-listed banks, \"investors often have a knee-jerk reaction when problems appear anywhere in the sector\".Bank shares in Europe were also hit, with Germany's Deutsche Bank ending the day around 6.2% lower, and France's Societe Generale closing 4.8% lower.Asian markets fell earlier on Friday. Japan's Nikkei index closed down 1.4% and in Hong Kong the Hang Seng Index ended the day 2.5% lower.But shares of some of the US banks hit hardest on Thursday appeared poised to claw back some ground.In early morning trade on Friday, shares in Zions Bank were up about 5%, following its 13% fall on Thursday. Shares in Western Alliance Bancorp, which had dropped almost 11%, were also up roughly 3%.In an interview on the Fox Business Network, the director of the White House National Economic Council described the issues as \"messes\" left by the Biden administration, while maintaining that US banks were well positioned to handle the stress.\"Right now, the banking sector has ample reserves,\" Kevin Hassett said. \"We're very optimistic that we can stay way, way, way ahead of the curve on this.\"Investors have been nervous following the failure of two high-profile US firms, car loan company Tricolor and car parts maker First Brands. These failures have raised questions about the quality of deals in what is known as the private credit market - where companies arrange loans from non-bank lenders.This week Jamie Dimon, the boss of the US's largest bank JPMorgan Chase, warned that these two failures could be a sign of more to come. \"My antenna goes up when things like that happen,\" he told analysts. \"I probably shouldn't say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\" There have also been warnings that the surge in artificial intelligence investment has produced a bubble in the US stock market - including from Mr Dimon - leading to fears that shares are overvalued.The market turbulence on Friday saw the price of gold reach a fresh record high of $4,380 per ounce, as investors looked for safe havens for their money. Another closely watched measure of market nerves, the VIX volatility index sometimes called the \"Fear Index\", hit its highest level since April. ",

    "body": "43 minutes agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporter andDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondentGetty ImagesThe proposed new embassy at Royal Mint Court would be the biggest in Europe if it goes aheadChina has warned the UK of \"consequences\" amid an escalating row over its delayed application to build a mega-embassy in London.It comes after the government confirmed it had pushed back a decision on the controversial site for a second time, to 10 December. On Friday, Beijing's foreign affairs ministry said the delay went \"entirely against the UK's commitments and previous remarks about improving China-UK relations\".Downing Street said it did not \"recognise any claims of commitments or assurances\". Beijing's application for the embassy was initially rejected by Tower Hamlets Council in 2022 over safety and security concerns.However, it was taken over by the UK government housing department last year, after China resubmitted an application one month after Labour came to power.Asked about the latest delay on Friday, Beijing's ministry of foreign affairs accused the UK of \"constantly complicating and politicizing the matter\".Spokesman Lin Jian said the UK had \"repeatedly put off the approval of the project citing various excuses and linked the project with other issues\".\"That goes entirely against the UK's commitments and previous remarks about improving China-UK relations,\" he added.\"We once again call on the UK to fulfil its obligation and honour its commitments at once, otherwise the consequences arising therefrom shall be borne by the UK side\".Downing Street hit back at Mr Jian's comments, saying: \"We do not recognise any claims of assurances, and I can't explain the statement they've set out.\"The PM's official spokesman added: \"Protecting the UK's national security is our first duty.\"In terms of the planning process, as set out yesterday, this is a decision that is independent of the rest of government.\"He added it would not be \"appropriate for me to comment further\" on a decision being made by the housing department. China bought the site of the proposed new embassy, at Royal Mint Court near the Tower of London, for £255m in 2018. At 20,000 square metres, the proposed complex would be the biggest embassy in Europe if it goes ahead.The proposed complex would include offices, a large basement area, housing for 200 staff, and a new tunnel to connect the Embassy House to a separate building on the embassy grounds.The pending decision on whether to approve the new embassy has attracted close scrutiny because of concerns about the security implications of the plan, including the location, size and design of the building.There are concerns held by some opponents that the site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into nearby fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.Blanked out plansThe government's first delay was requested by then housing secretary Angela Rayner, after she asked China to explain why some rooms within its planning documents had been blanked out for \"security reasons\".Planning consultants working for the Chinese embassy had replied that China \"does not consider that, as a matter of principle, it is necessary or appropriate to provide full internal layout plans\".Rayner had written back to groups involved in the consultation, including China, the Met police and a local residents' association, to give them more time to respond to the plans and putting the deadline back to 21 October.Steve Reed, who took over the housing role following Rayner's resignation last month, then requested a further delay to 10 December.In the latest correspondence, the housing department said it was unable to set a new deadline for fresh comments until it receives pending responses from the Foreign Office and Home Office.The two departments wrote jointly to Rayner in August to say they were still in discussions with China over consolidating the country's existing diplomatic premises in the capital into the new complex.The departments requested that Rayner should not make a final decision until a \"firm plan is agreed\". Sir Keir Starmer said last year that Chinese President Xi Jinping had raised the embassy issue during their first leaders' phone call in August.Speaking in November, the prime minister told China's leader \"you raised the Chinese embassy building when we spoke on the telephone, and we have since taken action by calling in that application\".\"Now we have to follow the legal process and timeline,\" Sir Keir added.The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have urged the government to throw out China's application.

    "body": "Two men have pleaded not guilty to plotting a series of arson attacks at properties connected to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.Ukrainian nationals Roman Lavrynovych, 21, and Petro Pochynok, 35, were accused of targeting two properties and a car linked to the PM, along with Ukrainian-born Romanian national Stanislav Carpiuc, 27.The men appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from HMP Belmarsh in south-east London on Friday.The charges relate to three incidents: a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street, and a fire at an address where he previously lived in north-west London.Mr Lavrynovych, of Sydenham, and Mr Pochynok, of north London, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life.The charge alleged that the men \"together with others\" conspired to damage by fire property \"belonging to another and intending to endanger the life of another or being reckless as to the life of another would thereby be endangered\".Mr Carpiuc, of Romford, was not asked to enter his plea for the same charge.The prosecution indicated that the case was not being treated as having a terrorist connection.Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said the circumstances of the alleged offences were \"somewhat opaque\".\"Plainly they are co-ordinated and must have some motive or purpose behind them,\" she told the court.The three men were assisted by interpreters during Friday's court hearing.They were remanded in custody, with the next hearing scheduled for 28 November. A provisional trial date has already been set for 27 April 2026.On 8 May, a car previously owned by the prime minister was found on fire on a street he previously lived on in Kentish Town, north London.Three days later, a fire was discovered at flats linked to the PM in nearby Islington. Firefighters rescued one person with the help of breathing apparatus.On 12 May, a fire was discovered at the entrance to Sir Keir's Kentish Town home, which was being rented out.",

    "body": "Husband guilty in murder case without a body that shocked France2 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondentLIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFPDefence lawyers said Cédric Jubillar had just found out his wife had begun an affair when she disappearedA murder trial without a body which transfixed France has ended with 38-year-old painter-decorator Cédric Jubillar convicted of killing his wife.Throughout the four-week trial, Jubillar maintained his innocence but was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to 30 years in jail.In four weeks of hearings in the southern town of Albi, the defence argued that because the body of his wife Delphine had never been found there was no certainty a crime had been committed.But the jury of six civilians and three magistrates decided that there was enough circumstantial evidence to conclude that Jubillar was guilty of murder.Jubillar's lawyers have said they will appeal.\"We respect the jury's decision,\" said defence lawyer Alexandre Martin. \"Of course we're disappointed, but we knew there would be a second battle, and we will get back to work on this appeal.\"Delphine was killed by her husband's hands,\" said Laurent Boguet, acting for the couple's two children. It was now for Jubillar to \"tell us where his wife's remains are and return them to the family\".LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFPJubillar's lawyers Alexandre Martin (L) and Emmanuelle Franck were shocked by the verdictWith its central mystery of his wife's missing body, the case has been hotly followed across news and social media since it broke five years ago. Amateur detectives proliferated online, much to the annoyance of police and families, with theories of what happened.It was on the night of 15-16 December 2020, in the middle of the Covid pandemic, that 33-year-old Delphine Jubillar disappeared from the house in Cagnac-les-Mines where the couple lived with their two children aged six and 18 months.Cédric Jubillar contacted police at around 04:00 on 16 December to say he had been woken up by the crying of the younger child and discovered that his wife had gone missing.Police and neighbours conducted extensive searches in the local area – including in its many abandoned mines – but no body was ever found.The court heard during the trial how Cédric and Delphine's relationship had turned sour. She had asked for a divorce, and was beginning an affair with a man she met over a chatline.According to the prosecution, on the evening of her disappearance she had told Cédric Jubillar for the first time that she had taken a lover. This led to a row – during which Delphine's screams were heard by a neighbour – and then he killed her, probably by strangling.Jubillar was then said to have disposed of her body somewhere in the countryside nearby, which he knew well.  CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFPA poster of Delphine Jubillar posted on a wall some time after her deathA key piece of evidence was that Delphine's car on the street outside was facing in the opposite direction from the way she normally parked it, suggesting he had used it on the night.Other key elements were:a broken pair of Delphine's glasses in the sitting-roomthe lack of steps recorded on Jubillar's phone pedometer, even though he claimed to have been out searching for his wifeand a statement by their son Louis about an argument between his parents taking place \"between the sofa and the Christmas tree\".France transfixed by murder trial without a bodyPsychological assessments presented Jubillar as a feckless character with a rough childhood, who smoked marijuana every day, had difficulty holding down a job and thought of little but his personal gratification.He was said to have shown little concern over the disappearance of Delphine – drawing money from her bank account a short time later, for example.And there was crucial evidence from Cédric Jubillar's mother, who recalled him telling her when he first heard that Delphine wanted a divorce: \"I've had enough. I'm going to kill her and bury her, and they'll never find her.\"Jubillar's defence lawyer Emmanuelle Franck said none of this amounted to more than speculation – and that the accused's habits and attitudes could not be taken as signs of criminal responsibility.\"Courts do not convict bad characters. They convict the guilty,\" she said.According to the defence, there were alternative explanations for all the circumstantial clues. They said witnesses had been coached by investigators, in order to corroborate the theory of guilt.They argued that in any normal crime of passion, there were tell-tale signs left at the scene – blood, or evidence of a clean-up. But all this was absent from the Jubillar home.His lawyers said that details told in court of Cédric Jubillar's behaviour were all irrelevant: his use of pornography, a pair of panda pyjamas with ears and tail that he was wearing when police came, and making his son Louis sit on Lego bricks as a punishment.\"Either [Cédric] is a criminal genius, or he is a bit of an idiot – you have got to decide,\" said Emmanuelle Franck.The defence offered no alternative explanation for Delphine's disappearance.Convictions for murder without a body are rare because of the difficulty of proving the existence of a crime. But they do happen, with jurisdictions in many countries concluding that circumstantial evidence alone can constitute proof.For a guilty verdict in France, jurors need to have an \"intimate conviction\" that a crime has been committed – a concept that is left vague in law. If more than two of the nine jurors dissent, then the accused is found not guilty.",

    "body": "Laurence Fox's libel claim after he was called a racist on social media should be reconsidered at a retrial, the Court of Appeal has ruled. The actor-turned-politician's libel counter-claim was originally dismissed during a civil case last year in which he was successfully sued and ordered to pay £180,000 for calling former charity trustee Simon Blake and drag artist Crystal \"paedophiles\" in a row on X.Mr Fox had called for a boycott of Sainsbury's over the chain marking Black History Month and was called  \"a racist\" by the pair, as well as by broadcaster Nicola Thorp, before he responded with the \"paedophile\" tweets.The Court of Appeal also rejected his appeal over the \"paedophile\" posts. But the court halved the damages Mr Fox was ordered to pay.In April 2024, High Court judge Mrs Justice Collins Rice ruled in favour of now-Stonewall chief executive Mr Blake and the ex-RuPaul's Drag Race UK contestant Crystal, whose real name is Colin Seymour, and ordered he pay them £90,000 each in damages. The judge dismissed Mr Fox's counter-claims against them and Ms Thorp's tweets accusing him of racism.Mr Fox subsequently challenged this decision at the Court of Appeal, where his lawyers described the decision as \"plainly wrong\". On Friday, Lord Justice Dingemans, Lady Justice Elisabeth Laing and Lord Justice Warby ruled in Mr Fox's favour on his counter-claims and level of damages. Lord Justice Warby said the tweets describing Mr Fox as a racist caused serious harm to his reputation and his libel claim should be reconsidered at a retrial. He also reduced the amount of damages Mr Fox was ordered to pay to Mr Blake and Mr Seymour to £45,000, with Lord Justice Dingemans describing the previous sums as \"manifestly excessive\".Lord Justice Warby said: \"Having reflected on the arguments and revisited the written materials presented to us I have however concluded that the judge's approach was in some respects wrong in law in ways that are material to the outcome.\"However the Court of Appeal dismissed Mr Fox's bid to overturn the finding that he had libelled Mr Blake and Mr Seymour.After the hearing on Friday, Mr Fox, who is leader of the Reclaim Party, said he believed his case \"is a fight worth fighting\". \"We don't want to live in a country where conversations and careers are destroyed and shut down by that most appalling of slurs,\" he said. \"I hope now, in fact I know now, that people will think twice before making that horrible allegation again.\"I was cancelled entirely from the job I love, and I still love and I hope to do again, overnight, so I am so grateful for this outcome and I hope it plays a part in putting free speech exactly back where it belongs, at the cornerstone of any free society.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, Jerusalem andJacob EvansBBC World Service, JerusalemA 10-year-old Palestinian boy has been killed by Israeli forces in a village south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank.The Israeli military says its soldiers opened fire on Thursday in response to \"confrontations and rock-hurling\" directed at them.Residents of al-Rihiya say that Muhammad al-Hallaq and his friends had been playing football in a local schoolyard when they saw Israeli military vehicles and began to run.\"It's normal, they were afraid and ran back towards the village,\" the parent of another boy who was a witness told the BBC.  \"There was no threat, no provocation.  Nothing.\"The parent says that a soldier \"opened fire erratically\" from the back of a car.  Muhammad was shot in the pelvis and rushed by car to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.Footage shared on social media shows a large crowd gathered around an ambulance as the body of Muhammad was driven back to his village in the dark.  His parents kissed his face as he lay on a stretcher.Later Muhammad's body was carried off for burial.In a video on Palestinian Maan news agency, his mother said that he had spent the day at school and had been showing off his new backpack before going out.\"He loved birds, and he told me he wanted to be a heart doctor, he used to say this all the time,\" she said tearfully, adding that he always got 'excellent' in his school grades.The Israeli army said: \"IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers responded with fire toward the suspects in the rock-hurling. Hits were identified.  No IDF injuries were reported, and the incident is under review.\"Israel's Kan news website said that a preliminary investigation by the IDF battalion commander criticised the soldiers' conduct.  According to its report, the commander found \"the shooting deviated from the rules of engagement, and there was improper use of weaponry, with an emphasis on crowd-control measures.\"\"This is the second incident in the company in which shooting was carried out not in accordance with the rules of engagement,\" the commander is quoted as saying.The BBC asked the IDF about the Kan report, but it declined to comment.Separately the army said on Thursday that it had killed a man in Qabatiya near Jenin in the north of the West Bank, saying he had thrown an explosive device at Israeli troops who were not hurt.The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, identified the man as Mahdi Kmeil who was 20 and said that he had been shot dead during an Israeli military raid.According to figures from the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA), some 200 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the year, including about 40 children.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterThe BBC has confirmed it will go ahead with broadcasting the latest series of Celebrity MasterChef, featuring sacked co-presenter John Torode.Torode was sacked in the summer after an allegation against him using \"an extremely offensive racist term\" was upheld. He has said he has \"no recollection\" of it.In a statement on Friday, the BBC said it had not been a \"straightforward decision\" but that all of the celebrities, contestants and guests involved had confirmed they were happy for the shows to be aired.Two Christmas specials will also be aired, the corporation confirmed on Friday.The latest series of Celebrity MasterChef was recorded earlier this year.It was fronted by Torode and food critic Grace Dent, who stepped in after BBC News first revealed separate allegations against former host Gregg Wallace.Wallace has said he was \"deeply sorry for any distress\" he caused but that \"none of the serious allegations against me were upheld\" by a report conducted by production company Banijay.The same report also upheld a claim against Torode of using a severely offensive racist term.Both presenters were sacked in July.The BBC decided to go ahead and still show this year's amateur series of MasterChef, with both Wallace and Torode in it, for the sake of the chefs who had taken part in it.The corporation has now confirmed that Celebrity MasterChef, featuring 15 stars, will also be aired from this autumn.Those taking part include rugby star Alun Wyn Jones, TV personality Chris Hughes, author and broadcaster Dawn O'Porter, gladiator Jodie Ounsley, and pop star Michelle Heaton.\"Banijay UK has consulted the celebrities, contestants and guests featured and all have confirmed that they are happy for the shows to be aired,\" a BBC spokesperson said.\"As we have said previously, these are not straightforward decisions.

    "body": "4 hours agoCounter Terrorism Policing North EastBrogan Stewart, Christopher Ringrose and Marco Pitzettu were intent on carrying out a violent attack, counter-terror police saidThree Nazi-worshipping extremists convicted of terror offences have been jailed.Christopher Ringrose, 34, Marco Pitzettu, 25, and Brogan Stewart, 25, were found guilty in May of planning terrorist attacks on mosques and synagogues.Stewart, from West Yorkshire, was jailed for 11 years, Ringrose, from Staffordshire, was jailed for 10 years, and Pitzettu, from Derbyshire, will serve eight years.Sentencing them at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday, Mrs Justice Cutts said she believed they all continued to adhere to their extreme right-wing ideology.The judge outlined how the online group the trio belonged to was preparing for an attack on an Islamic education centre in Leeds before they were arrested by counter-terror police.During their trial it emerged the men, who are not believed to have met in the real world before appearing in court, were preparing to use more than 200 weapons they had amassed, including machetes, swords, crossbows and an illegal stun gun.Ringrose had also 3D-printed most of the components of a semi-automatic firearm.Prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford KC said the three defendants were \"followers of an extreme right-wing Nazi ideology\" and styled themselves as an armed military group.Watch: Mrs Justice Cutts sentences three Nazi-worshipping extremistsMr Sandiford said by 2024 they were seeking further recruits and hoping to acquire more deadly weapons.He said by January and February they were planning their first attack and had identified a target in Leeds, harbouring an \"intention to commit acts of extremism which involved killing multiple victims\".The three men were arrested when security services believed an attack was imminent after undercover officers infiltrated their online group.A jury had rejected arguments the defendants were fantasists with no intention of carrying out their threats and found all three guilty of a charge of preparing acts of terrorism and charges of collecting information likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.Ringrose was also convicted of manufacturing a prohibited weapon.Counter Terrorism Policing North EastThe trio had amassed a cache of weapons as part of their planningCounter-terror police said the self-styled \"militant\" online group provided an \"echo chamber of extreme right-wing views where they shared horrific racial slurs, glorified mass murderers and encouraged violence against anyone deemed an enemy\".Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley said they were a group who \"espoused vile racist views and advocated for violence, all to support their extreme right-wing mindset\".\"Some of their defence in court was that it was all fantasy or just part of harmless chat, however all three took real-world steps to plan and prepare for carrying out an attack on innocent citizens.\"He said it had been a complex case involving multiple police forces.Bethan David, head of the Crown Prosecution Service's Counter Terrorism Division, said the men plotted \"violent acts of terrorism\".\"By their own admission, they were inspired by SS tactics and supremacist ideology.\"The prosecution case against the defendants included their disturbing Telegram and Facebook chats as well as acquiring military equipment such as riot shields, body armour and an arsenal of weapons found at their home addresses that were to be used in readiness for a 'race war'.\"In her sentencing, Mrs Justice Cutts said she believed the defendants would be dangerous on their release from jail and gave all three extended sentences, with additional licence periods of eight years for Stewart and five years each for Ringrose and Pitzettu.She said the trio's ideology was \"laid bare\" in a 374-page dossier of internet activity put before the jury.\"These pages were filled with hate towards black and other non-white races, especially Muslim people and immigrants, with ideas of white supremacy and racial purity together with a belief that there must soon be a race war.\"This was coupled, she said, with the \"glorification and admiration of the policies and actions of Hitler and the German Nazi Party, including antisemitism, and of mass killers who had targeted black or Muslim communities\".Counter Terrorism Policing North EastWeapons were found after searches of the men's homesThe nine-week-long trial heard how the defendants formed an online group called Einsatz 14 in January 2024, with \"like-minded extremists\" who wanted to \"go to war for their chosen cause\".The jury was shown a short video Stewart posted of himself wearing a German army helmet, a Nazi armband and a skull face covering.Prosecutors explained how Stewart discussed torturing a Muslim leader using his \"information extraction kit\" with an undercover officer.Stewart called himself \"Fuhrer\" of the Einsatz 14 group and appointed an undercover officer called Blackheart as the \"Obergruppenfuhrer\", which the other two defendants also joined.Potential recruits were sent a vetting form and Stewart also developed a mission statement for the group which said its \"basic duties\" included to \"target mosques, Islamic education centres and other similar locations\".And he sent Blackheart details of the Islamic education centre on Mexborough Road in Leeds, including a Google Maps image.The officer asked Stewart for more detailed information about the plan and he replied that they could smash windows or ambush someone, the court heard.All three men will be subject to a Serious Crime Prevention Order for five years on release and to Terrorism Notification Requirements for 30 years.Additional reporting by PA MediaMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Just nowEsme StallardClimate and science reporter, BBC NewsA landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions has been abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the US succeeded in ending the talks.More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.But President Trump had called the plan a \"green scam\" and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they had voted in favour.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a \"huge win\" for Trump.But reflecting the pressure countries faced, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation Arsenio Dominguez issued a \"plea\" for this not to be repeated.In a dramatic conclusion on Friday, when countries should have been voting to approve the deal, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year.The chairman said this would mean that the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have to be revised.The motion passed by just a handful of votes. Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia's motion was \"unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change\".\"We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,\" he said.The shipping industry has been broadly supportive of the deal because it offered consistent global standards. Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, said : \"We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.\"\"Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments,\" he added.The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, but some countries including Greece went against the EU bloc and voted to abstain.The countries that voted in favour of adjourning the talks included Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, who raised concerns that the deal would lead to price rises for consumers.Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings. Island states Bahamas, and Antigua and Barbuda also changed their position. A delegate Vanuatu told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position. The deal was first agreed in April after ten years of negotiations and was considered historic as it meant shipping was set to become the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.The agreement had meant that from 2028 ship owners would have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea. Unlike other sectors shipping has been unable to reduce its emissions, in part due to the lack of cost incentive.\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment, told the BBC during the last IMO negotiations.This means without intervention the International Maritime Organisation previously estimated that by 2050 emissions could grow by between 10% and 150%.The meeting this week in London between nations had been to make the final approval and finalise the next steps. But since April the US has been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan which they are concerned could raise prices for goods for its consumers.Posting on Truth Social on Thursday night President Trump wrote: \"The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers.\"With talks now delayed the carefully planned timeline to get the regulations in place for 2028 does not appear feasible. When they reconvene in April countries will therefore not be voting to approve but will have to re-negotiate the deal.",

    "body": "Baek Se-hee, the South Korean author of the bestselling memoir I Want to Die but I Want To Eat Tteokbokki has died at the age of 35.Her 2018 book, a compilation of conversations with her psychiatrist about her depression, was a cultural phenomenon with its themes of mental health resonating with readers across the world.Originally written in Korean, it found international acclaim after its English translation was published in 2022.The details surrounding her death are unclear.Baek donated her organs - her heart, lungs, liver and kidneys - which have helped to save five lives, the Korean Organ Donation Agency said in a statement on Friday.The statement also included comments from her sister, which said that Baek had wanted to \"share her heart with others through her work, and to inspire hope\".I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, published in 2018, has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated in 25 countries.The runaway bestseller was celebrated for normalising mental health conversations and its nuanced take on inner struggles - most notably, the author's personal conflict between depressive thoughts and her appreciation for simple joys.\"The human heart, even when it wants to die, quite often wants at the same time to eat some tteokbokki, too,\" goes the book's most famous line. Tteokbokki, which are tubular chewy rice cakes usually eaten with a spicy sauce or stew, is a popular snack in Korean cuisine.Born in 1990, Baek Se-hee took creative writing in university and worked for five years at a publishing house, according to her short biography on Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced the English version of her 2018 memoir.Anton Hur, who had translated Baek's book into English, wrote on Instagram that her organs have saved five people but \"her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing\".\"My thoughts are with her family,\" he wrote.For a decade she received treatment for dysthymia, a mild but long-lasting type of depression, which formed the basis of her bestseller, said her Bloomsbury bio.A sequel, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in Korean in 2019. Its English translation was published in 2024.Tributes have poured in on social media. \"Rest softly,\" reads a comment on Baek's Instagram page. \"Thank you for saving us with your honesty.\"Another Instagram user said each time they read Baek's memoir they found \"deep comfort in every sentence and grew alongside it\". \"To create a single book that can lift people up... is no easy task, and I have indescribable respect for you for achieving that,\" they wrote.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge1 day agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"Back in Columbia University, those years ago, the student from Pakistan had asked me a question. \"Don't you find it interesting,\" he said, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Murder and MI5: How an extraordinary battle erupted over what the state keeps secret4 hours agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent BBCPaul Thompson was shot dead while being driven home in a taxi through Belfast in April 1994. He was murdered in a sectarian attack by loyalist paramilitaries who had set out to kill Catholics.The taxi driver was a friend who was collecting a fare at another address in the Springfield Park area in the west of the city. But no one at the address had rung the taxi firm. The call is suspected to have been a deliberate decoy by the killers who wanted to lure a taxi as prey. Paul was not specifically targeted. They could not have known he would ask for a lift or be in the area.One resident described hearing a heavy burst of gunfire after 23:00, running to the car and finding Paul.Members of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for the killing. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the group repeatedly murdered Catholic civilians like Paul.Family Handout/PA WireMembers of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for killing Paul, who was nicknamed TopperOn the morning of the day that Paul was killed, locals had told police about a hole in a barrier – known as the 'Peace Line' – which separated the largely Catholic Springfield Park area from a largely Protestant neighbouring area. The residents were concerned the breach could give loyalist paramilitaries access to launch an attack.The hole was not fixed. After the murder, those responsible escaped through it.An inquest into Paul's death was opened in 1995 but never concluded. No-one has ever been held to account. There has never been a full investigation.Left by themselves to fight for answers, his mother Margaret and brother Eugene, both now dead, came to suspect collusion between British security forces and informants – meaning state agents - in the group responsible.In 2024, a coroner decided to release to the family a summary of secret information held by the police. This was said by the coroner to be of central relevance to the case and the police supported the move. But the British government and MI5 argued this would prejudice national security and mounted a legal challenge.PA MediaPaul Thompson was killed by the UDA, which used the cover name of the Ulster Freedom FightersThe case, which centred on who had the power to decide to release the information, reached the Supreme Court last summer, with Paul Thompson's brother, Eugene, tuning in to hearings from a hospice, as he neared death from cancer.The case is widely viewed as a major test of the state's policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) information involving national security.Who decides what is secret?The NCND policy is a position adopted by the government and security services when responding to questions about sensitive matters. It means there will be no confirmation, no denial, and no acknowledgement that the information requested is true, false, or even exists.Eugene Thompson's barrister, Monye Anyadike-Danes KC, said the family had concluded the murder happened because the authorities were colluding with the \"very group that actually perpetrated the killing\". She said Eugene was \"trying to find out why his younger brother was murdered\" and felt a \"deep responsibility\".PA MediaEugene Thompson, who has since died, spent years trying to find out the truth about his brother's deathEugene, she added, believed the public should be able to trust that those who kill will be held accountable, especially when they are agents of the state. She asked the judges not to let the NCND policy be used to \"conceal the involvement of state parties in the killing of an ordinary citizen\".Just before Christmas, the court ruled that the government's assessment of damage to national security \"should have been accepted by the coroner\" unless it was plainly irrational or there was no supporting evidence.The justices found the coroner had failed to understand it was \"solely\" for the government to make submissions on national security, not the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Jon Boutcher, who had argued for the release of the summary of police files.PA WireJon Boutcher argued for the release of the summary of police filesPaul Thompson's case is part of a battle over the truth and whether it can be told. The battle concerns official secrets, often connected to state agents, and it pits bereaved families and senior police officers against the government and the security service, MI5.It raises a profound question: can the state, especially when it is implicated in killing, be trusted as the arbiter of what should remain secret?The spycatcher who was himself a spyOther cases in the coming months will force these issues further into the spotlight – and they come at a time when MI5's integrity is under significant scrutiny.Yet the Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case creates a precedent that says the government and MI5 can withhold information from bereaved families, for national security reasons, even when the police want it to be disclosed.Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, described it as a \"grim day for truth\" and part of a pattern of \"national security being used as a shield to cover up and conceal the state's role in very serious crimes such as murder and other serious human rights violations.\"The government, by contrast, welcomed the court's \"unanimous judgment\".\"This is a highly complex case with wide-ranging implications,\" it said. \"The government will therefore take time to fully consider all aspects of this judgment.\"The Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case has created a precedentDuring the Troubles, the state made widespread use of informants, otherwise known as agents, who were tasked with carrying out actions and often paid. Agents existed in the IRA and in loyalist paramilitary groups. They were run by the police, the army, and MI5.The former Met Police chief Lord Stevens, who led UK government-commissioned investigations into collusion in Northern Ireland between the 1980s and 2000s, once said that of 210 people arrested during his enquiries, only three were not state agents.Collusion occurred in a number of ways, he said, ranging from the state withholding intelligence and evidence from investigators, to state agents being involved in murder. In some cases agents told the authorities in advance about planned attacks but nothing was done to stop them.One of the most notorious agents was codenamed Stakeknife. It has been publicly known for more than 20 years that Stakeknife was a man called Freddie Scappaticci. He died under MI5 protection in 2023 having never been charged with any of the many murders and other crimes to which he is linked.Pacemaker Press/ PAFreddie Scappaticci, or Stakeknife, died under MI5 protection in 2023Scappaticci was a senior figure in the IRA's internal security unit, which was tasked by IRA leaders with identifying and killing British agents in the organisation. But, with the spycatcher himself a spy, the result was one British agent killing other agents, or people accused of being agents, and the state repeatedly not intervening to save them.Intelligence agencies and historic wrongdoingA long-running police investigation into Stakeknife, Operation Kenova, was forbidden from officially naming Scappaticci in its final report, published in December, despite the fact that his identity was widely known.The head of the Kenova team, Sir Iain Livingstone, pleaded with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn for the right to name Scappaticci in his report, but Benn said he would decide after the Supreme Court ruling in the Paul Thompson case, which came later in December.That ruling has, in effect, strengthened Benn's power to stop him being named. If permission is granted, a revised version of the Kenova report can be published.Jon Boutcher, who was Livingstone's predecessor leading the Kenova investigation, has described the situation preventing Scappaticci being named as a \"pantomime\". It leads to the truth being \"suppressed,\" he argues, with \"profound and severe adverse impacts on victims and families, legitimate public discussion and debate, media freedom, open justice and public confidence in state agencies and the criminal justice system\".PA WireThe integrity of MI5, which is currently led by Sir Ken McCallum, is under scrutinyBoutcher, the PSNI chief constable, is involved in a significant and extraordinary stand-off with the government and MI5 over NCND.He has called for reform of the policy, a principle he fully supports but believes is being wrongly applied and has become a dogma that can be used to conceal wrongdoing.He has recommended the policy is reviewed to ensure it is applied proportionately and only where genuinely necessary for the protection of life or national security. The government has not yet responded to the call for a review of the policy.Boutcher has directly asked whether NCND's continued application on Stakeknife amounts to it being used as a tool for covering up things that should never have happened.\"I question whether this decision protects agents, or rather does it actually protect the government and intelligence agencies from accountability for historical wrongdoing.\"More from InDepthIn the Paul Thompson case he argued that he, as chief constable, rather than the government, had the right to allow the coroner to release a summary of police files. The high court and court of appeal backed his position before it was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.During the hearings, government barrister Sir James Eadie KC said Boutcher was being \"thoroughly disingenuous\" and that \"politics is being played with national security\". He argued the government is best placed to make assessments on national security, as only it has access to the full range of necessary advice. The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5.The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material.For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is \"unprecedented\" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s.\"If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool,\" he says.Trust, state secrecy and the publicBoutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed?He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case.Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day.In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife.But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife. Scappaticci was engaged in a pretence to help shore up his reputation: publicly fighting a legal case, while hoping – and expecting – he would lose.VCG via Getty ImagesMany families of those killed or injured in the Troubles are still fighting through the courtsHowever, the government feared Scappaticci would win because a judge would assume he was not Stakeknife and force ministers to be honest.Jon Boutcher has now confirmed an extraordinary fact: the judge who heard the case did so after being secretly briefed on the real identity of Stakeknife.That judge, the then Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord Carswell, ultimately allowed the government to maintain NCND, creating the legal precedent on the policy.\"The full facts about this and the government's explanation will never be known while it is able to hide behind the shield of NCND,\" Boutcher has said.There is a second extraordinary fact: the government barrister who did the secret briefing was Philip Sales, who as Lord Sales was one of the Supreme Court justices in the Paul Thompson case. This fact was uncovered by the journalist John Ware.This is an issue because it is Lord Sales' ruling in the Thompson case which has a central bearing over whether Scappaticci can be named and more details revealed about what went on, including Lord Sales' own role.I asked the Supreme Court whether, given Lord Sales' role in the Scappaticci matter, if it was appropriate for him to have heard the Thompson case.In a statement, the court said: \"Great care is taken in the selection of the panels which will hear a case at the UK Supreme Court.\"A Justice will not deal with a case where it is considered there is a conflict of interest and individual Justices are careful to ensure that they have none.\"The cases of Seamus Dillon and Sean BrownTwo further cases that touch on the potential release of information about the role of the state during the Troubles are also before the Supreme Court.Troubles-related inquests were shut down in 2024 with the passing of the Legacy Act, which created a new body called the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to examine relevant cases, including those being investigated by police.The families of four men who were either killed or injured during the Troubles won a further legal victory, when the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled the government has too much veto power over the disclosure of material by the ICRIR.Lady Chief Justice Siobhan Keegan said that the provision in the Act giving the Northern Ireland secretary \"the final say\" on disclosure of sensitive national security information by the ICRIR would risk undermining public confidence in the body.The UK government's appeal will be ruled on by the Supreme Court in the coming months. The lead respondent in the case is Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was killed in 1997.PA WireMartina Dillon's husband Seamus was killed in 1997 by the paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)The paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) claimed responsibility. A coroner had opened an inquest on the basis there was evidence of collusion by state authorities, but the inquest was halted by the Legacy Act. No-one has ever been held accountable.The government has also registered an appeal in another key case.Sean Brown was also murdered in 1997 by members of the LVF. The 61-year-old father-of-six was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports club in County Londonderry. There were investigative failures by police and no-one has been brought to justice.PA MediaSean Brown, a father of six, was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports clubDecades later, a coroner issued a summary of secret material stating that \"a number of the individuals linked through intelligence to the murder were agents of the state.\" Sean's family want a public inquiry, and have won judgments over the past two years at the High Court and Court of Appeal. The government, which was found to have acted unlawfully by refusing a public inquiry, has registered an appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the issue has constitutional significance regarding who should order inquiries.'The state viewed itself as above the law'At its heart, this vast battle over secrecy centres on two core claims by the state: that only the government and MI5 can ultimately be fully trusted on national security, and that their decisions on what information to release are solely about protecting the public.But these claims have been undermined by MI5's actions and omissions in several recent cases, all during the leadership of MI5's current director general, Sir Ken McCallum.A public inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which killed 22 people, concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held about the suicide bomber who carried out the attack. The inquiry chairman only uncovered what MI5 had done through his own persistent investigations during secret evidence sessions.The government has been resisting calls by families bereaved by the Manchester Arena attack for MI5 officers to be fully included in planned new legislation - known as the Hillsborough Law - that's designed to stop cover-ups and enforce truth-telling by public officials.Getty ImagesA public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of key intelligence it heldAnother ongoing case is an example of how MI5's evidence cannot always be taken at face value: MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about having maintained its NCND secrecy policy in relation to an abusive neo-Nazi agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete. But MI5 had in fact told me the man was an agent when attempting to prevent me from investigating him. After MI5 apologised, we then showed that inquiries into what happened by MI5 and the government were deficient and unreliable, with further falsehoods provided to the court. This prompted the most senior judge in England and Wales to dismiss MI5's explanations and led the prime minister to order a new investigation, which will report this year.In the Stakeknife investigation, MI5 disclosed key documents years after enquiries began, aer Scappaticci had died and charging decisions had been made, and at a point when the Legacy Act banned police from investigating further. The new material revealed MI5 had greater and earlier knowledge of Stakeknife than detectives had previously been told, including that MI5 had been involved in tasking him. The lead detective said it was a \"significant failure on the part of MI5\". A review commissioned by MI5 found no deliberate wrongdoing.Cover-ups and failures to disclose information have a long history in Northern Ireland. Lord Stevens, recalling his investigations, has said: \"I was misled deliberately, I was criminally obstructed from doing my job by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and military, whilst MI5 failed to disclose information.\"Judge Pomerance, who was senior counsel on another major investigation, concluded bluntly: \"The state viewed itself as above the law\".The battle of bereaved familiesLast July, days before Eugene Thompson died, Jon Boutcher delivered a letter of apology on behalf of PSNI. He apologised for the police's failure to take action that may have prevented Paul Thompson's murder, and for failures in the investigation, including not properly pursuing suspects.Mark Thompson from Relatives for Justice (no relation of Paul and Eugene Thompson) says the apology was \"important\" but that Eugene was by this stage \"very ill\".Thompson familyJust before he died, Eugene Thompson (right) received an apology for police failings over the murder of his brother Paul (left). Their mother Margaret is also picturedMark had watched the Supreme Court hearings with Eugene on a laptop in his hospice and describes the experience as \"tough\". Eugene was \"praying and hoping that before he died the judgment could be made\", Mark says.Bereaved families caught up in these cases have had to battle for decades, trying to fill voids left by the lack of proper investigations by the state.\"You became an investigator, tracking down witnesses. You became an expert in the law in that field. And you fought your own case tooth and nail.\"Eugene Thompson became an \"accidental lawyer and expert in his own case\", he says, as he campaigned for answers about why his brother Paul was murdered.\"I think if we take anything from the legacy of him, it's the example of never giving up.\"Email: security.investigations@bbc.co.ukSignal: @investigation.56Click here to learn how to use SecureDrop, an anonymous whistleblowing tool that works only in the Tor browser and follow the advice to stay secure.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.  Anti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Laura Cain.

    "body": "10 hours agoThomas MackintoshEPASince 8 January families have been spending the night outside the El Rodeo jail in ZamoraA leading Venezuelan human rights group says at least 80 political prisoners have been released under pressure from the US.Alfredo Romero, head of Foro Penal, said his group was verifying the identities of those freed from prisons across the country on Saturday - and more releases were likely to take place.It is the latest batch of detainees released since the US seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a raid, and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges earlier this month.On Friday Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez said more than 600 prisoners had been freed - but Foro Penal says this figure has been inflated.Romero announced the releases on social media. He also posted an image of Foro Penal colleague Kennedy Tejeda who he said had been held in Tocorón prison, west of the capital caracas since August 2024.In a post on X, Foro Penal lawyer Gonzalo Himiob said the number of releases could rise above 80 \"as we proceed with verification\".Previously, Foro Penal said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped.This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group said.Before this weekend's developments, the group had confirmed the release of just 156 political prisoners since 8 January.Some domestic opposition figures and at least five Spanish nationals are among those confirmed to have been freed so far.Separately, Rodriguez said she was due to have a call on Monday with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, to ask the UN to verify the lists of those released so far.Human rights groups and activists have long accused the government of using detentions to muzzle critics. The Venezuelan government has denied holding political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, when Maduro claimed victory despite opponents and many countries disputing the results.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBBCAlmost all of the papers are leading on a \"Labour civil war\", after Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham was blocked from standing as a candidate for the upcoming parliamentary by-election in Gorton and Denton by the party's ruling body. The i Paper reports the prime minister is facing \"condemnation from within his own party\", with one minister telling the publication that the move has made Sir Keir Starmer look \"cowardly\".\"Labour MPs revolt over blocking of Burnham\" reads the Times, which says the block saw Sir Keir defy calls from senior figures in his own party. According to the paper, Ed Miliband, Angela Rayner and Lucy Powell all advised that Burnham should be allowed to stand in the Gorton and Denton by-election, in part due to a  \"significant risk\" that Labour could lose the constituency to Reform UK. The paper warns that a combination of by-election defeat and the local elections in May could \"prove fatal for Starmer\".Sir Keir is now facing his \"biggest Labour civil war yet\", says the Express.The Telegraph has taken a similar approach, declaring the Labour party in \"open revolt\". The paper says a letter is circulating among backbenchers which claims that the decision amounted to a \"remote stitch-up from a small group of people at the very top of London\".The Daily Mail leads on a reported warning to the PM that his decision to block Burnham's return has only \"hastened his demise\" and make it more likely that he will face a leadership challenge.The Metro quotes Labour MP Karl Turner saying that \"there'll be a lot of bloodletting\" as a result of the decision.The Financial Times reports mounting backlash against Donald Trump, following the killing of a second person in Minneapolis by federal agents. It quotes top Republicans who have publicly condemned the shooting, such as Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, who said the president is \"getting bad advice right now\". Democrats are threatening a second government shutdown in response, while former President Barack Obama has declared the shooting a \"wake-up call to every American\", in what the paper calls a \"rare public intervention\". The Guardian also echoes other headlines of a Labour \"civil war\" in its coverage. Elsewhere, the paper focuses on the continued fallout from the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by an immigration officer in Minneapolis as pressure mounts on Donald Trump's administration to fully investigate the killing.\"Strong Starm tactics\" says the the Daily Mirror, citing \"furious\" Burnham supporters who called the ruling a \"stitch-up\".\"Crash and Burnham\" is the Sun's take. The paper quotes Burnham's reaction on social media, saying he is \"disappointed\" by Labour's move.The Independent says the move to block Burnham has \"laid bare\" the divisions in the Labour party.Inbetweeners actor James Buckley has made £2m making videos for fans, according to the front page of the Star.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "At least 15 people have died after a ferry carrying more than 350 passengers and crew members onboard sank in the waters off Philippines' southern coast.Search crews have rescued 316 people on board the MV Trisha Kerstin 3, but at least 28 people are still missing. The ship, which was both a cargo and passenger ferry, was on its way from the country's southern mainland, Mindanao, to Jolo island further south-west when it issued a distress call at 1:50 local time Monday (17:50 GMT Sunday).Authorities say they are investigating the cause of the sinking. The Philippines -  an archipelago nation of 7,100 islands - has a long history of maritime disasters involving inter-island ferries.\"Based on the account of some survivors, the waters in the area were rough at the time,\" Philippine Coast Guard spokeswoman Noemie Cayabyab said in a televised interview, according to an AFP report. A Facebook video by Basilan Governor Mujiv Hataman showed survivors wrapped in blankets as they disembarked from a rescue boat.Rescuers have been overwhelmed by the influx of survivors, Basilan emergency responder Ronalyn Perez told AFP.\"The challenge really is the number of patients that are coming in. We are short-staffed at the moment,\" Perez said.Poor maintenance and overloading have been blamed for past ferry accidents in the Philippines. Despite this, many Filipinos still travel by ferry due to its low costs. In May 2023, 28 people died after a passenger ferry caught fire. The fatalities included three children, among them a six-month-old baby.The year before that, at least seven people died after a fire in a high-speed ferry carrying 134 people.",

    "body": "Make sure pupils don't ever use phones at school, Phillipson tells teachers5 hours agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterPA MediaAll schools in England should follow new government guidance and be phone-free for the entire school day, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said.In a letter to schools seen exclusively by the BBC, she said it was \"not appropriate for phones to be used as calculators, or for research during lessons\", as well as during break times and lunchtime.Ofsted will be inspecting schools on the implementation of their mobile phone policies going forward, she confirmed, with teachers also being advised not to use their phones in front of pupils.One head teachers' union said using Ofsted to \"police\" schools' mobile phone policies was \"deeply unhelpful and misguided\".Schools were first given guidance on phones by the previous Conservative government in February 2024, but Phillipson said in her letter that it \"did not deliver the clarity or consistency that schools need\".She said the government had therefore \"strengthened\" the guidance issued last week, to make it \"explicit\" that pupils should not be using their phones at school.Phillipson's letter to schools comes just under a week after the announcement that the government would be launching a three-month consultation on banning social media for all under-16s in the UK.The education secretary has encouraged teachers to \"contribute your professional insight\".Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservatives, has already said her party would introduce such a ban if it was in power.Last week's announcement also included tougher guidance for schools from Ofsted, including telling staff not to use their devices for personal reasons in front of pupils.Recent research by the survey tool Teacher Tapp suggested 86% of primary school teachers said they were able to use their phones at school for personal use, but only during breaks, while 44% of secondary school teachers said they were allowed to use their phones freely.Only 2% of both primary and secondary teachers surveyed said their schools banned staff from using phones entirely during the school day.Teaching unions have generally welcomed the social media consultation, but pushed back on the suggestion of Ofsted monitoring schools' mobile phone policies.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said school leaders \"need support from government, not the threat of heavy-handed inspection\".The Association of School and College Leaders also said the government had been \"sluggish\" in responding to the online risks posed to children.Although the government consultation on social media concerns the whole of the UK, its guidance for schools on phones only includes England, as education is a devolved policy area.The Senedd said last year that phones should not be banned \"outright\" from schools in Wales, but that schools themselves should be supported to set and implement their own policies.In Northern Ireland, Education Minister Paul Givan previously advised schools to restrict pupils in their use of mobile phones, and has recently supported a campaign encouraging parents not to buy their children smartphones until they reach 14 years old.And in Scotland, schools have been given government guidance on setting their own rules, such as pupils having to hand in phones before lessons, or not being allowed to use them on school trips.",

    "body": "6 hours agoImogen JamesEPAHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood will pledge to cut \"unnecessary admin\"Police officers in England and Wales would spend more time on the streets under sweeping reform plans to be outlined on Monday. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will pledge to cut \"red tape\" and \"unnecessary admin\" that she says prevents officers from leaving their stations.She will also promise faster response times for emergencies by setting a national standard for 999 calls.Mahmood said: \"People are reporting crimes and then waiting hours or even days for a response.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said \"it's hard to take Labour's promises seriously when they have stripped more than 1,300 officers from the front line in our communities\". Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson said the government \"must deliver\" on its promises and \"get more officers back onto our streets\".The reform plans would see police forces required to respond to emergencies in urban areas within 15 minutes, and within 20 minutes in rural areas.Most forces already have response targets, but the Home Office said there was currently no way of holding them accountable if they do not meet that standard.Failure to reach targets would see the home secretary sending in experts from high performing forces to help improve response times.John Hayward-Cripps, chief executive of Neighbourhood Watch, said the new targets would be a \"welcome step forward\" towards the \"basic expectation that police will respond when you report a crime\". Mahmood will also say she wants to change how staffing levels are funded amid concern the current 'officer maintenance grant' encourages some forces to employ uniformed officers in administrative roles such as IT or human resources.The targets are part of the government's plans for sweeping changes to policing in England and Wales. Many of the changes have already been announced by the government in the run-up to Monday's announcements. These include: A new National Police Service to free up local forces in tackling everyday crime. The new service will take over responsibility for counter-terror, fraud and organised crime investigationsPlans for every police officer in England and Wales to hold a licence to be able to continue working. They will have to prove they have the right skills in issues such as tackling violence against women and girls or face being removed from their jobThe number of police forces will also be reduced, cutting them from the current 43. No official figure has been given for what will remain, but police chiefs have been calling for the creation of 12 \"mega forces\".More from the BBC",

    "body": "6 hours agoEPACrowds gathered in Minneapolis despite the freezing temperaturesThe National Rifle Association (NRA) has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a \"full investigation\" by the Trump administration into the killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota.Comments from the NRA come after a border agent fatally shot Pretti - registered nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital - in Minneapolis on Saturday.State and federal officials have given starkly different accounts. The Trump administration has said Pretti carried a gun and posed a danger to officers - while no available video shows Pretti holding a gun.The NRA labelled a suggestion by a federal prosecutor that people who carry guns risk being lawfully shot by officers as \"dangerous and wrong\".\"Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens,\" the NRA said in a statement.The NRA - which is typically aligned with Donald Trump - was reacting to comments from First Assistant US Attorney for the Central District of California on Saturday night.Bill Essayli wrote on social media: \"If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you. Don't do it!\"In a separate social-media post, the NRA said: \"As there is with any officer-involved shooting, there will be a robust and comprehensive investigation that takes place to determine if the use of force was justified. \"As we await these facts and gain a clearer understanding, we urge the political voices to lower the temperature to ensure their constituents and law enforcement officers stay safe.\"What we know about fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in MinneapolisProtests and anger after man shot dead by immigration agents in MinneapolisWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?Essayli's comments have drawn criticism from other gun advocacy groups, as well as politicians from across the spectrum.Gun Owners of America said in a statement: \"The Second Amendment protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting - a right the federal government must not infringe upon.\"Republican Thomas Massie said: \"Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government.\"In a follow-up social media post, Essayli accused critics of taking his comments out of context.\"I never said it's legally justified to shoot law-abiding concealed carriers,\" he said on X. \"My comment addressed agitators approaching law enforcement with a gun and refusing to disarm.\"For the second time this month, federal agents have been involved in a fatal shooting in Minneapolis linked to a crackdown on illegal immigration by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.Bystander video footage has captured the moments before Pretti was shot on Saturday.The altercation that led to Pretti's shooting was recorded from many points of view and federal and state officials have given conflicting accounts.Watch: Video shows moments around fatal shooting in MinneapolisThe Department for Homeland Security shared an image of a gun it claimed belonged to Pretti and said he was a threat to officers. On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked to clarify if Pretti had brandished a gun and said agents fired what she called \"defensive shots\" while trying to disarm Pretti.\"They responded according to their training, and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him. And, I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz branded the Trump administration's version of events \"nonsense\" and \"lies.\"Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey likened the federal operation to an invasion and accused ICE of \"trying to spin this as an action of self-defence\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorPA MediaSir Keir Starmer voted against allowing Andy Burnham being allowed to run as an MP The other day I compared the saga of Andy Burnham, his ambitions and the forthcoming by-election in Greater Manchester to a long and twisting marble run.If, and it was a big if, the marble trundled all the way to the bottom, it was possible to imagine Burnham as prime minister, before this year was out.But, as I said then, it was also possible the marble would fly off the run spectacularly – which is precisely what has now happened.In an exercise of brute power, which is simultaneously an illustration of how they perceive their own weakness, No 10 has scuppered Burnham's attempted run from Manchester to Westminster and perhaps on to Downing Street.Yes, this was a decision taken by a committee of the Labour Party, but allies of Sir Keir Starmer are making it perfectly clear he joined the remote meeting on Sunday morning and he cast a vote to block Andy Burnham.The relationship between the two men has long been fascinating to observe.Burnham's first act in politics was very much as a creature of Westminster: an adviser, an MP for 16 years, a cabinet minister. He has run for the Labour leadership twice before. Here he is talking to me more than a decade ago about his ambition to be prime minister. He later reinvented himself - by defining himself against Westminster as the Mayor of Greater Manchester.But his ambitions beyond the north west of England have long been transparent - and long provoked a roll of the eyes or a raised eyebrow from Sir Keir.Burnham's interventions last autumn, around the time of Labour's annual conference, deeply irritated many within the party. He gave an interview to The New Statesman, which carried the less than cryptic headline \"Andy Burnham's plan for Britain.\"Shortly after came an interview in The Telegraph, headlined \"Andy Burnham: MPs want me to challenge Starmer\".Burnham's team would point out, rightly, that politicians don't write the headlines but the wider point stands – his desires were very, very clear.Just the other day, he set out in The Guardian how he believed his approach to his mayoralty in Greater Manchester could be applied nationally.'You should not block democracy'Of course, aspiring to lead the country is noble, but it shouldn't be surprising that the current occupier of that role might have a rather sniffy view of such manoeuvring, particularly when Starmer can argue that it is he who won Labour's colossal majority not Burnham, whatever people might think of how governing has gone for Labour since.No 10 has calculated that it would rather weather a short-term storm – the gales of reaction for and against this decision currently gusting across social media – than authorise a circus lasting weeks, then months, with Burnham as a by-election candidate and one question dominating: what's your plan if you become prime minister?\"I'm afraid no-one is convinced that Andy is coming in to be a team player and the last thing we should do is allow this kind of psychodrama,\" one senior party figure tells me, adding: \"We can't allow insecurity and destabilisation to indulge one man's personal ambition.\"Others are livid, arguing it is absurd and counterproductive to spike the prospects of someone they see as one of the party's brightest lights.\"You should not block democracy. Keir is running scared and it's a very bad look,\" one senior Labour MP said.All this means that in the space of just a few months, those loyal to the prime minister have briefed heavily against Health Secretary Wes Streeting, whose ambitions they view with nervousness too - and have now blocked Andy Burnham from returning to Westminster.They argue that the electorate is sick of political soap opera and they want to get on with governing – against a tricky international and domestic backdrop.Their critics, within the Labour Party and beyond, say both are acts of a weak prime minister seeking to cripple capable rivals who might, they argue, do a considerably better job than him in No 10.This will likely be far from the last act this year in the drama of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership, and how much of a future it has.",

    "body": "Thousands of children facing 'catastrophic' waits for NHS community care4 hours agoNick Triggle,Health correspondentandElena Bailey,Health reporterGetty  ImagesTens of thousands of children in England have spent more than a year waiting for NHS community care such as hearing services, speech and language therapy and disability support, the BBC has found.The analysis shows a quarter of the 300,000 children on waiting lists have been waiting more than 12 months.NHS leaders and doctors say the delays are \"catastrophic\", harming not only their health but also development – and are calling for the same priority to be given to tackling these long waits as has been given to the hospital backlog.The government says the long waits are unacceptable, but under its 10-year plan greater investment in community services will improve access to care.'Waiting list after waiting list'Tiya Currie's six-year-old son, Arun, struggled to get the support he needs.He has had difficulties with his speech since he was just a toddler. But when Tiya, 46, from London, tried to get help she faced \"waiting list after waiting list\", she said.\"I was completely in the dark and I was tearing my hair out. That was really stressful.\"After two years of waiting, Tiya and her husband felt they had no choice but to use £4,000 of their savings to pay privately for speech therapy and a formal diagnosis, which revealed Arun had developmental language disorder (DLD).OtherTiya and her husband waited two years for the NHS, before paying privately for speech and language therapy for their son, ArunDLD is a diagnosis given to children who have significant, ongoing difficulties understanding or using spoken language.Tiya said: \"It absolutely crushes me that there are so many people out there who need access to speech and language therapists, but aren't getting it due to long waiting lists and it not being affordable.\"Arun's progress has improved significantly with speech therapy and proper school support, but Tiya said the need for better early intervention and resources for children is key.\"I know how stretched NHS services are, but children should be prioritised because they're still developing and they need that support now, not in years' time,\" she said.Harmful waitsThe community waits for under 18s have got worse over the last three years.Since the start of 2023, there has been a six-fold rise in children waiting more than a year, with more than 77,500 in England now in that position.Year-long waits for adults in the community are not common, with just 1% waiting that long compared with 26% of children.While the figures cover only England, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) says longer-than-usual waits are also being reported elsewhere in the UK.Many of the children facing long waits have complex needs, such as learning and physical disabilities. Some of the young children waiting will include those needing autism or ADHD assessments. For older children, mental health services tend to take the lead.Elliot Howard-Jones, chair of the Robinson Group, which represents specialist community NHS services, said he was really worried about how the delays were affecting children.\"Getting this support is fundamental to their development journey – that's why waits are so harmful.\"To illustrate the point, he gave the example of a child who struggles with hearing, which leads to them becoming disruptive and disengaged.\"For an adult, waiting is annoying, painful and difficult. But for a child, waiting means your peer group moves on while you don't. You fall behind and never catch up.\"Howard-Jones said there needed to be greater focus and investment in community services, similar to what has already been happening for hospital treatments - tackling that backlog was at the heart of Labour's manifesto and NHS trusts are get extra money for making progress.Chronic underinvestmentHis warnings have been echoed by other senior NHS leaders.Richard Kirby, chair of the NHS Confederation and NHS Providers' community network, said demand was outstripping capacity. \"Without more help, children will continue to wait longer and fall further behind - that is a situation none of us should accept.\"And Dr Ronny Cheung, from the RCPCH, added: \"Chronic underinvestment and a lack of focus on children's health and services have meant that staff are unable to meet increasing demand.\"Long waits are unacceptable for any patient, but for children and young people the waits can be catastrophic. \"Many treatments need to be given by a specific age or developmental stage to prevent long-lasting complications, and for many children these long waits mean we miss crucial chances to intervene in time.\"Kate Lawson, head of policy at disability charity Sense, said there were many \"heartbreaking stories\" of families battling to access essential care and therapies, with significant numbers having to resort to paying privately.\"It's essential that the government addresses this issue to give every child the best start in life,\" she added.The Department of Health and Social Care agreed the waits were unacceptable.It said it was taking \"firm action\" by introducing a new target to get community health services to work towards seeing patients within 18 weeks - the same as hospitals are expected to do.And a spokeswoman added under the government's 10-year NHS plan there would be greater investment in community services.\"Our vision for neighbourhood health will bring care closer to babies, children and young people, with more staff, better digital tools and services working together so children get the right support in the right place,\" she said.

    "body": "4 hours agoPeter HoskinsandAdam Hancock,Business reportersHiba Kola/ReutersThe price of gold has risen above $5,000 (£3,659) an ounce for the first time ever, extending a historic rally that saw the precious metal jump by more than 60% in 2025.It comes as tensions between the US and NATO over Greenland have added to growing concerns about financial and geopolitical uncertainty.US President Donald Trump's trade policies have also worried markets. On Saturday he threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China.Gold and other precious metals are seen as so-called safe-haven assets that investors buy in times of uncertainty. On Friday, silver topped $100 an ounce for the first time, building on its almost 150% rise last year.Demand for precious metals has also been driven by a range of other factors including higher-than-usual inflation, the weak US dollar, buying by central banks around the world and as the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this year.Wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as Washington seizing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, have also helped push up the price of gold.One of the biggest appeals of gold is its relative scarcity. Only around 216,265 tonnes of the metal have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council trade association.That's enough to fill between three to four Olympic-sized swimming pools. The majority of that was only extracted from the earth since 1950, as mining technology advanced and new deposits were discovered.The US Geological Survey estimates that another 64,000 tonnes of gold can still be mined from underground reserves, although the supply of the metal is predicted to plateau in the coming years.\"When you own gold, it's not attached to the debt of somebody else like a bond is or an equity where the performance of a company will drive performance,\" said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery.\"It's a really good diversifier in a very uncertain world,\" he added.'People go to gold'Gold saw a blockbuster year in 2025, with its biggest annual gain since 1979 as investors flocked to precious metals.With financial markets spooked by concerns including Trump's tariffs and fears that artificial intelligence-related stocks are overpriced, gold repeatedly hit new record highs.\"I think a large part of that is the extreme uncertainty we have around US policy,\" said Nikos Kavlis from research consultancy Metals Focus.While economic concerns can help to push up the price of gold, it also tends to rise when investors expect interest rates to be cut.Lower rates typically mean smaller returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to assets like gold and silver.The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its main interest rate twice this year.\"It's inversely correlated because the opportunity cost of keeping the money in a [government bond] is really not worth it anymore, so people go to gold,\" said Ahmad Assiri, Research Strategist at Pepperstone.Getty ImagesIn many cultures, gold is purchased during festivals or given as a gift at celebrationsIt's not just investors who have been buying up gold.Last year, central banks added hundreds of tons of bullion to their reserves, according to the World Gold Council.\"There's a very clear shift away from the US dollar, which is benefiting gold immensely,\" said Kavalis.The start of this year has seen gold continue to rally but Frappell warns the \"news-driven\" market could also result in a fall in its price.\"There's got to be scope for unexpected news that actually might be positive for the world and not necessarily positive for gold,\" he said.But not everybody is buying gold for purely investment reasons.In many cultures, the metal is purchased during festivals or given as gifts at celebrations such as weddings.In India, the annual Diwali festival is believed to be an auspicious occasion to buy precious metals in order to bring on wealth and luck.According to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, Indian households held $3.8tn of gold, equivalent to 88.8% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).Neighbouring China is the world's largest single consumer market for gold, with many believing that buying it brings good fortune.\"We often see a seasonal uptick in demand around Chinese New Year, which we are seeing at the moment to an extent,\" said Kavalis, referencing the upcoming Year of the Horse, which begins in February.",

    "body": "30 minutes agoStuart LauNurPhoto via Getty ImagesUkraine has hit a Russian chemical plant with UK-made Storm Shadow missiles, the Ukrainian military said on Tuesday.Calling the strike \"a successful hit\" that penetrated the Russian air defence system, Ukraine's general staff of the armed forces said they were still assessing the outcome of the \"massive combined missile and air strike\".The Kremlin has been warning the West not to give Ukraine weapons capable of long-range attacks, but Kyiv says it's imperative to target Russian facilities that play a key role in Moscow's war against Ukraine.\"The Bryansk Chemical Plant is a key facility of the aggressor state's military-industrial complex\", the Ukrainian military said in an X post on Tuesday.It added that the plant \"produces gunpowder, explosives and rocket fuel components used in ammunition and missiles employed by the enemy to shell the territory of Ukraine\".Moscow's authorities have not yet commented on the strike.The attack came on the same day that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and other European leaders vowed to \"ramp up the pressure on Russia's economy and its defence industry\" until Russian leader Vladimir Putin \"is ready to make peace\".A joint statement - co-signed by the Ukrainian, German, French, Italian, Polish, Danish, Finnish, EU and Norwegian leaders - added that \"Ukraine must be in the strongest position \"before, during, and after any ceasefire\".Russia launched an overnight air attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Wednesday morning, according to the city's mayor, Vitali Klitschko.Witnesses heard explosions that sounded like air defence units in operation, the Reuters news agency reported.The latest attacks came after a meeting at the White House last week between Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which the US leader indicated he was not ready to supply sought-after Tomahawk cruise missiles to Kyiv.Trump initially agreed with Putin to hold talks in Budapest regarding the war in Ukraine, possibly in the coming weeks. But that plan was put on hold on Tuesday, with Trump saying he did not want a \"wasted meeting\".Watch: \"I don't want to have a wasted meeting\", says Trump on talks with PutinIn remarks at the White House, the US president indicated that a key sticking point remained Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line.Just last month, Trump appeared to take a major shift in his position towards ending the war, saying Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\" - referring to Ukraine's internationally recognised borders.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsular Moscow annexed in 2014.",

    "body": "27 minutes agoEmily Holt & Yasmin RufoBBC NewsBBCWe all want hair that looks and feels healthy, whether that means glossy waves, bouncy curls or sleek and smooth strands. In an industry worth £5.8bn in the UK, there are endless products, trends and TikTok hacks flying around which makes it's easy to lose sight of the basics.The truth is, healthy hair isn't about spending a fortune or following complicated routines, it's about getting the simple stuff right.Trichologists Eva Proudman from UK Hair Consultants and Tracey Walker from Hair and Scalp Clinic, bust four common myths about how to look after your hair. 1. Cold water doesn't make your hair shinier Getty ImagesEver shivered your way through an icy shower just for the sake of shinier hair? Well luckily you can stop doing that and enjoy a warm and comfortable wash as Proudman says cold water doesn't add any extra shine to your hair. \"There's no need to wash your hair in freezing cold water as it does nothing,\" she says. \"What's much more important is how you protect your hair from chemicals, heat and the environment you're in.She does add that you don't want to wash you hair in too hot water though as it can dehydrate your hair and can scald the scalp in the same way hot water scalds our skin.2. No product can repair damaged hair Getty ImagesIf you're someone who hopes to fix their split ends without a visit to the hairdressers, you'll be disappointed to know a haircut is the only solution.Proudman explains a split end is similar to a ladder in tights - there's simply no way to mend it.Walker says: \"If you imagine a hair is fracturing and if you look at it under the microscope, it almost looks like there's two or three more prongs to the hair.\"Products on the market act as a kind of glue which puts the hair back together again so it looks better.\"She says these are temporary fixes, and warns not to get lulled into spending a lot of money on products which promise a solution.Proudman also says claims that cutting your hair can make it grow faster are untrue.\"It's just not possible to make your hair grow quicker so any product claiming that is lying.\"Other stories you may enjoy3. Your hair won't self-clean  Getty ImagesYou may well have met someone who swears they've managed to train their hair to \"self-clean\" allowing them to wash it infrequently or not at all. But Proudman says doing this is absolutely not good for your hair. \"Your scalp has 180,000 oil glands and it collects dirt and debris if it's not regularly washed.\" Walker agrees and likens it to the fact you can't remove an oily or dirty mark from clothes with just water, you need detergent too. Not washing your hair regularly can cause a smell as well as a worsening of scalp conditions such as dandruff, she says because \"leaving the hair to become oilier can let yeast and bacteria build, making itchy scalp conditions worse\".Proudman recommends washing your hair every other day if your hair is very oily or you use a lot of product in it.  Laura Waters, Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis at University of Huddersfield, says while those with very oily hair might benefit from stronger cleansing, people with drier hair could consider a sulfate-free shampoo which is more expensive but won't strip oil out of it.4. Dry shampoo isn't a substitute for washingGetty ImagesFinding time for a full wash, blow-dry and style isn't always realistic so between work, workouts and social plans, many of us reach for dry shampoo as a quick fix to revive greasy roots and refresh our hair without hopping in the shower. Proudman says dry shampoo is \"absolutely fine\", but that it should be used only once between hair washes. The problem arises when you use it for multiple days in a row without washing it out. \"The natural oil of the scalp sinks into the shampoo and the yeast will feed on the build up,\" Proudman says. \"If you're not careful you'll get an itchy and flaky scalp.\"Ultimately her advice is to focus on looking after your scalp in the same way you look after your face - you wouldn't keep piling makeup onto your skin without removing what's underneath and washing it first.

    "body": "Israel has received two bodies that Hamas says are two more deceased hostages who had been held in Gaza.The Israeli military said two coffins were handed over to troops in the Palestinian territory by the Red Cross, which had earlier received them from Hamas. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the coffins - which were escorted by the military - had crossed into Israel and will be taken to be formally identified in Tel Aviv. Confirmation of their identies would mean that Hamas has transferred 15 out of 28 deceased Israeli hostages under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal earlier this month. All 20 living hostages were released shortly after the agreement was reached.Hamas has handed over a Palestinian body in a previous hostage transfers, which it said was accidental due to difficulties locating the bodies.The IDF urged the Israeli public on Tuesday evening to \"act with sensitivity and wait for the official identification, which will first be provided to the families of the hostages\".It also stressed that \"Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages\".Israeli officials said the families of the hostages will be notified once the bodies are identified.There has been outrage in Israel that Hamas has not yet returned all the deceased hostages. The Palestinian group says it is trying to do this but that it faces difficulty finding bodies under rubble of buildings bombed out by the IDF in Gaza.Under the ceasefire and hostage release agreement, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians for every Israeli hostage's remains.The first phase of the agreement has also seen an increase of aid into Gaza, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt in fighting - though deadly violence flared up over the weekend as both sides accused one another of breaching the terms of the deal.The IDF launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.More than 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

It reports her budget is expected to see a charge added on those who use limited liability partnerships, in a move the paper calls \"targeting the wealthy\". It also carries an image of ex-French President Nicolas Sarkozy hand-in-hand with wife Carla Bruni as he heads to jail for the start of a five-year sentence.Brexit hit the economy \"even harder than feared, says Reeves\" is The Independent's top story. \"Leaving the EU 'needlessly' added costs for British businesses\" it quotes the chancellor as saying. Now, with \"one month to go until crunch Budget\", the UK is \"rebuilding ties with Brussels\". Bruni and Sarkozy are also featured having a farewell kiss.The governor of the Bank of England is hearing \"alarm bells\" writes the Financial Times as it reports Andrew Bailey drawing comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis. The paper also carries the image of Sanae Takaichi after the \"historic vote\" that saw Japan elect its first female PM.\"Putin defies Trump as peace talks collapse\" is the lead story for the Daily Telegraph. No meeting for the leaders is on the horizon as the paper reports the Russian leader \"refuses to freeze front lines\". It also carries a big image of Carla Bruni with her hands together on the day her husband went to prison.Former PM Boris Johnson's admission to the Covid inquiry that \"our lockdowns failed kids\" headlines the Metro. The paper quotes him as saying children paid a \"huge, huge price\", while standing by his handling of the pandemic.The Daily Mail reports the grooming gang inquiry is \"in chaos\" after three abuse survivors resignations from the process. The paper calls one of the withdrawal of one of the candidates in the running to the lead the review as a \"farcical development\".\"Family law shift hailed as victory for children facing domestic abuse\" headlines The Guardian. I says family courts will no longer have to operate under the presumption that contact with both parents is in the best interests of a child after the \"landmark change\".The Daily Star dubs Johnson \"Bozo the killer clown\" after he gave evidence at the Covid inquiry. The former PM described himself as \"homicidal\" after schools minister Gavin Williamson's \"U-turn\" on A-levels.\"Off you trot, Mr Windsor\" says the Sun after \"fury over free rent\". Following its story of Katie Price's ex-husband Kieran Hayler being charged with three counts of rape and one of sexual assault, the paper claims Ms Price may speak at his trial.The Daily Express headlines with a plea from the sister of 16-year-old Sasha Marsden, who the Express says was stabbed \"100 times\". It pictures Katie Brett who has called for MPs to scrap a 28-day limit on appeals against \"lenient\" sentences.The Daily Mirror leads on its Pride of Britain campaign - after its award ceremony on Monday night.

    "body": "4 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondent, Jerusalem andJake LaphamA small number of British planning officers has been sent to Israel to join a US-led multinational taskforce to help monitor the ceasefire in Gaza, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.The taskforce, called the civil military coordination centre, is also likely to include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the UAE, US officials have previously said.British troops are not going into Gaza, as it currently stands, and they are not being sent into a combat zone.The Israeli government has approved the first phase of a Gaza deal with Hamas, which has led to a ceasefire and the release of hostages and prisoners.Earlier this month, American officials said up to 200 US troops already based in the Middle East would be moved to Israel to support the taskforce.They said it would be led by US Central Command (Centcom) based in the region, and was intended to oversee the progress of the ceasefire agreement and also help coordinate humanitarian assistance.In a statement, a spokesperson for the MoD said the UK \"continues to work with international partners to support the Gaza ceasefire to see where the UK can best contribute to the peace process\".In a speech at Mansion House on Monday, Defence Secretary John Healey said the UK had sent a senior commander to deputise for a US commander tasked with running the centre in Israel, following an American request.He said Britain \"can contribute to the monitoring of the ceasefire\", but others would take the lead.\"Britain will play an anchor role, who will contribute to the specialist experience and skills where we can but we don't expect to be leading in the way,\" Healey added.An MoD source said the efforts were part of \"showing the UK is playing its part in setting the framework on what comes next\".Further work on what more the UK can contribute is understood to be under discussion.In the first two decades of this century, the UK military has built up extensive experience in capacity-building for security forces, first in Iraq, then in Afghanistan, which is partly why Centcom requested its participation. British officials have also been working in the West Bank since 2006 to help train the Palestinian police.Set against that is Britain's historic role in the Middle East. For 25 years, Britain was the colonial power in the area known as Palestine in World War One, departing in haste in 1948 as the State of Israel was created. There is still much bitterness amongst many Palestinians who blame Britain and the 1917 Balfour Declaration for what has happened to them since.The UK deployment comes after a visit by US Vice-President JD Vance to Israel on Tuesday, where he said the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire was \"going better than expected\".Vance also warned that \"if Hamas does not co-operate, it will be obliterated\", while refusing to give a deadline for when the Palestinian group must disarm - a part of US proposals yet to be agreed.The two special US envoys who helped negotiate the ceasefire deal, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, appeared alongside Vance at a news briefing in southern Israel.One of the points in US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza plan included the US working with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary international stabilisation force to immediately deploy in Gaza.This point is yet to be agreed between the sides and would only happen if a hostage and prisoner exchange was completed.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.At least 68,229 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "10 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East Correspondent, JerusalemUnder Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza, the \"yellow line\" - which Israel withdrew to earlier this month - is the first of three stages of Israeli military withdrawal. It leaves it in control of about 53% of the Gaza Strip.One Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, referred to it as \"effectively the new border\" in Gaza.It's a remark that will please the far-right coalition partners of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The fortifications and demarcations Israel is now building along this boundary are meant to clearly divide the territory, but they may also help to blur the differing hopes and expectations of Mr Netanyahu's allies in Washington and at home.How long he can keep both sets of expectations in play depends largely on this next stage of negotiations.The boundary marked by the yellow line is temporary, but further withdrawal of Israeli forces rests on resolving the difficult issues pinned to the second stage of Donald Trump's deal – including the transfer of power in Gaza and the process for disarming Hamas.Washington is keen that nothing upset this next delicate stage of negotiations. US Vice-President JD Vance flew in on Tuesday to push Netanyahu to press on with peace talks. Trump's negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with the Israeli PM on Monday.Israeli newspapers have been reporting that Netanyahu is receiving a stern message from his American allies to \"show restraint\" and not to endanger the ceasefire.When Israel complained that Hamas had violated the terms of the ceasefire on Sunday, killing two soldiers, the response advocated by Mr Netanyahu's far-right National Security Minister was a one-word demand: \"War\".Instead, Israel carried out an intense, but brief, wave of air strikes, before reinstating the truce, and was careful to emphasise that its troops had been attacked inside the yellow line – keen to show Washington that Israel had not broken the rules.Netanyahu has said the war will not end until Hamas is dismantled – its disarmament, and the full demilitarisation of Gaza, are among the conditions he has set.But Israeli commentators are lining up to say that the real decisions over Israel's military action in Gaza are now being made in Washington.The yellow line – and the daunting task facing negotiators in this second stage of the deal – are clues as to why Netanyahu's coalition partners have chosen to wait, rather than carry out a threat to bring down his government.The dream for many extremist settlers – and ministers – is that the next stage of this process will prove impossible to resolve and the yellow line will indeed become the de facto border, opening the way to new settlements on Gazan land. Some hardliners would like Israel to annex the whole of the Gaza Strip.The vast majority of Israelis want an end to the war and for the remaining bodies of the hostages, and Israel's serving soldiers, to come home.But Israel's prime minister is known as a politician who likes to keep his options as open as possible, for as long as possible, and this is a deal in stages, with caveats built in.Agreeing to this first stage meant withdrawing to positions that left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, and agreeing to a ceasefire in order to get hostages home.From here, it will become harder to align the goals of his US and domestic allies.Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly underlined that violations of the deal by Hamas – including its failure to disarm – would allow Israel to return to war.\"If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better,\" he told the Israeli public earlier this month. \"If not, it will be achieved the hard way.\"Donald Trump has said the same.  But Washington has so far shown a tolerance for delays and violations in implementing the deal on the ground, leaving Netanyahu with far less political room than perhaps he'd like.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSean FarringtonBusiness presenter andMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe head of global theme park giant Merlin Entertainments says its \"biggest competition\" is people choosing to stay at home on their phones and other devices. Fiona Eastwood says a day out at one of its UK attractions - which include Legoland, Thorpe Park and Alton Towers - was the \"perfect antidote\" for spiralling screen time. In a wide-ranging BBC Big Boss Interview, the chief executive reflected on challenges in the forthcoming Budget, big brand partnerships, and how its customers were responding to cost-of-living pressures.Eastwood also highlighted the importance of seasonal attractions to its customers - with Halloween now rivalling its summer season in driving profits at some attractions. Having been in the job since February, Eastwood has taken over at a time when her industry is facing challenges from a dip in consumer confidence. Her company's latest half-year update flagged concerns over a \"softening of demand\" in the UK theme park sector and fewer international visitors. Last year the company's overall revenue was down slightly to just over £2bn, with an operating loss of £132m. Despite the challenging environment, Merlin drew just shy of 63 million people to its attractions in 2024. Escapism was something people were willing to spend on, Eastood says.\"The moments to be together are increasingly precious, and what we provide is quite distinct,\" she says. \"It's all about families coming together to play.\"Getty ImagesFiona Eastwood said she was not a big fan of riding on Alton Towers' Nemesis roller coaster - and that the Wicker Man attraction was more here speed Talking about its UK attractions, which include Madame Tussauds, Sea Life and the London Eye, Eastwood says seasonal windows are key.Its major theme parks have hosted Halloween events, like Scarefest at Alton Towers and Fright Nights at Thorpe Park, since 2002. \"We're a very seasonally led business,\" says Eastwood. \"So you have spring break, Easter, summer and Halloween. \"Halloween, that we're in now, we're seeing some really strong performance. That's in view of the amazing product we have. You take Thorpe Park, increasingly Halloween is almost half of its annual profits.\"Along with seasonal offerings, big brand partnerships are also a key part of Merlin Entertainments' strategy - creating rides themed around children's tv hits to tempt families away from their screens and into the parks.Next year it will open its first Bluey ride at Alton Towers as part of CBeebies land, as well as PAW Patrol land opening at Chessington World of Adventures. One of next year's biggest launches is a collaboration with video game Minecraft - an enduring mega hit since it was launched in 2009, spawning one of the highest grossing films of 2025.With Eastwood citing screen time as Merlin's toughest competition, it hopes an £85m investment in immersive experiences will attract Minecraft fans with themed rides, restaurants and accommodation in the UK and US during 2026 and 2027.\"What I'm really excited about in terms of Minecraft is bringing [the game] to life in a physical way that will mean the massive fans of that game can then be in the game with their friends, their parents,\" says Eastwood. Call for a VAT cut Eastwood is on the board of Hospitality UK, an industry trade body which has been calling for VAT on hospitality to be cut from 20% to 12.5%.\"What we really want is a growth-led Budget,\" says Eastwood. She adds that cutting VAT would put the UK on a \"level-playing field\" with its European neighbours - where hospitality businesses often face a rate of about 10%. Making the case for this, Eastwood pointed to a period during Covid when VAT was cut to 12.5%. \"We saw a bump, and we saw demand, and we saw people wanting to spend,\" she says.In a statement, the Treasury said the government was supporting all UK businesses and the upcoming Budget would aim to encourage growth and investment.\"We are a pro-business government that has capped corporation tax at 25%, the lowest rate in the G7, we're reforming business rates, have secured trade deals with the US, EU and India, and have seen interest rates cut five times since the election, benefiting businesses in every part of Britain.\"While Eastwood has been CEO for less than a year, her time with Merlin stretches back a decade, with her joining shortly after Alton Towers Smiler rollercoaster crash in 2015.Coming into the chief executive role, she says her focus was trying to take an \"outside view\" of the company - aware that she could have bias and blind spots. She adds one of the best parts of her role is getting out to visit the sites. \"Nothing beats going to the theme park, that is my job,\" she says. \"Spending time with the team, seeing kids having an amazing experience at our attractions.\" However, asked about getting to the front of the queue for Nemesis - the Alton Towers ride that is one of the best known in the country - Eastwood did not have any concrete advice, despite joining front-line workers on the ride last year. \"I'm not a big fan of Nemesis,\" she says. \"My favourite's actually Wicker Man, I love Wicker Man.\" ",

    "body": "3 hours agoLaura GozziWatch: \"I don't want to have a wasted meeting\", says Trump on talks with PutinDonald Trump has said he did not want a \"wasted meeting\" after a plan to have face-to-face talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about the war in Ukraine were put on hold.The US president indicated that a key sticking point remained Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line, in remarks at the White House on Tuesday.Earlier, a White House official had said there were \"no plans\" for a Trump-Putin meeting \"in the immediate future\", after Trump said on Thursday that the two would hold talks in Budapest within two weeks.Key differences between US and Russian proposals for peace became increasingly clear this week, appearing to have dashed chances of a summit.Trump and Putin last met in Alaska in August, during a hastily organised summit which yielded no concrete results.The White House decision to shelve plans for a second Trump-Putin meeting may be seen as an attempt to avoid another similar scenario.\"I guess the Russians wanted too much and it became evident for the Americans that there will be no deal for Trump in Budapest,\" a senior European diplomat told Reuters.A preparatory meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was due to be held this week - but the White House said the two had had a \"productive\" call and that a meeting was no longer \"necessary\".On Monday, Trump embraced a ceasefire proposal backed by Kyiv and European leaders to freeze the conflict on the current front line.\"Let it be cut the way it is,\" he said. \"I said: cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"Russia has repeatedly pushed back against freezing the current line of contact.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the idea had been put to the Russians repeatedly but that \"the consistency of Russia's position doesn't change\" – referring to Moscow's insistence on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions.Moscow was only interested in \"long-term, sustainable peace\", Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday, implying that freezing the front line would only amount to a temporary ceasefire.The \"root causes of the conflict\" needed to be addressed, Lavrov said, using Kremlin shorthand for a series of maximalist demands that include the recognition of full Russian sovereignty over the Donbas as well as the demilitarisation of Ukraine – a non-starter for Kyiv and its European partners.European leaders released a statement with Zelensky earlier on Tuesday saying that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line and accused Russia of not being \"serious\" about peace.Zelensky said discussions about the front line were the \"beginning of diplomacy\",  which Russia was doing everything to avoid.The only topic that could make Moscow \"pay attention\" was the supply of long-range weapons to Ukraine, he added.Trump had discussed a summit in the Hungarian capital over the phone with Putin, a day before meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.Some reports suggested those talks had been a \"shouting match\", with sources suggesting Trump had pushed Zelensky to give up large areas of territory in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known collectively as the Donbas, as part of a deal with Russia.However, Zelensky has always said Ukraine cannot relinquish the parts of the Donbas it still holds, on the grounds that Russia could later use the area as a springboard for further attacks.Putin's unscheduled call with Trump last Thursday came following speculation that the US was preparing to send long-range Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv that could potentially strike deep into Russia.Zelensky said it was the Tomahawks issue that had forced Russia to engage in discussion. Despite coming away from the White House empty-handed, he added that the talk about the missiles had turned out to be a \"strong investment in diplomacy\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editor, CaerphillyBBCThe history of the Labour Party oozes out of the valleys of south Wales, perhaps like nowhere else in the UK.Keir Hardie, that founding figure of the party, was elected to Parliament in Merthyr Tydfil in 1900.Aneurin Bevan, the founder of the NHS, was elected as the MP for Ebbw Vale in 1929.Even in recent years, when the so called Red Wall of formerly solid Labour seats in many parts of the north of England and the Midlands crumbled, with the Conservatives as the beneficiary, much of south Wales stuck with Labour.The Red Wall and plenty more besides have since swung to Labour, but now things seem to be changing in Wales.Local sentiment, polling and the mood within the parties all suggests something is up, ahead of a by-election to the Welsh Parliament in Caerphilly.Labour gloomTalking to folk around town, there is a deep-seated frustration.A stubborn lack of evidence, as many see it, of things getting better.And there is a recurring sense of a declining sense of community: a sense that the ties that have long bound the town, the area together, are perhaps continuing to fray. Something which began with the closure of the coal mines and loss of much heavy industry has continued, some feel, as so many of us retreat behind a phone screen; our increasingly digital lives splintering and atomising us further from each other.Is that a contributor to political volatility and a dilution of the loyalty people may once have had to particular political parties?Whatever the contributory factors, Labour are gloomy here, even on their upbeat days.In Caerphilly, they are the essence of the political establishment: they run the council, they run the Welsh devolved government and they run the UK government as well.This, if you are the Welsh Labour candidate, can cause issues.Richard Tunnicliffe, a book publisher by trade, has campaigned in recent weeks to keep some local libraries threatened with closure open.The thing is, it is the local Labour council which runs the very libraries threatened with being shut. Awkward.It is a case study in the potential consequences for a party of near political ubiquity for such a long time.Perhaps little wonder Reform UK and Plaid Cymru are upbeat.Giants squeezedAnecdotally, and for what it is worth, they both appear to have considerably more posters dotted around the place than Labour.And they definitely have broader smiles and a greater spring in their steps.The big change round here is Reform UK.As has so often happened in the last six months or so, they are compelling their rivals to react to what they are doing.The party leader Nigel Farage has been here twice, drawing big crowds.But the security guard on their campaign office front door reminds you they provoke strong opinions, positive and negative.Some are incensed with their focus on immigration, in an area with barely any.Reform's candidate Llŷr Powell argues they are offering something new and are untainted by the blame being heaped on both Labour and the Conservatives.But they do come with their own Welsh branded baggage.The party's former leader in Wales, Nathan Gill, has admitted taking bribes to make statements in favour of Russia, of all countries, while he was a member of the European Parliament.He is expected to be jailed next month.Powell tells me Gill deserves to face the full force of the law.Lindsay Whittle, the Plaid candidate, is no stranger to elections.He has stood in ten general elections and every devolved election for over a quarter of a century – and victory has remained elusive.He has been a local councillor for nearly 50 years.Whittle reckons that when it comes to what appears to be a cratering in support for Labour, he has never seen anything like it.He is buoyant and thinks that in a tight tussle with Reform UK, he can squeak a win.Plaid are allowing themselves to dream, with some supportive polling evidence right now at least, that they could be running the Welsh government after next May's devolved elections across Wales. They see Reform as their big opponent.But some of Labour's opponents fret that they may be under pricing what they fear could be a new phenomenon – what one figure described to me as \"shy Labour voters.\"Some people might be unwilling to admit it, or saying they are undecided, but could they plump for Labour in the end? Let's see.The Welsh Conservatives, in a part of the world rarely fertile for them, find themselves cropped further out of the picture, again courtesy of Reform.Perhaps little wonder when former Conservative cabinet minister Sir Jacob Rees Mogg is suggesting Tory voters in Caerphilly should consider voting Reform to prevent Plaid from winning.Incidentally, he also suggests Labour supporters should back Reform too, for the same reason.Both of Westminster's giants – Conservatives and Labour – are feeling squeezed here.The Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and others are vying for support too.You can see a full list of the candidates standing in the by election here.As I say, next May, there will be elections across Wales to the Welsh Parliament, the Senedd.By Friday morning here, we could be seeing the first big indicator of a seismic change to come.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAleks PhillipsLouvre MuseumLouvre MuseumA tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen Jewellery stolen from the Louvre in Paris in a daring daylight robbery has been valued at 88 million euros (£76m; $102m), a French public prosecutor has said, citing the museum's curator.Laure Beccuau told RTL radio the sum was \"extraordinary\" but said the greater loss was to France's historical heritage. Crown jewels and pieces gifted by two Napoleons to their wives were among the items taken.Thieves wielding power tools took less than eight minutes to make off with the loot shortly after the world's most-visited museum opened on Sunday morning.With the thieves having not been caught more than two days on from the heist, experts fear the jewellery will already be long gone.How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftMs Beccuau said she hoped announcing the estimated worth of the jewellery would make the robbers think twice and not destroy them.She added the thieves would not pocket the full windfall if they had \"the very bad idea of melting down these jewels\".The items taken, previously described as having inestimable worth, include a diamond and emerald necklace Emperor Napoleon gave to his wife, a tiara worn by Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, and several pieces previously owned by Queen Marie-Amelie.Investigators found a damaged crown that used to belong to Empress Eugenie on the thieves' escape route - apparently having been dropped as they departed in haste.Four masked thieves used a truck equipped with a mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Two of them cut through a glass window on the first floor using a battery-powered disc cutter and entered the museum. They then threatened the guards inside, who evacuated the building.'It's like a scene from a film' - Paris tourists surprised at Louvre jewel theftThe thieves had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a member of museum staff. They were seen making off on scooters.French President Emmanuel Macron described the robbery as an attack on France's heritage.Security measures have been tightened around the country's cultural institutions, after a preliminary report found one in three rooms in the Louvre lacked CCTV and that its wider alarm system did not go off.Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said security protocols had \"failed\", lamenting that the thieves being able to drive a modified truck up to the museum had left France with a \"terrible image\".Authorities believe they are chasing a team of professionals, given how quick and organised they were.Experts in art recovery previously told the BBC investigators had just one or two days to track down the items before they could be considered gone for good.It is most likely they have been broken down into precious metals and gems, smuggled out of the country and sold for a fraction of their worth, other experts have said.

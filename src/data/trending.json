Has Donald Trump changed his mind on the Epstein Files?AmericastAvailable for over a yearOn Sunday night Donald Trump told Republicans in the House of Representatives to vote in favour of releasing files relating to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “because we have nothing to hide”. It’s a striking change in position from the president who has so far resisted pressure from Democrats and Republicans in his own party who have been demanding that all files relating to Epstein be released into the public domain. \nOne of the Republicans calling for their release is the conservative firebrand and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was once one of Trump’s most faithful supporters. After stepping up her demands to see the files released, she now appears to have lost the president’s backing who called her a “traitor” and a “disgrace” to the Republican Party. We answer your questions on why the pair have fallen out.\nAnd, we answer your questions on why there’s been another presidential pardon, this time for the UK billionaire Joe Lewis, whose family trust owns Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.

    "body": "A portrait by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt was sold for $236.4m (£179m) in New York on Tuesday, making it the second most expensive piece ever sold at auction. Six people took part in a 20-minute bidding battle for the Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer which was painted between 1914 and 1916. Auction house Sotheby's has not disclosed the buyer's identity.The portrait was looted by the Nazis and almost destroyed in a fire in World War Two, but was rescued in 1948. The artwork was returned to Lederer's brother, Erich, a friend and subject of Klimt's contemporary, Egon Schiele. The piece remained in Lederer's possession for most of his life, before he sold it in 1983, according to Sotheby's. The painting shows Lederer, an heiress and the daughter of one of Klimt's patrons, wearing a white robe and standing in front of a blue tapestry covered in Asian motifs. The Nazis, who annexed Austria in 1938, looted the Lederer art collection but left family portraits behind, says the National Gallery of Canada. Estée Lauder heir Leonard A Lauder made it part of his private collection in 1985, where it was displayed in his Fifth Avenue home in New York. Tuesday's sale shot past expectations, with the painting predicted to sell for  $150m before the auction. The second highest sale for a Klimt on record was Lady with a Fan, which sold for $108.8m in 2023 in London. Several other Klimt works in Lauder's collection were auctioned at the same event, including Flowering Meadow and Forest Slope at Unterach am Attersee, which fetched between $60m and $80m each. The most expensive artwork ever sold at auction was Salvator Mundi, attributed to  Leonardo da Vinci, which sold in 2017 for $450.3m.Tuesday also saw a sculpture of a fully functioning gold toilet by the conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan picking up $12.1m just an hour after the record-breaking Klimt sale.The 101-kg toilet received just one bid. Sotheby's said that the buyer was a famous American brand.",

    "body": "1 hour agoChloe ParkmanSouth WestVisit Isles of ScillyVictoria Bond is among five killed in a snowstorm in ChileA British woman is among five people who have died in a snowstorm in Chilean Patagonia.Victoria Bond, 40, a public relations consultant from Cornwall, was named by authorities in Chile as among those killed in the tourist hotspot of Torres del Paine National Park, in the south of the country.Along with Ms Bond, two German and two Mexican citizens died in the snowstorm, according to Jose Antonio Ruiz, the presidential delegate of the Magallanes region of southern Chile. Their bodies were found on Tuesday.Visit Isles of Scilly chairman Andrew Sells said the organisation was \"utterly devastated\" by Ms Bond's death.Visit Isles of Scilly said Ms Bond had headed up its public relations for more than six years and was on a \"trip of lifetime\" with friends in Argentina and Chile.She was out hiking when she became trapped in the storm, the organisation said.Mr Sells said she had \"worked tirelessly\" in her role to promote the islands, 28 miles off the Cornish coast, and was an \"integral part\" of the team. He said: \"She was always a joy to work with, and I cannot praise her work too highly. She is an enormous loss to the community.\"Euan Rodger, executive vice-chairman of Visit Isles of Scilly, said the organisation was \"heartbroken\".\"She brought life, energy, and an infectious enthusiasm to every project, making her a true joy to work alongside,\" he said.'Leaves a huge hole'Adrian Jones, who worked with Ms Bond promoting the Roseland Festival in Cornwall, paid tribute to her as \"lovable, witty and creative\".\"She was a doer... she had ideas and she saw them through,\" he said.\"She will leave a huge hole in Portscatho... she lived in Newquay but she spent a lot of the time in Portscatho.\"He described her as adventurous.\"Unbelievably sad as it may seem, she was doing what she lived life for,\" he said.'Intense' snowfallChilean officials said the search for victims had ended and the focus was now on repatriating the bodies and liaising with foreign consulates.Chilean President Gabriel Boric Font paid tribute to search and rescue teams who worked in \"intense\" snowfall and winds reaching speeds of up to 118mph (190km/h).He said in a post on X: \"To the families, friends, and loved ones of the five individuals of Mexican, German, and British nationalities who tragically lost their lives in the incident that occurred in Torres del Paine, I extend my deepest condolences.\"Know that you have the full support and collaboration of Chilean authorities and institutions during these difficult times.\"The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: \"We are supporting the family of a British woman who has died following an incident in Chile and are in contact with the local authorities.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "'I've banned solo drinkers from my bar'10 hours agoLynette HorsburghNorth WestGreensmith PhotographyCarl Peters says he takes pride in how safe his customers feel in AlibiThe owner of a cocktail and karaoke bar where solo drinkers are banned says he is baffled by the furore it has caused on social media as the policy is \"for the safety of all guests\".Carl Peters said the no-single-entry policy after 21:00 had been in place since the opening of Alibi in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, in 2022.He told the BBC it was to \"mitigate risk\" and \"protect his customers\" from being \"mithered\" by solo drinkers.He posted a reel on Instagram earlier this month about the policy after saying someone had accused him of discrimination. He said he was \"astounded\" by the ensuing criticism, describing his venue as an \"inclusive and safe environment\".The ban got a mixed response from Instagram users with one commenter saying she \"always feels safe in Alibi\", while another described the policy as \"narrow minded\", adding if he finishes work late and goes for a drink himself \"he has never once mithered anyone and... happy in my own company\".Alibi/InstagramA man claimed the policy was \"discrimination\", Mr Peters saysMr Peters explained there were two reasons why he introduced the policy.Firstly, if someone on their own has a seizure or an accident with no-one with them \"in a late night busy bar environment, it's an absolute nightmare for us to deal with\".He said also \"sometimes if you let people in on their own, the reason why they're on their own is that they've got no-one to talk to, so they start mithering other groups\".\"So what we do as a venue is we just eliminate that.\"He added: \"Unless you're with a group and we know who you're with, then you're not coming in.\" Mr Peters added he took \"pride that his customers feel safe in his venue\" so was \"astounded\" it was now being criticised on social media.

I just look at them and say, 'oh it's crazy I was doing that at that age.' But it's also incredibly sweet and I hope they're having a great time.\"An open casting call for the roles was announced last year, and more than 30,000 children auditioned.The chosen ones - McLaughlin, Stanton and Stout - are all relative newcomers.(Left to right) Young Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, stars of the movie franchise from 2001-2011McLaughlin previously appeared in Grow, a Sky comedy with Nick Frost and Golda Rosheuvel, while Stanton starred as Matilda in the musical of the same name in the West End. Stout had no prior acting credits.The young cast of the new series also includes Lox Pratt as Draco Malfoy, Alessia Leoni as Parvati Patil and Leo Earley as Seamus Finnigan, as well as Rory Wilmot who will play Neville Longbottom and Amos Kitson portraying Dudley Dursley.They will be joined by adult stars including John Lithgow as Albus Dumbledore, Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall, Paapa Essiedu as Severus Snape, and Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid.Filming is under way for series one of the new show, which is set to launch in 2027. But the entire production is expected to take 10 years to complete in total, as the plan is to film a series to cover each of JK Rowling's seven books, which the films were originally based on.With that in mind, Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden near Watford, where it is being made, was this summer granted permission to build a temporary school for the child actors to study in for real, when they're not at Hogwarts.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPMQs: Tory leader pushes PM over tax measures in next week's BudgetConservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the government's Budget is unravelling before it has even been delivered, after the chancellor backed away from raising income tax rates.Ministers had given strong indications it was planning to increase the tax - which would break an election pledge - but last week government sources said Rachel Reeves had decided against the move after better-than-expected economic forecasts.During Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch pressed Sir Keir Starmer over whether the government would \"break another promise\" instead by freezing income tax thresholds.The PM refused to rule this out, saying the chancellor would set out her plans in next week's Budget.Describing the situation as a \"shambles\", Badenoch accused the government of floating the idea of increasing income tax rates only to \"U-turn\".\"This is the first Budget to unravel before it's even been delivered,\" she told the House of Commons.\"The chancellor's cluelessness, I'm afraid, is damaging the economy now.\"Badenoch also highlighted comments from the chancellor in her Budget last year, when Reeves said: \"I am keeping every single promise on tax that I made in our manifesto\", adding that she would not extend the freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds because this \"would hurt working people\".The Tory leader asked the PM to confirm the government would not break this promise and continue the freeze on income tax thresholds.But Sir Keir dodged the question, only saying the Budget would focus on cutting NHS waiting lists, debt and the cost-of-living.\"What we won't do is inflict austerity on the country as they did. What we won't do is inflict a borrowing spree like [Conservative prime minister] Liz Truss did,\" he added.In response, Badenoch said it was \"quite clear\" the government was planning to freeze thresholds.\"If [the chancellor] breaks such a clear promise, how can the public trust a word that she says next week?\"Reeves will deliver her Budget in the House of Commons on 26 November, and Badenoch will give the immediate response for the opposition.In Labour's 2024 general election manifesto, the party promised it would \"not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, or VAT\".The freeze on income tax thresholds - the level people start paying tax or have to pay higher rates - was introduced under the Conservatives in April 2023 and is due to expire in 2028.While an extension of the freeze would not break the strict letter of the manifesto promise, it would mean some people's tax bills go up.This is because more people would be dragged into a higher tax band, or have to pay tax on their income for the first time, if they get a pay rise.Extending the freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds by two years could raise £8.3bn a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.It would mean those on the lowest incomes are increasingly subject to tax, with the think tank estimating that someone on a minimum wage would be liable to pay income tax if they worked just 18 hours a week.In the months running up to the Budget, ministers had repeatedly given strong indications that income tax rates would go up.As recently as last week, Reeves had told the BBC sticking to Labour's manifesto commitments would require \"deep cuts in capital spending\".In October, Sir Keir had declined to repeat his previous promises not to increase key taxes during Prime Minister's Questions.However, last Friday it emerged that Reeves had decided not to go ahead with the move, after estimates suggested a gap in the public finances was £10bn smaller than previously thought.Ahead of every Budget, the chancellor submits their plans to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which then make forecasts on whether the government will spend more money than it raises and whether the economy will grow or shrink.A proposal to increase income tax rates by 2p, while cutting National Insurance by the same amount, was sent to the OBR as an option earlier this month to be costed, to help fill what was then a £30bn gap in the public finances.Newer assessments from the OBR appear to have increased the projected strength of wages and tax receipts in the coming years and offset several billion pounds of that gap, taking it closer to £20bn.Many Labour MPs were also nervous about breaking an election promise, which would have influenced the chancellor's decision.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "48 minutes agoBrian Wheeler,Political reporter and Paul Seddon,Political reporter'We see you': Defence secretary's message to PutinA Russian spy ship has used lasers for the first time to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its activity near UK waters, the defence secretary has said.John Healey told reporters the \"deeply dangerous\" move from the Yantar was being taken \"extremely seriously\" by the government.He added that the vessel was north of Scotland and had entered UK waters for the second time this year during the last few weeks.The UK would continue monitoring the ship and had \"military options ready should the Yantar change course,\" he added.\"My message to Russia and to Putin is this: we see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,\" he added.Healey said the laser incident took place whilst the Yantar was being followed by a Royal Navy frigate and RAF Poseidon P-8 planes deployed to \"track the vessel's every move\". It is understood the episode occurred within the last two weeks.Speaking at a news conference in Downing Street, the defence secretary added he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely \"when it is in our wider waters\".The defence secretary previously issued a warning about the ship, after it was spotted in UK waters in January.Healey said the vessel, which entered service in 2015, was part of Russia's Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI), which was designed to \"undertake surveillance in peacetime and sabotage in conflict\".\"We have military options ready should the Yantar change course. I am not going to reveal those because that only makes President Putin wiser,\" he said.Asked about the risks posed by lasers, Healey replied: \"Anything that impedes, disrupts or puts at risk pilots in charge of British military planes is deeply dangerous.\"Ministry of DefenceThe Ministry of Defence released new photographs of the Yantar on WednesdayRussia describes Yantar, which is operated by the country's Ministry of Defence, as an oceanic research vessel. Western nations have often tracked it in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables.Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an American security think tank, said the Yantar's use of lasers was \"an escalation for sure\".\"Essentially, you do it to impede the pilots from doing their work,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World At One.\"We don't know exactly how strong the lasers were, but even if they didn't blind the pilots, it was provocative,\" she added.The UK and its Nato allies are concerned about the risk Russia poses to offshore cables, pipelines and other infrastructure critical to internet connectivity.In his speech, the defence secretary warned about Russian incursions into Nato airspace, as well as the threats posed by China and armed conflicts around the world, adding: \"Our world is changing. It is less predictable. It is more dangerous.\"Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence has come under criticism from a committee of MPs for being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack.The committee said the UK and its European allies should be building up their capabilities to prepare for potential US withdrawal.Healey said the UK government \"takes a different view\" to the committee about America's commitment to Nato.But he said the committee was \"right to say\" Britain should \"pick up the pace of our commitment\" and that was something Labour has been doing since it came to power last year.Defence talks ongoingThe report comes as British negotiators race to agree a deal with the EU to enable British defence companies to contribute to projects funded by a new €150bn (£130bn) EU defence loan scheme set to launch next year.The Labour government wants to conclude a deal in the coming weeks to allow British companies to take part in the first round of bids from EU countries, with applications due by the end of this month.Healey told reporters the UK wanted to be part of the programme, but not \"at any price\", amid reports the two sides are at odds over the entry fee the UK could pay to enable British firms to take part.It has been reported that the EU is demanding an entry fee running to billions of euros before the UK can take part.He added that any financial contribution to take part would have to be \"good value for money for our taxpayers and our industry\".",

    "body": "20 minutes agoJonathan Beale,Defence correspondent in Kyiv and Mattea BubaloAt least 25 people have been killed including three children in a Russian missile and drone attack that hit two blocks of flats in the western city of Ternopil, Ukrainian officials say.They say another 73 people were wounded, 15 of them children, in the strike early on Wednesday - one of the deadliest in the region since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Ukraine's air force later said Russian X-101 cruise missiles had hit the residential flats. The neighbouring Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions were also struck, and a drone attack on three districts of the north-eastern city of Kharkiv wounded more than 30 people. Photos posted online showed buildings and cars ablaze. Ukraine's air force said it had shot down 442 of 476 drones and 41 of 48 missiles launched by Russia, including 10 missiles destroyed by F-16 and Mirage 2000 fighter jets supplied to Kyiv by its Western allies. But in a reference to how stretched Ukraine's air defences currently are, the air force pleaded for \"the uninterrupted and timely supply of aviation weapons from Western partners\".Ternopil, a city closer to the Polish border than the capital Kyiv, has rarely faced attacks since the full-scale invasion. Social media footage of this strike shows missiles shooting across the sky towards the city, though very little sign of air defences reacting from the ground.The devastation caused by the Russian strikes on Ternopil soon became clear. A video shared by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showed one of the blocks of flats had completely caved in. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said it had been destroyed between the third and ninth floors.The attack had caused \"significant destruction\", said Zelensky, and many victims were reported to be in the rubble. Plumes of smoke poured from windows and small fires burned outside the tenement. A giant smoke cloud rose in the distance behind the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Ternopil, as sirens blared throughout the city. With limited defence systems, and a vast country to defend every night, no matter how effective Ukraine becomes at shooting down Russian missiles and drones, there is always a risk some will get through – to devastating effect, as happened in Ternopil.Energy facilities, transport and civil infrastructure were damaged elsewhere in western Ukraine.The energy sector came under attack in Ivano-Frankivsk region where two of the three people reported wounded were children. The head of Lviv region said an energy facility had been struck. Russia has recently upped its attacks on Ukraine's energy grid - as the fourth winter of the war approaches - hoping to damage morale as well as logistics and Ukraine's own defence industry.Electrical supplies are already being rationed and, after the latest attacks, the energy ministry announced more power cuts across the country.Russia's defence ministry said it had carried out its \"massive strike using long-range precision weapons\", claiming it had targeted Ukraine's \"military-industrial complex and energy sector\" in response to Ukrainian attacks on \"civilian targets\".Ukraine's military said on Tuesday it had fired US-supplied longer-range Atacms missiles at military targets inside Russia, the first time they had admitted using Atacms on Russian soil.Russia's defence ministry accused Ukraine of firing four of the missiles at the southern city of Voronezh but said they had all been shot down by air defences. Meanwhile, Zelensky has travelled to the Turkish capital Ankara, in an attempt to revive a US bid to end the war. He held talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid reports President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff has been working on a plan with Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev.The Kremlin said no Russian representative would be joining the talks in Ankara. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on a media report that the US and Russia had been working on a peace plan for Ukraine.\"In this case, there is nothing new that we can inform you about,\" Peskov told journalists on Wednesday.His comments came as Zelensky was reportedly due to meet two top US army officials in Kyiv on Thursday. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Army Chief of Staff General Randy George are the most senior US military officials to visit the Ukrainian capital since President Donald Trump took office, Reuters reports. In a separate development, Romania's defence ministry said a Russian drone had flown about 8km (5 miles) through its airspace in the early hours of Wednesday. The drone then crossed into Ukraine and Moldova before returning to Romania, it said.Romanian and German air force planes were scrambled in response to the incursion and the defence ministry said it was unclear where the drone had come down.Poland also deployed jets early on Wednesday and temporarily closed two airports in the southeast in response to the strikes in western Ukraine.As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches next February, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war.Ukraine and its Western allies, including the US, have called for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line – but Russia has repeatedly ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation.Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out two months before the full-scale invasion.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesWalk around your local supermarket and you'll struggle to find much that's healthy for your finances on the shelves - food price rises are accelerating.The cost of the weekly shop is, and will continue to be, a worry for millions of people.Beyond just food, prices of goods and services in general are going up, but the rate of those price rises has slowed.And that is likely to bring better news for the cost of borrowing, in particular mortgage rates for homeowners and first-time buyers.Are prices going up or down?Prices pretty much always rise. Official statistics chart the movement in the cost of hundreds of goods and services in the UK.It is the rate of increase that is crucial, and that inflation rate is published every month by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).On Wednesday, the ONS said the rate of inflation had fallen to 3.6%, which means prices are rising more slowly than they were and will foster hope that inflation has peaked.Delve a little further into the data, and there are more details about what is behind the latest trends. For example, fish, vegetables, chocolate and confectionary were among the products that rose in price, although fruit prices fell slightly.Recent research by the Bank of England found that people on average are still buying the same amount of food, but paying more for it. That said, they are changing the way they shop.\"Concerns about rising food costs and utility bills still dominate conversations,\" it said.\"Households continue to change their shopping habits to reduce spending, such as buying more vegetables and reducing meat consumption.\"Getty Images\"Staples like bread, meat and potatoes all cost more than they did even a month ago,\" says Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at investment platform AJ Bell.But she does point to a silver lining - the dip in the inflation rate means the Bank of England is now more likely to cut interest rates in December.The Bank uses its benchmark interest rate - which heavily influences the cost of borrowing for households and businesses - to try to bring inflation to its target rate of 2%.\"Inflation remains well above the Band of England's happy place of 2%,\" says Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.But, she says, the latest figures could pave the way for a sixth interest rate cut since August last year.The prospect of an interest rate cut has seen lenders make changes already. In recent weeks, many major lenders have lowered their rates for people getting a new fixed-rate mortgage or renewing their current one.\"There has been particular emphasis placed on rates for home movers with some of the best rates available for purchases,\" says David Hollingworth, of mortgage brokers L&C.Data from the financial information service Moneyfacts shows that the average rate on a new two-year fixed deal has fallen to 4.88%, and is down to 4.93% for the average five-year fixed deal.Average rates for those only able to put down a deposit of 5% or 10% - often first-time buyers - are now looking lower than they have been at any time in the last two or three years.Why are lenders cutting rates now?Inflation is only one factor in lenders' decisions to cut mortgage rates now.Generally, Christmas is a quiet time for the housing market as potential buyers and sellers concentrate on turkey and trimmings instead.So, they may be lowering rates in a bid to stimulate custom. The same cannot be said for savings rates. \"Competition has been scarce,\" says Caitlyn Eastell, from Moneyfacts. That is compounded by the fact that many of those buyers, sellers and savers have put plans on hold until they find out what happens in the Budget delivered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves on 26 November.The Budget looms large over the housing market, with talk of taxation on high value properties, as well as over economic activity in general. Reeves wants to introduce measures to lower the rate of inflation, and help people with the cost of living. However, she also needs to bring in more money or cut government spending to meet her own fiscal rules.It is a delicate balancing act that will affect individual and family finances, affecting the money people have to spend in the supermarket and the appetite they have to save, as well as buy or sell a home.

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul MoseleyNorfolk political reporterThe Labour MP Clive Lewis has offered to give up his seat to allow Andy Burnham to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the Labour leadership.There has been ongoing speculation that Greater Manchester Mayor Burnham wants to take on Sir Keir for the top job, but he would need to be an MP to do so.Lewis told the BBC's Politics Live that he was willing to step down from his Norwich South seat to allow Burnham to return to the Commons and put \"country before party, party before personal ambition\".Burnham was contacted for comment. Number 10 declined to comment.Lewis, who has been an MP for 10 years, said he had spoken to Burnham, and when asked if he would give up his seat for him, he said it was \"a question I've asked myself\".He added: \"Do you know what? If I'm going to sit here and say country before party, party before personal ambition, then yes, I have to say yes, don't I.\"Last week, he said Sir Keir's position as Prime Minister was \"untenable\" and told Channel 4 News that Burnham should be given the chance to \"step up\".Lewis first won his seat in 2015, and last year he increased his majority to more than 13,000.But if he were to step down, any would-be successor would first need to win a selection contest before a by-election was held.In September, Burnham said he had \"no intention of abandoning Manchester\" but did not rule out challenging Sir Keir.

    "body": "3 hours agoPhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterAction is needed now to reduce ultra-processed food (UPF) in diets worldwide because of their threat to health, say international experts in a global review of research.They say the way we eat is changing - with a move away from fresh, whole foods to cheap, highly-processed meals - which is increasing our risk of a range of chronic diseases, including obesity and depression.Writing in The Lancet, the researchers say governments need \"to step up\" and introduce warnings and higher taxes on UPF products, to help fund access to more nutritious foods.However some scientists say this review can not prove that UPFs directly cause health harms and more research and trials are needed to show that.Ultra-processed foods are defined as containing more than five ingredients you would not find at home in your kitchen cupboard, such as emulsifiers, preservatives, additives, dyes and sweeteners. Examples of UPFs include sausages, crisps, pastries, biscuits, instant soups, fizzy drinks, ice cream and supermarket bread. Surveys indicate these industrially-manufactured foods are on the rise in diets around the world, worsening the quality of what we eat with too much sugar and unhealthy fats and a lack of fibre and protein.This review of evidence on the impact of UPFs on health, carried out by 43 global experts and based on 104 long-term studies, suggests these foods are linked to a greater risk of 12 health conditions.These include type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, depression and dying prematurely from any cause.Review author Prof Carlos Monteiro, from the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, who set up the Nova classification system for categorising food, said the growing consumption of ultra-processed foods \"is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals\".\"This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritising ultra-processed products, supported by extensive marketing and political lobbying to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating,\" he added.Co-author Dr Phillip Baker, from the University of Sydney, said the answer was \"a strong global public health response - like the coordinated efforts to challenge the tobacco industry\".The review acknowledges a lack of clinical trials showing exactly how UPFs damage health - but says that should not delay action to protect people worldwide from potential health harms.Some scientists have commented that it is difficult to untangle the effects of UPFs in people's diets from other factors in people's lives, such as lifestyle, behaviour and wealth.Critics of the Nova classification system say it relies too much on the level of processing in foods, and not on how nutritious that particular food is. For example, wholegrain bread, breakfast cereals, low-fat yoghurts, baby formula milk and fish fingers all count as ultra-processed but have lots of good in them.Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said: \"A study like this can find a correlation, but it can't be certain about cause and effect.\"He said there was still \"room for doubt and for clarification from further research\".\"It seems to me likely that at least some UPFs could cause increases in the risk of some chronic diseases. But this certainly doesn't establish that all UPFs increase disease risk.\"It is still not clear what it is about ultra-processed foods that could be causing or contributing to diseases.Prof Jules Griffin, from the University of Aberdeen, said there were some positive sides to food processing, and more research to understand how it influences our health was \"urgently needed\".The Food and Drink Federation (FDF), which represents the industry, says UPFs can form part of a balanced diet, like frozen peas and wholemeal bread.\"Companies have been making a series of changes over many years to make the food and drink we all buy healthier, in line with government guidelines,\" says Kate Halliwell, chief scientific officer at the FDF.The amount of sugar and salt in products on sale in shops and supermarkets has gone down by a third since 2015, she added.The UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition said earlier this year that the association between higher consumpton of ultra-processed foods and adverse health outcomes was \"concerning\".But it added it was \"unclear\" whether these foods are unhealthy due to processing or because many of them are high in calories, saturated fat, salt and free sugars.Current UK government advice on diet is to eat more fruit, vegetables and fibre, and cut back on sugar, fat and salt.",

    "body": "36 minutes agoBrian Farmer,at the Old Bailey and Danny FullbrookHertfordshire PoliceEx-Met Police officer David Carrick was already serving multiple life sentences after admitting sex offences in court in 2022 and 2023Serial rapist and former Metropolitan Police officer David Carrick has been found guilty of sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl and a former partner.The 50-year-old, who has already been jailed for life, has been convicted of molesting the girl in the late-1990s and raping the woman during a relationship more than 20 years later.Jurors at the Old Bailey found him guilty of nine offences and he is due to be sentenced on Thursday.Carrick, from Stevenage, is already serving a minimum term of 32 years in prison, having admitted 71 offences of sexual violence committed over a 17-year period.Carrick, wearing a suit and tie, was joined by four prison officers in the dock.He shook his head repeatedly in the dock as the verdicts were read out.The jury deliberated for five hours before finding him unanimously guilty of the following offences: Five counts of indecent assault against a girl under 16 between April 1989 and August 1990Two counts of rape against a woman, once between December 2014 and April 2016 then between January and December 2019 Sexual assault against the same woman between January and December 2019Coercive and controlling behaviour in relation to the same woman between 2016 and 2019Carrick was tried at the Old Bailey in LondonLawyer Shilpa Shah, who led both prosecutions by the Crown Prosecution Service against Carrick, has issued a statement about the latest court case.\"It was clear from the compelling testimonies given by these women that they had endured relentless abuse to which they did not consent,\" she said.\"One victim was a child when she was indecently assaulted and another was sexually abused by him while he served as a senior police officer.\"These factors made it vital to prosecute him a second time - not only because of the severity of the crimes and the public interest arising from him being a police officer when he committed some of them, but also to show the full extent of his offending which spanned decades.\"Written confessionHertfordshire Police praised the victims for their bravery and urged any others to come forward.During the trial, jurors heard how Carrick abused a young girl for about 18 months before she told her mother what was going on.Carrick confessed to that abuse in a letter which was recovered from his medical records and signed \"Dave\".The court also heard how the other victim had been in a \"toxic relationship\" where she had been repeatedly raped.A police interview with that woman was played in court where she described how Carrick had  strangled her, called her abusive names and kicked her out of the house.She said their relationship was \"quite traumatising - I wish I'd never met him\".Carrick declined to give evidence in the current Old Bailey trial, but he had denied the new charges, whereas he admitted the previous charges during the court appearances in 2022 and 2023.Prosecutor Tom Little KC told jurors his silence in the dock was \"deafening\".Despite his written confession, Carrick dismissed the new allegations of child abuse, claiming the girl was a liar.Regarding his ex-partner, he had claimed during an interview at Full Sutton prison that the sex had been consensual and accused her of being motivated by the MeToo movement.The sentencing hearing is due to begin on Thursday morning.More on this storyRelated internet links",

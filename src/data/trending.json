    "body": "24 minutes agoTom Symonds and Amy WalkerGetty ImagesPolice and crime commissioners are to be scrapped in England and Wales to save £100m over this parliament, the government has said.The government has said that less than 20% of voters can name their PCC. Instead, the role will move to either an elected mayor or council leaders, following the end of the commissioners' terms in 2028.There are currently 41 commissioners under the system, introduced 12 years ago by former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron.According to ministers, the saving will allow them to invest an extra £20m in front-line policing every year.Though its stated aim was to make forces more accountable to the areas they serve,    the costs of the system and the effectiveness of commissioners has long been criticised.Policing minister Sarah Jones told the Commons on Thursday that the model had \"failed to live up to expectations\" and \"not delivered what it was set up to achieve\".She added that \"public understanding [of PCCs' role] remains low despite efforts to raise their profiles.\"Jones said PCCs had sought to provide strong oversight and tackle crime but the model \"weakened local police accountability and has had perverse impacts on the recruitment of chief constables.\"PCCs' main responsibilities include setting an annual budget, appointing chief constables, producing a five year policing plan, and assessing the performance of their force against the plan.",

    "body": "Ministers urge PM to sack whoever was behind anonymous briefings13 minutes agoChris Mason,Political editor and Kate Whannel,Political reporterHouse of CommonsSir Keir Starmer is facing calls from senior ministers to sack whoever was behind briefings to the media that the PM is facing a leadership challenge.Energy Secretary Ed Miliband and Health Secretary Wes Streeting were both named as potential challengers in the anonymous briefings - now both are calling for whoever was behind them to be found and sacked. It comes as Sir Keir apologised to Streeting for the episode, which the PM is said to be \"incadescent\" about.It has intensified pressure on the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, whom some - including senior figures in government - hold ultimately responsible for the briefings, as well as the overall culture inside No 10.One ally of the prime minister told the BBC: \"Morgan is a proxy for Keir. They are coming for Morgan because they want to get Keir. This isn't a parliamentary party battle, it's a Labour elite battle.\"Both Streeting and Miliband have stopped short of publicly criticising McSweeney, and on Wednesday Streeting made a point of praising his role in Labour's general election victory.On Thursday, Streeting brushed off questions about McSweeney's future saying it was \"silly Westminster soap opera stuff\" and \"yesterday's news\". Speaking to the BBC, Miliband said it's been a \"bad couple of days\", adding: \"We've got to learn the lessons of this episode and say this is not where the focus should be.\"He said he was confident the prime minister would want to find who the anonymous briefer was and \"get rid of them if he can find out\".\"He hates it when things get leaked, he hates it when cabinet colleagues get briefed against.\"People listening to this programme might think 'if he hates it, why can't he stop it'.\"The truth is, sometimes these things do happen. There are noises off and you can never quite know where they are coming from.\"Miliband's name has been discussed by some Labour MPs as another possible challenger to the prime minister.Asked if he would rule out returning as Labour leader, he replied: \"Yes.\"He added: \"I had the best inoculation technique against wanting to be leader of the Labour Party which is that I was leader of the Labour Party, between 2010 and 2015. \"I've got the T-shirt - that chapter's closed.\"Sir Keir apologised to Streeting in a brief phone call on Wednesday evening, however supporters of the health secretary are said to be irritated that briefing against him has continued. Those around the health secretary argue that \"this kind of briefing culture followed Keir Starmer from opposition into government\".There are a declining number of advisers who were with Sir Keir in opposition and are still working for him now.McSweeney is one of them, and the most senior. He has been approached for comment and not replied.Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Sir Keir had \"lost control of his government... and lost the trust of the British people\". She said McSweeney was responsible for the culture in No 10 and asked if the prime minister still had confidence in him.Sir Keir replied: \"Morgan McSweeney, my team and I are absolutely focused on delivering for the country.\"Let me be clear, of course, I've never authorised attacks on cabinet members, I appointed them to their post because they're the best people to carry out their jobs.\"He added that \"any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable\" and specifically praised Streeting for doing a \"great job\".Speaking after PMQs, the prime minister's press secretary told reporters the briefings against Streeting had come \"from outside No 10\" and that the prime minister had full confidence in McSweeney.The spokesperson refused to say whether there was a leak inquiry, but did say leaks would be \"dealt with\".",

    "body": "Type 1 diabetes is worse in the young - here's why10 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentNye familyGracie Nye in hospital when she was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetesScientists have discovered why type 1 diabetes is more severe and aggressive when it develops in young children.Type 1 is caused by the immune system attacking cells in the pancreas that control blood sugar levels.The research team showed the pancreas was still developing in childhood, particularly under the age of seven, making it far more vulnerable to damage.They say newly developed drugs could buy patients time for the pancreas to mature, delaying the disease.Type 1 diabetes affects around 400,000 people in the UK.Gracie, age eight from Merseyside, became suddenly ill on Halloween in 2018. It started as a slight cold, but rapidly escalated.\"She went from being a very happy one-year-old, who would go to nursery and dance and sing, to almost dying in less than 48 hours,\" says dad Gareth.\"The diagnosis remains the worst part of our life.Suddenly everything we took for granted was 10-20 times harder,\" he says.Nye familyNye family, with Gracie wearing pink glassesThe Nye family had to adapt quickly - keeping on top of everything Gracie had to eat or drink, checking blood sugar levels and giving the hormone insulin to tell her body to absorb the sugar in her blood.Gracie now has a glucose monitor and an insulin pump and is \"bossing diabetes\", says her dad.\"Gracie's a superstar,\" he adds.But why children diagnosed young like Gracie, especially those under the age of seven, have a more aggressive disease than those diagnosed in their teenage years or later, has remained a mystery.   The study, published in the journal Science Advances, shows it is down to the development of the beta cells living in the pancreas.These are the cells that release the hormone insulin when sugar levels rise in the blood after we eat. Researchers at the University of Exeter studied pancreas samples from 250 donors, allowing them to see how the beta cells formed normally as people got older, and in type 1 diabetes. Diabetes UKEarlier in life these beta cells were shown to exist as small clusters or as individual cells, but as we age they grow in number and mature into larger groups known as Islets of Langerhans.The study was able to see what happened after the immune system turned against a patient's own beta cells.Beta cells in small clusters were picked off and destroyed so they never had the chance to mature. Those in larger islets were still attacked, but were more durable allowing patients to still produce low levels of insulin which reduced the severity of their disease.\"I think this is a really significant finding for type 1 diabetes - this research really sheds light on why the disease is more aggressive in children,\" Dr Sarah Richardson, from the University of Exeter, told the BBC.She said \"the future is much brighter\" for children being diagnosed with type 1 now. This includes the possibility of screening healthy children for the disease and of new immunotherapy drugs to delay it.The UK has licensed teplizumab - an immunotherapy that can stop the immune system attacking beta cells and may be able to give them time to mature - although it is not available on the NHS. \"Because we have new drugs for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in children, we hope that these will be able to prevent or delay the onset in those young people,\" said Dr Richardson.Missing piece of the puzzleThe research was part of the Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge organised by the Steve Morgan Foundation, Diabetes UK, and Breakthrough T1D. Rachel Connor, director of research partnerships at Breakthrough T1D, said: \"This study gives us a missing piece of the puzzle, explaining why type 1 diabetes progresses so much faster in children than in adults.\"Dr Elizabeth Robertson, director of research and clinical at Diabetes UK, said: \"Uncovering why type 1 diabetes is so aggressive in young children opens the door to developing new immunotherapies aimed at slowing or stopping the immune attack, potentially giving children more precious years without insulin therapy and, one day, preventing the need for it entirely.\"",

    "body": "British Gas boss voices concerns over Scotland's energy jobs55 minutes agoMichael RaceBusiness reporter BBCSean FarringtonBusiness presenterChris O'Shea hasn't lived in Scotland for decades but the boss of Centrica, the owner of British Gas, is worried over the future of the energy industry in his homeland.He is concerned that the \"demise\" of drilling for gas and oil in the North Sea and the move to green energy will not create new roles quickly enough to offset job losses.His wide-ranging interview with us follows a series of difficult moments for the industry as soaring energy prices pushed household bills up and saw bumper dividends to shareholders and pay packets to bosses - including him. British Gas also faced a scandal over force-fitting prepayment meters in the homes of vulnerable people who fell behind on bills, something he says the company doesn't do anymore.Today O'Shea says his big concern is the decline in jobs in the North Sea oil and gas industry. The UK's largest oil and gas producer, Harbour Energy, announced job cuts earlier this year. And this month, the Port of Aberdeen said it would cut roles in the face of what it described as a \"staggering\" fall in North Sea oil and gas activity.\"The energy transition is the right thing for us to do. It's essential,\" says O'Shea, pointing out that British Gas no longer explores for oil and gas in the North Sea.\"What the area of disagreement is, is the pace at which it needs to happen,\" he tells the BBC's Big Boss Interview, drawing on personal experience.\"I grew up in the town of Fife, which was surrounded by coal mines. I saw the devastation when the coal mines were closed during the miners' strike and people that had incredibly well-paid jobs - they went to no work at all.\"You've got second, third-generation people that are not in work now. And I desperately want to avoid that through this transition.\"He says he found it quite hard to get a job after university and \"got loads of rejection letters\".\"I know what it's like to be a bit worried about getting a job,\" he says.\"I also know what it's like to get a job that you like, and you find out that you're good at, it can change your life - it certainly did for me.\"However, the chief executive is no stranger to cutting roles, having axed the best part of 5,000 soon after he took charge during the height of the Covid pandemic in April 2020.\"I wasn't sure the company was actually going to survive,\" he says. \"The only way I could justify that to myself was I was trying to protect 20,000 jobs, I couldn't protect them all.\"Since then, Centrica has taken on 1,700 apprentices and has committed to taking on one more every day for this decade at least.Much like energy prices in recent years, it's been a volatile time in the hotseat for O'Shea. As wholesale energy prices soared in part due to supply issues following the outbreak of war in Ukraine, many small suppliers went bust as they were unable to afford the fixed-price deals they'd locked into with customers.\"It's all down to poor regulation,\" O'Shea says, arguing that energy regulator Ofgem should have been stricter on making sure suppliers had enough cash to manage risks.\"You cannot have a system whereby the profits are privatised and the losses are socialised,\" he says.Ofgem told the BBC its regulation meant the sector \"now holds around £7.5bn in assets, a significant reverse from -£1.7bn during the crisis, meaning they are now better protected against failure, and the impact this has on customer's bills\".As energy bills surged, there were questions over bumper dividends to shareholders, and O'Shea's own salary and bonuses which hit £8.2m in 2023.\"Investors invest and they want a return,\" he says. \"People don't put money in the bank and say, 'it's ok, don't give me any interest' and investors don't buy shares and say, 'it's ok, don't give me any return'.\"Those dividends, O'Shea argues, are not generated from British Gas customers, and are as a result of other parts of Centrica's diversified business.\"There is very little profit that's made in the energy retail business. You're capped on the profit that you can make at 2.4% of your revenue,\" he says.The 52-year-old faced a huge public backlash after it emerged that debt agents working for British Gas were breaking into people's homes to fit prepayment meters.\"We are not doing that at the moment,\" he says when asked if this has resumed. But he argues the regulator Ofgem needs to tell firms how to act when people don't pay and how to find out who cannot pay and who refuses to.\"My heart goes out to those people who can't pay, but those people who choose not to pay are freeloaders and we have to find a way to differentiate and go after the people who choose not to pay, and to remove the distress from people who are unable to pay,\" he adds.He seems supportive of potential plans for the chancellor to announce relief for billpayers in the Budget, such as cutting the current 5% rate of VAT charged on energy.\"Anything that reduces the cost of energy, I would welcome. \"But the reality is we have got to pay for it in some way,\" he warns.

    "body": "4 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorGetty Images\"It's not been our finest 24 hours in government,\" one senior figure in government acknowledged to me, after mudslinging one way and another, some in public, plenty more in private.It began with anonymous briefings to journalists, including myself, that Keir Starmer would fight any attempt to remove him - and that cabinet ministers, including Wes Streeting, were plotting challenges.Streeting insisted he was loyal to the PM and called on those behind the briefings to be sacked, and the PM announced that any attacks on his ministers were \"unacceptable\".Questions about whether the PM had authorised the original briefings to flush out potential challengers - and whether those behind them were doing so with his knowledge, or approval, were thrown into the mix.Would there be a leak inquiry? Would there be sackings at what Streeting called a \"toxic\" Number 10 operation?What were those close to the prime minister hoping to achieve?I have been making loads of phone calls to patch together what actually happened and where all this leaves Keir Starmer's government.There are two key facts at the heart of all of this: the government is unpopular and so is the prime minister.These facts are the rocket fuel behind the constant conversations I hear about what Labour is trying to do about it and what it might mean for how long Sir Keir Starmer carries on in Downing Street.But let's get to the aftermath of all that mudslinging.Ministers urge PM to sack whoever was behind anonymous briefingsI have never authorised attacks on ministers, says PMStreeting denies plotting against PM after leadership claimsWho is Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney?The prime minister and Health Secretary Wes Streeting spoke on the phone on Wednesday evening to patch things up.I hear Sir Keir apologised to Streeting in the brief call and they agreed to talk in further detail \"soon\".They didn't talk about Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister's chief of staff - who has become a lightning rod for criticism from everyone including the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch in public to Labour figures junior and senior in private.Widely credited as the mastermind of Labour's election landslide and the political brain behind Sir Keir's quick rise since switching from Director of Public Prosecutions, McSweeney is also among the first to face criticism when the Downing Street machine is perceived to have stuttered, stumbled or outright failed.He is not responding to requests for comment, as some call for his head on a stick.His critics argue that in a Downing Street where McSweeney is called on to make plenty of big political judgements, he should take responsibility for how all of this unfolded.Others in the building insist no-one who works there was behind any briefing against a cabinet minister, after Wes Streeting said whoever was responsible should be sacked.In No 10, there is a tacit acknowledgement that the health secretary handled a round of pre-arranged interviews on Wednesday morning with dignity, aplomb and humour - despite being confronted by incessant questions about his own ambitions because those briefings about him came just hours before.For some Labour MPs, he demonstrated a nimbleness and knack for communication they only wish the Prime Minister shared.It also won't have gone unnoticed that at least some of those briefings that attempted to shore up the prime minister ended up creating an opportunity for Streeting to say he shared the sentiment of his colleagues who have described Downing Street as toxic and sexist and that those who were behind the briefings should be sacked.What a mess.\"I'm a faithful\" - Wes Streeting denies plan to challenge Starmer as PMThe prime minister, I am told, is \"incandescent\" at how all of this has played out and is looking into how it all happened.What appears to have gone awry, from No 10's perspective, is both volume and emphasis.Firstly, they had, perhaps naively, imagined that the briefings would generate some news, but not wall-to-wall headline news. It turned out to be much louder than they had anticipated.I'd say a prime minister letting this kind of thing be known, via supporters, less than 18 months after a landslide general election win, was always going to be front page, top of bulletins stuff – as it turned out to be, on these pages and others.And secondly, on emphasis, they insist they hadn't expected so much talk about Wes Streeting, which was then massively magnified by all those interviews he was booked in to do on Wednesday morning. Others, it must be said, concluded that that was precisely the intention.It has been another few days where Labour folk in government talk about lessons being learnt and on the backbenches plenty are irritated at what they see as an absurd spectacle playing out that they have to firstly witness and then attempt to defend.And they would rather not do either.But a government and a prime minister whose nervousness about their predicament is even bigger than their big majority will likely see repeats of this saga, unless they can quickly address the deep lack of popularity that drives it.",

    "body": "Amber warnings have been issued by the Met Office as Storm Claudia is forecast to bring heavy and persistent rain to parts of the United Kingdom.Through Friday, rain will spread across large parts of England and Wales with a larger yellow severe weather warning also issued.There will be some flooding and difficult travelling conditions with a strong easterly wind also developing through the day.The warnings come after recent rain and and flooding has already affected many areas such as south Wales last week.Storm Claudia - named by the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) - has already brought heavy rain and strong winds to Spain and Portugal.But rain associated with this storm will spread quickly north across England and Wales during Friday where it will stall and become persistent for most of the day.Met Office Amber warnings have been issued for parts of east Wales from 12:00 to 23:59 GMT where up to 150mm of rain - nearly 6 inches - is possible over high ground.An additional amber warning will also come in to effect for the same time across parts of east Wales, the Midlands and towards eastern England.Widely 50-75mm (2-2.9in) of rain is expected throughout Friday with some places seeing up to 80mm (3in).Difficult driving conditions and transport disruption is likely and some communities could be cut off from flooding.A larger Met Office yellow severe weather warning has been issued elsewhere across England and Wales that will come into force from 06:00 GMT Friday, lasting through until Saturday at 06:00 GMT.Around 30-50mm (1.2-2.9in) of rain is expected quite widely which may also bring some localised flooding and transport disruption.Strong south-easterly winds will accompany the rain.Additional yellow warnings for the wind have been issued for the far north-west of Wales and the Pennines.Gusts up to 50-70mph (80-113km/h) could bring some minor damage and disruption.While a typical named storm in the UK might sweep in from the North Atlantic bringing strong and damaging winds,  Storm Claudia is more notable for the rainfall.Named by AEMET earlier this week for the impacts it has brought to Spain, the storm is moving up the western side of Portugal and France and approaching the UK from the south-west.And while it will turn quite windy with gusts up to 70mph (113km/h) in north-west Wales and the Pennines, the winds are not the most notable feature of this storm.Once a meteorological agency takes the decision to name a storm, there is agreement that all nations use the same name to allow consistency and clearer communication of the impacts.Claudia will not replace Bram in the list of the UK's named storms. So we can still expect the next weather event deemed serious enough to be named by either the Met office, Met Eirean in Ireland or KNMI in the Netherlands to be Bram.Rain has featured a lot so far this November with some areas seeing over their November average in the first thirteen days.Shap and Carlisle in Cumbria for example have recorded more than their November rainfall already; 226mm and 95mm compared to the averages of 205mm and 85mm respectively.Other sites on higher ground such as Honister in the Lake District has recorded over 500mm of rain.Bannau Brycheiniog - known as the Brecon Beacons - in south Wales, has also been particularly wet with many Natural Resources Wales rainfall stations recording over 200mm of rain so far.The heavy rainfall in south Wales has also led to some significant flooding.A business owner who had to close his shop in Carmarthen due to the floods described it as \"the worst in living memory\".",

    "body": "ByChris BevanBBC Sport journalist and Chris CollinsonBBC Sport statisticianAnd then there was one.Thomas Tuchel's latest squad has laid bare the current dearth of English centre-forwards, with Harry Kane the only out-and-out striker in the 25-man group.Admittedly that is partly down to injury, with Tuchel explaining Ollie Watkins has been rested to manage an ongoing issue, while Dominic Solanke has been sidelined since August and Liam Delap is only just back in action for Chelsea after two months out.We should not forget that some more versatile forwards have been selected, too. Marcus Rashford, Jarrod Bowen, Phil Foden and Anthony Gordon may not be traditional number nines but they could be asked to play through the middle against Serbia and Albania this week.But still, seeing Kane as the only true striker's name is a stark reminder of how heavily England rely on the 32-year-old as the fulcrum of their attack, with the shortage of other options to lead their line a real worry before next summer's World Cup and, especially, beyond.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kane is England's all-time record goalscorer, with 76 goals in 110 senior appearancesKane has been prolific in the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich this season - but just eight English strikers have appeared in the Premier League in the current campaign and 22-year-old Delap is the only one under the age of 26.Behind Delap, there does not appear to be a new generation waiting for its chance, either.England Under-21s went to last summer's European Championship without a recognised striker and their latest squad includes only one, Manchester City's Divin Mubama, 21, who is yet to score in the Premier League and is currently on loan at Championship side Stoke.So, where have all the English number nines gone, and why is the country not producing traditional strikers anymore?Fewer games, and different systemsThere are some English strikers out there, but when you look at their stats, they are not exactly encouraging.Danny Welbeck, who turns 35 at the end of the month, and 33-year-old Callum Wilson are the only ones who have scored more than one goal in the Premier League this season.Of those under consideration by Tuchel who play further afield, Ivan Toney is the most prolific in the current campaign with 11 goals in 15 games for Saudi Pro League side Al-Ahli, whom he joined in 2024.Tuchel picked the 29-year-old for the games against Andorra and Senegal in June, but Toney only featured as an 88th-minute substitute in the Senegal friendly, and has not made it into another squad since.This shortage of number nines is not down to a sudden drop-off in numbers. Instead it's a trend that has been going on for a while.Last season, just three English strikers - Watkins (16), Delap (12) and Welbeck (10) scored 10 or more Premier League goals, the fewest ever.It's a far cry from the first season of the Premier League era in 1992-93, when 20 English strikers passed the 10-goal mark.In recent years, however, what was already a steep decline has fallen off a cliff. Last season, only 67 goals were scored by English strikers, less than half the number in 2020-21.Kane's departure from Tottenham for Germany has played a part, of course, but he left for Bayern in 2023 and English strikers still scored 96 goals in 2023-24.If anything, this campaign is shaping up to be even worse.So far, English strikers have scored only 11 goals between them - and they are on course for a meagre total of 38 collectively, if they continue at their present rate. That's only four more than Andy Cole and Alan Shearer each scored as they topped the Premier League scoring charts 30 years ago.Cole bagged 34 goals for Newcastle in 1993-94 and Shearer netted the same number for Blackburn the following season - still the record haul for English strikers in the Premier League era, albeit in 42-game seasons.The decline of English strikers is down to several factors according to BBC pundit Chris Sutton, who passed the 10-goal mark himself in four separate Premier League campaigns, including a 25-goal haul with Norwich in 1993-94, and an 18-goal season with Blackburn that saw him take a share of the Golden Boot in 1997-98.One reason is a lack of appearances. From the table above, only Welbeck, Watkins and Calvert-Lewin have started more than three league games this season, while Nketiah, Solanke and Barnes have not started any.\"If you look back at the 1990s, players like Jurgen Klinsmann and Dennis Bergkamp started arriving from abroad but the overall number of foreign strikers was much lower,\" Sutton explained.\"The number one striker of my era was Shearer but if you went through the teams, then there were so many brilliant English centre-forwards like Ian Wright, Les Ferdinand, Andy Cole, Teddy Sheringham, Robbie Fowler and David Hirst - you could add Stan Collymore and Dion Dublin to that list too.\"There was an unbelievable number of them, even before Michael Owen came through ahead of the 1998 World Cup, and all different types of striker too.\"One of the differences is that they were all playing every week, because how many English centre-forwards start for their clubs in the Premier League now? That's down to the quality which the clubs can attract from elsewhere.\"Another change we've seen is in the way teams are set up. I am not saying everyone was a rigid 4-4-2 back in my day, because that's nonsense, but far fewer sides play with two strikers now.\"In other ways, things have gone full circle, because if you look at teams like Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United, then the big number nine is back in fashion. There are plenty of strikers in the Premier League, just not many who are English.\"Did people stop wanting to be a striker?Shearer, who formed the devastating 'SAS' partnership with Sutton to help Blackburn win the Premier League title in 1995, feels the tactical shifts we have seen over the past 10 to 15 years are the biggest reason for the current shortage of strikers.\"Because of the way kids have been training and the coaching they have had, no-one wants to play at centre-forward because you very rarely get a touch,\" the former England captain told The Rest is Football podcast.\"Instead, coaches want a pass from the keeper, a pass to the side, then a pass into midfield... and then it goes back. As a centre-forward you are thinking 'I am not getting involved'.\"I am convinced that is why there is a lack of number nines, particularly in our country.\"Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, The SAS - Shearer And Sutton - partnership that fired Blackburn Rovers to the 1994-95 title scored 49 Premier League goals between them that season, although Shearer did get 34 of themSutton agrees with his old strike partner and, although modern-day wide forwards like Rashford and Bukayo Saka are scoring more goals than old-school wingers ever did, he sees the current situation as \"a massive problem\".\"Alan makes a good point about how everyone wants to mess around on the ball these days,\" Sutton explained. \"Everyone wants to be a creative player off the wide areas, or be a left-footer cutting in off the right wing. Those players can score goals too, but it is very different to having someone who can lead the line.\"Owen, who shared the Premier League Golden Boot with Sutton as an 18-year-old in 1997-98 and won the award outright the following year, feels he would not be considered as a striker if he emerged now.\"In today's game, I think I would have been one of the wide players,\" he told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. \"I don't think I had the stature to occupy two defenders, so I guess I would have played on the left.\"The worry I have for strikers is that I spent my life learning my trade, playing off people. Now, how are we going to reinvent those pairings. I have been waiting and waiting for teams to go back to having two, but will it ever happen?\"Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Owen (number 10) struck up a seemingly telepathic partnership up front with his Liverpool and Three Lions team-mate Emile Heskey (number nine) for club and country. They both scored in England's famous 5-1 win over Germany in 2001, with Owen netting a hat-trick'We've got Kane, but then what?'Playing with two strikers is not an option for Tuchel this week, at least not in the way Owen means.\"Just on numbers alone, the situation is incomparable to the 1990s,\" Sutton added. \"But when you actually list the players we had then, there was unbelievable depth of quality too and a lot of them didn't really get a look in for England.\"Ferdinand only won 17 caps but he was phenomenal. Fowler, who only got a few more, was probably the most natural finisher you could ever see. But they were both behind Shearer because he was like a machine with the way he finished.\"Sutton only won one full cap, coming on as a substitute against Cameroon in November 1997, before falling out with then England boss Glenn Hoddle when he turned down a call-up to the England B team in February 1998.\"I can joke about how I messed things up with Hoddle but nowadays you would be rubbing your hands if you are a half-decent striker with a World Cup coming up,\" he added. \"We have got Kane, but then what?\"If you're an English centre-forward now and you can kick a ball straight, you've got a good chance of going to the World Cup. I feel like dusting my boots off myself.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Harry Kane has been England's number nine since 2015, but who will be next to wear the famous shirt?FootballEngland Men's Football Team",

    "body": "3 hours agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, WashingtonWatch: Republican and Democratic House leaders on ending government shutdownAfter 43 days, the longest US government shutdown in history is coming to an end.Federal workers will start receiving pay again. National Parks will reopen. Government services that had been curtailed or suspended entirely will resume. Air travel, which had become a nightmare for many Americans, will return to being merely frustrating.After the dust settles and the ink from President Donald Trump's signature on the funding bill dries, what has this record-setting shutdown accomplished? And what has it cost?Senate Democrats, through their use of the parliamentary filibuster, were able to trigger the shutdown despite being a minority in the chamber by refusing to go along with a Republican measure to temporarily fund the government.They drew a line in the sand, demanding that the Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year. When a handful of Democrats broke ranks to vote to reopen the government on Sunday, they received next to nothing in return – a promise of a vote in the Senate on the subsidies, but no guarantees of Republican support or even a necessary vote in the House of Representatives.ReutersSince then, members of the party's left flank have been furious. They've accused Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer – who didn't vote for the funding bill – of being secretly complicit in the reopening plan or simply incompetent. They've felt like their party folded even after off-year election success showed they had the upper hand. They feared that the shutdown sacrifices had been for nothing.Even more mainstream Democrats, like California's Governor Gavin Newsom, called the shutdown deal \"pathetic\" and a \"surrender\".\"I'm not coming in to punch anybody in the face,\" he told the Associated Press, \"but I'm not pleased that, in the face of this invasive species that is Donald Trump, who's completely changed the rules of the game, that we're still playing by the old rules of the game.\"Newsom has 2028 presidential ambitions and can be a good barometer for the mood of the party. He was a loyal supporter of Joe Biden who turned out to defend the then-president even after his disastrous June debate performance against Trump.If he is running for the pitchforks, it's not a good sign for Democratic leaders.EPAWatch: Moment House votes to end longest government shutdown in US historyFor Trump, in the days since the Senate deadlock broke on Sunday, his mood has gone from cautious optimism to celebration.On Tuesday, he congratulated congressional Republicans and called the vote to reopen the government \"a very big victory\".\"We're opening up our country,\" he said at a Veteran's Day commemoration at Arlington Cemetery. \"It should have never been closed.\"Trump, perhaps sensing the Democratic anger toward Schumer, joined the pile-on during a Fox News interview on Monday night.\"He thought he could break the Republican Party, and the Republicans broke him,\" Trump said of the Senate Democrat.Although there were times when Trump appeared to be buckling – last week he berated Senate Republicans for refusing to scrap the filibuster to reopen the government – he ultimately emerged from the shutdown having made little in the way of substantive concessions.While his poll numbers have declined over the last 40 days, there's still a year before Republicans have to face voters in the midterms. And, barring some kind of constitutional rewrite, Trump never has to worry about standing for election again.EPADemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was critical of the funding dealWith the end of the shutdown, Congress will get back to its regularly scheduled programming. Although the House of Representatives has effectively been on ice for more than a month, Republicans still hope they can pass some substantive legislation before next year's election cycle kicks in.While several government departments will be funded until September in the shutdown-ending agreement, Congress will have to approve spending for the rest of the government by the end of January to avoid another shutdown.Democrats, licking their wounds, may be hankering for another chance to fight.Meanwhile, the issue they fought over – healthcare subsidies – could become a pressing concern for tens of millions of Americans who will see their insurance costs double or triple at the end of the year. Republicans ignore addressing such voter pain at their own political peril.And that isn't the only peril facing Trump and the Republicans. A day that was supposed to be highlighted by the House government-funding vote was spent dwelling on the latest revelations surrounding the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Later on Wednesday, Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva was sworn in to her congressional seat and became the 218th and final signatory on a petition that will force the House of Representatives to hold a vote ordering the justice department to release all its files on the Epstein case.It was enough to prompt Trump to complain, on his Truth Social website, that his government-funding success was being eclipsed.\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,\" he wrote.It was all a very clear reminder that the best-laid plans and political strategies can be derailed in a flash.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "What we know about new Epstein emails that mention Trump5 hours agoNadine YousifGetty ImagesJeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump (pictured here in 1997) were friends for years, though the US president says he had a falling out with him in the early 2000sUS lawmakers have released more than 20,000 pages of documents from the estate of the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including some that mention President Donald Trump.Early on Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email exchanges, including correspondence between Epstein, who died in 2019 in prison, and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.They also released emails between Epstein and the author Michael Wolff, who has written numerous books about Trump.Within hours, House Republicans released a massive tranche of documents to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to \"cherry-pick\" documents. They also said it was an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" she said.Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.What the Epstein-Maxwell email saysThe first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell. In it, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him\". Epstein goes on to write that Trump \"has never once been mentioned\", including by a \"police chief\".Maxwell responded: \"I have been thinking about that...\"The victim's name was redacted in the email the Democrats released, although the unredacted version is in the tranche released by the committee. That shows the name \"Virginia\". The White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year. In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\". Giuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse. And in a memoir released this year, she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.Asked why the name was originally redacted, Representative Robert Garcia - the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee - said the party will never release names of victims in line with the wishes of the families.What the Epstein-Wolff emails sayIn exchanges with Wolff, the author, Epstein discusses his connection to Trump, who - at the time - was campaigning for the presidency ahead of his first term in office. In a second email exchange released by Democrats, Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, \"either on air or in scrum afterwards\".Epstein responds: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"Wolff writes: \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\"He adds: \"Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"Reuters\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" Wolff said on WednesdayIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump. \"There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?\", Wolff writes to Epstein.A third email released by Democrats is dated January 2019, during Trump's first term in office.  In it, Epstein tells Wolff: \"Trump said he asked me to resign\" apparently referring to his membership at the president's Mar-a-Lago club, adding, he was \"never a member ever\". Epstein adds that \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop\". Responding to the release in a video he posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.Andrew emailed Epstein in 2011As well as Trump, a released document also mentions Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.He responded to an email forwarded by Ghislaine Maxwell via Jeffrey Epstein in March 2011 about alleged sexual activity with a masseuse working for Epstein.Andrew's reply reads: \"Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"Maxwell had forwarded a \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March, making numerous allegations about Maxwell, Epstein, and then-Prince Andrew.The right of reply email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.On 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Guiffre.Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges.White House says Epstein story \"a manufactured hoax\"Peter Mandelson contacted Epstein in 2016Lord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, is also mentioned in the new documents.They show he was in contact with Epstein as late as 2016, according to the documents.The latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.An email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, reads: \"63 years old. You made it\".Lord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".Epstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.Epstein goes on to say \"you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]\", a reference to Lord Mandelson's now-husband Reinaldo Avilda da Silva.Lord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. He declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.What the survivors have saidAnnie Farmer, one of Epstein's accusers and a key witness in Maxwell's sex trafficking trial, shared a statement after the emails were released. In it she said: \"The more information that comes out about Jeffrey Epstein, the more questions we're left with. Survivors deserve more than a trickle of information.\"Farmer demanded the \"full release\" of the so-called Epstein files and said \"the estimated one thousand women and girls who were harmed by Epstein and his associates deserve full transparency\".",

    "body": "'Not an easy job' - why would anyone want to be the new BBC director general?3 hours agoKatie Razzall,culture and media editor and Steven McIntosh,entertainment reporter, with additional reportingBBCDirector general Tim Davie announced his resignation on Sunday after five embattled yearsThe full story of what exactly precipitated the downfall of the BBC's director general and his CEO of News is probably still emerging.But one part of it, to my mind, isn't in question: Tim Davie's explanation that one of his main reasons for resigning was the human toll that five years in the job (and, presumably, particularly the difficult, error-filled past year) have had on him.In his resignation email to staff, he wrote of \"the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times\".On a human level, it's relentless. But there are plenty who - perhaps understandably - have little sympathy for the outgoing DG.They point out that the job is highly remunerated (it is), brings many perks with it (it does) and that there were just too many mistakes on his watch.Every time a story has blown up (most recently, two Gaza documentaries, Bob Vylan at Glastonbury, and now a misleading edit of a presidential speech), I have immediately been messaged by journalists outside the BBC. The question is always the same. \"Surely this time the DG has to go?\"Whatever the arguments over individual crises, we live in a 'hunting for a scalp' media culture.And when it comes to finding Davie's replacement, the words of the BBC chairman Samir Shah have stayed with me.\"This is not an easy job to fill, it really isn't,\" he told staff on Tuesday. \"And I have to be honest, the way we as a country attack people, really personally, is not good. \"Why would somebody want to do this job if that's what they face? We're asking a lot of a director general.\"PA MediaBBC chairman Samir Shah said he has \"cleared the decks\" to \"go full on\" with the succession searchHe's right - and whoever takes on the job next will know the odds aren't great that they will make it through unscathed. Three of the last five permanent DGs have resigned following scandals.One person said to me: \"If that's what it's like, the number of people prepared to do the job won't be many.\"Although all newsrooms make mistakes, when the BBC does, it often results in pressure on its editor-in-chief - the director general.One media executive said to me that the volume of output generated by the BBC makes it impossible for the DG to be across it all, but \"inevitably at any one moment somebody is doing something really stupid\". In the end, those mistakes can sink a DG because they have ultimate responsibility.'Still the biggest job in British broadcasting'Davie was paid about £530,000 a year for his trouble - but that is less than he'd have made heading up a big commercial service.However, for the right candidate, it could equally be an enticing moment to join the BBC as it heads into negotiations with the government over its new royal charter, which will determine its future. \"It's a difficult time to be leading the BBC, but it's also an exciting time,\" says Deadline's international TV editor Max Goldbart, who has been reporting on the corporation's crises this week.\"The charter renewal is about to happen, criticism is coming from all fronts, but if you're able to push through this then you could be seen as the person who led the BBC through difficult times in the modern streaming era.\"Goldbart says it is still \"the biggest job in British broadcasting\".\"It remains an influential position which has a lot of prestige attached to it... although that prestige has probably dropped over the last five years.\"ReutersGoldbart thinks there will be people who are up for the fight.Of course that's right. But the pool of people with the right combination of skills is actually more of a small puddle.The role calls for experience in creative leadership, a tight grip on editorial issues, knowledge of running a large administration, political nous, experience of commercial affairs, and a grasp of the global media perspective.There aren't many people (if any) who tick every box - which is why some people feel the job is now too big for one person to take on. There have even been calls for it to be split.Inside the BBC, some are saying there could be one leader in charge of programming and strategy, and a separate editor-in-chief or deputy director general responsible for news and current affairs.Giving someone else responsibility for news and current affairs, which is where many of the recent BBC scandals originated, could significantly help a director general's chances of survival.However, my sense is that the BBC only works with one person at the very top with final oversight.Who could be the new BBC director general?Getty ImagesApple Europe's creative director Jay Hunt (pictured in May with Tom Cruise) could be one of the frontrunnersJay Hunt - The former BBC One controller has also worked as Channel 4's chief creative officer and director of programmes at channel 5, and is currently creative director for Apple in EuropeAlex Mahon - Recently left her role as CEO of Channel 4 to become chief executive of Superstruct EntertainmentCharlotte Moore - The BBC's former head of content left the corporation earlier this year to become chief executive of production company Left Bank PicturesDame Carolyn McCall - Formerly the chief executive of EasyJet, now the chief exec of ITVKate Phillips - The BBC's current chief content officer makes her the likely internal frontrunnerAnne Mensah - Has worked at the BBC and Sky and is currently Netflix's vice president of contentSir Mark Thompson - Could the BBC DG from 2004 to 2012, who has since taken on tough challenges in the US as boss of the New York Times and CNN, return?Other possible candidates include BBC Studios chief Tom Fussell, All3Media CEO Jane Turton, RTE's director general Kevin Bakhurst, Sky CEO Dana Strong and Channel 4's chief content officer Ian Katz.Ex-BBC head of news James Harding, former ITV chairman Sir Peter Bazalgette, Washington Post CEO Will Lewis, TV presenter and executive Sir Trevor Phillips and broadcaster Andrew Neil have also been suggested. BBC presenters Nick Robinson and Amol Rajan have even been mentioned.Additional reporting by Ian Youngs.",

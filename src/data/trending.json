    "body": "7 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBCPat will return when Nigel's \"memories and altered reality take him back to the 1990s\"EastEnders favourite Pat Evans, formerly Pat Butcher, is to return to the BBC soap for a one-off comeback episode over the Christmas period.The character, played by Pam St Clement, was beloved by viewers for more than 25 years for her no-nonsense personality and memorable taste in earrings.Pat died in 2012, but was later seen on-screen again with Dame Barbara Windsor, when she returned as a figment of the dying Peggy's imagination in 2016.She will now similarly come back, acting alongside Paul Bradley as Nigel, whose memories take him back to the 90s, as part of a storyline about his dementia next month. 'Coming home'\"I was both surprised and excited to be asked back to tread the streets of Walford once again and to be involved in Nigel's touching dementia storyline,\" St Clement, 83, said.\"It was lovely to be welcomed back by those with whom I had worked for so long. It was just like coming home.\"Pat returns to help Nigel when his dementia symptoms intensify, following an emotional evening at his festive film screening.St Clement first appeared in EastEnders in 1986 and was at the heart of the drama in Albert Square until her character's death.EastEnders executive producer Ben Wadey said: \"It's an honour and a privilege to welcome Pam St Clement back to EastEnders for a special episode in Nigel's ongoing dementia storyline.\"Pat Evans is one of the most cherished and iconic characters to have graced the streets of Walford, and I know I speak on behalf of everyone when I say what a delight it was to see Pat and Pam back in The Queen Vic, as she helps Nigel in his time of need.\"Pat is one of a number of classic characters who have made a return to Walford.Anita Dobson's Queen Vic landlady Angie Watts made a surprise return to visit her daughter Sharon, as she drifted in and out of consciousness in the show's 40th anniversary episode in February.Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins) and Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) are back in the Square, while Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) made recent short-term comebacks.",

    "body": "9 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondent, BBC NewsVictoria Gill/BBC NewsMy own dog seems a long way from a wild wolfIf you, like me, have a spoiled, lazy dog that enjoys cheese flavoured treats, the fact that your pet's ancestors were wild predators can seem unfathomable.But a major new study suggests their physical transformation from wolf to sofa-hogging furball began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than we previously thought.\"When you see a Chihuahua - it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified,\" says Dr Allowen Evin from the University of Montpellier, a lead researcher on this study.She and her colleagues discovered that the transformation of our pets championed by the Victorians through selective breeding actually started more than 10,000 years ago.C AmeenThe researchers studied more than 600 skulls that spanned 50,000 years of dog and wolf evolutionIn a paper published in the journal Science, this international team of researchers focused their attention on prehistoric canine skulls. Over more than a decade, they collected, examined and scanned bones that spanned a period of 50,000 years of dog evolution.They created digital 3D models of each of the more than 600 skulls they examined - and compared specific features across ancient and modern dogs - and their wild relatives.This revealed that, nearly 11,000 years ago, just after the last ice age, dog skulls started to change shape. While there were still slender, wolf-like dogs, there were also many with shorter snouts and wider, stockier heads.Dr Carly Ameen from the University of Exeter, another lead researcher on this project, explained to BBC News that almost half of the diversity we see in modern dog breeds today was already present in dog populations by the middle of the Stone Age.\"It's really surprising,\" she said. \"And it starts to challenge the ideas about whether or not it was the Victorians -  and their kennel clubs - that drove this.\"C Brassard (VetAgro Sup/Mecadev)The researchers produced digital scans of each of the skulls they studied. The pink skull on the left in this image is a modern dog with a shorter snout and the green image on the right is a scan of a wolf skull. Domestication: An ancient mysteryDogs were the first animals to be domesticated. There is evidence that humans have been living closely with canines for at least 30,000 years. Where and why that close association began remains a puzzle.This study has revealed some of the earliest physical evidence of dogs transforming into the diverse array of pets, companions and working animals that we know today. And the researchers' digital scans of the skulls that they studied will allow them to answer more questions about the evolutionary driving forces behind domestication.Some researchers have suggested that humans and wolves came together almost by accident, when wolves moved to the outskirts of hunter-gatherer communities to scavenge for food.Tamer wolves would get more food, and the humans gradually came to rely on the wolves to clean up remains of messy carcasses and to raise the alarm if a predator came near.As to why that ultimately changed dogs' physical appearance, Dr Ameen said there were likely to be a number of reasons. She did not rule our ancestors preference for boxy heads and cute, snub noses but she explained: \"It's likely to be a combination of interaction with humans, adapting to different environments, adapting to different types food - all contributing to the kind of explosion of variation that we see.\"It's hard to untangle which of those might be the most important one.\"For tens of thousands of years, our human story and that of our dogs has been entangled. In another paper in this same edition of the journal Science, a research group led by scientists in China studied ancient DNA from dogs that lived between 9,700 and 870 years ago - at sites across Siberia, the Central Eurasian Steppe, and northwest China.They concluded that the movement of domestic dogs across that region often coincided with migrations of people - hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. So our dogs have travelled alongside us - and been integrated into our societies - for thousands of years.I can't say that my own stubborn, disobedient terrier provides me with any of the benefits that the first domesticated wolves bestowed on our ancestors. But I can see why, as research suggests, once a dog showed up for some leftovers, there was no going back.",

    "body": "53 minutes agoAbhishek DeyBBC News, DelhiGetty ImagesNarendra Modi's party has never managed to form a government on its own in Bihar state Votes are being counted in the eastern Indian state of Bihar where Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to return to power with its alliance partner. The election was held in two phases on 6 and 11 November and the state witnessed a record voter turnout of 66.91% - the highest since Bihar's first elections in 1951, India's Election Commission (EC) said. Several exit polls predict a victory for the BJP's alliance, although such polls have been wrong in the past. The election was conducted after a controversial revision of electoral rolls that the opposition alleged would exclude genuine voters and give Modi's party an edge - a charge both the BJP and EC deny.The counting of votes began at 08:00 local time (02:30 GMT) on Friday.Trends are expected to become clear by noon local time, although the counting will finish only by evening. The Bihar polls serve as a precursor to several other key state state elections next year in West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where the BJP is not in power and has struggled to make inroads. Bihar, with more than 74 million voters, is India's poorest state, with millions migrating to other parts of India for jobs. It is also among the few states in India where Modi's party has not managed to form a government yet on its own. The outgoing government is an alliance between the BJP and the Janata Dal (United). Both the parties contested the recent election together, while India's main opposition Congress party tied up with the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and several smaller parties.The polls also witnessed the entry of a new political party led by Prashant Kishor, a former political consultant who has in the past worked with both the BJP and the Congress.Getty ImagesQueues formed outside some poling stations as voters arrived with their voter ID card ready to make their mark on democracy in the stateThis election was closely watched because it could be the last one to see active participation from two regional stalwarts - JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar and RJD's Lalu Prasad Yadav - who have shaped Bihar's politics for almost four decades.The political rivals, both in their 70s, are said to be in poor health. They have on occasion joined hands to stay in power.Kumar, who is Bihar's incumbent chief minister, is one of the state's most influential leaders and has led the government for most of the past two decades. Yadav is currently out on bail after being convicted in corruption cases. His son Tejashwi has been projected as the chief ministerial candidate for the opposition alliance.Getty ImagesAnalysts say female voters are expected to play a key role in the Bihar electionsNearly half of the voters are women, and the state - which has seen a steady increase in female voters over the years - recorded its highest female voter turnout in history at 71.6% this year.Both alliances have offered financial assistance schemes to woo women.The election was conducted after a controversial voter list revision carried out by India's Election Commission a few months ago. The commission released a list of 74.2 million voters in September, weeding out 4.7 million names.The exercise - which is now taking place in 12 states and federally administered territories across India - was sharply criticised by the opposition.They accused the commission of dropping many voters, especially Muslims, to aid Modi's party. Both the BJP and the Election Commission have denied such allegations.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterReuters / AFP via Getty ImagesThe BBC has apologised to US President Donald Trump for a Panorama episode that spliced parts of his 6 January 2021 speech together, but rejected his demands for compensation.The corporation said the edit had given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not show the 2024 programme again.Lawyers for Trump have threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn (£759m) in damages unless the corporation issues a retraction, apologises and compensates him.The fallout from the scandal led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness on Sunday.BBC News has approached the White House for comment.The apology comes hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" it said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to President Trump's legal team in response to a letter received on Sunday, a BBC spokesperson said.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"Why is Donald Trump threatening to sue the BBC?Trump vs the BBC: What hurdles might the president's legal argument face?In Trump's speech he said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Speaking to Fox News, Trump said his speech had been \"butchered\" and the way it was presented had \"defrauded\" viewers.The BBC received the letter from Trump's lawyers on Sunday. It demands a \"full and fair retraction\" of the documentary, an apology, and that the BBC \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused\".It set a deadline of 22:00 GMT (17:00 EST) on Friday for the corporation to respond.Watch: How the BBC works... in under two minutesIn its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC sets out five main arguments for why it does not think it has a case to answerFirst it says the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it says the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it says the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it says the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.A BBC insider said that internally, there is a strong belief in the case the corporation has put forward, and in its defence.Fresh claim of misleading editEarlier on Thursday, the BBC was accused of another misleading edit of Trump's 6 January 2021 speech, two years before the Panorama sequence aired.On a Newsnight programme from 2022, the edit is a little different from Panorama.Trump is shown as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol. And we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.\"This was followed by a voiceover from presenter Kirsty Wark saying \"and fight they did\" over footage from the Capitol riots.Responding to the clip on the same programme, former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who quit a diplomatic post and became a critic of Trump after describing the 6 January riots as an \"attempted coup\", said the video had \"spliced together\" Trump's speech.\"That line about 'we fight and fight like hell' is actually later in the speech and yet your video makes it look like those two things came together,\" he said.In response to Thursday's story in the Telegraph, a BBC spokesperson said the BBC holds itself to the \"highest editorial standards\" and the matter was being looked into.A spokesman for Trump's legal team told the Telegraph it was \"now clear that BBC engaged in a pattern of defamation against President Trump\".Concerns over the Trump Panorama documentary emerged when a leaked internal memo, written by a former independent external adviser to the corporation's editorial standards committee, was published by the Telegraph newspaper. Among other things, the document also criticised the BBC's reporting of trans issues, and BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.",

    "body": "3 hours agoEmily HoltRebecca MiddletonWhen Rebecca Middleton became pregnant, she had no idea that she would end up in a wheelchair for the final three months before she gave birth. Rebecca had had a difficult first trimester dealing with nausea and sickness, and began to develop pelvic pain four months into her pregnancy. \"I could hardly walk, I'd always had some problems with lower back pain in my life. But nothing that significant and it escalated quite quickly,\" she says. After complaining about the pain, she was referred to an NHS physio, and eventually diagnosed with an extreme case of pelvic girdle pain (PGP), also known as symphysis pubic dysfunction.Problems with your pelvic joints are a common symptom of pregnancy, affecting one in five expectant mothers to some degree.\"I was terrified, would I ever walk again? How would I have my baby, how would I care for it?\"Rebecca MiddletonRebecca now helps raise awareness of the issueAfter giving birth, Rebecca was in less pain, but she still struggled with basic things like walking, lifting her son or pushing a pram. \"I was disabled for seven months and had to have someone helping me all the time,\" she says. \"I just couldn't do the things that you should be able to do in looking after a baby, it was a really challenging time.\"Prior to becoming pregnant, it was an issue Rebecca was unaware of and since her experience she volunteers for The Pelvic Partnership, a charity which helps raise awareness and support women with this condition.It says the condition is treatable with the right action. As soon as your symptoms start, the charity advises you get hands-on individualised treatment, including manual therapy, and ask for a referral for NHS physiotherapy from your GP or midwife.If you aren't offered this support initially, the charity suggests going back to your GP or midwife and asking for a second opinion.They can also refer you to maternal mental health support to help you manage the emotional impacts of living with PGP.Dr Nighat Arif, a women's health specialist, says higher awareness and early assessment could prevent patients like Rebecca needing wheelchairs or crutches.\"Without that early identification based on a really good understanding of the female body, we leave some of these women with negative effects for life,\" she says.Gynaecologist Dr Christine Ekechi says the lack of research around the condition means it is less likely to be identified and suitably treated, particularly post birth.\"We don't necessarily see them unless they then come back into a gynaecology clinic presenting with pain.\"So we don't have a great understanding as to the proportion of women that have persisting pain that has started off during pregnancy.\"Victoria RobertonVictoria says her second pregnancy was much easier to manageVictoria Roberton, co-ordinator at the Pelvic Partnership, is an example of how awareness can help. Like Rebecca, she didn't know what PGP was when she began experiencing the condition during her first pregnancy. She tried to stay as active as possible as advised and was referred to NHS physio sessions online and by phone, but found the pain worsening as her pregnancy progressed. \"They gave us exercises, stretches to do. By this point I couldn't do any of them. It was too painful,\" she says. It got to the point where even sitting became uncomfortable for Victoria, and she was largely homebound until her baby was born. The pain lessened after the birth of her daughter, but she began experiencing the same problem when she became pregnant with her second child. It's not an option for many mothers, but Victoria said given her medical history she decided to pay for a private physio as the NHS wait for referral was long.The physio gave her a full assessment and hands-on treatment including joint mobilisation, and taught her different ways to move her body to not aggravate her hip joints, which helped ease the pain. Victoria still struggles with a degree of PGP today, four years on, but her second pregnancy was much easier to manage because she understood her condition and how to handle it.   Rebecca's second pregnancy has been similarly a much more positive experience. This time round she knew she was at risk of PGP and was able to have it treated throughout her pregnancy before it became debilitating.She has made a full recovery from PGP, just two months post birth compared to  two years for her first child. \"I'm probably in better shape now than I was before either of my children because I now know what caused that pelvic girdle pain, and have had it fully treated and resolved with manual therapy,\" she says.  \"It was five years of hell because of the pain I was in because of a lack of knowledge and understanding about the subject.\"  Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "6 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlin correspondentGermany's coalition government has agreed a new military service plan to boost troop numbers following months of wrangling between political forces.The new military service plan will mandate all 18-year-old men to fill out a questionnaire on their suitability to serve and, from 2027, to undergo medical screening.The decision comes as Berlin aims to create Europe's strongest conventional army.The boss of Germany's biggest defence firm, Rheinmetall, has told the BBC he believes that target could be met in five years.Lawmakers are expected to vote on the plan by the end of 2025. Armin Papperger said Chancellor Friedrich Merz's aim to boost the Bundeswehr was \"realistic\" and he told the BBC that \"clear decisions\" were coming from government.Earlier this year German defence chief Gen Carsten Breuer warned that the Western Nato alliance had to prepare for a possible Russian attack within four years.Mr Papperger said he had \"no glass ball\" about the future but agreed Germany had to be \"ready in '29\".When they formed a coalition earlier this year, Merz's conservative CDU/CSU and the centre-left Social Democrat SPD agreed to re-introduce military service which would be voluntary \"to start with\".The Bundeswehr currently has around 182,000 troops. The new military service model aims to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year, rising to between 255,000 and 260,000 over the next 10 years, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists.From next year, all 18-year-old men and women will be sent a questionnaire to assess their interest and willingness to join the armed forces. It will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.From July 2027 all men aged 18 will also have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for duty.If the government's targets are not met, a form of compulsory enlistment could be considered by parliament. If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.Some within Germany's political left remain deeply opposed to mandatory service.Many young Germans are wary and a significant majority oppose it. A recent Forsa survey for Stern magazine suggested while just over half of respondents favoured compulsory service, opposition rose to 63% among 18- to 29-year-olds.\"I don't want to go to war because I don't want to die or I don't want to be shot at,\" said Jimi, a 17-year-old student from Berlin, who attended an anti-conscription protest outside the Bundestag earlier this week. \"I also don't want to shoot people.\"An attack against Germany was an \"unlikely and abstract scenario\" that the government was using to legitimise \"stealing millions of young people's right to decide what they should be doing\", he said.Meanwhile, 21-year-old Jason signed up as new Bundeswehr recruit earlier this year because of the current \"security situation\".\"I wanted to contribute to defend peace, to defend democracy if the worst happens,\" he said. By joining up he felt he was \"giving back to society\" but also believed in the deterrent potential of the army, \"so potential enemies don't even think about attacking you\".Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has sought to reassure Germans, saying that despite the new military service plan there was \"no cause for concern... no reason for fear\".\"The more capable of deterrence and defence our armed forces are, through armament through training and through personnel, the less likely it is that we will become a party to a conflict at all,\" Pistorius said.Defence spending in Germany tumbled after the end of the Cold War, while conscription was suspended in 2011.Given its past, Germany has long been shy of showing military might, but earlier this year Friedrich Merz announced that the rule for German defence \"now has to be whatever it takes\", following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Nato countries across Europe have come under pressure from President Donald Trump's White House to hike spending.European moves to re-arm have meant significant revenue for Rheinmetall. Its CEO, Armin Papperger, whose firm also supplies Ukraine, said: \"We make a lot of money because there is a huge demand.\"\"We have to grow strong on vehicles, on ammunition, we have to have our own satellite competencies. We do much more on the electronics and artificial intelligence... than ever before,\" he said.A US report last year suggested the Rheinmetall boss had been the target of a Russian assassination plot. There was no confirmation at the time and Mr Papperger would not be drawn on the report, saying: \"I feel good, I feel safe.\"Asked about whether he felt Europe was in a state of a cold or hybrid war, he said: \"Whatever you call it, it's not a peaceful time.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporter and Harry Farley,Political correspondentMembers of the House of Lords have put forward more than 900 proposed changes to the law to deliver assisted dying, ahead of a debate on Friday.Experts believe the number of amendments, which is understood to be 942, is  unprecedented, but opponents say significant alterations are needed to ensure any scheme can operate safely.The volume of amendments has sparked a letter from 65 supportive peers to their colleagues in the Lords, raising concern about possible delaying tactics.Those opposing the bill have been urged not to \"frustrate\" the passage of the legislation, which has already gained the approval of MPs. The House of Commons passed the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill in June, and it passed its first stage in the Lords in September.The required line-by-line examination of the bill that follows was delayed, following an amendment by Labour's Baroness Berger to allow a committee of peers to scrutinise the legislation further.Parliament heard officials worked into the early hours of Thursday morning to compile the suggested changes to the bill that flooded in ahead of the next scrutiny stage, known as committee stage, which begins on Friday. There appear to be seven opponents to the bill who have submitted 579 amendments between them.According to the parliamentary authorities, while some bills have had more amendments tabled in total at committee stage, it sets a possible record for the number submitted in the first full list of suggested changes.They say it is almost certainly unprecedented for the committee stage of this type of bill, known as a private member's bill, which has been put forward by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater rather than the government.Experts including Matthew England, a researcher at the Hansard Society, said the number of amendments \"does appear to be a record, at least in the recent past\".Others drew comparisons to the bill to take the UK out of the European Union, which had 820 amendments in total. A peer in favour of the legislation told the BBC that the number of amendments \"looks like a delaying tactic to me... It's obviously not a coincidence.\"Defending the volume of amendments,  Baroness Luciana Berger, who opposes assisted dying, told the BBC that evidence to the select committee \"strongly refuted any suggestion this bill is either safe or workable\".\"This bill is full of holes which vulnerable people will fall through and be harmed if peers don't act to change and amend it,\" she added.However, signatories to the letter highlighted how the bill had \"already undergone unprecedented scrutiny\" and \"offers dying people the choice of a safe, dignified end while strengthening protections for the vulnerable\".Former Royal College of Nursing president Baroness Rafferty was among the 65 peers to have signed, and she was joined by scientist and broadcaster Lord Winston, former Labour leader Lord Kinnock and former Whitehall chief Lord O'Donnell.They urged opponents to focus on refining the bill to find where \"genuine improvements can be made, while respecting both the will of the Commons and the overwhelming support of the public\".In response to the letter, a source close to peers who are concerned about the bill said: \"This letter is making claims directly contradicted by the evidence provided in the last few weeks at the Lords select committee by the royal colleges, professionals and independent statutory bodies. \"Evidence and facts are vital when crafting good legislation.\"The bill is being treated by parties as a matter of conscience, meaning they will not instruct their MPs or peers how to vote. The bill will become law in England and Wales only if both the House of Commons and House of Lords agree on the final drafting of the legislation - with approval needed before spring next year, when the current session of Parliament ends.If it does pass into law, the government has four years in which to get an assisted dying service into place, meaning it could be 2029/30 before the first assisted death happens.The legislation proposes allowing terminally ill adults with fewer than six months to live to apply for an assisted death.This would be subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, a senior legal figure and a psychiatrist.

    "body": "TikTok award winner Max: 'It takes me hours to make the content you scroll on the toilet'3 hours agoYasmin RufoMagazine LondonGetty ImagesMax Klymenko took home the coveted prize of creator of the yearA transport enthusiast, a beauty advocate and a mum teaching people how to raise an autistic child were among the winners of the second annual TikTok awards. Hosted by TV presenter Aj Odudu at Magazine London, awards were handed out in  12 categories including fashion, travel, food and education. And taking home the coveted prize of creator of the year was Max Klymenko, who is best known for his career ladder series, which he says is the most popular non-animated show in the world.In case you've not seen it, Max sets up his stepladder in various public spaces and invites passers-by to join him standing on the ladder while he tries to guess their career with a series of yes/no questions. Max came to the UK from Ukraine 14 years ago and said the reason he started creating content was because he found it impossible to get a job to get his own career going. \"I had a lot of anxiety and stress around finding a job so I created videos helping people know what jobs were available to them.\" Gold ladder in hand, Max, who has 8.5 million followers on TikTok, dedicated his award to his grandma in Ukraine who \"has no electricity to follow along\". \"I'm calling her right after this,\" he said, explaining that she used to log-in from different TikTok accounts when he first started creating content so it looked like he had more views. The 29-year-old, who accepted his award from last year's winner Kyra-Mae Turner added that he was grateful his content was being recognised because \"everything you see when you scroll on the toilet or in bed takes hours to make\".The nominees have a combined follower count of more than 83 million and the winners were voted for by five million people on the app. Winning the award for video of the year was Bemi Orojuogun, better known as bus aunty. Often seen smiling silently on TikToks as she stands at the side of a road or a depot – while a passing double-decker appears to narrowly miss hitting her – Orojuogun has turned her lifelong love of the London's transport network into a viral celebration of city life.Getty ImagesBemi thanked Transport for London, Stormzy and god for her award tonight Her winning video has been viewed almost 50 million times and she now has collaborations with Burberry and Ikea.The mental health nurse has become one of TikTok's most unexpected success stories and she admitted: \"It's slightly overwhelming that everyone recognises me,\" but said is she is proud of what she's achieved.She thanked Transport for London and Stormzy, saying that he propelled her to fame after re-posting one of her videos. The 56-year-old grandma had a wonderful night making friends - including Nikki Lilly, the winner of the fashion and beauty creator of the year.Nikki, who has 10 million TikTok followers, told the BBC that fashion, beauty and lifestyle content can be seen as \"skin deep\" but her content challenges those perceptions. \"I don't want to only make my social media a highlights reel,\" the 21-year-old said. \"It's also me having surgeries, a chronic illness and me having a facial difference.\"Third wheeling a new friendship... Bemi and Nikki have found a best friend in each other After being diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation, a rare life-threatening medical condition, at age six, she has used her platform to raise awareness and inspire others.\"As someone with a facial condition, I've never felt fully embraced in this space,\" she said while accepting her award. But she added, she has now found \"so much safety\" in the TikTok beauty world. Another advocate creator is Tola and Kevin who won the \"voice for change\" award. Getty ImagesTola's content about raising an autistic child has seen her build up a global following Tola and Kevin are a mother-son duo behind an account that posts candid videos of what it's like to raise a young adult with autism, striving to create content that raises awareness and promotes acceptance.In tears, Tola said she was so grateful for the award and explained she started the account because she felt isolated when her son was first diagnosed with autism 16 years ago.She's since built an \"amazing community who love and support Kevin\" which has helped the both of them immensely. One of the most recognisable winners of the night was Charley Marlowe, a Radio 1 presenter, who won entertainment creator of the year. Getty ImagesCharley's celebrity interviews and presenting work earned her the award for entertainment creator of the year If you don't know her, you're likely to know her famous cackle which has become her trademark. On the red carpet earlier in the night she told me \"Win or lose, we're on the booze, so I'm having a good night anyway.\" She was in shock to have won the award and dedicated it to \"every northern, working-class diva.\" Full list of winnersCreator of the year - Max KlymenkoEntertainment creator of the year - Charley MarloweFood creator of the year - Kieran MonlouisSport creator of the year - Lissie MackintoshFashion and beauty creator of the year - Nikki LillyTravel creator of the year -  Phil CarrBooks & learning creator of the year - Gabriel AstorgaVoice for change creator of the year - Tola and KevinStoryteller of the year - Morgan M James Rising star creator of the year - Joy AnokwuruVideo of the year award - Bemi OrojuogunArtist of the year - Olivia Dean",

    "body": "Amber warnings have been issued by the Met Office as Storm Claudia is forecast to bring heavy and persistent rain to parts of the United Kingdom.Through Friday, rain will spread across large parts of England and Wales with a larger yellow severe weather warning also issued.There will be some flooding and difficult travelling conditions with a strong easterly wind also developing through the day.The warnings come after recent rain and flooding has already affected many areas such as south Wales last week.Storm Claudia - named by the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) - has already brought heavy rain and strong winds to Spain and Portugal.But rain associated with this storm will spread quickly north across England and Wales during Friday where it will stall and become persistent for most of the day.Met Office Amber warnings have been issued for parts of south-east Wales from 12:00 to 23:59 GMT where up to 150mm of rain - nearly 6 inches - is possible over high ground.An additional amber warning will also come in to effect for the same time across parts of east Wales, the Midlands and towards eastern England.Widely 50-75mm (2-2.9in) of rain is expected throughout Friday with some places seeing up to 80mm (3in).Difficult driving conditions and transport disruption is likely. With flood warnings in place in some parts of the country already, Ben Lukey, Flood Duty Manager at the Environment Agency, said:\"Storm Claudia will bring heavy prolonged rainfall across parts of England, with significant surface water flooding probable across parts of central England on Friday, while significant river flooding impacts are also possible, and into Saturday.\"A larger Met Office yellow severe weather warning has been issued elsewhere across England and Wales that will come into force from 06:00 GMT Friday, lasting through until Saturday at 06:00 GMT.Around 30-50mm (1.2-2.9in) of rain is expected quite widely which may also bring some localised flooding and transport disruption.Strong south-easterly winds will accompany the rain.Additional yellow warnings for the wind have been issued for the far north-west of Wales and the Pennines.Gusts up to 50-70mph (80-113km/h) could bring some minor damage and disruption.While a typical named storm in the UK might sweep in from the North Atlantic bringing strong and damaging winds,  Storm Claudia is more notable for the rainfall.Named by AEMET earlier this week for the impacts it has brought to Spain, the storm is moving up the western side of Portugal and France and approaching the UK from the south-west.And while it will turn quite windy with gusts up to 70mph (113km/h) in north-west Wales and the Pennines, the winds are not the most notable feature of this storm.Once a meteorological agency takes the decision to name a storm, there is agreement that all nations use the same name to allow consistency and clearer communication of the impacts.Claudia will not replace Bram in the list of the UK's named storms. So we can still expect the next weather event deemed serious enough to be named by either the Met office, Met Eirean in Ireland or KNMI in the Netherlands to be Bram.Rain has featured a lot so far this November with some areas seeing over their November average in the first thirteen days.Shap and Carlisle in Cumbria for example have recorded more than their November rainfall already; 226mm and 95mm compared to the averages of 205mm and 85mm respectively.Other sites on higher ground such as Honister in the Lake District has recorded over 500mm of rain.Bannau Brycheiniog - known as the Brecon Beacons - in south Wales, has also been particularly wet with many Natural Resources Wales rainfall stations recording over 200mm of rain so far.The heavy rainfall in south Wales has also led to some significant flooding.A business owner who had to close his shop in Carmarthen due to the floods described it as \"the worst in living memory\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoAmy Walker and Tom SymondsPolice and crime commissioners (PCC) are to be scrapped in England and Wales to save £100m over this parliament's term, the government has said.The home secretary called the system a \"failed experiment\" - and less than 20% of voters can name their PCC, the Home Office said.There are 37 elected commissioners under the current system, introduced 12 years ago to improve police accountability. Their main responsibilities include setting an annual budget, appointing chief constables and producing a policing plan.One PCC described the move as \"deeply\" disappointing, and the shadow home secretary said the government was \"tinkering around the edges\" while \"failing on crime and policing\".When the commissioners' terms end in 2028 the role will move to an elected mayor or to council leaders. Scrapping the role would allow for an extra £20m of investment in front-line policing every year, the Home Office said, enough for 320 constables.Though its stated aim was to make forces more accountable to the areas they serve, the costs of the system and the effectiveness of commissioners has long been criticised.Policing minister Sarah Jones told the Commons on Thursday that the model had \"failed to live up to expectations\" and \"not delivered what it was set up to achieve\".\"Public understanding [of PCCs' role] remains low despite efforts to raise their profiles,\" she added.Jones said PCCs had sought to provide strong oversight and tackle crime but the model \"weakened local police accountability and has had perverse impacts on the recruitment of chief constables.\"With no elected mayors in Wales, Jones said the UK government would \"work with the Welsh government...recognising the unique nature of Welsh arrangements\".Under the changes, measures to cut crime would be \"considered as part of wider public services\", including education and healthcare. The government would ensure support services for victims and witnesses currently provided by PCCs would continue, the Home Office said.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the introduction of new reforms would make police accountable to their local mayoralties or councils.But, scrapping PCC's \"represents a tinkering around the edges from a government which is failing on crime and policing\", shadow home secretary Chris Philp said.He cited rises in crimes including shoplifting, as well as warnings from police forces of cuts to front line staffing due to funding shortfalls.Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Max Wilkinson called it a \"huge\" win for the party, which has called for PCCs to be scrapped for years.But he added giving their powers to mayors \"who have dubious democratic mandates and little scrutiny\" was not the way to bring the \"failed Conservative experiment\" to an end.PCCs were \"deeply disappointed by this decision and the lack of engagement with us\", the PCC for Merseyside and chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners Emily Spurrell said.She argued that the role had \"improved scrutiny and transparency, ensuring policing delivers on the issues that matter most to local communities\".\"Abolishing PCCs now, without any consultation, as policing faces a crisis of public trust and confidence... risks creating a dangerous accountability vacuum,\" she said.The Police Federation of England and Wales welcomed the announcement. Chairwoman Tiff Lynch said the \"tens of millions of pounds\" PCCs cost should instead be used to fund the police service \"with experienced police officers who can afford to keep doing the job\".The Home Office has said that the last elections for police and crime commissioners in 2024 cost at least £87m, making up a significant portion of the savings expected by scrapping the 37 roles.The costs have not yet been finalised, a spokesperson said.Policing Minister Sarah Jones told the Commons this money would be returned to the Treasury, whereas the cost of running the offices of the commissioners themselves will be retained by the Home Office and invested in policing.Home Office said this would enable £20m to be reinvested every year during this parliament, enough to fund 320 new police officers.",

In that time he has suffered countless seizures and endured 17 operations, while his parents have had to give up their jobs to care for him full-time. Now his mother Kirsty Grandison, 35, is charting their experience on TikTok in a bid to help other parents of sick children in hospital. \"We used to feel like we were the only parent's going through this,\" she said\"There was no-one online making videos where we could go for advice, so I started making videos to show life in hospital in a bid to help other people.\"Her TikTok page has 34,000 followers and receives up to 40 private messages a day.Chris Watt PhotographyKobi has had 17 operations and has spent most of his life in hospitalKobi was born 10 weeks prematurely at the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh on 17 July 2024. Despite weighing just 3lb 3oz, his parents initially thought he was doing well.However, that night doctors \"came pouring\" into his hospital room in Edinburgh as his tiny lung had collapsed and he had stopped breathing. Then Kirsty, 35, and her partner Daniel Crolla, 38, received the news \"that changed everything\" - Kobi had had a grade four brain bleed, the most severe kind.They were told he would not have any quality of life and they should prepare for the worst and call their family to say their goodbyes.Against all odds, Kobi pulled through and eight \"agonising\" days later, they finally got their first cuddle with their son, which felt like a \"miracle\".But his parents said his \"battles kept coming\" with Kobi developing meningitis and each day bringing a new fear with blood transfusions, lumbar punctures and scans.Chris Watt PhotographyKobi has been diagnosed with hydrocephalus that causes a dangerous build-up of fluid on the brain\"He was having up to 10 seizures a day. We were always panicked, always so scared for him. We still are,\" said Kirsty.Kobi was diagnosed with hydrocephalus that causes a dangerous build-up of fluid on the brain. The only option was brain surgery, to install a shunt to allow fluid to be drained from the brain - since then, Kobi has endured 16 surgeries. \"That's 16 times we've handed him over, not knowing if he'd come back,\" Kirsty said.Both Daniel, a bus driver, and Kirsty, a carer, have given up their jobs to care full-time for their son.And Kirsty is using her TikTok page - Kobi The Brave - to give followers a glimpse into the reality of life in a sick kids' unit. She shows where she buys specially-adapted vests to fit around his feeding tube, how to clean his feeding peg, showing them medicines and setting up Kobi's feeding pump and changing his bed.\"I get messages from other parents in neonatal saying my videos are getting them through and how it's making them not give up hope because they have seen how far Kobi has come from my videos and how well he does despite what he's been through,\" Kirsty said.\"I want to take all these followers on this journey as I know how many it can help.\"Chris Watt PhotographyKobi was born on 17 July 2024 - 10 weeks before his due date of 28 SeptemberKirsty said caring for Kobi was the \"greatest privilege in the world\" but it was exhausting, relentless and a lonely journey.She plans to continue documenting Kobi's story in a bid to help other parents know there are other people going through a similar experience.\"We don't remember the last time we felt at ease, content,\" Kirsty said.\"We used to have little bits of ourselves outside all this - football, the gym. Now, we go days without having a shower. Sometimes, you wish someone would ask, 'But how are you?'\"Kirsty and her two children from a previous relationship live in Prestonpans, East Lothian, with Daniel, who has three children.They take it in turns to stay in the hospital with Kobi day and night.\"We've grieved the life we thought we'd have with Kobi,\" Kirsty said.\"It's hard not to feel jealous sometimes. You see people worrying about hand prints on the walls or toys all over the floor. We'd give anything for that kind of normal.\"'Flight or fight mode'Now the family are hoping they can have their \"cheeky and determined\" Kobi at home with them for Christmas, away from the beeping machines and clinical smells of hospital.\"We will be on edge worrying and thinking what might go wrong,\" said Daniel\"His head can double in size instantaneously and we have to rush him back to hospital, you see all the veins in his head and it's like a balloon.\"It's very traumatic and we are constantly in a fight or flight mode.\"But when the fear feels overwhelming, his smile pulls us back.\"As a family, we can count on one hand the number of days we've had out together. \"That's all we want - more time, more chances to make memories.\"The family are being helped with the hidden costs of hospital life by the Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity.Chris Watt PhotographyHope, Kobi's big sister, is hoping he can be at home with them for ChristmasPippa Johnston, deputy chief executive officer at Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity, said Daniel and Kirsty had shown \"so much courage and resilience in the face of such unimaginable hardship and uncertainty\".\"While many people will be heading home to be with their loved ones, the sad reality is that many children like Kobi, and their families, will spend the festive season in hospital,\" she said.\"No-one should feel like they're facing hospital alone, especially at Christmas. \"Alongside our friends in the NHS, we'll be there to bring reassurance, comfort and unexpected moments of joy when they're need most.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoGetty ImagesResident doctors in England are going on strike between 14 and 19 November, in their 13th walkout since March 2023.The doctors' union, the British Medical Association, is in a long-running dispute with the government over pay for the medics, who were formerly known as junior doctors.The government says resident doctors have received pay rises totaling nearly 30% in the past three years, but the union says the increases don't go far enough.Who are resident doctors? Resident doctors make up around half of all doctors in England. As a patient you could come into contact with a resident doctor in any NHS department, including at A&E and in your GP surgery. Resident doctors are qualified doctors who have completed a medical degree.Many then enter speciality training in a particular area of medicine and surgery, or train to become a GP.They used to be known as junior doctors, but in September 2024 the government agreed to change the name of their role to better reflect their expertise. Full training can take a long time, so although some resident doctors may have only recently finished medical school, others could have more than a decade of practical experience and be responsible for most aspects of care. How much do resident doctors earn?During their first foundation year after finishing their medical degree, resident doctors in England earn a basic salary of £38,831. In their second year, this rises to £44,439. Medics are often expected to work night shifts, weekends and longer hours, for which they receive extra payments.After eight years or more as a resident doctor, salaries can progress to around £73,000.During 2023-24, they received a 22% pay increase over two years. From August 2025, they have been given an additional 5.4%.What are the resident doctors' pay demands?The BMA has called a series of strikes in England over pay and working conditions since 2023.It argues that resident doctors' pay is 20% lower in real terms than it was in 2008, even after the August 2025 increase.The government uses the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation to calculate public sector pay increases. However, the BMA says many resident doctors have large student loans and that interest on these is calculated using a different inflation measure called RPI, which is higher. Using the CPI measure, the government says resident doctors' current pay is fair.But analysis from the Nuffield Trust think tank suggests pay has fallen 5% since 2008 if CPI is used, compared with nearly 20% with RPI. What have the government and the BMA said about the dispute?Health Secretary Wes Streeting says resident doctors have received the largest pay rises of any public sector employees over the last three years, and insists the government won't offer any further increases. In October the union rejected a fresh offer to cover mandatory exam fees and increase the number of specialist training posts by an extra 2,000 places.These are roles which many doctors apply for two years after qualification.In 2025, there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs, although some were foreign doctors. The BMA argues that said that even after the expansion of places, many resident doctors would be left without a job at a crucial point of their training, and said the pay issue still needed to be addressed.The union said it had told the government there would be no strikes for the foreseeable future if doctors were offered a multi-year deal \"that restores pay over time\", and expressed disappointment at the lack of progress. What happens if I'm ill over the strike? The strike in England will last from 0700 on Friday 14 July to 0700 on Wednesday 19 July. The NHS has urged patients to \"come forward for care as usual\" during the period. Anyone with a life-threatening emergency should call 999 and attend the emergency department if needed.  For urgent, non life-threatening issues the advice is to use the NHS 111 website or to call the helpline. GP surgeries will be open as normal.Most planned hospital appointments and procedures should go ahead as scheduled. The NHS says anyone whose appointment is postponed will be contacted in advance.As happened during previous industrial action, hospitals have been told they should only cancel routine appointments in exceptional circumstances. The target set this time is for a minimum of 95% of \"planned activity\" to take place on strike days.But NHS chiefs accept that the ongoing industrial action has disrupted the care for  thousands of patients. Government analysis shows that 507,000 appointments and operations were cancelled or rescheduled during the previous wave of strikes between July 2023 and February 2024 - which involved some consultants. The latest strike action takes place as the NHS starts to face additional winter pressures, such as a rising number of flu cases. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not affected by the latest walk-out. What pay rises have other public sector staff had?In May 2025, the government announced pay rises for a number of public sector workers, including:4.5% for members of the UK armed forces, with 3.75% for senior military staff4% for other doctors, dentists, and teachers in England, as well as prison officers in England and Wales3.6% for some NHS staff in England, including nurses and midwives3.25% for civil servantsHowever, because a medical degree can take five or six years to complete - longer than most other degree courses - the BMA argues resident doctors' pay should reflect the fact that they may have more student debt than other graduates. Resident doctors also have little control on where and when they are asked to work, and that the need to do placements in different parts of the country can be expensive. ",

    "body": "Lack of trust and racism concerns: Five key failings in Sara Sharif review12 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondentHandoutSara Sharif suffered bites, burns and beatings before she was killed in WokingAn independent review of the Sara Sharif case has identified multiple failings from agencies before her murder in Surrey in 2023, following two years of abuse.The child safeguarding practice review, published on Thursday, said there were \"clearly several points in Sara's life, in particular during the last few months, where different actions could and should have been taken\" by the authorities.\"The system failed to keep her safe,\" it added.Responding to the report, the Children's Commissioner said the case was a \"catalogue of missed opportunities, poor communication and ill-informed assumptions.\" The education secretary said there had been \"the glaring failures\" across all agencies.From before she was even born Surrey Children's Services, Surrey Police and the Family Court knew of the domestic violence in her home.The review authors said her father and stepmother were \"a lethal combination\", and that \"with hindsight it is clear that they should never have been trusted\" with her care.Here are five of the key failings identified by the review.Social workers not trustedWarning: This story contains distressing detailsWhen Sara Sharif's case was first in the family court in the early months of her life, social workers from Surrey County Council wanted her to be removed from her parents for her safety. But after the initial court hearings the plan changed. The review found that the \"social workers felt very frustrated\" by this, saying voices were not heard. They felt that in court \"the views of the children's guardian took precedence\". The children's guardian is an expert appointed by the court to \"represent the best interests of a child\". The review authors said that where the children's guardian and local authority social workers have differing views, the difference of opinion should be summarised clearly for the judge.Vital information missing in custody caseWhen Sara Sharif's father remarried and applied for custody, an inexperienced social worker was asked to produce what is called a Section 7 report. But the review found the report was missing \"vital information and analysis\" because the files that Surrey Children's Services held were not \"thoroughly reviewed\". By chance the judge who heard the case, Alison Raeside, had sat on the earlier hearings, but she was not reminded of some key facts. For example, Sara's father Urfan Sharif had a history of \"domestic abuse and past violence to the children\". He had been told to complete a domestic abuse perpetrators programme before having unsupervised contact, but he had not.Surrey PoliceSara's father Urfan Sharif and stepmother Beinash Batool were sentenced to life imprisonmentBruising report rushedWhen in March 2023, Sara's school reported to Children's Services that she had a golf ball-sized bruise on her cheek the request for support was graded \"Amber\".This meant it should be dealt with within 24 hours. The social worker did not check what information Surrey Police held on the family, and they did not speak to the school to inquire more about Sara's change in demeanour. She had gone from a bubbly child who loved singing to someone who was \"quiet and coy\". Urfan Sharif told the social worker that Sara had \"lots of marks because of the machinery she was hooked up to when born prematurely\", which was a lie. The outcome was \"no social work action\". Five months later Sara was murdered by her father.Address not updatedThe next month Urfan Sharif took his daughter out of school. The review found that she \"effectively disappeared from view\". Surrey County Council had a policy of making home visits to children being home-schooled. The Sharif family had recently moved from a small flat in West Byfleet to a house in Woking. The school knew this and had informed the Council who owned both the homes anyway. The review found that \"address on the referral form sent by the school was the new address but the old address remained on the electronic system used by the inclusion team.\" It meant that when the home education team went round to check on Sara on 7 August 2023 they went to the old address. The next day Sara - already tortured, battered and burned - was murdered by Urfan Sharif and her stepmother Beinash Batool.'Devastating that the information was incorrectly inputted,' says Surrey County CouncilRacism concernsNeighbours of the Sharif family did at times hear things that worried them, but the review found that \"they were worried about reporting concerns about what they heard within the family's home. They feared being branded as being racist, especially on social media\".Sara started wearing the hijab in 2021 when she was only eight years old, even though her stepmother did not. The review found that the \"school showed appropriate curiosity by talking to Sara and stepmother and accepted the explanation that this was linked to Sara's interest with Pakistani culture following a visit to her paternal grandparents in Pakistan\".In the last months of Sara's life the the hijab hid the bruising and injuries to her face and head.More on this storyRelated internet links",

This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

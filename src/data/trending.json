    "body": "Image source, SNSImage caption, Rangers' new head coach Danny Rohl went to the travelling fans after the defeatByBBC Scotland's chief sports writerAnd so it begins for another Rangers head coach. More timidity to observe, more vulnerability in defence, more powder-puff stuff up front, more wide men running in ever decreasing circles.Another defeat, another performance that along with zero goals and zero points had zero positives. In the last few seasons, Rangers, for all their other faults at the time, went toe-to-toe with Athletic Club, Benfica, RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund.Now they're getting routed by Brann, Norway's third best team. The collapse in standards has been stark. It's not just ability that these Rangers players lack, it's character, it's stomach for the fight. Memo to Danny Rohl - are you absolutely sure you know what you've let yourself in for here?Before Brann scored their easy first, their soft second and the third that turned a pitiful debut into a mortifying one for Rohl, there was a moment (the first of many) that will have sent a chill up the spine of the new Rangers boss.The German preaches speed and intensity, pressing and hunting, and he saw plenty of it, but not from any of his players. His players were the same as before. The same as the dog days under Russell Martin, the same as the demise under Philippe Clement, the same as the downfall in the Michael Beale months.What he'd seen from his team to that point was lack of organisation and lack of belief, but at least they were level. They were a touch lucky to be 0-0, but they were - and then they should have been ahead.The chance missed by Youssef Chermiti was a glaring one, a rare piece of Rangers accuracy in the cross from Nico Raskin, but a poor attempt from the young striker, a tame header from a brilliant position. Nine minutes later, the deluge began.'Chermiti is symbol of what's wrong'This must have been the first of the red flags for Rohl. It wasn't just that Chermiti failed to score, it was that he never really threatened to score. His effort was harmless. A lack of confidence, sure. A young player, no question. But a player, also, that Rangers have spent £8m on. By the time he was taken off deep into the second half, his goalscoring record at Rangers, Everton and Sporting stood at three goals in more than 25 hours of football.That touch from the header was the only one Chermiti managed in the Brann penalty area all game. That's as much a criticism of his team-mates' desperate inability to create chances as anything else. The 21-year-old's passing accuracy was the joint-lowest of any player on the pitch and he won only four of his 13 duels.Chermiti might come good, but Rohl does not have time to wait and the chances are that if he was given the £8m splurged on the striker he'd think of any number of other ways to spend it.The striker is a Kevin Thelwell project. The sporting director is all-in on him, lauding his promise as recently as a few days ago when Rohl was unveiled.Thelwell's faith in the £8m spend seems unshakeable, which is quite something given that Chermiti's last senior goal was the fourth in a 4-0 win for Sporting over Pacos Ferreira in May 2023.So far, the striker is a proving to be a symbol of what is wrong at Rangers and what Rohl must somehow fix - poor decision-making and the bizarre feat of investing a lot of money on a team only to make it even worse. Media caption, Tavernier doesn't hold back after Brann defeatThey have spent over £30m on transfer fees and loan fees since the summer only to be humiliated by Brann. It beggars belief.You have to feel for Rohl. He's clearly an impressive coach, having worked at Bayern Munich and with the German national team. Stellar names in the management game talk of his ability. The story of his brief time at Sheffield Wednesday and how his players and how the fans loved him is evidence that he can be a fine leader, too.It's easy to dismiss Wednesday as 'not Rangers', and it isn't, but it was a pressurised job at a club with a monumentally difficult owner and he did it really well.What he's got now is an incredibly supportive owner and a hierarchy at the club that is praying that he succeeds, but he's also got players who are afraid of their own shadows.He has players whose heads are full of mush and whose nerve is all but shot from the torment of the repeated failures under Martin and the visceral abuse they have endured from the fans. They're like quivering jelly. Get in touchSend us your views on RangersThey are so lacking in self-belief that Rohl doesn't just have a coaching job on his hands. He needs to send for the sports psychologists.That's not being glib. These Rangers players lost any faith they had in themselves when Brann made it 2-0 with a free header from a free-kick. They were broken at that point. Rangers defenders remonstrated with each other, but it was the kind of frailty everyone has seen from them for quite a while. They've now shipped 15 goals in their last five European matches.For Rohl, it must have been an education in how much work he needs to do. Maybe he knew it already. He certainly knows it now. What he wants from his team -  speed of thought, speed of movement, aggression, togetherness, relentlessness - is light years away from what he actually has, which is what did for Martin, although Martin did for Martin in many ways.As tends to happen at Rangers, the honeymoon doesn't last long. Rohl is now embedded in the reality of how challenging his new life really is.'My job is to find solution as soon as possible'Scottish Football Podcast23/10/25",

    "body": "Video has emerged appearing to show the alleged thieves behind the Louvre heist making their escape on a mechanical ladder in broad daylight.Two people can be seen looking around frantically as they slowly descend, minutes after the famed Paris museum was broken into and €88m-worth  (£77m)  of France's crown jewels were stolen.    The gang of four thieves have not been caught and on Wednesday, the Louvre's boss admitted that staff had failed to spot them early enough because there was only one camera pointing on the gallery where the items were displayed.In the video, the truck fitted with the ladder is seen parked by on a busy road running along the Seine as vehicles pass. Laurence des Cars told French lawmakers that the Louvre planned to double the number of CCTV cameras in and around the museum. She admitted that the camera trained on the Gallery of Apollo, the south-side room where the jewels were kept, was facing the wrong way.Paris city prosecutor Laure Beccuau told the Ouest France newspaper that up to 150 DNA samples and fingerprints had been retrieved so far as part of the police investigation.The theft happened in less than eight minutes, after the thieves arrived at 09:30 on Sunday (07:30 GMT) after the Louvre opened its doors to the public.They stole eight items including an emerald necklace and earrings given as a wedding gift by Napoleon Bonaparte to his second wife, Marie-LouiseAs they fled, they dropped a 19th-Century diamond-studded crown belonging to Empress Eugenie. Although it was recovered, the crown was damaged and des Cars said it had probably been crushed as the thieves prised it from its display case.",

The duo are quoted as saying \"now feels like the right time\" to - as the paper describes - \"waltz off\".The pair's announcement also leads the Metro as it dubs the phrase \"Quitterball\" across its front page. The outgoing hosts say the \"time is right to pass on the sparkly baton\".The Daily Star says former contestant and ex-BBC radio host Zoe Ball is tipped to be the new host for Strictly Come Dancing.Daly and Winkleman \"vowed to go a year ago\" in a \"secret pact to quit\", the Sun reports, writing the decision left the BBC \"blindsided\".Elsewhere, The Daily Telegraph leads with calls for Sir Keir Starmer to reinstate the Legacy Act after Soldier F was cleared of charges over the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings. The paper quotes criticism from the Ulster Unionist Party who likened it to a \"show trial\".

    "body": "A migrant who returned to the UK on a small boat after being removed under the \"one in one out\" scheme with to France will have his removal \"fast-tracked\", the prime minister has said.The man claimed to have been a victim of modern slavery at the hands of smuggling gangs in France, according to reports in the Guardian.Speaking to the BBC, Sir Keir Starmer said \"trying to get back here has been completely pointless\" for the man, who is understood to be an Iranian national.\"He's already in the system, we know who he is, we've got him and we're going to get him back out of the country very, very quickly.\"The BBC understands the man was initially detained on 6 August and was removed on 19 September, becoming the third person to be sent to France under the scheme. He returned about a month later, on 18 October.More than 40 people who arrived in the UK illegally have been removed under the scheme since September.Under the treaty, France agreed to take back migrants who had travelled to the UK by small boat and had their asylum claim withdrawn or declared inadmissible.For each person returned to France, the UK will accept someone with a case for protection as a refugee who has not attempted to cross the Channel.The migrant, who has not been named, told the Guardian he returned to the UK due to fears for his life in France. Speaking about his alleged treatment at the hands of smugglers, he said: \"They took me like a worthless object, forced me to work, abused me, and threatened me with a gun and told me I would be killed if I made the slightest protest.\"The Home Office previously said: \"We will not accept any abuse of our borders, and we will do everything in our power to remove those without the legal right to be here.\"Separately, the BBC has spoken to an Eritrean man in France who says he was also returned under the scheme.The man, who asked to be identified as Jonas, said he fled his home country because he feared religious persecution during mandatory conscription in the military.Home Office data released on Thursday shows the total number migrants who have arrived in the UK by small boat so far in 2025 now stands at 36,954 - exceeding the total for the whole of last year.",

I saw them juggling work and home. They instilled really strong values in us,\" she added.Kyei hopes to inspire more young people to consider banking as a career.\"You don't need to be a mathematician, you don't need to be an accountant and you don't need to be an economist. What we're looking for is fresh perspectives and we want the best people\".Kyei takes the place of tech CEO Dean Forbes at the head of the list.The rest of the 2026 Powerlist Getty ImagesGetty Images for W Magazine2.

    "body": "2 hours agoKaty AustinTransport correspondent Planned airport expansion that would result in hundreds of thousands of extra flights a year could risk the government's own net zero goals, a committee of MPs has found.The report from the cross-party Environmental Audit Committee said the government had also \"not demonstrated\" that the negative climate impact of expansion would be outweighed by the economic growth created.The government has approved several airport expansion schemes, most recently a third runway at London Heathrow and a second runway at Gatwick.The Department for Transport said airport expansion plans would \"only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change\".Ministers are expected to announce which of two rival proposals is preferred for the expansion of Heathrow within weeks.The Gatwick decision could lead to an extra 100,000 flights per year. If Heathrow gets permission to build a third runway, that could mean another 276,000 flights a year, with approval for an expansion of Luton airport also potentially adding tens of thousands.The Environmental Audit Committee said the only prospect of meeting net zero would be if airport expansion was \"accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation\". However, its chair Toby Perkin noted that technological solutions - such as sustainable aviation fuel - were not yet being used on a commercial scale.  The report said the plans were likely to provide some economic growth, but how much was unclear, and the government had not provided supporting evidence. The UK has legally binding targets to reduce its levels of planet-warming emissions, and contribute to the global goal of preventing average temperatures rising by more than 1.5C by 2050.Above this temperature level, scientists anticipate significant impacts from global sea level rise, more extreme weather and impacts on agriculture.To prevent temperatures increasing there is a limit to the amount of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, that the world can release, and the UK has set out its own share of these – known as carbon budgets.On Wednesday, the Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told Parliament that Heathrow's expansion plans \"must align with our legal, environmental and climate commitments\".A spokesperson for the DfT said: \"We have been clear that airport expansion will only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change, including net zero, and we will be seeking advice from the independent Climate Change Committee to inform the ANPS review.\"But Dr Alex Chapman, a senior researcher at New Economics Foundation (a think tank focused on environmental and social policies) who gave evidence to the environmental audit committee, said the inquiry was a \"damning assessment of this government's airport expansion agenda\".\"This government is unable to produce evidence that supports their central claim: that growing our airports will grow our economy. \"Had they done their research they would have found that demand for business air travel is collapsing and we're flying ever more tourists to spend money outside the country than we are flying in.\"",

    "body": "Jaguar Land Rover cyber attack caused UK car production to slump by a quarter2 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterGetty ImagesProduction of JLR's Range Rover Sport ground to a halt in September, hitting overall UK vehicle outputThe five-week shutdown of Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) factories following a cyber-attack drove car production down by more than a quarter in September.JLR facilities did not produce a single vehicle last month, after the cyber-attack forced the car maker to shut down its IT systems and halt its global manufacturing operations, including at its three UK plants.Overall UK car production fell by 27%  with just over 51,000 made last month, data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed.It is the lowest number of cars made in any September in the UK since 1952, including the pandemic, the SMMT said.The JLR cyber-attack was largely responsible for the slump in UK car production, the SMMT said, because other manufacturers reported stable figures for the month.The attack is also estimated to cost £1.9bn and be the most economically damaging cyber event in UK history, according to research published on Tuesday.The Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC) found 5,000 businesses have been affected by the event and a full recovery will not occur until January 2026.JLR said production across sites in Solihull, Wolverhampton and Halewood was returning in a phased approach.The maker of the Jaguar I-Pace and Range Rover Sport is the second-largest car producer by volume in the UK after Nissan.Overall, total vehicle production slumped by 35.9% in September compared to a year ago to about 54,300 vehicles.The SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: \"September's performance comes as no surprise given the total loss of production at Britain's biggest automotive employer following a cyber incident. \"While the situation has improved, the sector remains under immense pressure,\" he added.The majority of vehicles made in the UK are shipped overseas, and exports in September also slumped - down 24.5% - with the EU, US, Turkey, Japan and South Korea the top five destinations. This year so far UK car and van factories have made 582,250 vehicles, which is 15.2% lower than at the same point in 2024.The five-week JLR shutdown was a \"severe, but short-term issue\" for the overall industry, the boss of Autotrader Ian Plummer said.\"It'll be a bit like Covid, where after the shutdown and delays end, there's a surge in demand and sales,\" he said.Mr Plummer,  who runs the UK's biggest car-selling platform said, JLR brands had risen to have the highest number of monthly sales leads on Autotrader, \"so there is demand out there, even as the pipeline is currently stuck\".The SMMT's Mr Hawes also said a recent ambition from the UK government to help foster a resurgence in domestic car production to 1.3m vehicles a year is in doubt if the chancellor Rachel Reeves ends tax breaks offered to Employee Car Ownership Schemes (ECOS).\"The industry is calling for rapid interventions to shore up its competitiveness,\" he said.Keeping manufacturers' ECOS schemes would be \"an immediate relief\", he said, and bringing forward other interventions including programmes to bolster supply chain resilience \"would further boost the sector\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe British Medical Association has announced a fresh round of strikes in England after talks broke down again with the government.The union and government have been in dialogue throughout the summer and early autumn since the last walkout at the end of July.But the BMA said with no progress being made there would be a five-day walkout by resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, starting on Friday 14 November.This will be the 13th strike in the long-running pay dispute since March 2023 and is expected to cause significant disruption, particularly in hospitals.Resident doctors represent nearly half the medical workforce and range from doctors fresh out of university through to those with up to a decade of experience.They will walk out of both emergency and routine care with senior doctors brought in to provide cover.While the NHS attempted to keep as many routine services running as possible during the last strike, thousands of operations and appointments still had to be postponed.Dr Jack Fletcher, chair of the BMA's resident doctors committee, said: \"This is not where we wanted to be. \"We talked with the government in good faith. We hoped the government would see that our asks are not just reasonable, but are in the best interests of the public and our patients and would also help stop our doctors leaving the NHS.\"While we want to get a deal done, the government seemingly, does not, leaving us with little option but to call for strike action.\"Health Secretary West Streeting has maintained throughout this year that he would not negotiate on pay after resident doctors had received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years.The talks, therefore, had centred on career progression, working conditions and out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees.The union argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.They have also said they wanted the government to address what they say is a shortage of jobs after the second year of training when resident doctors move into speciality training.This year there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs at this stage, although some will have been doctors from abroad.Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the announcement \"preposterous\".\"The BMA are walking away from an offer to improve resident doctors' working conditions and create more specialty training roles to progress their careers. The BMA are blocking a better deal for doctors.\"These unreasonable and unnecessary strikes do not have the public's support.\"The BMA's reckless posturing will harm patients, leave other doctors and NHS staff to pick up the pieces and divert resources away from rebuilding the NHS.\"Rory Deighton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health leaders, said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" talks had broken down again - and urged the BMA to get back to the negotiating table.\"We now have to prepare to mitigate the disruption of more strikes at the same time as they are getting ready for what is likely to be another very difficult winter, while continuing to bear down on their elective waiting lists.\"Ultimately, despite the best efforts to plan and put contingencies in place, it is patients who bear the brunt of industrial action, with more cancelled appointments, tests and operations leaving people waiting longer for the care they need.\"",

    "body": "X-ray tables, high-tech glasses, NBA players: How a poker scheme allegedly stole millions1 hour agoNardine SaadBBCCelebrities, professional sports stars and wealthy gamblers sat at a table hoping to win big in a game of Texas Hold 'Em.But they didn't know it was nearly impossible. They were \"fishes\" allegedly being targeted by the mafia in an elaborate poker gambling scheme that included X-ray card tables, secret cameras, analysers in chip trays and sunglasses and contact lenses that could read their hand. In what sounds like an Ocean's Eleven film plot, prosecutors say these \"unwitting\" victims were cheated out of at least $7m (£5.25) in poker games - with one person losing at least $1.8m (£1.35m). The scheme, which US prosecutors described as \"reminiscent of a Hollywood movie,\" was dismantled in a sprawling federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests, including members of La Costra Nostra crime families, Portland Trail Blazers basketball coach Chauncey Billups and former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Damon Jones. FBI director Kash Patel called it a \"mind-boggling\" fraud scheme that cheated victims in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and other US cities. Arrests in the scheme were announced Thursday along with those in an alleged basketball betting plot, where professional NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds. The underground poker scheme started as early as 2019, prosecutors say, and was allegedly operated by the mafia - specifically by members of notorious crime families, including Bonnano, Gambino, Luchesse and Genovese. A cut of the profits, prosecutors say, helped fund their criminal enterprise. Former professional athletes, described by prosecutors as \"face cards\", were enlisted to help in the scheme and entice victims into playing. Lured in by the opportunity to play with a high-profile celebrity - such as Billups or Jones - a wealthy, \"unwitting victim\" would be recruited for illegal, underground poker games where tens of thousands of dollars were on the line, prosecutors allege. Unbeknownst to the lured-in players - referred to in the scheme as a \"fish\" - everyone surrounding them was in on the elaborate scam - from the players to the dealers, even the technology used to shuffle the deck and count the chips, according to a lengthy federal indictment. Sophisticated wireless technology was also used to deceive the players during the games, most commonly in Texas Hold'em.NBA stars and mafia among dozens arrested in illegal gambling crackdownNBA injuries, poker and the mafia: What we know about gambling arrestsUS Department of JusticeA rigged card-shuffling machine was also used in the plot, prosecutors sayThe technology was everywhere - an X-ray table that read any face-down card, analysers inside chip trays, a rigged shuffling machine that read cards and predicted who would have the best hand, and pre-marked cards that allowed those wearing special sunglasses and contact lenses to read what was in everyone's hands. Secretive cameras - built into tables and light fixtures - also helped convey information to those helping in the plot, authorities say. Then there was also a sophisticated method of communicating and rigging the game, prosecutors allege. Information from the game would be sent to an off-site conspirator - called an \"operator\" by prosecutors - who then would send information to another player sitting at the table who was in on the scheme - which prosecutors call a \"quarterback\" or \"driver\".

Authorities estimate that each game would leave a victim out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Prosecutors say the defendants allegedly laundered the funds from the scheme through cryptocurrency, cash exchanges and shell companies. A cut of the profits went to those who helped in the plot, prosecutors say, and some allegedly went to fund the mafia's criminal enterprise. \"This alleged scheme wreaked havoc across the nation, exploiting the notoriety of some and the wallets of others to finance the Italian crime families,\" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia.Billups, who was accused of being a face card in the fixed card games, was arrested in Portland and was placed on leave by the NBA. In a statement, the Portland Trail Blazers said that they are aware of the allegations involving their head coach and are \"fully cooperating with the investigation\".Jones was arrested in relation to both the poker and NBA injuries scheme. He is charged with two counts each of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.",

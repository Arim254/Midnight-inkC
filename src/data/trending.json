    "body": "Blocking Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an Aston Villa match is the \"wrong decision\", the prime minister has said.Followers of the Israeli team will not be allowed to attend the Europa League match between the sides on 6 November because of safety concerns, the body responsible for issuing safety certificates for matches said on Thursday.Sir Keir Starmer criticised the move, saying \"we will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets\" and that the role of police was \"to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation\".Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch branded the decision a \"national disgrace\" and suggested Sir Keir should act to reverse it.She wrote on X that Starmer should \"guarantee that Jewish fans can walk into any football stadium in this country\".\"If not, it sends a horrendous and shameful message: there are parts of Britain where Jews simply cannot go.\"West Midlands Police said the game had been classified as high risk and that it had concerns about its ability to deal with potential protests at the match at Villa Park.It said this was based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including \"violent clashes and hate crime offences\" between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans before a match in Amsterdam in November 2024.More than 60 people were arrested over the violence which city officials described as a \"toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger\" over the war in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East.The Safety Advisory Group, which issues safety certificates for matches, told Aston Villa that no travelling fans would be permitted at the match in Birmingham.Aston Villa said it was in \"continuous dialogue with Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local authorities,\" with the safety of supporters and local residents \"at the forefront of any decision\".Football's European governing body Uefa said it wanted fans to be able to travel and support their team in a \"safe, secure and welcoming environment\".Uefa told Reuters: \"In all cases, the competent local authorities remain responsible for decisions related to the safety and security of matches taking place on their territory.\"Ayoub Khan, the independent MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, welcomed the decision: \"From the moment that the match was announced, it was clear that there were latent safety risks that even our capable security and police authorities would not be able to fully manage.\"Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar called the decision \"shameful\" and urged officials to reverse it.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was \"a serious mistake,\" adding: \"You don't tackle antisemitism by banning its victims. This decision must be reversed.\"Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the move \"takes racial discrimination to a whole new level\".Various sporting events have seen protests over the war in Gaza, including when Israel's national team played Norway and Italy in recent World Cup qualifiers.Earlier on Thursday, the prime minister said it was his \"responsibility\" to address how many in the Jewish community were feeling \"insecure and unsafe\", particularly after the attack at a Manchester synagogue in early October that killed two men.During a visit to the Community Security Trust (CST) - a charity that provides security at Jewish sites such as synagogues and schools - he told Jewish News: \"We have heard loud and clear in the last few days and weeks that words are not enough. Action is what matters, and we're absolutely committed to that.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoHelen SullivanBBC NewsGetty ImagesPaul Daniel \"Ace\" Frehley, founding guitarist for the American rock band KISS, has died aged 74, his family announced in a statement reported in US media.Frehley died surrounded by family, who said they were \"completely devastated and heartbroken\".\"We were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth,\" the statement said. The guitarist was known for his \"Spaceman\" persona, from the days when KISS was founded with the original line-up of Paul Stanley on vocals and rhythm guitar, Gene Simmons on vocals and bass guitar, Frehley, on lead guitar and vocals and Peter Criss on drums and vocals. Getty ImagesThey applied black and white face paint to create four enduring characters - Demon, Starchild, Spaceman and Catman.  \"We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!\" the family said. In a joint statement, Stanley and Simmons said, \"We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley. He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy.\"Frehley is survived by his wife Jeanette and his daughter, Monique.Kiss first formed in 1973. The band produced hits such as Rock and Roll All Nite and God of Thunder. Known for wearing big wigs, black leather, glitter, platform shoes - and making a lot of noise - the band had sold 100 million records by 2024. Frehley often played a guitar that emitted smoke.In 1983, they appeared without face paint for the first time and enjoyed something of a resurgence. This was known as their \"unmasking\". They later re-masked in the late 1990s.In 1982, Frehley quit the group, which continued with different musicians. He returned for the band's 1996 reunion tour and stayed on until 2002. The original members were inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame in 2014. Getty ImagesFreyley was born in the Bronx, New York, and was given his first guitar as a Christmas present when he was 13. He later left high school to pursue music. \"I'm a high school drop out but here I am a millionaire and I never even took a guitar lesson in my life,\" he told Metal Express radio in 2020.In 2024, the band sold its back catalogue of songs to a Swedish music investor for a figure thought to be upwards of $300m (£237m).Stockholm-based Pophouse Entertainment also bought the group's brand, likeness and intellectual property.The sale marked the band's retirement from live performances, but Frehley continued to perform, releasing eight solo albums. In September this year he announced that he would have to cancel his performance at the Antelope Valley Fair in Lancaster, California after falling in his studio and being taken to hospital. \"He is fine, but against his wishes, his doctor insists that he refrain from travel at this time,\" representatives said in a statement at the time. He later cancelled the remainder of his tour dates due to \"ongoing medical issues\". The BBC has reached out to the band's representatives. ",

    "body": "7 minutes agoAlex KleidermanGetty ImagesFormer members of the military will be able to start applying for a digital version of their identity cards from Friday.About 1.8 million veterans are eligible to download the new digital ID to a smartphone - with ministers saying the rollout can serve as a \"case study\" to show the public how the technology for a planned scheme for all British citizens and residents will work.Physical veterans' cards will continue to be issued, but the digital version will allow holders to prove their status more easily to access to public services, the government says.Digital government minister Ian Murray said the veterans' digital ID could also help address \"legitimate concerns around privacy and security\" of the UK-wide scheme.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the plans for the wider scheme last month as part of efforts to clamp down on illegal working. It will be introduced by 2029 and mandatory in order to work.The digital veteran card is optional but the government says it will allow former service personnel to show their entitlement to services such as GP and mental health support, supported housing, careers advice as well as reduced entry prices at museums and money off their shopping.Murray said the veterans ID was \"probably a demonstration to the public by default... on the basis that this is the first use case for having a digital credential on your smartphone, and that digital credential is the first sort of verifiable one that government have now launched\".Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"We are modernising our public services so they work around people's lives and keep pace with the digital world we live in.\"The digital veterans' card will help remove barriers, reduce red-tape and make it easier for people to access the public services they need.\"The digital veteran card will be the first document to be stored in the government's One Login smartphone app, with digital driving licences set to follow at a later date.",

    "body": "Five takeaways from the Mamdani-Cuomo NYC mayoral debate2 hours agoKayla Epstein and Grace Eliza Goodwin at Rockefeller Center, and Sakshi VenkatramanWatch: Grocery bills, Trump and Gaza - How NYC mayoral debate unfoldedLive from New York: It's mayoral debate night.The three leading candidates for New York City mayor took the stage at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan Thursday night to make a case to lead America's biggest city.Early voting in the race is set to begin next week, and the most recent polling, suggests Zohran Mamdani has widened his lead to 46 percent, while Andrew Cuomo stands at 33 percent. The outcome of the race could have political implications beyond the Empire State as President Donald Trump looms large, and whoever wins will likely face pressure from Washington in some form.The Democratic Party nationally also is likely watching to see if the America's biggest Democratic stronghold chooses an establishment, centrist Cuomo, who is running as an independent or the progressive Mamdani. The winner could help determine the kind of candidate and platform Democrats choose in the future following their staggering 2024 loss to Trump. Republicans also will watch to see if their candidate, Curtis Sliwa, continues to make inroads with his public safety platform.Here are five big takeaways from tonight's debate.Mamdani addresses his support for PalestiniansMamdani's past statements on Israel and Palestinians came up several times during the night in questions from moderators and opponents' criticisms.The candidate has stressed his support for Palestinians and statehood, and has criticized Israel's military operation in Gaza.He also was criticized for declining to condemn the phrase \"globalise the intifada\" when probed by interviewers, but has said he would seek to serve as a mayor for all New Yorkers, including its large and ideologically diverse Jewish population.Cuomo, however, attacked Mamdani for his views, calling the New York state assemblyman a \"divisive personality across the board.\"Angelina Katsanis/Pool via REUTERSThe fourth man: Donald TrumpAlthough there were three candidates at tonight's debate, another name kept coming up: Donald Trump.President Trump has implied he wants to send the National Guard into cities controlled by Democrats - in spite of resistance - and has moved to withhold government funds for infrastructure projects in New York City. Trump also has prioritized New York City for his mass deportation policy, and the mayor — who has little power over federal immigration enforcement — will likely have to weigh the city's response. Sliwa, the Republican, noted that the mayor would need to get along with Trump regardless of political views. But Mamdani made his opposition to Trump explicit from his very first response, promising to \"take on Trump.\"Cuomo positioned himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the current White House, warning \"it will be Mayor Trump\" if Mamdani is elected.\"I fought Donald Trump,\" he told voters. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\"Affordability front and centerAs large as Trump looms, the biggest policy issue around this mayoral election is affordability. New Yorkers face high costs of living on everything - especially rent and groceries.In his opening statement, Sliwa acknowledged the \"really serious issues of affordability\" facing the city. He called for the next mayor to free up vacant apartments in NYCHA - New York's public housing programme — and allow people to move in.The moderators directly asked each candidate how much they paid for rent, groceries and whether they paid off credit card debt monthly. The candidates pitched a volley of proposals, including Mamdani's plan to make buses free and Cuomo's proposal to place income limits on people who resided in rent-stabilized apartments.He criticised Mamdani for living in a rent-stablised apartment, even though his parents are wealthy (his mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair).\"If you think that the problem in this city is that my rent is too low, vote for him,\" Mamdani said. \"If you know the problem in this city is that your rent is too high, vote for me.\"Cuomo also opposed Mamdani's proposed rent freeze on stabilized apartments, saying it would only postpone future increases, force building owners into bankruptcy, and fail New Yorkers who don't live in rent-stabilized apartments.Former Governor Andrew Cuomo announces run for New York City mayorFULL COVERAGE: Mamdani, Cuomo, Sliwa debateWho is Zohran Mamdani?How Mamdani stunned New York - and what Democrats can learn from his winCuomo's controversies still loomCuomo touted his decades of experience in office, rising from federal housing secretary during President Bill Clinton's administration to New York's governor.But his controversies while governor have shadowed his campaign and Cuomo came prepared for a fight.He resigned as governor in 2021 after an investigation by the state attorney general found he had sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo apologised for acting \"in a way that made people feel uncomfortable\" but denied allegations.The New York attorney general also investigated his administration for undercounting nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, finding he understated the actual number of deaths.Mamdani attacked Cuomo on these matters, accusing him of \"sending seniors to their death in nursing homes,\" and accused him of lacking integrity.Cuomo said the allegations about harming seniors in nursing homes was \"totally false.\"\"During Covid, everyone did whatever they could in this state, and there have been numerous investigations where they've gone through it, and they said we followed federal guidance,\" Cuomo said. \"But yes, people died during Covid. And my heart breaks for everyone that broken, that died in this state and across this nation.\"Sliwa, too, attacked Cuomo for the \"lawsuits filed against you for sexual harassment.\" The former governor rebutted that the case brought New York attorney general Letitia James, who investigated the misconduct claims, \"was political.\"Curtis Sliwa makes his markSliwa held his own as the only Republican on stage. His voting bloc might be in the minority in New York City, but the 2024 presidential election revealed that residents prioritise public safety issues and Sliwa hammered that repeatedly. As the founder of the Guardian Angels, a New York City organization devoted to crime prevention, he seized the opportunity to connect with voters.The longtime New York media and political personality also knew how to make himself heard. He frequently interjected, telling moderators he wanted to speak, and elbowing his way into the debate's most heated moments. From centre stage, he took swings at both opponents in equal measure.He felt confident after the debate, saying his night went \"extraordinarily well\" and likening his opponents to \"two kids in the schoolyard.",

    "body": "'Game-changing' HIV protection jab approved in England and Wales3 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorGetty ImagesAn injection to prevent HIV is to be offered to patients on the NHS in England and Wales for the first time, bringing the policy in line with Scotland.The long-acting shot, given six times a year or every other month, is an alternative to taking daily pills to protect against the virus.Experts hope the cabotegravir (CAB-LA) injections will help meet the ambition of ending new HIV cases by 2030 in the UK. Meanwhile, early results for a different injection called lenacapavir suggest it may even be possible to move people on to an annual HIV prevention jab. 'This represents hope' Wes Streeting, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said: \"The approval of this game-changing injection perfectly embodies what this government is determined to deliver - cutting-edge treatments that save lives and leave no one behind. \"For vulnerable people who are unable to take other methods of HIV prevention, this represents hope.\"HIV prevention therapy, known as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), is taken by HIV-negative people to reduce the risk of getting HIV.Pills have been available for years and are still extremely effective at stopping HIV infections, but are not always easy for some to take. It can be hard to access, not practical, or feel embarrassing. For example, people might worry someone like parents or housemates could find their pills. Homelessness and domestic violence can make it difficult to take oral PrEP every day.An injection which lasts for months offers convenience and discretion.HIV is a virus that damages the cells in the immune system and weakens the body's ability to fight everyday infections and diseases. It can be caught during unprotected sex or through sharing needles. Mothers can also pass it to their baby at birth.Cabotegravir should be used in combination with safer sex practices, such as use of condoms.The NHS has an undisclosed discount from the manufacturer for the treatment that has a list price of around £7,000 per patient per year. The jab will be considered for adults and adolescents with a healthy weight who are at high risk of sexually acquired HIV and eligible for PrEP, but for whom taking oral tablets would be difficult. It’s thought around 1,000 people will be offered it.They will be able to get it from NHS-operated sexual health clinics \"in coming months\" says the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Charities say some people face long waiting times for appointments at clinics and the rollout must happen quickly. Richard Angell, of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said it was time to explore delivering the \"transformative therapy\" in other settings, not just sexual health clinics. \"It's highly effective and acceptable for patients, and a vital tool for tackling inequalities – with the potential to reach those who are not currently accessing other HIV prevention.\"Official figures for England show the number of people taking PrEP in sexual health services is increasing.Last year,146,098 HIV-negative people accessing sexual health services had a PrEP need because they were at substantial risk of acquiring HIV. Of those, about 76% (111,123) began or continued PrEP - a 7.7% rise from 2023.PrEP need is not being identified and met equitably though. Access to the treatment varies significantly by group, with uptake highest among white (79.4%) and ethnic minority (77.8%) gay, bisexual and all men who have sex with men, but much lower among black African heterosexual women (34.6%) and men (36.4%). At the same time, HIV testing has expanded across hospital A&E departments in England. Currently, 89 routinely test anyone who has blood taken, specifically in cities and towns with high HIV prevalence.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterBritish Gas's parent company Centrica, Euro Garages and Holland & Barrett are among the latest companies named and shamed by the government for underpaying staff.The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) has released a list of nearly 500 employers fined more than £10m for failing to pay the national minimum wage. It said 42,000 workers were repaid more than £6m.Business Secretary Peter Kyle said: \"I know that no employer wants to end up on one of these lists. But our Plan to Make Work Pay cracks down on those not playing by the rules.\"All three firms blamed past payroll problems for the underpayments and said all affected staff had been remunerated.All the employers named on DBT's list were fined up to double the total amount they owed to staff, some for underpayments dating as far back as 2013.Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said there was \"no excuse for workers being cheated out of money they're owed. It's bad for workers, families and the economy.\"According to the government's latest investigations between 2018 and 2023, Euro Garages, known as EG Group, is top of the list short-changing 3,317 of its workers by a hefty sum of more than £824,000.The company, which was co-founded by billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa but who have since stepped back from leading the firm, has significantly reduced its UK operations over the past year.It sold its UK petrol forecourts business and Cooplands bakeries, but still runs some Starbucks franchise stores across the UK.In a statement, an EG Group spokesperson said: \"These historic payroll issues that took place between 2015 and 2019 have been fully rectified. \"All affected employees were subsequently reimbursed in full in agreement with HMRC.\"The firm said it improved its systems to make sure it complied with UK laws and maintained that it was committed to treating employees fairly.Centrica, which owns British Gas, was eighth on DBT's list having failed to pay £167,815 to 356 workers.The energy giant recently bought one of the biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities in the UK for £1.7bn, extending the firm's control of the country's energy supplies.A Centrica spokesperson said the company supported fair pay and pointed to technical faults in its payroll system between 2015 and 2019.\"This issue relates to a small number of historic technical errors which was put right as soon as it was identified. \"The total underpayment related primarily to salary sacrifice arrangements and training bonds, rather than take home pay, and was around £160,000 – our UK annual wage bill is currently around £1.2bn.\"High street retailer Holland & Barrett is next on the list after it failed to pay more than £153,000 to 2,551 workers. In a statement, the company said past issues with minimum wage payments, between 2015 and 2021, had since been fixed in 2022.\"This was not a case of deliberate underpayment,\" said a spokesperson. \"The issue stemmed from legacy practices such as requiring team members to wear specific shoes, unpaid training completed at home, and time spent preparing for shifts at our Burton distribution site.\"Holland & Barrett said it remained \"committed to fair pay\" and that it was paying store staff about 5% above the National Living Wage and follows all rules.\"While we respect the transparency of the scheme, we are disappointed that naming has occurred over three years after the matter was settled.\"The minimum wage for over 21s, known officially as the National Living Wage, is currently £12.21 an hour. Younger employees - aged between 16 and 20 - are entitled to receive the National Minimum Wage, which is set at £10 and hour.",

    "body": "8 hours agoKevin Nguyen,Phil Leake andMerlyn ThomasBBCThe controversial US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has confirmed it suspended operations in Gaza after the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas came into effect on 10 October.Despite being funded until November, the organisation said its final delivery was on Friday.The GHF has been heavily criticised after hundreds of Palestinians were killed while collecting food near its distribution sites. Witnesses say most were killed by Israeli forces.Israel has regularly denied that its troops fired on civilians at or near the sites and the GHF has maintained that aid distribution at its sites has been carried out \"without incident\".The group's northernmost aid distribution site, known as SDS4, was shut down because it was no longer in IDF-controlled territory, said a spokesman.Satellite imagery revealed it was dismantled shortly after the 10 October ceasefire came into effect. Images show tyre tracks, disturbed earth and detritus strewn across the former compound.\"Right now we're paused,\" the GHF spokesman said. \"We feel like there's still a need, a surge for as much aid as possible. Our goal is to resume aid distribution.\"Despite the group's apparent desire to continue there has been speculation the final terms of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel would exclude them.Meanwhile, analysis of UN-supplied data shows little change in aid collected from crossings after the ceasefire deal came into effect last Friday.The average amount of aid \"collected\" - defined by the UN as when it leaves an Israeli-controlled crossing - each day has increased slightly compared with the previous week, but it remains in line with September figures.UN data shows about 20% of aid leaving a crossing has made it to its intended destination since 19 May. More than 7,000 aid trucks have been \"intercepted\" either \"peacefully by hungry people or forcefully by armed actors\", according to UN data.Aid sources told the BBC they hoped looting would subside in coming weeks as law and order is re-established and the populace is given assurances the ceasefire would hold.A spokesperson from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said while it was critical for the ceasefire to allow for an increase in aid and other essential supplies, it was important to reach vulnerable Gazans, including in areas that were inaccessible until recently.OCHA has hundreds of community and household service points involved in distributing aid. It lost access to many, sometimes due to conflict and sometimes due to Israel denying it access.\"We need to re-establish our service points, we need looting to reduce, we need roads to be cleared of unexploded ordnance and we need safety assurances,\" the OCHA spokesperson said.",

    "body": "11 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent andPaul SeddonPolitical reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe proposed new embassy at Royal Mint Court would be the biggest in Europe if it goes aheadA decision on whether to approve China's application for a new super-embassy in London has been delayed again by the government.Housing Secretary Steve Reed had been due to rule on the application by 21 October, but the deadline has been pushed back to 10 December.It is the second time the government has delayed a decision on the controversial site, whose location has sparked concerns it could pose an espionage risk.A ruling had originally been due by 9 September after ministers took control of the process from Tower Hamlets, the local council, last year. China bought the site of the proposed new embassy, at Royal Mint Court, near the Tower of London, for £255m in 2018. At 20,000 square metres, the proposed complex would be the biggest embassy in Europe if it goes ahead.The pending decision on whether to approve the new embassy was already under close scrutiny because of concerns about the security implications of the plan, including the location, size and design of the building.The site is close to fibre optic cables carrying communications to and from financial institutions in the City of London. Concerns have been raised that Chinese operatives could use the site to tap into the cables and eavesdrop.Further questions have been raised in recent weeks about the nature of the threat posed by Beijing, following the collapse of the case against two men accused of spying for China.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly dropped charges against parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and academic Christopher Berry, 33, last month. Both men deny the allegations. The government's first delay was requested by Reed's predecessor Angela Rayner, after she asked China to explain why some rooms within its planning documents had been blanked out for \"security reasons\".Planning consultants working for the Chinese embassy had replied that China \"does not consider that, as a matter of principle, it is necessary or appropriate to provide full internal layout plans\".Rayner had written back to groups involved in the consultation, including China, the Met police and a local residents' association, to give them more time to respond to the plans and putting the deadline back to 21 October.Reed, who took over the housing role following Rayner's resignation last month, has now requested additional time before a final decision needs to be made.In a letter seen by the BBC, the housing department said more time was needed due to the \"detailed nature\" of responses received so far.It added that it was unable to set a new deadline for fresh comments until it receives pending responses from the Foreign Office and Home Office. BBC visited the location where China plans to put its mega-embassyThe proposed complex would include offices, a large basement area, housing for 200 staff, and a new tunnel to connect the Embassy House to a separate building on the embassy grounds.Beijing's application for the embassy was initially rejected by Tower Hamlets Council in 2022 over safety and security concerns.It resubmitted an identical application to the council in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power. The government then took over the decision in October.The Chinese Embassy in the UK has previously said the new complex would enhance \"mutually beneficial cooperation\" between China and Britain.In a new diplomatic note released alongside Reed's letter explaining his reasons for the latest delay, a Chinese official said objections to the site were \"either ill-founded or unjustified\".The Conservatives said Labour ministers should throw out the application, and accused them of trying to \"silence the warnings about the threats to national security\" posed by the embassy site.The Liberal Democrats also called for the application to be blocked, calling on the government to \"stand up to China\".Foreign Affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said it would be \"insane\" for ministers to allow the embassy development to go ahead, after warnings from the head of MI5 on Thursday about the threat of Chinese espionage.Boris Johnson's former chief advisor Dominic Cummings said MI5 and MI6 had warned him China was \"trying to build a spy centre underneath the embassy,\" when he was working at Downing Street.Speaking on ITV's Talking Politics podcast, Cummings said the agencies had told him that allowing the embassy to be built would be \"an extremely bad idea\". In his annual speech, Sir Ken McCallum said \"Chinese state actors\" presented a national security threat to the UK \"every day\".He added that the UK needed to \"defend itself resolutely\" against China, while also being able to \"seize the opportunities\" from having a relationship with Beijing.

    "body": "5 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorWatch: Government will be taking targeted action on cost of living, says ReevesChancellor Rachel Reeves has said she is planning \"targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges\" in next month's Budget.Speaking to the BBC, she said it was the job of both the government and the Bank of England to reduce inflation.The UK's inflation rate is forecast to be the highest among the G7 group of developed nations this year and next.The BBC understands that the government could intervene to bring down energy bills, for example, by cutting the current 5% rate of VAT charged on energy.Another option is to reduce some of the regulatory levies currently added to bills.The government will receive the next draft from the official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Monday, which will reveal how much space there is for such a measure.The expectation from most analysts is that Reeves will have to announce tax rises or spending cuts in order to meet her self-imposed borrowing rulesEarlier on Thursday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated there was a £22bn gap for the chancellor to fill, which is at the lower end of expectations.\"There's a shared job between the Bank of England and the government to bear down further on some of the causes of inflation,\" Reeves told the BBC in Washington, at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.While much of the focus has been on likely tax rises, the chancellor said the latest information from the OBR had not changed her commitment to manifesto promises not to raise rates on income tax, VAT or National Insurance.She blamed an \"uncertain world\" with rising geopolitical and trade concerns for the Budget tax moves, likely to be focused on those \"with the broadest shoulders\".The chancellor also announced a new support scheme to help attract financial firms into investing in the UK.The government said its so-called \"concierge\" facility – called the Office for Investment: Financial Services – would guide companies through regulations and help them choose the best locations to set up, making it easier for them to do business in Britain.About 1.2 million people across the UK are employed in the financial services sector, with more than half of those jobs located outside of London, according to the Treasury.Reeves, who is in Washington DC for the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) annual meeting, said: \"This service will drive investment across our United Kingdom, making sure that the world's most innovative businesses can access the talent found in every corner of our country and that working people feel better off.\"The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries. They work together to maintain global economic stability.Ms Reeves also addressed at the IMF meeting the concerns about the UK's economic relations with China, saying \"our national security always come first.\"Last week's announcement by China to tighten export controls on rare earths and other materials that are key for advanced tech manufacturing led US President Donald Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on imports from China, raising the prospect of an all-out trade war between the two economic giants.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called China's move \"economic coercion\" and \"a global supply chain power grab\".Asked about accepting the US offer to join it in its battle with China, Reeves said she was \"very concerned\" by China's actions and urged the Chinese government \"not to put up barriers and restrict access\".She said the move was \"bad for the global economy and creates further headwinds\".\"I believe there are areas where we must challenge China, but there are also important opportunities to sell into Chinese markets, including financial services and other areas of the economy. We've got to get that balance right.\"The chancellor also confirmed she was working with G7 counterparts \"on our own critical minerals strategy, so that we are less reliant\".Reeves also acknowledged that the price the NHS pays for medicines could go up as a result of ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration and its drugs companies, in return for lower tariffs and investment.Some of the world's largest drug companies have said recently that they are either pausing or scrapping projects in the UK, with some blaming the low prices they are receiving.Last month, Science Minister Patrick Vallance said the price the NHS pays for medicines would need to rise to stop companies and pharmaceutical investment leaving the UK.Reeves told the BBC: \"We have seen because of the pricing regime, that clinical trials, new drugs have not been offered in the UK in the way that they are in other European countries.\"We want to make sure that people getting treatment from the NHS are able to access the best life-saving drugs in the world. And so we are looking at all of that, and… looking to secure more investment into Britain.\"Additional reporting by Pritti Mistry.",

    "body": "8 hours agoRuth CleggSenior health reporter BBCBack in the 1990s, Alan Reeves would regularly perform on stage, stripping off to thousands as a member of The Dreamboys. He was so sought after that he, along with his troupe of male dancers, popped up in the Spice Girls film, Spice World.The then 24-year-old was, by his own admission, \"a bit of a pin up\".But by the time Reeves was in his 30s, he found himself in a very different situation — his mood was low and his libido had virtually disappeared.\"I just didn't feel right,\" he says.Reeves, now aged 52, says his lack of a sex drive began to have a detrimental impact on his long term relationship.\"We were going without sex for three, four months at a time. I just wasn't interested,\" he says.\"This kind of thing can cause couples to break up.\"Fragile Films/ Icon Entertainment International/ Polygram Filmed EntertainmentGeri Halliwell and Alan Reeves in the Spice Girls film, Spice WorldNow a fitness and lifestyle coach based in London, Reeves began testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and says it has given him his libido back, turning him \"from a grumpy old man\" to feeling like he's back in his 20s. It just \"felt phenomenal\" he says.And women too are turning to testosterone.Rachel Mason, a 37‑year‑old menopause blogger, says the hormone has been \"amazing\" for her energy levels, concentration, and libido.Prescriptions for testosterone have surged. The latest data from the NHS Business Authority, compiled by the Care Quality Commission, shows that prescribing rose by 135% between 2021 and 2024.This increase comes at a time when sex drive across the UK appears to be waning. According to the National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), which questions more than 10,000 people roughly each decade with new figures due out later this year, the frequency of sex has steadily declined.In 1990, people aged 16 to 44 reported having sex an average of five times a month. By 2000, that had dropped to four times, and by 2010, to three. The next set of results are due later this year, and researchers expect the downward trend to continue — though they do not point to a singular reason for the decline.Against this backdrop, a debate is gathering pace. Can boosting testosterone improve libido, or is much of the attention solely hype, profit, and placebo?Diminishing sex driveAlan Reeves' experience of declining libido is just one example of a trend researchers say is becoming increasingly common.\"Over the years, we have noticed a drop across every demographic,\" says Soazig Clifton, Natsal academic director.\"There are fewer cohabiting couples than there were in the 90s, for example, so that could help explain the reduction in sex drive, but even when we looked specifically at that group, there was a decrease.\"In fact, some of the steepest declines in sexual frequency were among older, married or cohabiting couples.Clifton says it is difficult to say conclusively why sex drive seems to be declining.\"No data we have so far can really tell us with any confidence why, as a population, we are no longer having sex as much,\" she says.There are several studies which try to understand the reason, highlighting that the digital world could be a major factor, making it harder to switch off, as well as offering more choices of things to do.Our stress levels are also generally higher than they were 30 years ago, which may be a factor, says Dr Ben Davis, a GP and sex therapist.\"People have so much going on,\" he explains, \"There's tech obviously, but there's also an increase in stress, depression, loneliness […] all of these will add to a reduction in sex drives.\"And there is another possibility that has generated lots of interest online and become big business —  that low testosterone levels could be having an impact on sex drive.\"Testosterone levels in men are definitely reducing,\" says Prof Geoffrey Hackett, consultant urologist and member of the British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM).\"The rise in obesity, type 2 diabetes, the increasing number of people leading more sedentary lives — all of these reduce testosterone levels. And declining testosterone levels will be a factor in why our sex drive is diminishing.\"Several large scale studies over the past 20 years which have measured levels in men, suggest that testosterone levels have dropped, but Hackett stresses that the picture is nuanced — having low testosterone does increase the likelihood of a low libido, but that does not mean that everyone with low testosterone will have a low sex drive.Despite this complexity, tube stations, bus stops and social media feeds are now festooned with adverts like: Low libido? Brain fog? Tired? Time to get a testosterone check! Has your man lost his spark? It might be his hormones!So, can testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) really offer a cure‑all for low libido?Testosterone 'gave me my life back'Melissa Green has been taking testosterone for nearly a year. She says it not only gave \"her zest for life\" back – it saved her marriage.The 43-year-old says her low sex drive was having a huge impact on their relationship.Being perimenopausal, her GP had already prescribed her oestrogen and progesterone through hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but Green says the GP would not test her testosterone levels, saying she did not need that extra hormone.The NHS says it follows guidance from the National Institute of Care Excellence which states that testosterone should only be considered for women following a trial of HRT and all other factors which explain low sexual desire have been excluded. Those with concerns should speak to their GP, they add.Eventually, Green went to a private clinic, had blood tests done, and was told her levels were low. After taking her results back to her GP, she now receives some testosterone on the NHS, and a small top up through a private prescription.\"It's given me my life back. In some ways, I feel like I'm back in my 20s,\" she says, \"I've got more energy, I feel sharper, and my sex drive has come back.\"Melissa GreenMelissa Green and her husband, MarcusWhile some are effusive about the impact testosterone has on libido, others say it has had less welcome effects.Cheryl O'Malley was on testosterone for a year. She says while it may have helped return some of the energy she had lost during the menopause, it also boosted her sex drive too much, and left her with feelings of intense rage.\"I was really horny. I wanted to have sex with my husband, but at the same time I hated him.\"That's when you know this is not a good place to be, this was not me, I felt out of control.\"Rachel Mason says when she posts about TRT she finds \"many women are so scared to start testosterone, they worry they will become manly, develop facial hair, lose themselves.\"Rachel Mason @raysecommunityRachel Mason says testosterone has been \"amazing\" for her Mason says she has a \"particularly hairy part\" of her wrist where she applies her testosterone gel on a daily basis, but that the benefits she gets from the hormone are worth it.Along with increased body hair, TRT can come with a range of other side effects. For women, the most common effects are excess hair growth, acne and weight gain, which are usually reversible with reduction in dosage or discontinuation. Alopecia and deepening of the voice are rare with testosterone replacement.For men, it can cause side effects such as weight gain, painful and prolonged erections, male pattern baldness and mood swings. It can also lead to lower sperm production which can impact fertility. There are treatments that can help, but medical advice is recommended.'It's a gravy train'Some NHS GPs and secondary care consultants have told the BBC that private clinics are profiteering by selling TRT as a quick fix to a complicated problem.Dr Paula Briggs, an NHS consultant in sexual and reproductive health, describes it as a \"gravy train\" where people end up paying a lot of money for something they do not need.\"It's out of control,\" she says. \"The wellbeing industry has created this gap in the market they're using to their advantage.\"It's abusive.\"Private clinics, however, say they are improving people's lives by offering a service that the NHS is failing to provide.Jeff Foster, an NHS GP and medical director at Voy, a multi-million pound clinic specialising in men's health, says the private sector is filling a gap in care.\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone.\"TRT is offered via the NHS with most clinics functioning under either endocrinology or urology.Michael Kocsis has been offering TRT through his company, Balance My Hormones, since 2016. He says that he's seen demand grow \"exponentially\" over the past few years.Kocsis says some of his patients have gone through the NHS to be tested, and been told they do not have low levels of testosterone, so have decided to go private.\"Just because their level of testosterone might be a bit higher than the threshold set by the NHS, does not mean that TRT can't help them.\"It's not black and white, it's more nuanced than that.\"AFP via Getty Images\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone,\" says Jeff Foster, a medical director at VoyFor men, testosterone starts to decrease by around 1% from the age of 30 to 40. NHS advice states that this is a normal part of ageing and is unlikely to affect libido.Alan Reeves initially received TRT on the NHS. Two tests showed levels of 10nmol/L (nanomoles per litre) and 12nmol/L, and he was given a course of four injections, three weeks apart. But after his fourth treatment, Reeves was told it could no longer continue, \"without much of an explanation.\"\"I was back to square one,\" he explains. \"That's when I decided to go private.\"Alan Reeves @coachalreevesAlan Reeves is now a fitness and lifestyle coachSo, what is a healthy testosterone level for men? It differs depending on which organisation you ask and which study you read.Guidelines from the BSSM, which have been interpreted from major international studies, suggest that men with less than 12nmol/L, should be considered for TRT and will probably be showing symptoms of hypogonadism — a condition where the testes are not producing enough of this vital sex hormone.NHS guidance differs between trusts, but it states that a man with levels below 6 to 8nmol/L may have testosterone deficiency.For women, testosterone starts to decrease between the ages of 20 and 40 before it plateaus as they enter menopause. It's normal for levels to go down, but the question is how much that reduction has an impact on sex drive and overall wellbeing.There are tests available, but it's difficult to take accurate readings because, while testosterone is also vital for women, the amount needed is a lot less. And even if it is prescribed, it has to be given a \"off-label\" as there is currently no licensed treatments for women available on the NHS.More from InDepthBriggs is wary of the buzz around TRT. She says she has seen a huge surge in patients telling her they need testosterone because they feel low and not in the mood for sex anymore.\"They tell me they've done their research. Often that means they have seen the life changing impact this hormone has had on someone posting about it on social media.\"Just because it works for a celeb does not mean it works for the general population.\"She says GPs in her local area, Cheshire and Merseyside, are inundated with patients asking for testosterone checks. There are many, she says, that will leave with a TRT prescription, only to come back a few months later and say it's had very little impact.While it does help some people, she says, the proportion of those who say they need testosterone, and who will actually benefit from it, is small. Clinical evidence so far when it comes to women, suggests that TRT is only effective for treating those who are postmenopausal with low libido.Briggs says advertising by private clinics has \"blown everything out of proportion.\"\"I'm not against TRT when it's needed, what I am against is seeing it so over-promoted.\"GP Ben Davis also warns that TRT can have a placebo effect, leaving patients sometimes taking and paying for medication privately, that they do not need.Cheryl O'Malley has stopped taking testosterone. She says the intense anger and heightened sexual arousal she experienced during treatment have subsided, and her libido has returned to a level that feels comfortable for her.\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it,\" she says.'It's not a silver bullet'\"For some, medication can be really transformative,\" Davis says, but he adds that it is more than just handing out medication.\"GPs might not have time to discuss with a patient what is behind their low sex drive, could it be their relationship with their partner, could it be how they view themselves, could it be the sex they are currently having is longer turning them on?\"He says that there are so many factors that play into a low libido and testosterone is not the only answer.Cheryl O'Malley\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it [testosterone],\" says Cheryl O'Malley Alan Reeves, however, has been on TRT for seven years now and is prescribed testosterone by the private clinic, Balance My Hormones. He says his life has dramatically improved.\"My libido came back, so much so at first, I wanted sex every night for 10 nights.\"But now that's calmed down and I am just in a good place.\"Nonetheless, Reeves believes \"it is not a silver bullet\" and there is no point in taking testosterone without making other changes to your lifestyle.Otherwise, he says, it's like putting a Ferrari engine in a \"clapped out car\".\"I walk… taller now, that's partly down to testosterone, partly down to me.\"Additional reporting: Nat WrightTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Alpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (13:15-15:15)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in Tuesday's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Before them (09:15-11:15) the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.The first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "Actor Ross Kemp to return to EastEnders for short stint4 hours agoZahra FatimaBBCActor Ross Kemp is set to return to the show for a short stintActor Ross Kemp is set to return to BBC soap EastEnders, the broadcaster has announced.The 61-year-old will reprise his iconic role playing Grant Mitchell for a short stint, having briefly returned to Walford a year ago for the show's 40th anniversary.\"I'm truly delighted to be stepping back into Grant Mitchell's shoes and returning to EastEnders later this year,\" said Kemp in a statement, adding it was an \"honour\" to be part of two significant storylines.Executive producer Ben Wadey said the soap was \"absolutely thrilled\" to welcome Kemp back in \"the legendary role of Grant\".He added: \"The Mitchells remain one of EastEnders' defining dynasties, and we can't wait to see them reunited again. As always when Grant is around, drama inevitably follows him…\".Kemp plays one half of the soap's iconic Mitchell brothers, alongside Steve McFadden in the role of Phil Mitchell.Grant was last seen on screen in February 2025, when he briefly returned as part of the series' 40th anniversary - following concerns about brother Phil's mental health.At the end of that spell, Grant left Walford for his home in Portugal, but is set to return again after being called upon by estranged son Mark.In a statement, a spokesperson from the soap said: \"This year, Grant is called upon by his estranged son Mark to return to Walford, marking the first time the pair will be reunited since Mark learned the truth about his true parentage.\"Grant's arrival on Albert Square also comes amidst the deteriorating health of long time family friend Nigel. While full details of Grant's comeback remain under wraps, viewers can expect explosive drama.\"Kemp said that \"it's especially an honour to be part of Nigel's powerful ongoing dementia storyline\", which he says \"holds deep personal meaning for me due to a close family connection in real life\".Kemp rose to prominence playing Grant throughout the 1990s, before pursuing other acting roles and fronting a series of documentaries on gangs.He returned to the soap for several episodes between 2005-2006, before again making a comeback in 2016 for a number of guest appearances.",

    "body": "8 hours agoA number of Sunday's papers focus on the UK saying Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from dart frog toxins. Navalny died suddenly while incarcerated in a Siberian prison in February 2024, after being an outspoken critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin for years. The Sunday People says that Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper led the probe into his death, and \"points [her] finger\" at the Kremlin. According to the Russian news agency Tass, Moscow has dismissed the finding as \"an information campaign\"The Telegraph says that the poison responsible for killing Navalny was developed from an Ecuadorian frog, which it says serves as proof that Russia possesses illegal chemical weapons. Navalny's death has been investigated by Porton Down scientists, the paper says, with biological samples smuggled from his cell to the UK shortly after his deathThe Mail on Sunday leads with a call for police to investigate Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and his role as a UK trade envoy, saying it has compiled a \"dossier of evidence\" against the former prince. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously strenuously denied any wrongdoing relating to convicted sex offender Jeffrey EpsteinThe Mirror leads on \"Wills' agony\", and features a full-page rendition of a new photograph shared by the Prince and Princess of Wales for Valentines Day. The paper says Prince William was \"in a state of disbelief\" when he learned of Catherine's cancer diagnosis, and that he \"told pals it was brutal and completely disorienting\"Convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein \"lured\" actress and model Donna Air, the Sun on Sunday alleges. The front page also highlights an interview with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, with the headline: \"It's been tough but I'll fight on\"The Sunday Express claims the rise in pension age later this year will \"send 115,000 elderly into poverty\". The paper says it has based its figures on the previous rise in pension threshold from 65 to 66, which saw the proportion of 65-year-old's living in poverty rise from one in 10 to one in four\"Dr Ice and the skeleton crew\" reads the headline of the Observer, referencing Matt Weston's Winter Olympics gold in the skeleton on FridayThe Star says a woman is suing TV presenter and farmer Jeremy Clarkson, claiming she tripped and fell in his pub car park - the front page reads \"Clarkson's harm\". The paper says he has been contacted for commentThe Sunday Telegraph reports that the Defence Secretary, John Healey, is being lined up by Labour rebels to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the party leadership. The paper says Mr Healey is seen as the 'unity' candidate drawing support from all sides of the party. The moderate wing of MPs is said to believe that the Health Secretary Wes Streeting has become too \"toxic\", after he published his Whatsapp messages with Lord Mandelson.The Mail on Sunday leads on more claims about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor when he was a UK trade envoy. The paper says that documents released by the US Department of Justice show he leaked sensitive information about the Royal Bank of Scotland, to one of Jeffrey Epstein's advisers in 2010. The Mail says there is now a \"clamour of demands\" for a full investigation by police and ministers into his conduct while in the role. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing.Meanwhile, the Sunday Times quotes the Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales, Stephen Parkinson, saying that \"nobody is above the law\" as, the paper says, pressure grows for a full investigation into the former Duke of York. Mr Parkinson tells the paper he has \"total confidence\" that detectives will examine any relevant evidence that would point to criminality.Ministers are set to delay publication of the government's definition of Islamophobia, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The paper says they want to wait until after the Gorton and Denton by-election; a Labour source explains that the government is worried about, in their words, \"the Muslim fallout\". The Department of Housing, Communities and Local government tells the Telegraph the story is speculation and it's carefully considering the recommendations of a working group.The Sunday Mirror carries extracts from a new biography of the Prince and Princess of Wales which describes how William was in a \"state of disbelief\" before he and his wife told their children she had cancer. The book's author and the paper's Royal Editor, Russell Myers, reveals how Prince William told friends the diagnosis was \"sudden, brutal and completely disorientating\".Charities warn in the Sunday Express that a rise in the state pension age will plunge more than a hundred thousand people into poverty. The paper says the pensionable age of 66 will rise by a month in April and keep increasing until it reaches 67 in March 2028. Age UK tells the Express that many those affected are not aware of the changes and it will \"crush a generation\" struggling with soaring bills. The Department for Work and Pensions says it's committed to tackling poverty among all ages.A UK exam board chief tells the Observer that children could be taking half of their GCSEs and A-levels on screens, within a decade. Colin Hughes, from AQA, says replacing some pen and paper exams with digital assessments would make the system \"more secure\" and \"fairer\" particularly for children with special educational needs.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "10 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesObama seen on the campaign trail in November 2025Former US President Barack Obama has indirectly addressed a racist video posted on President Donald Trump's social media, telling a podcast host that the \"shame\" and \"decorum\" that once guided public officials is now lost.The offensive video included a clip depicting Obama and his wife Michelle as apes, which drew widespread criticism from Democrats and Republicans. The White House initially defended the video, calling backlash \"fake outrage\". The post was later blamed on a staff member and deleted.Obama spoke to liberal podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, who asked the first black US president about the tone of political discourse. Cohen cited Trump's post among several recent controversies. The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was included at the end of a video Trump's Truth Social account shared containing unfounded claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. The post led to outrage from politicians, including from senior members of Trump's Republican party.Senator Tim Scott - the only black Republican senator - described it as \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The clip recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys, and appears to have been taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October.Trump has told reporters that he \"didn't see\" the part of the video that showed the Obamas.\"I didn't make a mistake,\" he told reporters when asked whether he planned to apologise.The 47-minute podcast featuring Obama was released on Saturday. The episode begins with the host asking him to comment on US \"discourse\", which he says \"has devolved to a level of cruelty that we haven't seen before\".Cohen notes claims by the White House that the \"victims\" of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are \"domestic terrorists\", and adds \"just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face, on an ape's body\".Obama responds by saying: \"It's important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling.\"It is true that it gets attention. It's true that it's a distraction.\"But Obama said that while travelling around the US, he found himself meeting people who \"still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness\".\"There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television,\" he continued. \"And what is true is that there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? \"That's been lost.\"He did not mention Trump by name in his response.During the interview, Obama spoke about a range of issues. He praised protesters who have peacefully organised against immigration operations, discussed electoral redistricting and talked about his presidential library, which is due to open in Chicago next year.Watch: Trump says he 'didn't see' racist clip depicting Obamas as apes",

    "body": "2 hours agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentUK ParliamentJosh Simons previously said he had asked the firm to look into a \"suspected illegal hack\" which was unrelated to any UK journalistA Labour group which helped Sir Keir Starmer get elected as Labour leader commissioned a report that investigated the personal and religious background of a Sunday Times journalist, the BBC understands.Labour Together paid APCO Worldwide at least £30,000 to \"investigate the sourcing, funding and origins\" of a story about undeclared donations at the think tank before the general election.It delivered a report, codenamed \"Operation Cannon\", which included claims about a journalist who wrote the story and his faith, relationships and upbringing.Sources told the BBC the US public affairs firm's report included information about journalist Gabriel Pogrund's Jewish beliefs and claims about his ideological position. It also claimed, the sources said, that Pogrund's previous reporting, including on the royal family, \"could be seen as destabilising to the UK and also in the interests of Russia's strategic foreign policy objectives\".Pogrund is currently the Sunday Times Whitehall editor, and was named Political Journalist of the Year and News Journalist of the Year at the 2025 Press Awards.The report was allegedly prepared by a former Sunday Times employee who now works for APCO Worldwide.It was commissioned by the then-head of Labour Together, Josh Simons, who is now a Cabinet Office minister.In a contract addressed to Simons, seen by BBC News, APCO Worldwide agreed to investigate \"the sourcing, funding and origins\" of the Sunday Times reporting, as well the journalist, Paul Holden, who has since published a critical book on Keir Starmer and his former chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, and Matt Taibbi, an American reporter.McSweeney was a former head of Labour Together.Josh Simons said APCO Worldwide had gone beyond what was asked of them and welcomed an investigation launched by the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA).\"I was surprised and shocked to read the report extended beyond the contract by including unnecessary information on Gabriel Pogrund. I asked for this information to be removed before passing the report to GCHQ,\" he said.A redacted version of the report, with the details about Pogrund removed, was passed to the National Cyber Security Centre because of the concerns about the hack, sources close to Simons said. They added he had not shared the report with anyone else outside of Labour Together.Alison Phillips, the CEO of Labour Together, and who joined after the APCO report was commissioned and delivered, said: \"I am committed to ensuring Labour Together aspires to the highest standards of probity at all times.\"We stand ready to support the PRCA [and other relevant governance bodies] with its review of this issue.\"Some Labour MPs have expressed their concerns about the story.Karl Turner, the Labour MP for East Hull, said the prime minister should look into the matter.\"Plausible deniability is only plausible until it isn't,\" he posted on X.The former shadow chancellor under Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, said he had repeatedly asked Labour's general secretary, Hollie Ridley, for an independent inquiry into the claims.\"[It's] clear to me as Secretary of the NUJ's [National Union of Journalist's] Parliamentary Group if true this is unacceptable,\" he posted.",

And we don't understand why that is, but we have to try and help those people thrive as much as the young people who are going to grow out of this.\"The review was commissioned after concerns about the treatment of growing numbers of children and young people with worries about their gender, particularly at the Tavistock Clinic in LondonWhen asked how many children with distress about their gender would experience that same distress into adulthood, Cass said it was impossible to assess precisely, but it would be a \"really tiny number\".The paediatrician added: \"When the clinic started, there were about 50 children a year in the UK, and then by the time I started my review it had shot up to 3,500 a year. \"We tried very hard to find out from the Tavistock what happened to the ones who didn't go on medical pathway. They just didn't follow them up and they didn't have that data. \"So that's one chunk of children who don't go on a medical pathway, then there are all the ones that me and parents and teachers will tell you about who go through two or three years of gender questioning and then desist.\" Asked if children had been let down by an adult-led debate, Cass said \"absolutely\", adding they \"were also caught up in all the issues about single-sex spaces and sports and safe areas for women which were actually not to do with the children but they were somehow part of a football within it\".\"That's a real shame that children have been weaponised.\"The vast majority of people in the middle of the debate were silent while the \"people at the extremes\" and rhetoric in the media had been \"frightening for young people,\" the clinician said.She added that some activists for trans rights had been \"so strident that it's made it more difficult for trans people themselves who are just trying to live under the radar\", while equally people who had taken the view no-one should ever transition had \"similarly made it difficult\".Cass, who praised the government's guidance for schools in England published earlier this week, said it was important for there to be caution about very young children beginning the transitioning process because \"if they socially transition too early we think they can get locked onto a trajectory that may not have been the correct natural trajectory for them\".Asked about why the number of children and young people who have gender dysphoria is increasing, Cass said it was \"complex\" but there was a different cultural context, with people \"less locked into gender stereotypes\". \"I think what has kind of misled children is the belief that if you are not a typical girl, if you like playing with trucks, or boys who like dressing up or that you have same-sex attraction that means that you're trans and actually it's not like that but those are all normal variations,\" she said.\"I think children and young people were being given a narrative that it's not okay to be anything but absolutely typical of the other girls on Instagram.\"Cass also said it was \"vital\" that a controversial trial of puberty blockers for under-16s went ahead, or \"we're going to have ongoing charlatans just handing out inappropriate drugs\", pointing to the private sale of the drugs - particularly online.Puberty blockers - which suppress the hormones that cause puberty - are often prescribed to children questioning their gender as a way of stopping physical changes such as breast development or facial hair.They were banned for under-18s after the Cass review raised concerns about their safety, but a clinical trial to assess their safety was announced last year.Campaigners have questioned the ethics of it, while the charity Stonewall said it was \"vitally important\" that all LGBTQ+ people have access to high-quality, evidence-based and timely healthcare.Cass denied that she had stopped young people and families getting the help they needed, saying the new centres would make sure people had \"individualised treatment\".\"The biggest hurdle at the moment is they are still working through the big backlog,\" she said.",

The 18-year-old student turned to BookTok - a community of book lovers on TikTok - in her bid to reduce her screentime. She is not the only young person to spend hours glued to her screen - statistics suggest 18 to 24-year-olds average six hours and 20 minutes online every day. And less than a third of young Scots say they enjoy reading in their spare time. But could social media trends like BookTok persuade them to put down their phones, and pick up a book instead? BookTok is a TikTok community where users share book reviews, recommendations, and literature-themed content such as \"what would Lizzy Bennet wear?\"It is especially popular for genres like romance, young adult fiction and \"romantasy,\" often turning older books into sudden bestsellers.Some of the most popular BookTok videos have more than eight million interactions.Rebecca Yarros has found success with books including Onyx Storm, part of her Empyrean series which is currently being adapted for TV.Meanwhile, Sarah J. Maas has developed a cult following, particularly for A Court of Thorns and Roses.Amy LairdAmy has made reading a regular habit since finding BookTokAmy felt she was spending so much time on her phone, she was missing out on real life experiences. \"I was averaging about seven hours a day and thought I'm experiencing life through this device where reality is being curated for me,\" she told BBC News.Since turning to BookTok, she has made reading a regular habit.\"On average, I'd say I read every other day, even if it's just 10 pages of a novel per night,\" she said.\"My favourite books are Pride and Prejudice, The Handmaid's Tale and Gone With the Wind.\"Some BookTok videos have racked up eight million \"likes\"UK adults spend four hours and 30 minutes online each day, according to a 2025 report by Ofcom - 10 minutes more than in 2024.People aged 18 to 24 were found to be most active online, averaging six hours and 20 minutes daily.A study by the National Literacy Trust found that in Scotland only three in 10 people from the age of eight to 18 enjoyed reading in their free time and  one in six read daily in their free time.Isabella Potamitis BriozzoIsabella reads for hours before she goes to bedBookTok helped decrease screen time for 19‑year‑old student Isabella Potamitis Briozzo.\"I usually read for two to two-and-a-half hours before I go to bed,\" she said. \"And if I have any spare time I try to read as much as I can.\"Isabella discovered her favourite series - The Caraval by Stephanie Garber - through BookTok and \"just got addicted immediately\".\"Some of my favourite books come from BookTok,\" she said. \"Usually over the holidays, I tend to go days where I just read and that's all I do, it's just something that helps me relax,\" she added.James GreenJames like to use BookTok to get summaries of booksJames Green, a 20-year-old student at Manchester Metropolitan University, has recently being diagnosed with ADHD.He recognises that his attention difficulties exist without social media, but believes platforms like BookTok can genuinely help rebuild reading habits. \"It definitely helped me and inspired me to read more,\" he said.  \"It actually helped me put down my phone, because it made me want to read a lot more.\"He added: \"Short form content is helpful in giving a useful but concise insight into different books, which is why it is a good way to form a reading habit\"Meanwhile Caroline Cronjaeger, a 25-year-old student, is writing her dissertation on Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway - a book she found on YouTube.\"I read quite a lot, from two to three hours day,\" she said.\"Even more if I have a lot of free time and a really good book in my hands.\"Mrs Dalloway is also the reason why I chose to study English literature.\"",

    "body": "An abduction, a Bitcoin demand and a TV icon - why Nancy Guthrie's case has gripped the US6 hours agoDavid WillisTucson, ArizonaGetty ImagesBefore the sun rose over a barren desert landscape, YouTuber Jimmy Williams watched as hundreds of subscribers took to his online chat room.A laptop balanced precariously on his knees, his iPhone framed by a ring light, he spends several hours a day dissecting the details of Nancy Guthrie's sudden disappearance with his rapidly growing audience of fellow true crime enthusiasts.Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and authorities believe she was taken against her will in the early hours of 1 February.Williams is just one of dozens of curious observers and amateur sleuths who have descended on the area.The influx of spectators has turned a quiet mid-size city, popular with retirees, into a global media spectacle.Police have yet to identify any suspects in her abduction, and her daughter – the Today show presenter Savannah Guthrie – has repeatedly begged the public for help in finding her mother.A reassuring face on morning television in the US, Savannah Guthrie now finds herself at the same intersection of hope and dread that has defined many of her interviewees.This time, however, the roles have been reversed, and instead of asking questions she is the one awaiting answers.Breakfast television affords its presenters a special sense of intimacy with their audience, with segments often focusing on human-interest stories.Savannah Guthrie spent her childhood in Tucson, and in November she even invited people into her mum's home for a segment on the Today Show.Kelly Himes lives several miles from Nancy Guthrie's home in the shadow of the Catalina Mountains. Like a growing number of Tucson residents, she felt compelled to stop and say a prayer alongside the growing array of flowers at the end of her driveway.\"Nancy's the same age as my mum, the same height as my mum, and she's got the same hair,\" Himes told the BBC. \"She lives alone just like my mum does. This is someone who could be anybody's mother.\"Savannah Guthrie's fame has proved to be a double-edged sword. As well as drawing an unprecedented amount of attention and resources to the search for her mother, it has also inspired feverish speculation and given rise to a string of false leads.Getty ImagesTwo weeks after Nancy Guthrie's disappearance investigators revealed they had found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from her home.The sheriff's department also said media reports that a glove was found inside her home or on the property were inaccurate.To Williams' growing audience speculation over the case only heightens its intrigue.Since Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, Williams' YouTube channel Dollyvision has gained more than 8,000 new subscribers.Interest in Nancy's disappearance was \"massive\", he said.\"You expect kidnappings to involve cash in a bag dropped off somewhere remote, and then the police turn up and arrest everyone. This is different. This is like a 'new age' of kidnapping.\"The days of ransom demands made up of letters cut from the pages of a magazine seem a thing of the past.Secure servers, secret IP addresses and untraceable Bitcoin accounts have changed the face of one of the world's oldest crimes, but a former FBI hostage negotiator, Chip Massey, said he believed Nancy Guthrie's kidnappers would soon be caught.Referring to the video images of a masked man on her doorstep shortly before she disappeared, he said somebody somewhere would recognise the suspect based either on their behaviour or their body language.\"The attention this case has generated is unprecedented,\" he said, \"and while a mask can conceal a face it can't conceal a person.\"Getty ImagesMissing person flyers featuring pictures of Nancy's smiling face, combined with motorway billboards promoting the FBI's tip line have made this case impossible to ignore, even for those who don't watch the news. The White House said the FBI would be giving the investigation its \"full resources\".\"So many people now seem to be engaged with this search that it is going to very hard for this individual to function. That sort of scrutiny makes it impossible for a suspect to move, and creates a sense of the world 'closing in' on them. That's when they start to make mistakes,\" Massey said.Yellow ribbons now adorn the trees around Nancy Guthrie's home,  but as days pass with no word of her whereabouts the hope of an emotional homecoming is rapidly giving way to a deepening sense of dread.",

Dumfries and Galloway Council also approved a community asset transfer in 2019, which paved the way to realise its \"inclusive community vision\".Stories you may have missedThe report recognised the park for its strong community engagement, sensory‑rich play and accessibility.Now its model for \"small‑scale, high‑impact transformation\" could be replicated across the world.Dr Andrzej Zieleniec is chairman of Include Us, which runs the park. He said the recognition was very welcome.\"I think it is amazing that a wee park in Dumfries has come to the attention and been recognised in such a prestigious report,\" he said.\"Being featured in this report positions Catherine Street Inclusive Park as a significant contribution to global thinking on inclusive urban design.\"It demonstrates how local, community‑driven initiatives can inform international policy and practice.\"Include UsSites in Jakarta, Barcelona and Nairobi were highlighted alongside Dumfries in the reportThe park is close to Dumfries town centre, across from its main library and Dumfries AcademyDevelopment manager, Lisa Callander-Bone, said they were \"honoured\" to feature in the report.\"It demonstrates that when communities come together with purpose and imagination, we can create places that change lives, not just here in Dumfries, but as part of a wider global story about inclusion, equity and children's rights,\" she said.\"This accolade is for all who have supported our inclusion vision.\"",

    "body": "'Trump will be gone in three years': Top Democrats try to reassure Europe8 hours agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent,  in Mar-a-LagoEPAGavin Newsom, Democratic governor of California, told attendees that \"Donald Trump is temporary\"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was the centre of attention at the Munich Security Summit, as European leaders wondered apprehensively what tone he would strike in his remarks on Saturday. While his speech did not fully allay their concerns, it has been viewed as a reassurance to allies that while US relations may have frayed under Donald Trump, they will not break.Rubio's was not the only American political voice at the security summit, however. And even if the secretary of state's remarks had not been so well-received – if he had sharply criticised Europeans the way Vice-President JD Vance did at the conference last year – there were other American politicians doing their best impression of the Persian poet, counselling: \"This too shall pass\".\"If there's nothing else I can communicate today,\" California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a conference event on Friday, \"Donald Trump is temporary. He'll be gone in three years.\"Newsom was just one of dozens of American legislators and governors in attendance – including some Democrats, like the Californian, who may contend for their party's 2028 presidential nomination.ReutersNew York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the biggest attractions at the conferenceMany emphasised that the US would continue to be a strong partner with Europe – lines similar to those offered by Rubio, but unleavened by his criticism of cultural decline on the continent.\"The reason we're here is to provide reassurance that we understand how important our European allies are,\" Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire said.A Republican in attendance, Senator Thom Tillis, echoed her, noting that the US and Europe were not in a \"civil war\". He cautioned American allies not to get caught up in the \"rhetoric of American politics\".That has been easier said than done recently, as Trump has imposed steep tariffs on many US trading partners, and he and some of his top aides have been blunt in their desire to reshape the international order, use American military power and refocus American foreign policy on the western hemisphere.The president's designs on Greenland – which he repeated before departing the White House for a weekend in Florida on Friday – have been only the most jarring example of the shift in the American outlook.Trump's willingness to push boundaries and test the limits of his power has not been limited to foreign affairs. And several Democrats took time in Munich to address more domestic concerns.Virginia Senator Mark Warner warned that the president's talk of nationalising elections and instituting stringent identity requirements for voting via executive order mean the freedom and fairness of November's midterm congressional elections are at stake.\"I never thought I would say that in 2026 America,\" he said.Trump has defended his effort – and the SAVE act, which would implement a national voter identification requirement legislatively – as both popular with a sizable majority of Americans and necessary to prevent voter impersonation at the ballot box.Senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin, who were the focus of a recent unsuccessful indictment attempt by the Department of Justice for their video urging US soldiers to disregard \"illegal\" orders, both commented on being in the administration's spotlight.America, Slotkin said, was \"going through something profound\", before adding, \"We'll get through it.\"ReutersSenator Mark Kelly of Arizona spoke at the Munich Security ConferenceCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proved to be one of the biggest attractions at the conference beyond Rubio. She drew a line between growing wealth inequality – a focus of her domestic policy agenda since she won an upset victory in Congress in 2018 - and the rise of authoritarian governments.\"It is of the utmost urgency that we get our economic houses in order and deliver material gains for the working class,\" she said. \"Otherwise, we will fall into a more isolated world governed by authoritarians who also do not deliver to working people.\"While Ocasio-Cortez comes from a different wing of the Democratic Party, her view about the need for western democracies to provide a compelling alternative to authoritarian governments was similar to one expressed by Joe Biden during his presidency.Trump, with his \"America First\" foreign policy and talk of preserving Western culture, provided a decidedly different view of world affairs. And in 2024, a plurality of Americans voted to return Trump to the White House, setting off a tumultuous year in which Vance's confrontational Munich speech was just the scene-setter.While Rubio has smoothed over some rough edges, the Democrats who made the trip to Munich attempted to provide a more distinct counterpoint.\"Right now, Europe just wants us to be better, right? And I think this has been a very good conference to reassure nerves,\" Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego said. \"Sometimes you have to remind them that this is not all Trump ... We're still here.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoAdam GoldsmithandTom McArthurGetty ImagesRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin, the UK and European allies have said.Two years on from the death of Navalny at a Siberian penal colony, Britain and its allies have blamed the Kremlin following analysis of material samples found on his body.Speaking from the Munich Security Conference, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said \"only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity\" to use the poison while Navalny was imprisoned in Russia.According to Tass news agency Moscow has dismissed the finding as \"an information campaign\", but Cooper said there is no explanation for the toxin, called epibatidine, being found.While Cooper announced the findings, a joint statement was issued by the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.Cooper met with Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya at the conference this weekend.\"Russia saw Navalny as a threat,\" Cooper said at the event.\"By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition,\" she added.In the statement the allies said: \"Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.\"Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia.\"There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny's body.\"The Foreign Office said the UK has informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of Russia's alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Praising Navalny's \"huge courage\", UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"his determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy\".\"I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin's murderous intent,\" he added.Watch: 'Only Russian state had means' to poison Navalny, says Yvette CooperFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot also said his country \"pays tribute\" to Navalny, who he suggested was \"killed for his fight in favour of a free and democratic Russia\".Navalny – an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's most vociferous opposition leader - died suddenly in jail on 16 February 2024 at the age of 47.In 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.'Extremely rare' toxinEpibatidine, the toxin the UK and its European allies have said was used to kill Alexei Navalny, was first derived from a group of poison dart frogs native to northern South America.Though epibatidine has previously been investigated as a pain killer and for relief from painful inflammatory conditions of the lungs, it has been deemed too toxic to use clinically.Speaking to BBC Russian, toxicology expert Jill Johnson said it was \"200 times more potent than morphine\". By acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause \"muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death,\" Johnson said.The extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in one wild frog species in tiny quantities, and only when the frog eats a specific diet, she told the BBC.Researchers believe the frogs acquire it through their diet because animals from different habitats have displayed different levels of the toxin, and those raised in captivity have none.Johnson described it as an \"incredibly rare way to poison a person\".She added: \"Finding the wild frog in the correct location that is eating the specific diet to create the correct alkaloids is almost impossible...almost.\"German Federal Foreign Office via Getty ImagesNavalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently claimed that her husband was poisoned by RussiaBefore Saturday's announcement, Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently argued that her husband was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024.She did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results.Reacting to the announcement, Navalnaya said: \"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof.\"I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,\" she added.According to the state-run news agency Tass, Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: \"All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to the penal colony.According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk at his Siberian penal colony, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.",

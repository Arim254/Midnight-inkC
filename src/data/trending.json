The newspaper says the woman was not a contestant or professional dancer on the show, but had met the man due to his participation in the competition.In a statement, Hertfordshire Police said: \"A man was released on police bail under investigation having been arrested in London on Monday 13 October on suspicion of rape.\"The police force said the allegations related to an incident which happened in Hertfordshire.\"Meanwhile inquiries by officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Public Protection team will continue.\"Given the nature of the allegations, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this time.\"It comes after another man involved with the hit BBC dance show was also arrested on suspicion of rape in August.The Metropolitan Police said the man was also suspected of \"non-consensual intimate image abuse\".It is not known what role that individual had in the programme.Strictly, which has aired since 2004 and is predominantly filmed at Elstree Studios, has faced multiple controversies over the past few years relating to the behaviour of some of its professionals and celebrity guests.Separately, the BBC launched an investigation earlier this year into alleged drug use by two of the show's stars, who have not been named.In August, the Met said it was investigating allegations of drug use on the hit dance show.",

South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said the absence of the US at G20 was \"their loss\" and added that \"boycott politics doesn't work\".None of South Africa's political parties - including those that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general - have claimed that there is a genocide in South Africa.Ramaphosa's government has said that claims of a white genocide are \"widely discredited and unsupported by reliable evidence\".",

    "body": "52 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA surrealist painting from the 1940s by Frida Kahlo has sold for $54.7m (£41.8m) - shattering the auction record for an artwork by a female artist. The painting went for more than 1,000 times its original auction price in 1980, after a tense bidding battle between two collectors, according to the Sotheby's auction house.The auction also broke the previous record for the highest amount paid for a Kahlo portrait, which sold for $34.9 million in 2021.The work - titled El sueño (la cama), which is translated to The dream (The bed)  - depicts Kahlo asleep in a canopy bed beneath a skeleton entwined with dynamite.It marks one of the Mexican artist's most \"psychologically charged\" self portraits, Sotheby's said, and was painted during a turbulent chapter in Kahlo's life - the year her former lover was assassinated and shortly after her divorce and remarriage.Kahlo, who died in 1954, is widely regarded as one of the greatest painters in the past century and became known for her personal portraits.Her work often conveyed her painful relationship with her body, disabled through polio in her childhood and serious injuries following a bus accident.Few could have imagined El sueño (la cama) selling for $55m when it was first went under the hammer at Sotheby's in 1980 for $51,000, the auction house's head of Latin American art, Anna Di Stasi, said. \"This record-breaking result shows just how far we have come, not only in our appreciation of Frida Kahlo's genius, but in the recognition of women artists at the very highest level of the market,\" she added.El sueño (la cama) is one of the few Kahlo paintings in public markets since the Mexican authorities declared her artworks as artistic monuments in the 1980s, preventing them from being exported without authorisation.Kahlo's story was adapted into a biographical film starring Salma Hayek in 2002, telling her story of her rocky relationship with her husband, artist Diego Rivera, and her injuries.The previous highest price at auction for a work by a female artist is Georgia O'Keeffe's Jimson Weed / White Flower No.1, which was sold at Sotheby's in 2014 for $44m.

    "body": "Energy price cap fall expected as temperatures plunge4 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesRegulator Ofgem will announce the next energy price cap later on Friday, with prices for millions of households expected to fall slightly at the height of winter.Gas and electricity bills remain relatively high, and the sudden drop in temperature has brought the costs to the forefront of people's minds.The next price cap will take effect at the start of January, and affect those on variable tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland.Ofgem will announce the details at 07:00 GMT. Analysts have predicted a 1% fall in prices.The cap sets the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity, not the total bill - so those who use more energy, pay more.A 2% increase in October to the end of December means a household using a typical amount of energy is currently paying £1,755 a year.The Ofgem cap is illustrated with a household using a \"typical\" amount of 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. However, the amount used varies significantly between households, so the best way to calculate the change is to work out the percentage change from your own usual annual bill.Analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted a 1% fall from the current cap to take effect in January, but for prices to then head back up in April.The forecaster, widely respected for the accuracy of its predictions, said the main driver of energy bills was shifting from sky-high wholesale prices to the cost of overhauling and maintaining the country's energy networks.Charities say they are seeing people owing increasing levels of unpaid bills and charges to suppliers. The total amount owed has reached a record £4.4bn, prompting plans from Ofgem to ensure energy companies write off some of that debt. Up to £500m could be knocked off the total under plans that regulator Ofgem wants to take effect early next year.Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents suppliers, anyone facing difficulties paying should contact their energy provider as soon as possible.\"We know that far too many people are struggling to pay for the energy they need to use,\" she said.But she added that suppliers could help with efficient appliances, tailoring the tariff to customers' needs or ensuring people were on the correct benefits.The government has hinted at extra cost-of-living support in the Budget on 26 November.In the meantime, as the cold weather sets in, various tips are available to keep people warm while controlling costs, including clothing, insulation and heating rooms people are in rather than the whole home.",

    "body": "10 hours agoShiona McCallumSenior Tech Reporter Online marketplace Vinted says it has removed sexually explicit adverts, after a mum reported seeing a video depicting what she believed to be a pornographic scene while browsing for clothes. Kirsty Hopley, 44, from Carlisle, said she was searching the app for a dressing gown when the ad popped up.She was sitting next to her teenage daughter at the time.Ms Hopley reported the content to Vinted and later contacted Ofcom.She told BBC News the video, which started playing automatically, showed a \"sickening\" graphic and violent sexual encounter. The law and criminology teacher said she had installed content filters on her home internet and was shocked to see such material on the e-commerce platform.\"I probably won't buy anything from there again, which is disappointing as I love Vinted,\" she said. \"But I don't want to see content like that.\" The platform, which has no age restrictions, has recently faced scrutiny in France after reports that some sellers were using the site to direct users to adult content.The advert Ms Hopley saw was promoting DramaWave, a mobile app that produces short-form scripted stories for social platforms.Many of their series appear to follow romance storylines over multiple episodes of just a few minutes each. Vinted said the adverts have now been blocked. A spokesperson said the platform has a \"zero-tolerance policy for unsolicited sexual communications and the promotion of sexual content\". \"This includes prohibiting sexually explicit advertisements on our platform,\" they said. \"Where listings or ads are found to violate these rules, we will take action, including blocking or removing them.\"The BBC has approached DramaWave for comment. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) told BBC News their rules were clear \"that ads must not cause harm or offence\". \"Harmful or degrading portrayals of women in ads are completely unacceptable, and we take a zero-tolerance approach to this kind of content,\" they said in a statement.They added: \"We encourage anyone with concerns about an ad they've seen to get in touch.\"Ms Hopley told BBC News she expected the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA), which includes laws to protect children from explicit content online, to have prevented such material appearing on her phone.However the only paid-for advertising that is in scope of the OSA is fraudulent content.

    "body": "Biggest prostate cancer screening trial in decades begins in UK2 hours agoFergus WalshMedical EditorGettyA major prostate cancer screening trial aimed at finding the best way to detect the disease has been launched in the UK.  The first letters have been sent out from GPs inviting men to join the study, the biggest of its kind in decades.The £42 million Transform trial is funded by Prostate Cancer UK and the National Institute for Health and Care Research.Hashim Ahmed, trial chief investigator, said: \"Transform is truly game-changing… the start of recruitment today marks a pivotal step towards getting the results men urgently need to make prostate cancer diagnosis safe and more effective so that we can unlock the potential of prostate cancer screening in the UK.\"The trial will recruit men aged 50-74, with a lower age limit of 45 for black men, who have twice the risk of developing and dying from prostate cancer compared with white men.It won't be possible to volunteer for the trial, but Prostate Cancer UK is strongly encouraging anyone who receives a letter to take part.The trial will look at how rapid MRI scans of the prostate could be combined with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood tests in order to improve the accuracy of cancer diagnosis.Currently, men over 50 can request a PSA test, which looks for abnormally high levels of protein in the blood, but this is unreliable, picking up many prostate cancers that would never need treatment, and missing others that do.The trial will also use spit tests, which extract DNA from saliva, to see if this is more accurate than PSA readings.Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said current diagnostics methods don't find enough aggressive cancers, and cause too much harm.\"We hear from men who were diagnosed late, whose lives may have been saved if they'd been screened or tested earlier. We also hear from a lot of men who have suffered incontinence or impotence because of treatments they had,\" said Mr Hobbs. \"Some of those men didn't need to have those treatments, and that's the harm that we need to try to avoid.\"'If we want to stop 12,000 men dying early every year, it's the obvious solution' Danny Burkey, 60, from west Yorkshire, is terminally ill with prostate cancer. By the time his condition was diagnosed four years ago, it had already spread to his bones.The former teacher and father of three told the BBC that if men were offered regular screening from the age of 50, his disease might have been caught when it was still curable.\"I think that a screening programme would be a game changer. If you want men to not be in the position I'm in, and if we want to stop 12,000 men dying early every year, it's the obvious solution.\"Danny BurkeyDanny, 60, with wife Jeanette, was diagnosed with prostate cancer four years ago - but it had already spread to his bones The opening of the trial comes a week before the National Screening Committee (NSC) - an expert body that advises the NHS - is due to announce whether to recommend the introduction of screening for the disease, the most common cancer in men in the UK.Previously, the NSC had concluded that the harms of screening outweighed the benefits.Initial results of the Transform trial are due in around two years, after which it will be expanded by up to 300,000 men across the UK.",

The BBC has approached Chilean authorities for further comment.Visit Isles of ScillyVictoria Bond was killed along with four others in the stormMr Aldridge, from Newquay, said the conditions during the storm had been \"really rough and freezing\".The group he was part of had tried to keep moving, but no-one came to rescue them, he said.\"I was shocked,\" he said. \"I went and spoke to the staff personally and said, 'We're missing a friend, we think she's still on the mountain, you need to get a search party'.\"Chilean President Gabriel Boric Font said search and rescue teams had worked in \"intense\" snowfall and winds reaching 118mph (190km/h).The Chilean Forestry Corporation said its priority was to relocate people who had been on the park's O Circuit hiking route, which Ms Bond and Mr Aldridge's group were visiting.Carabineros de Chile/ReutersA snowstorm has led to search and rescue missions in the Patagonia area of ChileHowever, Mr Aldridge said park staff \"didn't seem to take it seriously\".\"They moved us aside and said they needed to check in new guests and get dinner ready,\" he said.Mr Aldridge said the group ended up having to hike out of the park over three days despite being injured.\"We're sleep-deprived, shocked, traumatised, and grieving,\" he said. \"We were like, 'Why are we not getting the help?

    "body": "34 minutes agoLaura Gozzi and James ChaterUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is ready for \"honest work\" with the US after receiving a draft peace plan to end the war with Russia. Several US media outlets report that under the plan, Kyiv would give up areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine that it still controls, cut the size of its army, and pledge never to join Nato.It was unclear how involved Ukraine has been in drafting the plan, but White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US had engaged \"equally with both sides\". In a separate statement, Zelensky's office said that Ukraine had \"agreed to work on the plan's provisions in a way that would bring about a just end to the war\".If confirmed, the demands in the plan, would appear to favour Moscow's interests.Zelensky said he expects to speak with US President Donald Trump in the coming days about the proposals, which also include plans for Ukraine to forego many of its weapons.But in a press briefing at the White House, Leavitt rejected suggestions that the plan demanded major concessions from Ukraine, and said the US president \"supports\" it. US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and had engaged both sides \"to understand what these countries would commit to in order to see a lasting and durable peace\", Leavitt said.\"It's a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine,\" she added, without providing further details. \"We believe that it should be acceptable to both sides. And we're working very hard to get it done.\"A unnamed senior US official told CBS News that the plan \"was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of President Zelensky's administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelensky\". In a statement on X, Zelensky wrote, \"The American side presented points of a plan to end the war—their vision. I outlined our key principles. We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it's all genuine.\"The statement came after a meeting in Kyiv on Thursday between Zelensky and senior US military figures, including US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, army chief of staff Gen Randy George and top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue.Despite Kyiv's tepid reaction to the draft, Zelensky said he \"appreciated the efforts of President Trump and his team to return security to Europe\" – perhaps a way to keep the US president onside despite his administration's apparent soft approach to Russia.In his nightly address on Thursday, Zelensky said Ukraine needs a \"worthy peace,\" and that the \"dignity of the Ukrainian people\" must be respected. When asked if Europe was involved in the process of drafting the plan, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, said: \"Not that I know of.\" \"For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,\" she added. Moscow downplayed the significance of the plan, which is rumoured to include 28 points. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that while there had been \"contacts\" with the US there was \"no process that could be called 'consultations'\".Peskov warned that any peace deal would have to address the \"root causes of the conflict\" - a phrase Moscow has used as shorthand for a series of maximalist demands which, to Ukraine, are tantamount to surrender. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The future of Ukraine must be determined by Ukraine and we must never lose sight of that principle underpinning the just and lasting peace that we all want to see.\"Since starting his second term earlier this year, Trump has launched into various initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, including a bilateral summit with Putin in Alaska, several visits by his envoy Witkoff to Moscow, and rounds of talks with Zelensky and other Western leaders. But as the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears, the two sides remain deeply at odds over how to end the conflict. While Ukraine has become adept at targeting Russian military infrastructure and energy facilities with long-range drones, Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian targets continue unabated. Late on Thursday, a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed at least five people, according to the regional governor. Earlier this week, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil. Another 17 people were still missing at the site on Thursday, Zelensky said as he offered his condolences. ",

    "body": "8 hours agoDaniel De Simone and Jo AdnittBBC News InvestigationsSocial mediaWiltshire Police were told in 2016 that serial rapist David Carrick had abused his youngest victim but failed to take action, the BBC can reveal.Carrick, who was a Metropolitan Police officer, went on to rape five women before his arrest in 2021 and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years in 2023. He was handed a further prison sentence on Thursday for abusing his youngest victim for 18 months, beginning in 1989, when she was 12 and he was a teenager.Speaking to the BBC, his victim Jo - not her real name - said the way her case was handled \"was disgraceful\".Wiltshire Police said the incident was \"a clear case\" of officers failing to properly investigate allegations made to them.A Hertfordshire Police investigation into Carrick, who was originally from Wiltshire, began in 2021 after a woman came forward to say she had been raped by him. He was eventually convicted of raping and abusing 12 women, who came forward to police once the inquiry began.But the BBC can reveal that Wiltshire Police were told in 2016 about Carrick's abuse of his youngest victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.Another person - not Jo herself - contacted the force one night to report what happened decades before. When subsequently contacted by officers, the person said they had been drinking when they contacted police and had a poor memory about what happened years earlier.But Wiltshire Police failed to contact Jo herself and closed the investigation before it even began. They knew that Carrick was a Met Police officer, but did not tell their London counterparts about the reported abuse.Wiltshire officers also failed to search for Carrick in their own systems. Had officers done so, the search would have revealed he was already under investigation for a serious offence reported three days earlier.Jo urges other women to not suffer in silenceJo told the BBC the \"whole way it was handled was disgraceful\".She said that, had she been approached by officers in 2016, she would have told them everything.\"He'd have had five years of less offending if they'd spoken to me.\"She said Wiltshire Police should apologise to the women who were raped after 2016.\"If it was a member of the public, they would have probably done it a lot differently than a police officer.\"Jo wants Wiltshire Police to \"take accountability\" and make sure it never happens to anyone else, she said.In a statement, Wiltshire Police \"apologised unreservedly to the person whose report we did not initially investigate as we should\".Two Wiltshire officers have since been found to have committed misconduct and given final written warnings.Elsewhere, authorities had known about Carrick's abuse of Jo since 1990, when an NHS psychologist interviewed her.A letter from Carrick admitting the abuse was in his medical records, but police vetting didn't uncover it. He went on to join the Met in 2001.In his recent trial, the letter from Carrick was used as evidence. The BBC has separately seen a letter from an NHS psychologist, sent to a local GP practice in1990 who had spoken to Jo about the abuse.But there was no investigation into Carrick at the time.CPSCarrick penned this letter in August 1990 after sexually assaulting JoIn a recent letter to Jo, the NHS has apologised for how the abuse was handled in 1990.The letter says that \"unfortunately, when you were seen in 1990 the organisations would not have had a strong safeguarding governance structure\" and this is \"sadly evidenced in your available medical notes.\"The abuse against you was not fully understood and your voice was not heard in the process.\"Referrals that could have been made – meaning to police and other bodies – \"appear not to have been enacted\", the letter notes.The letter then apologises for this \"historical practice\".Jo told the BBC the abuse in the NHS records should have been identified when Carrick joined the police, and he could have been prevented joining at all.\"He shouldn't have been a police officer,\" she said.Jo said the recent BBC Panorama undercover investigation into Met Police showed a culture in which Carrick would have \"fitted in like a glove\", and that she is alarmed by that.Jo wants change and for women's voices to be heard.\"Just don't suffer in silence\", she said.\"Just keep talking. Keep telling people. If somebody won't listen, go somewhere else.\"\"Everyone should be a valued person. Everyone should be listened to.\"",

    "body": "Woman who drove round bend at 85mph admits killing three men12 hours agoAlan SimpsonJorja Colville will be sentenced in JanuaryA 21-year-old woman who crashed a car after driving round a bend at more than 85mph has admitted killing her three passengers.Reece Williams, 23, Lewis Soden, 24, and Connor Page, 21, all died after the Ford Focus being driven by Jorja Colville crashed near Falkirk in July last year.  The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Colville was also speeding at more than 90mph shortly before the accident outside the village of Dunmore. Colville admitted causing death by dangerous driving and will be sentenced on 8 January at the High Court in Stirling.Her bail was continued.Police ScotlandConnor Page, Lewis Soden and Reece Williams were all killed in the crashJudge Lady Ross told Colville a prison sentence was \"inevitable\" and that there was nothing that could be said to take away \"the desperate pain\" in the lives of the three victims' families.Colville, of Stirling, admitted causing the deaths of the men on 26 July last year by driving dangerously at excessive speed, failing to maintain control of her car, causing it to leave the road and travel onto a verge where it struck a tree.Advocate depute Scott McKenzie told the court that Colville, an early years assistant, had no previous convictions.'Screaming for help'The prosecutor said that on the day of the crash, witness Kirstin Scobbie was driving on Moss Road on the approach to the collision site when she saw Colville's car behind her.She was travelling at about 60 mph, the appropriate speed limit, when the Focus overtook her before pulling back in close to the front of her vehicle.Mr McKenzie said: \"The white Ford Focus pulled away from her at speed.\" Following a series of bends in the road she noticed debris on the roadway and then saw the Focus in bushes.The prosecutor said: \"She noted the vehicle was on its side and had sustained serious damage. \"She stopped her vehicle as she approached the white Ford and saw Jorja Colville covered in blood and screaming for help.\"The court heard that Colville said that there were three people in the car who could not get out.Mr McKenzie said: \"She described that none of them were awake and that she did not know if they were breathing.\"Another driver, Dean Norris, saw the Focus approaching him in the opposing lane and said it momentarily left the road surface due to the dip on the road and formed the impression it was travelling at excessive speed. \"He saw the vehicle land back on the road surface before it lost control as it passed him,\" said the prosecutor.Mr Norris turned back to offer help and went to the Focus, but could not find any signs of life from the three men inside the vehicle. When police arrived Colville confirmed she was the driver and said her boyfriend Reece Williams was in the car along with her friends.Mr Williams had sustained blunt-force injuries to his head, chest, abdomen and limbs in the crash.Mr Soden suffered multiple injuries to his head, neck, chest abdomen and pelvis and Mr Page died from multiple blunt-force head and neck injuries.The court heard that data recovered from the car showed its speed increased greatly on the approach to the crash scene, hitting a maximum speed of 92.6mph prior to a bend and continuing through the bend at speeds in excess of 85mph.Collision investigators said the crash occurred because the driver was \"driving at significantly excessive speed for the road layout and approaching hazards of which she was warned of\".The court heard that a section of the road before the crash site has a series of peaks and troughs with a warning sign in place to alert drivers.Defence solicitor advocate Gordon Martin KC told the court that Colville, who suffered a broken shoulder and ribs, has not driven since the incident.'Kind, generous and hardworking man'Following Colville's guilty plea, Mr Williams' mother Tracy said the tragedy had not only affected her family, \"but Jorja and her family too\".\"We know she didn't set out to cause hurt that day, and this will be something she will carry for the rest of her life,\" she said.In a statement issued through Digby Brown Solicitors, Mrs Williams added:  \"If I close my eyes I can see Reece as a little boy laughing and helping his granddad build a summer house.\"He was adored by his little sister and shared a special bond with his cousins and aunts. I am so proud of the kind, generous and hardworking man he became.\"We have been blessed with these memories but are devastated there will be no more.\"My family and I will never fully comprehend life without Reece.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick MarshBusiness reporter, SingaporeGetty ImagesThe growth of artificial intelligence (AI) may eventually lead to fewer entry-level graduates being hired, the boss of accountancy giant PwC has told the BBC.However, global chairman Mohamed Kande said AI was not behind recent job cuts at the firm, adding that the company actually needed to hire hundreds of new AI engineers but was struggling to find them.But some observers say the technology itself threatens thousands of junior jobs across the professional services industry.Speaking on the sidelines of a business summit in Singapore, Mr Kande also said big changes in the global economy, such as US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, had been good for the firm's consulting business.He also addressed the company's suspension in China last year over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande, promising that the same mistakes \"would not happen again\".Headquartered in London, PwC is one of the Big Four accountancy firms. It provides a range of services, such as financial auditing, consulting and tax advice for business clients around the world.According to Mr Kande, advising them on how to integrate AI into their operations will be at the heart of the firm's future business strategy, even as the rapidly advancing technology affects its own hiring plans.Firms who would have previously hired PwC consultants to sift through data and documents may now use AI models instead, turning weeks of costly work into mere minutes.Watch: 'It is a different set of people we are hiring now'Every year, the company hires thousands of new graduates in entry-level positions - including 1,300 in the UK and 3,200 in the US last year - but it recently dropped long-term plans to continue increasing its headcount.In 2021, PwC said it wanted to hire 100,000 people over the course of five years - but Mr Kande said this would no longer be possible.\"When we made the plans to hire that many people, the world looked very, very different,\" he said.\"Now we have artificial intelligence. We want to hire, but I don't know if it's going to be the same level of people that we hire - it will be a different set of people.\"Last year, PwC cut more than 5,600 roles across its worldwide operation.The boss of the company's UK business has previously spoken about reducing graduate recruitment, admitting that AI was \"certainly reshaping roles\".At a global level, however, Mr Kande insisted that the AI boom was an \"exciting time\" for creating new jobs.\"We are looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers today to help us drive our AI agenda, but we just cannot find them,\" he said.Trade turmoil 'good for us'Businesses around the world may be facing challenges adapting to AI, but in the meantime PwC appears to have benefited from the broader uncertainty in the global economy, largely fuelled by President Trump's extensive use of tariffs.\"We are receiving a lot of calls from many companies around the world asking how to navigate the current environment,\" said Mr Kande.\"It's been good for us. We need to remain relevant to our clients and we have to be in these discussions, which we are.\"However, the company took a huge reputational blow last year, when Chinese authorities suspended PwC for six months over its work on the collapsed property giant Evergrande.The firm went bust after amassing debts of more than $300bn (£230bn) and has been at the centre of a ruinous housing crisis that continues to damage lives and livelihoods in China.The country's Securities Regulatory Commission found that PwC, as the auditor, had \"covered up and even condoned\" financial fraud at Evergrande.Mr Kande, whose tenure as global chairman began after Evergrande went bankrupt, said PwC no longer faced any restrictions in China.\"Let me tell you - we changed many of our people, implemented new quality management systems and introduced new governance systems,\" he said.\"My focus has been to make sure nothing like this ever happens again.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondentNational Crime AgencyGeorge Rossi, who heads up TGR, with his second in command Elena ChirkinyanBuying cocaine on a Friday night in Britain can indirectly help Russian arms factories, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has warned.The NCA said a man linked to a Russian-led money-laundering network operating in the UK had bought a bank in Kyrgyzstan which was used to make payments on behalf of the Russian war machine.Sal Melki, the agency's Deputy Director for Economic Crime, said it was a \"vast criminal ecosystem that is funding some really bad things all around the world\".The NCA is trying to disrupt the network from top to bottom, even putting adverts in UK motorway service station toilets to warn couriers carrying cash for the money-launderers of the lengthy jail sentences they face.The investigation into Russian money laundering is called Operation Destabilise. Last year the NCA said it had identified two networks called TGR and Smart that worked together to process cash for drugs gangs, suppliers of illegal firearms and people smugglers.Investigators have now discovered that George Rossi, who heads up TGR, bought a bank in Kyrgyzstan.National Crime AgencyOne of the cash seizures made by the NCARossi bought the bank through his company Altair Holding SA. On Christmas Day 2024, Altair Holding SA took a 75% stake in Keremet Bank.Further work showed that Keremet Bank was facilitating payments for a Russian state-owned bank called Promsvyazbank (PSB) which is described by the US treasury as a \"sanctions evasion hub\".The NCA says Keremet Bank was helping PSB make payments for \"Russia's military-industrial base\", in other words, for the arms factories making weapons for the Ukraine war.At street level TGR and Smart provide a \"full spectrum of money-laundering services\", the NCA said. They allow people like drug dealers and suppliers of illegal firearms to swap their cash for cryptocurrency. Investigators say the money-laundering network was operating in at least 28 towns and cities across the UK \"sustaining an entire architecture that allows crime to pay in our country\".The NCA's Sal Melki said: \"We can't ignore the sheer scale of this threat.\"He said: \"We can draw a thread between somebody buying cocaine on a Friday night in the UK, all the way through to geopolitical events that are causing suffering across the world.\"It's not as simple as 'OK, I pay my drug dealer and that is the end of it'. This is actually a vast criminal ecosystem, that is funding some really bad things all around the world. \"We can say with certainty that laundering street cash is really critical to underpinning how serious crime works in our country.\"National Crime AgencyEkaterina Zhdanova ran the Smart money-laundering networkHe also said that his investigators had discovered that the Smart network run by Ekaterina Zhdanova had provided financial services to the ring of spies led by Bulgarian Orlin Roussev, who tracked Russia's enemies across Europe. Zhdanova is currently in custody in France awaiting trial.Operation Destabilise began by tracking the activity of the ransomware group Evil Corp, but ended up uncovering \"eye-watering scales\" of money-laundering, the NCA said. Smart and TGR were trading \"billions of pounds of criminal wealth\".The money they collected was laundered through cash-rich businesses such as construction, or bundled up in \"stash houses\" and taken out of the country to be laundered overseas.Sometimes the cash was smuggled out hidden in boxes of washing powder and baby formula.National Crime AgencyBoxes of washing powder used to smuggle cash out of the UK Among those linked to the groups are former Hibernian footballer James Keatings, and Semen Kuksov and Andrii Dzektsa, who the NCA say laundered money for the Irish Kinahan drugs cartel.Two men convicted this year, Valeriy Popovych and Vitaliy Lutsak, were buying vehicles in the UK and driving them to Ukraine where they sold the vehicles for cryptocurrency. One spreadsheet suggested they had laundered £6.63m of dirty British cash just between August 2022 and June 2023.'Walls closing in'At the bottom rung of the ladders, the money-launderers need couriers to move criminal cash around the country. The couriers typically earn a commission of 0.5%. So moving £100,000 earns them £500. But they can get prison sentences of five years or more. \"You own all the risk,\" Mr Melki warned them.National Crime AgencyAdverts have been placed above urinals in motorway service stations in Russian and English warning that \"moving money for organised criminal might seem like easy work. But it ends with hard time\".The NCA's Mr Melki said: \"We're communicating with them directly in their own language to say: the walls are closing in. \"We know who you are, and we're coming for you.\"If you, or someone you know, have been affected by addiction, support is available via BBC Action Line",

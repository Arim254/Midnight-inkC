    "body": "Venezuela has accused US President Donald Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\" after he said the airspace around the country should be considered closed.  The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\".The US does not legally have the authority to close another country's airspace, but Trump's online post could lead to travel uncertainty and deter airlines from operating there. The US has been building its military presence in the Caribbean, which officials say is to combat drug smuggling. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has dismissed US claims of drug trafficking as an attempt to oust him. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Trump's comments come days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".In a statement on Saturday, Venezuela's foreign ministry said that the US had \"unilaterally suspended\" its weekly migrant repatriation flights.\"We call directly on the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organizations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression,\" it said.Venezuela on Wednesday banned six major international airlines – Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines – from landing there after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment – the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 – is to combat drug trafficking.On Thursday, Trump warned that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, the US has not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs. The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US action is to depose Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.Venezuela's interior and justice minister Diosdado Cabello, who is alleged to be one of the high-ranking members of the cartel, has long called it an \"invention\".The US state department has insisted that the Cartel de los Soles not only exists, but that it has \"corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoDanny AeberhardandTom BennettUkrainian naval drones hit two oil tankers from Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" as they travelled through the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials have said.Footage verified by the BBC shows waterborne drones speeding through the waves into the vessels, before detonating into a ball of flame, sending black smoke into the air.The targeted tankers were named by Turkish authorities as the Kairos and Virat, both flagged to Gambia. Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.The two ships are reportedly part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a term that refers to the hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The shadow fleet is largely made up of aged tankers, many with obscure ownership or insurance.The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.  Sources told BBC Ukrainian that Sea Baby drones were used in the attack - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation after the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet American officials in Florida on Sunday. Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy, will hold talks in Moscow next week.",

    "body": "Australian children's music group The Wiggles has issued a statement after two of its members were featured in a music video for a song that apparently alludes to drug use.In the since-deleted clip for musician Keli Holiday's new song, Ecstasy, Blue Wiggle Anthony Field and his nephew Dominic Field, who plays the Tree of Wisdom, could be seen dancing in the background.A spokesperson for The Wiggles said the group \"does not condone\" the use of drugs \"in any form\" and that the video had been created without the band's approval.The TikTok video was viewed more than 92,000 times before it was taken down, Australian media report.\"We understand that a video circulating on social media has caused concern for many parents and professionals, and we want to address that directly,\" the group said in a statement to The West Australian newspaper. \"The Wiggles do not support or condone the use of drugs in any form. The content being shared was not created or approved by us, and we have asked for it to be removed.\"While Keli Holiday is a friend of The Wiggles, the video and the music added to it were created independently and without our knowledge.\"The clip was filmed at the TikTok Awards earlier this month where members of the band appeared on stage with Holiday - whose real name is Adam Hyde - during his song Dancing2. Holiday shared the video on TikTok, with the caption \"The Wiggles get it\",  to promote his new single Ecstasy. The song's chorus lyrics are: \"Hey girl, come on dance with me. You and your pocket full of ecstasy.\"A spokesperson for The Wiggles told The West Australian newspaper that the band's performances at the awards had been \"family-friendly\" and that the video had been \"edited together separately and without our awareness\".Created in 1991 as part of a university assignment, The Wiggles has become an international phenomenon among young children. Anthony Fields is the only original member still with the group.Keli Holiday is the solo project of Hyde, who is also known for being one half of electronic dance duo Peking Duk.The BBC has contacted Holiday's management for comment.",

    "body": "5 days agoWill VernonYury KrylovA British child chess prodigy has swept the board at a national competition, earning her a place among the top 50 women in the world for the blitz category of speed chess.Ten-year-old Bodhana Sivanandan won eight games in a row at the UK Women's Blitz Championship in Royal Leamington Spa at the weekend - triumphing over much older and more experienced players.\"I don't mind who I compete against, I only care about the game,\" Bodhana told the BBC following her latest win.Malcolm Pein, from the English Chess Federation, described Bodhana as a \"generational talent with no equivalent in any other sport\".\"It's hard to say what is more remarkable - the fact that a 10-year-old is a top seed in a British chess championship, or that she strolls to victory by a huge margin, leaving three other England internationals in her wake,\" he added.Bodhana, from Harrow in north-west London, said she was \"really happy\" about her victory. \"Chess helps me with so many other things, at school it helps with maths, art and music.\"Her father, Siva, said his daughter was very determined, and he and his wife were proud of her: \"She is doing her best, and we are supporting her.\"It is the latest success in Bodhana's phenomenal career. In August, she became the youngest person to earn the Woman International Master title - the second-highest ranking in women's chess, below grandmaster.  Yury KrylovBodhana became the youngest person to earn the Woman International Master title earlier this yearLast year, she made history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport, at the age of just nine. Bodhana says she wants to become the youngest grandmaster in history. The current recordholder is American chess player Abhimanyu Mishra, who claimed the title at the age of just 12. Blitz is a type of speed chess in which each game lasts no more than ten minutes.",

    "body": "Image source, ReutersImage caption, Hurricane Melissa left a trail of destruction in Jamaica before hitting CubaByDarren BettLead Weather PresenterThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season will probably be remembered mainly for Hurricane Melissa and the devastation it caused across Jamaica and Cuba.But it was also a season of stark contrasts, with periods of relative calm and bursts of intense activity.The season managed to generate three Category 5 hurricanes - only the second season on record where that has happened. But during the typical mid-September peak things turned \"remarkably\" quiet. Also notable, it was the first time since 2015 when no hurricane made landfall in the United States.Image source, BBC WeatherImage caption, 2025 had more major hurricanes than an average seasonThe North Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from 1 June to 30 November. However, the vast majority of tropical storm and hurricane activity typically occurs during the August-October period, which is considered to be the peak.At the beginning of the year forecasters were predicting that 2025 would be an \"above average\" season. Overall, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) report that the season fell within the ranges they had predicted for named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes.This year there have been 13 named storms and five hurricanes, four of which strengthened to become major hurricanes.How active a hurricane season has been can also be assessed by looking at the Accumulated Cyclone Energy or ACE Index. This reflects the strength or wind speed of each storm and how long it will last. For 2025 the total ACE is 132.9, which would indicate an above normal or very active season. A quiet startThe 2025 season started with Tropical Storm Andrea on 23 June which was a short-lived storm that remained over open water in the Atlantic. At the end of the month Tropical Storm Barry formed in Mexico's Bay of Campeche and became the first to strike land, further up the coast near Tampico.It was closely followed by Tropical Storm Chantal that hit South Carolina on 6 July and brought up to 6 inches of rain and subsequent flash flooding to North Carolina.This turned out to be the only storm to make landfall in the US which is very unusual in any season. In fact the last time no hurricanes made landfall in the US was a decade ago.The first hurricane in 2025 didn't develop until mid-August. But when it did, it was a big one. Hurricane ErinImage source, ReutersImage caption, Hurricane Erin highlighted the dangers even distant hurricanes can pose to coastal communitiesHurricane Erin became a major Category 5 hurricane on 16 August with sustained winds of 160mph (257km/h). It passed near the Caribbean and skirted the US east coast. Although it did not make direct landfall it did produce dangerous rip currents and large surf which kept beaches closed and led to evacuations in some areas.  It was significant because it underwent an exceptionally rapid strengthening, going from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in about a day. It later turned out that Erin wasn't the only storm to undergo explosive intensification with both hurricanes Humberto and Melissa following suit to reach Category 5 status. This was only the second season on record with three Category 5 hurricanes.Where did all the storms go?What followed Erin was a \"quite remarkable\" quiet period in storm activity that coincided with the climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. A report from Colorado State University (CSU) highlighted three factors that could have led to a marked reduction in storm activity. These included a lack of moisture in the atmosphere, increased vertical wind shear that rips storms apart destroying them and a lack of thunderstorms off the west coast of Africa – typically a tropical storm formation area.Forecasters suggested the lull in activity would be short-lived with a flurry of storms to come later in the season. And in due course two major hurricanes formed - Gabrielle and Humberto. The track of these storms were affected by an area of high pressure known as the \"Bermuda high\". The high was weaker and displaced further east which resulted in both hurricanes being steered towards Bermuda and the mid-Atlantic rather than towards Florida, normally one of the hardest hit states during hurricane season.Hurricane MelissaImage source, NOAAImage caption, Hurricane Melissa bears down on JamaicaUp until this point it had been a quiet year for the Caribbean. But that changed late in October when Tropical Storm Melissa, to the south of Jamaica, strengthened to a category 4 hurricane within 24 hours, fuelled by unusually warm waters in the region.After becoming slow-moving and bringing several days of damaging winds and flooding rains, Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on 28 October as a major category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 185mph (297km/h).Most years the island will feel the impacts of two or three tropical storms or hurricanes but only three hurricanes have directly hit the country since 1988. Hurricane Melissa was the strongest storm ever to hit Jamaica and tied for the strongest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic basin.Melissa went on the make a second landfall in eastern Cuba still as a major hurricane and brought widespread damage and flooding.Melissa brought an abrupt but catastrophic end to the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season with no storms forming in November.Role of climate changeA World Weather Attribution study has found that the atmospheric and ocean conditions that led to the rapid intensification of Hurricane Melissa were made six times more likely by climate change. Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide but warmer oceans, coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense.The frequency and magnitude of \"rapid intensification events\" in the Atlantic is also likely to have increased. This is where maximum wind speeds increase very quickly, as we saw with Erin and Melissa.The speed of movement of storms seems to be slowing down too with the potential to give more rainfall, as we also saw with Hurricane Melissa.",

    "body": "More than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The death toll has continued to rise since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October, with Israel carrying out air strikes for what it says are violations of the truce - while bodies continue to be recovered from under the rubble.Among those reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike on Saturday were two young brothers, Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, whose family said they had been gathering firewood when they were killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had struck two suspects who had crossed the so-called yellow line.The line marks where the Israeli military agreed to withdraw to under a ceasefire brokered by the United States more than seven weeks ago.The boys who died have been described in media reports as an eight-year-old and his brother, aged 10 or 11.Relatives said the children had been looking for firewood east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip when they were killed.Their funeral was held at Nasser Hospital on Saturday.Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian toll is now 70,100 and that more than 350 of those deaths have happened since the 10 October ceasefire. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

Fifty patients and their immediate family members are now receiving care in surroundings that are safe and welcoming.\"In October the prince unveiled a global memorial for humanitarian aid workers where he delivered a speech on humanitarian values.This royal visit signals further intent from Prince William to establish what he has called \"more empathetic leadership around the world\" where humanitarian issues are concerned.Speaking in a recent episode of the documentary series The Reluctant Traveller,  he told presenter Eugene Levy \"change is on my agenda, change for good\".\"Not overly radical change, but change that needs to happen,\" he added.After his visit to the Gazan children, a Palace spokesperson said: \"The Prince wished to offer a moment of comfort to these young people who have endured experiences no child should ever face. \"The Prince was also able to offer his heartfelt gratitude to the NHS teams providing exceptional care during such a profoundly difficult time.\"His Royal Highness was moved by the courage shown by the children and their families and by the dedication of the team who are supporting them with such professionalism and humanity.\"Israel launched a military operation in Gaza after Hamas-led militants based in the Palestinian territory attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251.At least 70,100 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

    "body": "Drinking is a way of life in Ireland. Can a warning label change that?3 hours agoBob HowardDublinNurPhoto via Getty ImagesJack likes a drink and a standard night out will probably involve several pints at his local.\"If you have three pints, that is easy, easy going,\" the 29-year-old says. \"Probably a heavy night, casually, would be like six-plus pints.\"Jack grew up in County Galway where, he says, young people often start drinking at 14 or 15, \"usually in a field with a horrendous can of cider\".\"And then, when you're 17, your dad brings you to a pub, buys you your pint of Guinness, and that's where it takes hold.\"Ireland has a complex relationship with drinking and many see alcohol and socialising as inextricably linked, part of the social fabric of everyday life.Pubs tend to be the focal point of communities where there's often live music, and many traditional songs celebrate or speak of the harms of having one too many. Huge brands such as Guinness and Jamesons are major exports.Since 2020 supermarkets and corner shops across the country have had to erect physical barriers between sections selling alcoholic drinks and general products, while some bottles and cans of alcohol now carry among the strongest warning labels anywhere in the world.First signed into Irish law in 2023, products with the new labels - which state drinking causes liver disease and is linked to fatal cancers - are already on sale in pubs and supermarkets across the country.But in a move condemned by public health advocates, the Irish government has delayed their compulsory introduction until 2028, blaming uncertainty with world trade - which some believe is the result of lobbying by the drinks industry.For its part, the industry body, Drinks Ireland, said it did look to the Irish government to give some \"breathing space\" on health warning labels and that it believes they should be agreed on an EU-wide level.Labels displaying the calorie content and alcohol quantity (in grams) for each product won't become mandatory until 2028It was when Jack moved to Dublin in 2015 to study journalism that he really got to know the capital's nightlife.\"Dublin's a great spot because it's always spontaneous drinking, and that's why it's famous,\" he says. \"It's very pub-centric, drink-heavy.\"A big weekend night out for Jack usually begins with pre-drinks at someone's house - perhaps a bottle of gin mixed with tonic shared between him and three friends - before going on to a club for shots.Yet even though he sometimes drinks a considerable amount, Jack, who works in advertising, says he knows his limits and feels healthy.\"I'm a pretty fit person, I ran a marathon a year ago,\" he says. \"I know my limits. As long as you know what your limits are, I think its fine, health-wise.\"Jack outside a bar on Drury Street in the centre of DublinThree-quarters of the population here drink and celebrations, from birthdays to weddings, often involve alcohol.Consumption has fallen by around a third over the past 25 years, according to figures from The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland (DIGI).Young people, on average, now start drinking at 17 - two years older than the average 20 years ago. But once they start, their consumption and binge drinking is among the highest in Europe.A report from public health advocacy group Alcohol Action Ireland found the proportion of 15-24-year-olds consuming alcohol had risen - from 66% in 2018, to 75% in 2024 - and that two out of three 15-24-year-olds regularly binge-drink.Campaigners believe Ireland's alcohol warning labels are making an incremental impact. But 23-year-old Amanda, who's seen the labels, isn't so sure.\"You look at it and you're like, 'Oh, I just drank that. Should I drink another one?'\"Amanda doesn't think people will pay much attention to the health warnings and reckons they might even make some more inclined to drink.\"I just don't think they care,\" she says.On a night out in Dublin Amanda says she will usually limit herself to a maximum of three drinks.\"I like to be in control of what I do when I'm out,\" she says. \"I don't really drink that much for letting loose.\"She's mindful of how young people are perceived on social media, and that influences her own drinking choices.\"I don't like taking photos with myself with a glass of wine or Guinness,\" she says. \"You don't want to be in compromising positions, you don't want people to have a negative image.\"Amanda has seen the new warning labels on alcohol - but isn't sure how effective they'll beTwenty-one-year-old Sean lives in the capital and likes to socialise with friends - some are drinkers, while others are not.Unlike in other parts of Europe, Sean says if you want to socialise in the evenings there aren't many options here, other than going to the pub.\"There's not much to do in Dublin after a certain time,\" Sean says. \"Six to seven or so the city kind of shuts down. At times you'd just be like, 'I'm really not in the humour to have a pint, but I want to sit somewhere and see my friends' - so you have to get a pint.\"He's seen the alcohol warning labels too, but isn't sure they will put him off drinking.\"Everyone kinda knows it's bad for you, but we do it anyway,\" he says.Cigarette warning labels are \"far more graphic\", Sean's friend Mark adds.Ireland was the front-runner in restricting smoking and since 2004 you can't smoke in the workplace or restaurants and bars.Sean (left) with friends Mark, Ted, Nikita, Darragh and James in a courtyard near Temple Bar, Dublin's nightlife hub Even before the introduction of the new warning labels, some young Irish people in their 20s have been finding they are better off without alcohol in their lives.Mark rarely drinks. It's \"one for my birthday, one for Christmas\", he says, in part because alcohol is expensive and it's cheaper to opt for something else.\"I don't really like the taste of it,\" the 21-year-old says. \"Guinness is probably the one I would have, but also the cost of it - I am saving so much money by just getting the Club Orange.\"Helen is 27 and when she was younger used to drink regularly. Although she hasn't given up alcohol completely, like Mark she says she can largely live without it.\"The last time I had a drink was February,\" Helen says. \"It just kind of dwindled off to this point where I'm more or less sober, but I just don't identify as that because I may have a drink again - or maybe I won't.\"Sam and Helen are good friends who encourage each other not to drinkHelen's friend Sam - who started drinking when he was \"16 or 17\" - has gone a step further.\"It was a bit of fun then [I] went to college and the drinking kind of took off,\" Sam, who's now 27, says. \"One day I just kind of realised it was going too far. My dad said to me, 'What are you doing with your life? You really need to pack it in.'\"In 2021 Sam signed up to a year-long no-beer course and then quit alcohol completely. He's not had a drink now in three years and has even given up playing the concertina in pubs because it was so ingrained to have a drink at a session. When he does go to a pub he'll opt for a zero-alcohol drink.But he says it sometimes seems difficult for people to accept he's teetotal.\"There's the odd person that you meet and you tell them you're not drinking and they kind of look at you sideways.\"Unlike Sam, Jack's not keen on zero-alcohol drinks, and thinks they're \"a waste of time, because it's the same price as a pint\".He's thought about giving up drinking, but his inner resolve never lasts long.\"Honestly, it's quite difficult to try and embark on the sober journey in Ireland - because it is intrinsically entwined into our culture,\" Jack says.\"I always kind of flirt with the idea of going totally sober - but then I instantly dissuade [myself] and have a pint.\"Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe BBC asked the Irish government why it had postponed the compulsory introduction of the new alcohol warning labels until 2028. It said the decision to defer was made following concerns raised about the impact of their implementation in the current global trading environment.More weekend picks",

Playwright Sir Tom Stoppard dies at 88\"We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: 'Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else'.\"The line is from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, one of his most notable stage works which also include The Real Thing. In a statement announcing his death, United Agents said: \"He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language.\"It was an honour to work with Tom and to know him.\"The playwright captivated the hearts of audiences for more than six decades with work that explored philosophical and political themes. Paying tribute to his \"favourite playwright\", Sir Mick Jagger posted on social media: \"He leaves us with a majestic body of intellectual and amusing work. I will always miss him.\"Publishing company Faber Books said Sir Tom was \"one of the most brilliant and feted playwrights of the last sixty years and one of the great intellects of our time\". \"Tom has been at the heart of Faber Drama since his first play, the dazzling Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. He will be missed beyond measure,\" it added. He also wrote for film, TV and radio. He adapted Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina for the 2012 film starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law.

There his mother met and married an Englishman, a Major Kenneth Stoppard, before moving to England.He later learned from relatives that all four of his grandparents had been Jewish, and that they had died in Nazi concentration camps. \"I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die. It's a conspicuous part of what might be termed a charmed life,\" he said in US magazine Talk in 1999, as he reflected on returning to his birthplace Zlin in what is now the Czech Republic.He worked as a journalist in Bristol in 1954 before becoming a theatre critic and writing plays for radio and TV.\"I wanted to be a great journalist,\" he said, as quoted by Reuters news agency. \"My first ambition was to be lying on the floor of an African airport while machine-gun bullets zoomed over my typewriter. But I wasn't much use as a reporter. I felt I didn't have the right to ask people questions.\"I always thought they'd throw the teapot at me or call the police.\"Sir Tom's career as a playwright did not take off until the 1960s when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was later performed at the National Theatre and Broadway.The play focuses on two minor characters from Hamlet. It won several awards including four Tonys in 1968, including best play.He received many honours and accolades throughout his career, including being knighted by the late Queen for his services to literature in 1997.PA MediaSir Tom Stoppard and the late Queen in the year 2000.

In a post on X, it said Sir Tom had won three Olivier Awards and five Tony awards  - for Broadway theatre - as well as the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love. \"That recognition attests to the remarkable range and enduring impact of his work on both stage and screen,\" it said. Rupert Goold, artistic director of the Almeida Theatre, described Sir Tom as the \"most supportive, most generous man\" whose \"magic was present in everything he wrote\". London's Royal Court Theatre paid tribute to a \"playwright whose work probed the deepest human mysteries of truth, time, mortality and frailty while dazzling with wit, laughter and the buoyancy of the human spirit\".Lyricist Sir Tim Rice said he \"was in awe of nearly everything\" Sir Tom did. \"He was able to mix intellectual arguments and philosophical thought with sheer wit and fun and that was apparent in Rosencrantz And Guildenstern, which was his first big success, and I remained very much in awe of him, but he also became a friend and I was very honoured to know him,\" he told BBC News.\"He's written at least half a dozen, probably twice that, plays that will live for a long, long time - however brilliant plays are, a lot of them don't last much beyond their era, but I think Tom Stoppard's will, no question.\"Among other tributes:Britain's National Theatre said it was \"devastated\", adding: \"As a cornerstone of the National Theatre for 50 years, Tom's influence on British theatre has been simply immense\"John Lennon's son, Sean Ono Lennon, described him as an \"absolute genius\" The Writers' Guild said it was \"sad to learn of his death\", adding that he had been the recipient of their award for outstanding contribution to writing in 2017Getty ImagesActors Daniel Radcliffe (right) and Joshua McGuire in an Old Vic production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead in 2017",

    "body": "Adolescence lasts into 30s - new study shows four pivotal ages for your brain5 days agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentMonty Rakusen/GettyThe brain goes through five distinct phases in life, with key turning points at ages nine, 32, 66 and 83, scientists have revealed.Around 4,000 people up to the age of 90 had scans to reveal the connections between their brain cells.Researchers at the University of Cambridge showed that the brain stays in the adolescent phase until our early thirties when we \"peak\".They say the results could help us understand why the risk of mental health disorders and dementia varies through life.The brain is constantly changing in response to new knowledge and experience – but the research shows this is not one smooth pattern from birth to death.Instead, these are the five brain phases:Childhood - from birth to age nineAdolescence - from nine to 32Adulthood - from 32 to 66Early ageing - from 66 to 83Late ageing - from 83 onwards\"The brain rewires across the lifespan. It's always strengthening and weakening connections and it's not one steady pattern - there are fluctuations and phases of brain rewiring,\" the lead author of the research, Dr Alexa Mousley, told the BBC.Some people will reach these landmarks earlier or later than others – but the researchers said it was striking how clearly these ages stood out in the data. These patterns have only now been revealed due to the quantity of brain scans available in the study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications.The five brain phasesChildhood - The first period is when the brain is rapidly increasing in size but also thinning out the overabundance of connections between brain cells, called synapses, created at the start of life.The brain gets less efficient during this stage. It works like a child meandering around a park, going wherever takes their fancy, rather than heading straight from A to B.Adolescence - That changes abruptly from the age of nine when the connections in the brain go through a period of ruthless efficiency. \"It's a huge shift,\" said Dr Mousley, describing the most profound change between brain phases.This is also the time when there is the greatest risk of mental health disorders beginning.Unsurprisingly adolescence starts around the onset of puberty, but this is the latest evidence suggesting it ends much later than we assumed. It was once thought to be confined to the teenage years, before neuroscience suggested it continued into your 20s and now early 30s.This phase is the brain's only period when its network of neurons gets more efficient. Dr Mousely said this backs up many measures of brain function suggesting it peaks in your early thirties, but added it was \"very interesting\" that the brain stays in the same phase between nine and 32.Adulthood - Next comes a period of stability for the brain as it enters its longest era, lasting three decades.Change is slower during this time compared with the fireworks before, but here we see the improvements in brain efficiency flip into reverse.Dr Mousely said this \"aligns with a plateau of intelligence and personality\" that many of us will have witnessed or experienced.Early ageing - This kicks in at 66, but it is not an abrupt and sudden decline. Instead there are shifts in the patterns of connections in the brain.Instead of coordinating as one whole brain, the organ becomes increasingly separated into regions that work tightly together - like band members starting their own solo projects.Although the study looked at healthy brains, this is also the age at which dementia and high blood pressure, which affects brain health, are starting to show.Late ageing - Then, at the age of 83, we enter the final stage. There is less data than for the other groups as finding healthy brains to scan was more challenging. The brain changes are similar to early ageing, but even more pronounced.Dr Mousely said what really surprised her was how well the different \"ages align with a lot of important milestones\" such as puberty, health concerns later in life and even the pretty big social shifts in your early 30s such as parenthood.'A very cool study'The study did not look at men and women separately, but there will be questions such as the impact of menopause.Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at the University of Cambridge and part of the team responsible for the research, said: \"Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviours.\"The director of the centre for discovery brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh, Prof Tara Spires-Jones, who did not work on the research paper, said: \"This is a very cool study highlighting how much our brains change over our lifetimes.\"She said the results \"fit well\" with our understanding of brain ageing, but cautioned \"not everyone will experience these network changes at exactly the same ages\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoLuis BarruchoBBC World ServiceCourtesy of GabrielaGabriela, pictured here, says she \"tried everything\" from stricter dieting to intense workouts six days a week but \"nothing worked\"Gabriela was trying to lose the weight she'd gained during the Covid pandemic. But a few stubborn kilos just wouldn't budge.She had tried everything, she says. Going on a stricter diet; being more consistent with her high-intensity workouts six days a week.But \"nothing worked\" for the Brazilian lawyer who weighed 76kg (11st 13lb) and is 1.69m tall (5ft 6in).Then, friends let her in on a secret - they'd been using weight-loss injections and were thrilled with the results.So despite being a long-standing fitness fanatic, Gabriela, 40, decided to do the same.She bought her first Ozempic jabs in February 2024 from a pharmacy in Rio de Janeiro – with no prescription - and began taking them without medical oversight.The results were almost immediate.\"It was surreal,\" recalls Gabriela, which is not her real name. \"I'd go to a Japanese buffet, eat six pieces of sushi and feel like I'd had a whole rack of ribs.\"The transformation was noticeable, but it didn't last. When she stopped taking the injections, slowly but surely, the weight crept back.That's when Gabriela's new routine began. She would stop taking the jabs when she was satisfied with the way she looked. But when the reflection in the mirror wasn't quite what she wanted, the process would begin again.She's been going through this cycle for a year now.\"When I look in the mirror and like what I see, everything in life feels easier,\" she says.Doctors warn that people like Gabriela, who have no medical need for weight-loss jabs and are taking them intermittently and without clinical supervision, are gambling with their health.In the UK, the National Health Service generally won't prescribe weight-loss jabs - which mimic a natural hormone that regulates hunger and make you feel full for longer - unless your body mass index (BMI) is above 35 or 40, depending on the drug. The threshold is lower for some ethnic groups and people with certain weight-related health conditions.Gabriela's BMI was 26.6 when she started taking the jabs. She had no weight-related conditions and was a muscular woman who regularly did high-intensity exercise.\"There is a growing trend of its use for cosmetic purposes,\" says Dr Bharti Shetye, vice-president of the Obesity Medicine Association in the US.\"I hear of so many cases of people using it just to look good.\"Professor and endocrinologist Simone van de Sande Lee is clear: \"These are drugs approved to treat conditions like diabetes or obesity - they are not cosmetic tools.\"'I felt like I was a bit puffy'Andrew, 49, was also far below the threshold for being prescribed weight-loss drugs in the UK.A top executive of a food company used to hosting lavish parties in his central London penthouse, it was feeling unhappy about his appearance that compelled him to act.\"I felt like I was a bit puffy… I didn't feel good about myself,\" the 49-year-old, who also asked for his real name not to be used, says.\"I came back from Christmas holidays and thought, 'I'm going to fix this somehow.'\"At the time, Andrew weighed around 90kg (14st 2lb) at 1.83m (6ft) tall, though like Gabriela he was also muscular. This gave him a BMI of 26.9.Despite this, Andrew says he was able to obtain the jabs from an online pharmacy, simply by completing a self-assessment. As far as he is aware, no-one checked if what he'd written was accurate or whether the treatment was appropriate.In early 2024, he began weekly injections of Wegovy and later Mounjaro.Courtesy of AndrewAndrew started fat-loss jabs, even though he did not meet the threshold set in the UK\"Almost immediately what I felt with the jab is that the food noise went away from me… I really enjoyed not having to think about food so much.\"Now, Andrew still goes out to restaurants but eats much less.\"I never feel, or very rarely feel, that urgent hunger that I used to.\"Like Gabriela, he cycles on and off the jabs depending on social events. He used them before a boat trip to the Mediterranean this summer, then stopped for a couple of months, only to resume again recently, before Christmas, he explains.Gabriela sometimes skips doses before parties so she can eat more.\"If I know I'm going to drink a lot one day, I don't take it,\" she says. \"I'm like, 'Come on, I'm already going to be drinking a ton of beer - why would I take it?' So I don't.\"\"These days, I'm probably taking it in a pretty sloppy way - honestly, I have no idea,\" she adds.She explains cycling on and off the medication helps her make it last longer and save money. So far, Gabriela estimates having spent more than $2,000 (£1,500).Risk of muscle lossGetty ImagesAs weight-loss jabs surge in popularity, experts warn against unsupervised use for quick resultsWhile both Gabriela and Andrew are positive about their experiences, health experts point to risks with taking weight-loss jabs irregularly and without oversight.While earlier versions of GLP-1 drugs were used as early as the 1990s for type 2 diabetes, it's only in the past four years that the drugs have truly surged in popularity, after medical regulators around the world began licensing them for weight loss.\"We simply don't know the effects in people using these drugs purely for cosmetic purposes,\" says Simon Cork, senior lecturer in physiology at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK.Prof Lee adds that most of what we know about these drugs comes from people who use them consistently under medical supervision, so any stop-and-start pattern makes it harder to gauge their long-term effects.Dr Bruno Halpern, endocrinologist and president-elect of the World Obesity Federation, said research suggested the drugs for people with obesity or diabetes were \"relatively safe\".\"But if millions of healthy people start using them - some without medical need - we may begin to see rare side effects more regularly,\" he adds.Common side effects of the drugs include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation.But rarer and more serious ones include acute gallstone disease, pancreatitis and serious allergic reactions.Gabriela says her only issue so far has been mild stomach pain, which she blames on a combination of not eating and drinking alcohol while using the jabs.\"I was going through a wild phase,\" she admits.Another drawback of the jabs is that they can cause people to lose muscle as well as fat, and this is likely to be particularly true for those who are slimmer, says Halpern.\"Slim individuals on restrictive diets tend to lose muscle more than fat,\" he says.\"If they regain weight later, their body composition worsens,\" he adds, noting that this \"yo-yo cycle\" of losing and regaining \"raises the long-term risk of weight gain,\" especially when cycling on and off the medication.The patient leaflets for Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro recommend once‑weekly injections on a fixed schedule under medical supervision, indicating the drugs are intended for regular, continuous use rather than occasional or sporadic dosing.They are meant to be injected into the upper arm, thigh, or stomach, with doses gradually increased.Emotional tollThere are also psychological dangers.Dr Halpern says he sees patients who imagine that if they lose weight they'll feel loved, happy and accepted, but these expectations are rarely realistic.When people stop taking jabs and the weight returns, they often feel like failures, he says.Another challenge is that our bodies tend to resist long-term weight loss, explains Dr Cork.\"When you lose weight, your body doesn't just say, 'Great, job done.' Hunger hormones ramp up, your metabolism slows, and your body tries to restore what it sees as your natural point.\"He points out that as soon as patients stop taking the jabs, which suppress hunger signals, the body resumes its fight to regain the weight it has lost.This is why they are intended for long-term use in patients who need them, he says, stressing that obesity is a chronic disease. In the UK, NHS guidelines currently limit the use of weight-loss drugs to a maximum of two years.No plans to stopIn early 2025, Britain's General Pharmaceutical Council tightened restrictions on how online pharmacies can sell and prescribe the jabs in response to growing concerns about misuse, safety and supply shortages.Brazil also tightened the rules this year around the prescribing of the drugs for similar reasons.Despite the risks, Gabriela and Andrew say they have no plans to stop.\"I think I've become addicted to it,\" admits Gabriela, while Andrew sees the drug as a long-term commitment to his appearance.He sees it as a \"relatively informed risk\" he's taking.\"If I happen to cycle on and off this for the rest of my life, that would probably be OK.\"Details of mental health support in the UK are available at BBC Action Line.More weekend pics",

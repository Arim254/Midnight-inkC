    "body": "Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. That was the case in runs one and two too, with Lochner leading Friedrich by 0.80. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, are down in eighth, 0.40 off the medals. Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. He was fifth in qualification. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, and he qualified in third. USA's Mac Forehand and Austria's Matej Svancer were the top two in qualification. \"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle final (10:20-11:40) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (13:30-14:50 - re-arranged from Tuesday because of weather)British teenager Mia Brookes was a potential medal hope in this event but she is not in the final after finishing 16th in qualification. Reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand topped qualification, ahead of the Netherlands' Melissa Peperkamp. The rest of the field were at least nine points behind the pair. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

    "body": "26 minutes agoRachel Muller-HeyndykUS Department of Justice/PAEpstein took dozens more flights to the UK than were previously knownEssex Police has said it is assessing information about private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the Epstein files.The BBC understands that while the police is \"assessing\" the information, it should not be inferred as the opening of an investigation.Last year a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to the convicted sex offender had arrived at or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018.Ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the New Statesman last week that police \"urgently\" need to re-examine whether Jeffrey Epstein's victims were trafficked within and outside of the UK.An Essex Police spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\"In December, BBC News discovered that three British women who were allegedly trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK alongside other documents related to the convicted sex offender.US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims told the BBC it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a \"full-scale\" investigation into his activities in the UK.He added that Stansted, located around 40 miles away from central London, was one of the airports \"where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\".Stansted Airport said all private aircraft use entirely independent terminals not operated by Stansted, and the airport does not manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft.A new national group has been set up to support UK police forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has said.The force previously said it has held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein during his time as the UK's trade envoy.The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.He was dismissed from his role as ambassador role in September, after Downing Street said new information had emerged about the depth of this relationship with Epstein.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesTop doctors will meet at the Monaldi hospital in Naples to decide whether the child is suitable for a new transplantA toddler in Italy remains in critical condition after undergoing a transplant with a damaged heart.The organ, which was transported south from the from the city of Bolzano to Naples in December, was reportedly placed in an unsuitable container and in direct contact with dry ice, leading to severe tissue damage. The box also lacked a thermometer that could alert the medical team to the low temperature.The heart, which came from another young boy who drowned, arrived \"burned by frostbite,\" the child's family's lawyer, Francesco Petruzzi, said.Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident and six medics have been placed under formal investigation.The heart transplant went ahead in December but the child, who is just over two years old, had to be placed on life support shortly afterwards. He is now in a \"stable but critical condition\", according to the hospital where he is being treated.The longer the boy is kept on life support, the more serious the complications to his lungs, liver and kidneys could be.On Wednesday, a team of specialist doctors from major hospitals around Italy will convene to decide whether the child's current conditions make him suitable for a new transplant.\"I am not giving up,\" his mother Patrizia Mercolino told Italian media, adding she hoped the child could still be eligible for another donor heart.She has appealed to the Pope for help in finding a new organ for her son.Her lawyer said that if the doctors deemed another transplant not viable, the family would seek a third opinion.\"We must absolutely clarify what happened,\" said health minister Orazio Schillaci. \"We owe it to the child, to the family, but also to all Italians.\"\"We have an excellent national health service which has been able to handle and almost always resolve complex situations. So, I believe citizens should not lose faith.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoChris Mason,Political editorandBrian Wheeler,political reporterCivil Service Blog / GOV.UKDame Antonia Romeo has held senior roles in three government departmentsThe frontrunner to be the next head of the UK civil service faced allegations from several people about her behaviour when she was a senior diplomat in New York, according to documents seen by the BBC.Former officials have told the BBC that it is \"disingenuous\" for the Cabinet Office to state that there had only been a single official complaint.Dame Antonia Romeo is currently the senior civil servant at the Home Office and is highly regarded by some in Whitehall for her ability to get things done.But claims about her conduct when she was the UK's consul general in New York a decade ago have led to critics to question her suitability for the role of cabinet secretary, which would put her at the head of the civil service.The government says three allegations relating to her use of expenses and bullying of staff when she was in New York were investigated and there was \"no case to answer\".The Cabinet Office said the three allegations were from a single complaint, that she had been spoken to about her management style after the complaint had been dismissed, and that no similar claims have been raised in any of her other roles.Sources have told the BBC there had, in fact, been complaints about Dame Antonia's conduct in New York from several people.Sir Matthew Rycroft, who was the UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York when Dame Antonia was consul general and Rupert McNeil, the government's then head of human resources have both said in recent days that there were was just one complaint.But a source told the BBC: \"To argue publicly that there was just one complaint is willfully misleading. They were presented to London in one dossier, but there were multiple complaints.\"In documents setting out the complaints, Dame Antonia is described as behaving in an \"unreasonable,\" \"degrading,\" and \"demeaning\" way towards staff and of being more interested in promoting her own \"personal brand\" on social media than that of the UK government.\"She's a diplomat, not a D-list celebrity. My 15-year-old, social media obsessed, brother is less shameless in his self-promotion,\" reads some contemporaneous testimony.One member of the UK's team described feeling \"emotionally battered\".As the UK's consul general between 2016 and 2017 Dame Antonia's job involved promoting UK trade and business in New York, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum to take Britain out of the EU.The BBC has learned that 47% of staff in New York said they had experienced bullying in the workplace in an annual staff survey  - the highest level ever recorded anywhere in the Foreign Office.It is understood that in most government departments or divisions the figure is usually in low single figures. The survey covered a 12 month period, including three months in which Dame Antonia was in post.Dame Antonia's critics acknowledge her abilities in documents seen by the BBC, with one saying she was \"smart, dynamic and really talented.\" Another said she was an \"extremely intelligent, innovative thinker\".But there was also criticism of her management style, with one person saying she was  \"very demanding, very disrespectful, very threatening\".\"I'm used to big egos but this was something else. The minute she heard the word 'no' she'd say I'll go to your boss. But it was worse than that. She would go to your boss's boss and your boss's boss's boss,\" they added.Someone else told us: \"If you don't say 'yes' to her she's not only going to screw your career, but she'll screw all of those around you.\"Her approach, it was claimed, \"inflames rather than calms a situation\" and \"creates a culture of fear and anxiety\".The majority of the complaints seen by the BBC were from female members of staff.The allegations were so serious a former ambassador to Japan, Sir Tim Hitchens, was flown to New York to look into it.His work examined allegations of \"bullying behaviour, financial probity, and putting her private objectives above those of the wider Consulate-General or government\".The BBC has been told the Foreign Office's investigation concluded there was a case for Dame Antonia to answer about her behaviour towards colleagues, but there was no case to answer about what was called \"financial probity\" and is understood to refer to expenses.A Whitehall source said: \"The fact that selective excerpts are now being resurfaced, almost a decade on, to substantiate vexatious anonymous briefings from disgruntled individuals is frankly unconscionable.\"An email from the time raised concerns about Dame Antonia's use of social media.It said: \"Antonia's obsession with promoting her personal brand over the work and priorities of HMG has created an untenably tense and bullying atmosphere for all staff\".Staff also reported, as one put it, that Romeo insisted they \"frame articles in Vogue and the New Yorker about her and place them in the Residence guest bathroom directly in the line of site at all angles so that regardless of, um, how you use the bathroom, you have to stare at a photo of her in a magazine spread staring back at you.\"One former colleague said in an email: \"I'm extremely alarmed that Antonia, who holds one of the highest diplomatic positions here in the United States, seems to be focusing an undue amount on building her personal Twitter brand.\"Government sources say the magazine interviews were arranged by the Foreign Office communications team and it is the role of any diplomat overseas to promote the UK and British brands, including on social media.Dame Antonia has held a string of senior roles since her time in New York and is currently one of three figures sharing the role of cabinet secretary on an interim basis, following the departure of Sir Chris Wormald last week.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \"Antonia Romeo is an outstanding leader with 25 years of public service. She has been appointed to three different Permanent Secretary roles and has led hundreds of thousands of public servants to deliver for governments of all stripes.\"As we have repeatedly said, one formal complaint was raised nine years ago which was thoroughly investigated. The allegations were dismissed on the basis that there was no case to answer.\"It is entirely inappropriate to resurface dismissed HR proceedings almost a decade later.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoJoe PikePolitical correspondentGetty ImagesKeir Starmer and his team knew last week that a U-turn on delaying council elections was inevitable, and they knew it would be painful.From my conversations with some of those involved, they sound frustrated, downbeat and a little annoyed.The PM's advisers correctly predicted that Nigel Farage would paint their reversal as a victory for him - after all, ministers were forced to cave ahead of an imminent legal challenge from Reform UK.The alternative may, however, have been even more embarrassing for the government. Imagine their legal arguments being picked apart in court, perhaps a judge criticising their actions, and even Nigel Farage celebrating a major win in front of TV cameras on the steps of the Royal Courts of Justice.Allies of Local Government Secretary Steve Reed - who is ultimately responsible for this reversal - argue that their approach shifted because the legal advice changed. But they won't explain how.\"We're trying to make policy while live legal advice is fed in,\" says one official. \"It's never going to be perfect.\"It seems highly likely that ministers were warned that they might lose Reform's court challenge.Even though the case is now not going ahead, the government still faces a significant lawyers' bill, as well as having to pick up Reform's legal costs which are reported to be more than £100,000.Ministers have also committed to helping those councils that will now need to run complex multi-ward elections with just two and half months' notice.The District Councils Network, which represents many of the smaller councils affected, says voters will be \"bewildered\".The fallout from this embarrassment is far from over. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are calling for the government's legal advice to be published - something that is likely to be fiercely resisted in Whitehall.The Lib Dems are also considering using their upcoming 'opposition day' in Parliament next week to try and force the government to reveal what happened.Justifying the delaysMinisters had argued that with local government reorganisation and simplification underway, why hold expensive elections for councils that might not exist in a year or two?A lot of stretched local authorities agreed, but they now face a rush to print ballot papers and prepare polling stations.Labour might have received a political advantage if the election delays had gone ahead.The party currently controls 21 of the 30 English councils where elections were due to be delayed, and opinion polls suggest it may have been difficult to keep hold of all of them.These extra contests may also magnify possible losses for the Conservatives - Kemi Badenoch's party currently holds many of the seats where votes have been reinstated.Reform, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party are likely to be less worried. May 7 could provide opportunities for them to bolster their representation in English local government.Yesterday's shift in policy was both a U-turn, and a humiliation for Local Government Secretary Steve Reed.As to Reform's call for Reed to resign, a government source brushes off the suggestion: \"We're not Manchester United\", they say. \"It's not like we're having one managerial resignation a month.\" ",

    "body": "2 hours agoWatch: Jesse Jackson's life in civil rights, diplomacy, and politicsUS civil rights leader Jesse Jackson died aged 84 on Tuesday morning surrounded by relatives, according to a statement released by his family. \"It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Civil Rights leader and founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the Honorable Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr,\" the family said, adding he died \"peacefully.\"  His cause of death has not been released, but Jackson had been diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy and was in hospital late last year.Tributes poured in for the prominent activist who twice ran to be Democrats' presidential nominee, including from the first black US president, Barack Obama.Jackson is survived by his wife Jacqueline and their children: Santita, Jesse Jr, Jonathan, Yusef, Jacqueline and Ashley. In their statement, Jackson's family said his \"unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and human rights helped shape a global movement for freedom and dignity\". \"A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless from his Presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilising millions to register to vote - leaving an indelible mark on history,\" they added.Along with working with Marting Luther King, Jr, and running for president in 1984 and 1988, Jackson is remembered as the founder of a nonprofit organisation focused on social justice and civil rights, the Rainbow PUSH coalition.Calling Jackson a \"true giant\", Obama said in a statement that Jackson's \"two historic runs for president\" had \"laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land\". Obama added that his wife Michelle \"got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons' kitchen table when she was a teenager\".\"For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history,\" the Obamas also said in the statement. \"From organizing boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect.\"Jackson was admitted to hospital last November, and doctors said he had been diagnosed with a rare degenerative condition called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in April 2025, revising an earlier diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease that Jackson had said was made in 2015.Both diseases affect the brain, nervous system, and muscle control and, according to the American Parkinson Disease Association and the group CurePSP, many people with PSP are initially diagnosed with Parkinson's because a number of the symptoms overlap. Born in 1941 in Greenville, South Carolina, Jackson became involved in politics at an early age. He rose to prominence in the 1960s as a leader in Martin Luther King, Jr 's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was with King when he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968.Over the course of his career, Jackson built a movement to bring America's increasingly diverse population together, with a message that centred on poor and working-class Americans.After his presidential runs, Jackson later positioned himself as an elder statesman within the Democratic Party.His son Jesse Jackson, Jr is a former US congressman.Getty ImagesJackson was remembered by politicians and friends as an agent of change and a transformative leaderShortly after his death was announced, politicians and other public figures took to social media to mourn the loss of Jackson. US President Donald Trump said he knew Jackson \"long before becoming president\". \"He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and 'street smarts,'\" Trump said. \"He was very gregarious - Someone who truly loved people!\"Former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, a former secretary of state, also shared tributes, saying they were friends with Jackson for \"almost fifty years\".\"Reverend Jackson championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives,\" they said in a statement. House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Jackson \"was a legendary voice for the voiceless,\" in a tribute to the late civil rights leader posted on X.\"For decades, while laboring in the vineyards of the community, he inspired us to keep hope alive in the struggle for liberty and justice for all,\" the Democrat said.New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the civil rights leader \"never stopped demanding that America live up to its promise\".\"He marched, he ran, he organized and he preached justice without apology,\" Mamdani said. King's daughter Bernice said Jackson had \"devoted his life to lifting people in poverty, the marginalized, and those pushed to society's edges\". Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, who worked closely with Jackson during the civil rights movement, said Jackson was a \"consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world\". \"He told us we were somebody and made us believe. I will always cherish him taking me under his wing, and I will forever try to do my part to keep hope alive,\" Sharpton said. Watch: BBC interviews Jesse Jackson in Birmingham in 2013",

    "body": "Six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will compete under their nations' flags at the upcoming Winter Paralympics.In September, the International Paralympic Committee lifted its ban on athletes from the two countries competing at the Games.Both countries were suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus a close ally of Russia. A partial ban - allowing athletes to compete as neutrals - was introduced in 2023. However, the four individual governing bodies in charge of the six sports contested at the Paralympics decided to keep their bans in place.In December, Russia and Belarus won an appeal against FIS - the governing body for skiing and snowboarding - at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), permitting them to compete and accumulate ranking points.The IPC confirmed to BBC Sport that the 10 athletes have been awarded bipartite commission invitations to compete in Para-alpine skiing, Para-cross country skiing and Para-snowboarding at the Milan-Cortina Games.\"The IPC can confirm that NPC Russia has been awarded a total of six slots: two in Para-alpine skiing (one male, one female), two in Para-cross country skiing (one male, one female), and two in Para-snowboard (both male),\" it said in a statement.\"NPC Belarus has been awarded four slots in total, all in cross-country skiing (one male and three female).\"Bipartite commission invites are granted to individual athletes, rather than their international federation, and allow the participation of top athletes \"who may not have had the opportunity to qualify through other methods due to extraordinary circumstances\", among other factors.Ukraine has also been awarded bipartite slots in three sports.It will mark the first time a Russian flag has been flown at a Paralympic Games since the Sochi 2014 Games, firstly due to the country's state-sponsored doping programme, before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Russian news agency TASS reports that among the athletes set to compete are Aleksey Bugaev, a three-time Paralympic champion in alpine skiing, and cross-country skiers Ivan Golubkov and Anastasiia Bagiian - both are World Championship medallists.All three returned to competition in January, and both Bugaev and Bagiian have since won World Cup titles.The Milan-Cortina Winter Paralympics will take place from 6-15 March.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDearbail JordanBusiness reporterEPAThe European Union (EU) has launched a formal investigation into fast fashion giant Shein over possible breaches of digital law, including the sale of childlike sex dolls.The European Commission (EC), the EU's executive arm, said it will examine what systems the Chinese firm has in place to prevent the sale of illegal products \"including content which could constitute child sexual abuse material\".It will also investigate the \"addictive design\" of Shein's platform and the transparency of the system it uses to suggest products and content to shoppers.Shein said: \"Protecting minors and reducing the risk of harmful content and behaviours are central to how we develop and operate our platform.\"Last year, Shein was reported to French authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website.The firm said it removed the products immediately, banned the sellers, and removed the sale of sex dolls \"regardless of appearance\" across its global site. It also said it worked with local and international authorities on investigations into both the buyers and sellers of the childlike sex dolls.The Commission said it will investigate the systems Shein uses to limit the sale of illegal products. It said that would include weapons but declined to specify particular items.It has sent a number of requests for information to Shein in the past and EC spokesperson Thomas Regnier told the BBC's World Business Report that Shein was \"very cooperative\". But the EC said that once there were indications that a platform may have systemic risks for its users, the EC could open proceedings to investigate further.Regnier said the EC was concerned about the \"addictive\" nature of Shein's website, and the \"gamification\" of the platform, including its \"rewards programme\" for consumers.He said that the Commission was not against reward programmes per se, but that online platform algorithms were \"often opaque\".\"You don't know how they're being designed [and] you're not in control of what you see,\" he said.The EC will also examine the transparency of so-called \"recommender systems\" which use a shopper's data to push certain products their way. It said that under the Digital Services Act (DSA), Shein must disclosed the main parameters it uses to recommend products and must provide users with \"at least one easily accessible option\" that is not based on using their data to profile their likely purchases. Opening a formal investigation into a company means that the EC can take \"enforcement steps\" such as fines of up to 6% of a company's global sales. In the most recent figures available, Shein reported $38bn in sales for 2024.A spokesperson for Shein said: \"Over the last few months, we have continued to invest significantly in measures to strengthen our compliance with the DSA. \"These include comprehensive systemic-risk assessments and mitigation frameworks, enhanced protections for younger users, and ongoing work to design our services in ways that promote a safe and trusted user experience,\" it said.",

Although earlier warnings for snow and ice expired on Tuesday morning, the Met Office warned commuters to remain vigilant due to the risk of black ice and slippery conditions.The UKHSA's yellow cold health alert covers all of England except London and the South East. The alert will be in place from 18:00 on Tuesday until 18:00 on Friday.The agency warns that the weather is likely to have \"minor impacts on health and social care services, including increased use of healthcare services and a greater risk to life of vulnerable people\".A yellow weather warning for snow across most of Wales and parts of western England will come into effect at 16:00 on Wednesday and will be in place until 06:00 on Thursday.A separate yellow warning for rain will be in place for much of the south of England from 06:00 on Wednesday until Thursday at 08:00.How to drive safely in icy weatherTuesday has been a mostly dry with some spells of sunshine. But with temperatures only reaching 3C to 7C and a brisk north-westerly wind, it felt colder - particularly in eastern areas where wind the chill made it feel close to freezing.Temperatures are set to fall close to freezing for most of the UK on Wednesday morning. In parts of northern and north-east Scotland, temperatures could fall to -8C. Icy stretches are likely.Weather conditions will become more unsettled again on Wednesday with a band of rain pushing in from the south and west. This could bring a mix of rain, sleet and hill snow, according to the Met Office. The forecaster said the system is being monitored closely with the potential for further snow warnings.Later in the week, conditions are expected to turn milder, and although further showers are forecast, drier spells in between are also expected.Getty ImagesA flooded playground in the Chertsey area of Surrey, where a flood warning is in placeMeanwhile, 65 flood warnings and 178 flood alerts have been issued by the Environment Agency across England on Tuesday - concentrated in the south and the Midlands - following a long spell of wet weather.Two flood alerts were in place in Wales on Tuesday for the lower Severn catchment in Powys, and south Pembrokeshire.Jonathan Day, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said more than 24,000 homes and businesses have been protected but about 330 flooded.With further heavy rain forecast for southern England and South Wales on Wednesday, and the ground already saturated, more flood warnings or alerts could be issued.More on this story",

    "body": "Viral face depuffing tricks - skin experts reveal if they work5 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesFrom plunging your face into bowls of ice water to rolling frozen tools across your cheeks, social media is full of quick fixes promising to depuff your face in minutes.While these techniques look convincing on screen, dermatologists say many of them are misunderstood, overhyped and at best, temporary. Consultant dermatologist Dr Aiza Jamil says facial puffiness is usually caused by fluid retention and common triggers include high salt and alcohol intake, allergies and lack of sleep. Dr Tina Tian, also a consultant dermatologist explains most viral hacks fall into three categories - cold exposure, massage and temporary tightening effects.They can \"genuinely reduce visible swelling and provide relief but the key word is temporary - they won't permanently change facial structure\". So what actually helps with facial puffiness, and what's more myth than miracle? Here's the truth about three common treatments.1. Cold therapy Getty ImagesCold exposure causes blood vessels to constrictIf you've ever hovered over a sink debating whether to dunk your face into a bowl of ice water, you're not alone. The \"ice facial\" has become a social media rite of passage and is half beauty hack, half endurance challenge.Tina explains the appeal comes from the fact that the \"cold exposure causes blood vessels to constrict, which can reduce swelling\".This is the logic behind ice facials, cryo globes and refrigerated sheet masks but Tina says you don't need a dramatic ice plunge to get the benefit as a chilled compress or even a splash of cold water can do the job. Aiza adds that it can give you a \"slightly tighter, fresher appearance, particularly in the morning\" but results are temporary and the effect \"lasts hours rather than days\". Tina says there's also a fine line between refreshing and overdoing it as \"very aggressive ice exposure can irritate sensitive skin or trigger rosacea, so keep it gentle\". 2. Facial rollers Getty ImagesIt's important to use the tools gently, says TinaOnce niche spa tools, facial rollers and gua sha stones are now bathroom staples for many of us. Promoted as sculpting devices, they've built a reputation for lifting and contouring but Aiza says they \"do not permanently tighten skin, change skin structure, or remove fat\". She adds that it's best to see them as a \"soothing tool\".They can however help with reducing facial puffiness temporarily. \"A gentle massage encourages lymphatic drainage and reduces fluid pooling if used regularly,\" Tina says. When you roll or glide these products across the skin, you're helping stagnant fluid move away from the face and towards the lymph nodes, where it can drain naturally. Tina adds that cooling the tools can boost the results so some people choose to keep them in the fridge. If done properly, it's unlikely to cause you any harm, but Tina warns that \"too much pressure can cause bruising or broken capillaries, so be gentle\".3. Caffeine creamsGetty ImagesYou've probably seen caffeine eye cream everywhere - it's recommended by influencers, stacked in skincare aisles and tucked into \"morning routine\" videos promising instant bright eyes. The skin around the eyes is especially prone to swelling because fluid can collect there easily.Unlike many beauty trends, Tina says this one does have some evidence behind it. \"Caffeine is a mild vasoconstrictor [narrows blood vessels], so caffeine-containing eye creams can genuinely reduce puffiness,\" she says. Caffeine temporarily shrinks blood vessels and less dilation means less visible swelling. Aiza adds that it can help \"reduce fluid retention and some under-eye darkness\". If you're going to use an eye cream, Tina recommends looking for one with hydrating ingredients alongside the caffeine as that supports skin quality. She adds that you can also keep the cream in the fridge or even \"apply it with the back of a cold spoon\". Aiza says DIY alternatives like using a cold spoon or chilled tea bags \"works similarly by temporarily reducing swelling and soothing skin\".Tina agrees and says these methods follow the same principle \"but can provide a lesser effect\".While caffeine eye cream can help reduce puffiness, Tina says it's more important to focus on the cause. \"Reduce evening salt and alcohol, treat allergies properly, prioritise sleep and slightly elevate your head at night. Most puffiness isn't a medical issue and will settle on its own but Tina says that \"if it's persistent, worsening, painful or associated with other symptoms such as breathlessness or swelling elsewhere in the body, it should be assessed medically\".

    "body": "5 hours agoGetty ImagesThousands of students and graduates are bringing legal action against their universities, over the quality of teaching and learning during Covid lockdowns.Pre-action letters were sent to 36 universities as part of the Student Group Claim, saying students did not receive the full education they paid for during the pandemic.Universities UK, which represents more than 140 institutions, said Covid was an \"unprecedented challenge\" and the sector had to adapt quickly and creatively to support students.So why are these legal challenges starting now and what might be the outcome?Why are students claiming?The latest tranche of pre-action letters follows a settlement between University College London (UCL) and about 6,000 of its students, who were also part of the Student Group Claim.That case had been due to go to trial this year, but ended out of court with a confidential settlement, so we don't know the details of the outcome.UCL has not admitted any liability and said it had \"worked diligently to deliver teaching and student support in unprecedented circumstances\".Now, pre-action letters - official documents warning of potential legal proceedings if a dispute is not resolved - have been sent to 36 other institutions.Those letters allege that students missed out on the full education they paid for, and other university experiences, because of the Covid lockdowns.\"It's very simple, in English law if you paid for a five-star holiday and received a one-star holiday, you are entitled to compensation,\" Shimon Goldwater, a partner at Asserson Solicitors, said.During the pandemic, most university teaching shifted online for long periods of time, with students either returned home or locked down in university accommodation.Access to shared campus facilities was restricted, which caused particular issues for students on practical courses or those who required specialist resources.Graduation ceremonies were virtual or delayed, and graduates entered a job market that was only just recovering from the pandemic.What are they asking for?The letters to the universities act as a notice that the claimants intend to seek damages for learning which students claim they paid for but did not actually receive.If the university disagrees, court proceedings could follow.One of the pre-action letters seen by the BBC says former students are seeking redress for the academic years 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22.It is hard to know how likely it is that any or all of the student claims will be successful, or how much they could be entitled to if they are.Goldwater, one of the lawyers for the Student Group Claim, told Radio 4's PM programme that \"the people we are representing would only require relatively modest amounts of compensation compared with universities' budgets\".\"Typically a student who was an undergraduate at university during the pandemic, we say would be entitled to around £5,000,\" he said. \"That's what they would be claiming as an estimate.\"In the UCL case, the university did not admit any liability and the details of the settlement remain confidential, with neither the institution nor lawyers for the students able to discuss it.Who is claiming?More than 170,000 students and graduates from 36 universities are involved in the latest claims, which have been set into motion by the pre-action letters.Goldwater has said lawyers are only claiming on behalf of students signed up to the Student Group Claim.While the next stage is to pursue claims against the 36 universities, other universities could face action in the future, Goldwater said.He added that students could register to be updated as to whether claims will be brought against their university. The deadline for student claims relating to Covid is in September 2026.Which universities are affected?The case against UCL involved 6,000 students and was due to be heard in court in March.However, the deal now appears to have opened the way for large-scale legal action against the university sector.The 36 universities to have received a pre-action letter are:University of BathUniversity of BirminghamBirmingham City UniversityUniversity of BristolCardiff UniversityCity St George's, University of LondonCoventry UniversityDe Montfort UniversityUniversity of East AngliaUniversity of ExeterImperial College LondonUniversity of KentKing's College LondonUniversity of LeedsLeeds Beckett UniversityUniversity of LiverpoolLiverpool John Moores UniversityLondon School of Economics and Political ScienceLoughborough UniversityThe University of ManchesterManchester Metropolitan UniversityNewcastle UniversityUniversity of NottinghamNottingham Trent UniversityNorthumbria UniversityUniversity of PortsmouthQueen Mary University of LondonUniversity of ReadingUniversity of SheffieldSheffield Hallam UniversityUniversity of SouthamptonSwansea UniversityUniversity of the Arts LondonUniversity of The West of EnglandUniversity of WarwickUniversity of YorkWhat could happen next?It is hard to know how these cases will proceed, but it is likely that it could take some time.The 2026 trial date for the UCL case had been set in July 2024, and that had followed months of previous court hearings and letters between the lawyers representing each side.The other universities which are now involved will have a chance to respond to the lawyers for the Student Group Claim who issued the pre-action letters before any further proceedings can begin.",

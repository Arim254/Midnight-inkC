Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for the US president if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday.No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said.Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added.It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can used by ICE agents towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.Judge Katherine Menendez earlier ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations.Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January.City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".",

    "body": "US forces have carried out a strike which killed an al-Qaeda leader \"who had direct ties\" to an Islamic State (IS) group terrorist responsible for an ambush which killed three Americans in Syria, officials have said. The US Central Command (Centcom) said in a statement that Bilal Hasan al-Jasim was killed in the attack on Friday, which took place in northwest Syria. The statement says he was \"directly connected\" with the IS group gunman who killed and injured American and Syrian personnel. The BBC has not independently verified the US claims.\"The death of a terrorist operative linked the death of three Americans demonstrates our resolve in pursuing terrorists who attack our forces,\" said Centcom commander Adm Brad Cooper.\"There is no safe place for those who conduct, plot, or inspire attacks on American citizens and our warfighters. We will find you.\"The US has been carrying out large-scale strikes on IS targets in Syria, dubbed Operation Hawkeye Strike, since the deaths of the three American on 13 December 2025 in Palmyra, central Syria.So far, the US has hit more than 100 \"infrastructure and weapons site targets\", using 200 precision munitions, according to Centcom.Earlier this month, Centcom said it had killed or captured nearly 25 IS group members in 11 missions between 20 December and 29 December.Syria has been in a fragile state since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime in December 2024, which effectively ended a civil war that had ravaged the country for 13 years.Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known by his nom-de-guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has been serving as the country's president since his rebel group ousted Assad and solidified control.IS has been weakened in Syria, but still remains active, predominantly carrying out attacks against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east in 2025.",

    "body": "Ant and Dec have apologised for promoting their new podcast with a video that has been criticised for containing imagery that was insensitive and may be triggering for people struggling with mental health.Social media users characterised the opening shot of the clip - showing a pair of feet dangling above the ground - as evoking \"suicide imagery\" and \"triggering\".The TV presenters said in a statement: \"We did not mean to cause any offence with this promo video and we are sorry if it upset anyone.\"The clip was created to promote their podcast, Hanging Out With Ant & Dec, which is due to launch later this month as part of their new digital entertainment channel. It has now been deleted.The video, which was shared on Instagram and X on Friday, opened with a close-up image of feet suspended in the air, before showing the duo pegged to a washing line.Former X Factor contestant and mental health advocate Katie Waissel described the video as \"triggering, insensitive and frankly reckless to push out as 'entertainment'\".\"This opening visual of feet suspended above the ground is not a harmless 'play on words',\" she wrote, adding: \"The suicide imagery is impossible to ignore.\"Other social media users called the clip \"insensitive\", \"triggering\" and in \"poor taste\". Ant and Dec said in a statement on Saturday that they had \"taken on board comments\" and deleted the video.The podcast will see the duo catch up about their lives as well as taking questions and comments from listeners.It is part of their new Belta Box brand, which will be on platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, and will also host classic clips from their TV careers as well as \"new digital formats\".If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.",

    "body": "Turkey's Zeynep Sonmez rushed to help a ball girl who fainted during the qualifier's surprise first-round victory over Ekaterina Alexandrova at the Australian Open.As Alexandrova was serving for the second set to level the tie, the ball girl - stood beside the umpire's chair - fell flat on her back before quickly getting back up.Sonmez sprinted over to her and helped her walk over to the side of the court, where she received medical attention in the shade.The ball girl managed to get back to her feet and was helped off court by medical staff, with play resuming after a six-minute delay.Russian 11th seed Alexandrova went on to win the set, but world number 112 Sonmez fought back from 3-0 down in the decider to complete a 7-5 4-6 6-4 upset on her fourth match point.It is the biggest win of the 23-year-old's career and moves her into the second round at Melbourne Park for the first time.Temperatures reached highs of 28C on Sunday at Melbourne Park as the first major of the year got under way, while the mercury is forecast to reach 35C by Saturday, 24 January.The Australian Open updated its extreme heat policy (EHP) in 2019 after conducting research into the effects of heat stress on tennis players.This research led to the development of the heat stress scale (HSS), which is used to decide when the conditions get too challenging, and when players' health could be at risk.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCThe Observer headline declares \"Blackmail over Greenland\" after US President Donald Trump announced \"rising tariffs on the UK and European allies until he gets control of the Danish territory\". A striking image of red-and-white Greenland flags waved by protesters in front of snow-capped hills dominates the front page. \"Greenland is not for sale!\" read several of their posters.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's anger at Trump's tariffs leads the Sunday Times. Trump \"blindsided his Nato allies\" with the move, it says. Meanwhile, Sir Keir's aide Darren Jones has been accused of launching a \"briefing war\" against Health Secretary Wes Streeting.For the Sunday Telegraph, Trump's actions amount to a \"trade war\". The paper highlights the PM's comments that the tariffs are \"completely wrong\", and that is backed in an editorial column by former US national security adviser John Bolton, who declares: \"This is the worst move of his presidency.\" Separately, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch tells the paper the Conservatives are the only party that will stop Britain becoming a \"poodle\" state.The Greenland tariffs also lead the Independent website. Trump has said the 10% trade fees will remain in place unless a deal is reached to sell the Danish territory to the US by the start of February, the paper reports. A photo of protesters waving Greenland flags in Copenhagen takes up much of the front page.The Mail on Sunday has gotten hold of a \"secret defection memo\" that it says fell into the hands of Tory leader Kemi Badenoch before Robert Jenrick's move to Reform. The memo is alleged to recommend Jenrick style himself as the \"new sheriff in town\", which the Mail dubs \"a bizarre plot\". In a royal exclusive, the Mail says Princess Eugenie has cut Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor out of her life.Following Jenrick's defection, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage tells the Sunday Express it's time for the right to unite behind his party. \"They want to fiddle with the plumbing and we think it needs a brand new boiler,\"  Farage said of the differences between the Tories and Reform.\"I will be free\" writes the Daily Star, as it says killer nurse Lucy Letby has told \"fellow lags and prison staff\" her convictions will be \"quashed within months\". Letby is currently serving 15 whole-life terms after she was convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims.A photo of the Duke of Sussex next to King Charles leads the Sunday Mirror as they describe \"Harry's lonely trip home\". While \"both are in London\", the pair will not see each other this week.The Sunday People reports Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas has undergone a \"brain scan after fall\". Her \"hospital shock\" comes \"just days before tour\".A TV row gives the Sun on Sunday its front page lead. It reports \"fury at anti-Muslim posts\" that have been discovered in the social media feed of a contestant on the upcoming series of BBC One's The Apprentice is caught in a \"race rant storm\". Contestant Levi Hague has apologised for making comments containing \"truly awful language\" in posts written more than a decade ago. The series is produced by an independent production company and the BBC said in a statement it had asked the company for \"further assurances on their social media checks given the process has not been completed to a satisfactory standard in this instance\".The Sunday Times says Nato allies were left \"blind-sided\" by US President Donlad Trump's threat of tariffs on governments opposing an American takeover of Greenland. The paper understands the the UK \"was not warned\" about the announcement. The Sunday Telegraph says Trump has declared trade war on Britain and describes the issue as the \"biggest crisis\" in US-UK relations Sir Keir Starmer has faced since becoming prime minister. The Observer calls the potential  tariffs a \"humiliating blow\" for the prime minister who has \"risked political capital in trying to shore up the UK's special relationship with the US\".The Mail on Sunday claims to have obtained a private media plan for the former shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, while he was plotting to join Reform UK. The memo reportedly says he should be styled as \"the new sheriff in town\" adding his defection would be \"the biggest\" Reform has ever had. The Sunday Times is also said to have seen the documents. It says they include \"handwritten annotations and tweaks that appear to have been penned by Jenrick himself\". His team has told the paper he had no involvement in drafting the original document.In an interview with the Sunday Express, the leader of Reform Nigel Farage describes Robert Jenrick's defection as an \"historic moment\" and something that marks \"the coming together of the right\". But \"the danger\", the Sun on Sunday says, is that instead of \"attacking the failing government\" Reform and the Conservatives are \"too busy attacking one another\".Two royal relationships make the front pages. According to the Sunday Mirror, Prince Harry's return to the UK this week will not involve a meeting with the King. Sources insist the monarch's week is \"packed with engagements\". The Mail on Sunday reports that Princess Eugenie has \"cut off all contact\" with her father, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. The Princess is said to be taking a dim view of his refusal to apologise to victims of Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Mountbatten Windsor is reportedly \"devastated\" at the estrangement.The Sun on Sunday leads on a race row surrounding the BBC programme The Apprentice. One of the contestants, 33-year-old Levi Hague, has apologised for anti-Muslim comments on social media. The BBC has described the remarks as \"totally unacceptable\". The production company behind The Apprentice says it will be reviewing the process of background checks.The Sunday Times joins more than 100 people at a cinema in Reading to watch the Lords of the Rings films in a back-to-back viewing. The screening which lasts just over twelve hours had been arranged to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the trilogy. While viewers were not \"venturing to the fires of Mount Doom\", the Sunday Times warns that sitting down for the equivalent of a half a day meant fans may get headaches, eye complaints and some aches and pains.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "12 hours agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", and blamed the US for the deaths.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.\"Those linked to Israel and the US caused massive damage and killed several thousand,\" Khamenei said, quoted by Iranian state media.\"We consider the US president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation.\"The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

    "body": "'Young 40s': Gen Z has found a new way to mock millennials for their style in South Korea9 hours agoHyojung KimBBC KoreanInstagram/@detailanceJi says he has become more self-conscious interacting with younger colleaguesJi Seung-ryeol, 41, prides himself on his sense of fashion. He diligently shares mirror selfies on Instagram, where everyone knows the more likes you get, the cooler you are.  So he was bewildered to find out that men his age have become the subject of ridicule online, mocked for shoehorning their way into styles associated with Gen Z and younger millennials.AI-generated caricatures of this demographic have gone viral on social media: a middle-aged man decked out in street wear and clutching an iPhone. The kids call them \"Young 40s\".The memes have made Ji's beloved Nike Air Jordans and Stüssy T-shirts the butt of jokes—and the source of much indignation.\"I'm just buying and wearing things I've liked for a long time, now that I can afford them,\" he tells the BBC. \"Why is this something to be attacked for?\"The iPhone that started it allOnce celebrated as pioneers of taste in the 1990s, the tide of public opinion on 40-year-olds turned after the release of the iPhone 17 last September.The smartphone, long considered the preserve of the youth, was suddenly recast as a tacky trademark of Young 40s. These are, in the words of Gen Z Jeong Ju-eun, people \"trying too hard to look young\", who \"refuse to accept that time has passed\".The figures seem to reflect this shift. While the majority of young South Koreans still prefer the iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy, over the past year Apple's market share fell by 4% among Gen Z consumers and rose 12% for people in their 40s, according to research by Gallup.Something similar played out a few years back with Geriatric Millennials, born in the early '80s, whose brand of humour—the crying-laughing emoji, finger moustaches and the word \"adulting\"—was derided as cringey.Back then, debate over Geriatric Millennials sparked self-deprecating jokes, think pieces and quizzes dictating if you're meant to pile on the ribbing or be subjected to it.The same trends have taken hold in South Korea with Young 40s.News1The iPhone, long considered the preserve of young people, is now seen as a trademark of Young 40sIn Korea, age difference, even by a year, forms the basis of social hierarchy. Age is one of the first things strangers ask each other, setting the tone for future interactions: how they address one another, who gets to open the bottle of soju at parties (it's usually the oldest person) and which way to tip your shot glass (the correct answer: away from your seniors).But the Young 40 memes also represent Korean youth's growing scepticism of this almost forced reverence for elders.Just a few years ago, the term \"kkondae\" was another buzzword among young South Korean to describe an annoying breed of rigid, condescending elders.Such friction has been exacerbated by social media, where \"multiple generations mix within the same space\", says Lee Jae-in, a sociology professor at Korea University's Sejong campus.\"The old pattern where different generations consumed separate cultural spaces has largely disappeared,\" he adds.A self-conscious sandwich generationPopularised in marketing circles in the 2010s, the term \"Young 40\" originally referred to consumers with youthful sensibilities. They were health-conscious, active and comfortable with technology—an important target demographic for companies.\"In the past, people in their 40s were seen as already old,\" says Kim Yong-Sup, a trend analyst widely credited with coining the term \"Young 40\".As the median age of South Korea's society rose, however, these people were \"no longer on the verge of old age but at the centre of society\", he says.But the marketing term has since taken a viral, sardonic turn. Over the past year, \"Young 40\" was mentioned online more than 100,000 times - more than half the references were used in a negative context, according to analytics platform SomeTrend. Many of them appeared alongside words like \"old\" and \"disgusting\".An offshoot of the meme is Sweet Young 40, a sarcastic label for middle-aged men who like to hit on young women.Getty ImagesMany South Korean youth face soaring house prices and cut-throat competition in the job marketSome see the jokes about Young 40s as a form of punching up: these are people at the peak of their careers, who amassed wealth in a time of economic stability and a property boom.On the other side are Gen Z and young millennials, born a couple of decades later, who face soaring house prices and cut-throat competition in the job market. In their eyes, Young 40s represent \"the generation that made it through just before the door of opportunity closed\", according to psychologist Oh Eun-kyung.\"They are seen not simply as individuals with personal tastes, but as symbols of privilege and power,\" she says. \"That's why the energy of mockery is focused on them.\"But Ji, the 41-year-old fashion enthusiast who lived through the so-called golden era, tells a different version of that story.After experiencing the Asian financial crisis as a teen, Ji entered a tough job market in his 20s, submitting around 60-70 applications to land a job. His generation is one that \"had very little to enjoy growing up, and only began to enjoy things later, as adults\", he says.Instagram/@detailanceJi says he feels \"caught in between\" two generationsNow at the workplace, he often finds himself sandwiched between two worlds. The generation above him ran a \"strict, top-down system where you did what you were told\", while below him is \"a generation that asks 'why''\".\"We're a generation that has experienced both cultures. We feel caught in between.\"While the ability to straddle two generations was once a badge of honour, Ji says he has become self-conscious about interacting with younger colleagues for fear of being labelled a kkondae or Young 40.\"These days, I hardly organise drinking gatherings,\" he says. \"I try to keep conversations focused on work or career concerns, and only share personal stories when discussions naturally deepen.\"According to Kang, another fashionable 41-year-old, sitting at the heart of the Young 40 meme is a deeply human desire.\"As you get older, longing for youth becomes completely natural. Wanting to look young is something every generation shares.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoDan WhitworthMoney Box reporter, LondonBeth KojderBeth Kojder became pregnant and gave birth to her baby while still waiting for British Gas to provide an accurate final billA woman says it is \"absurd\" it took British Gas 15 months to produce a final bill and refund more than £1,500 of credit, despite the energy ombudsman telling the firm to do so nearly one year ago.Beth Kojder moved out of her one-bed flat in south-east London in October 2024 but complained to the ombudsman a few months later when the company did not send her a final bill or refund her credit.In February 2025 the ombudsman decided in Beth's favour and told British Gas to carry out her request. But it has no legal powers to force it.Beth only received the offer of her money this week, just days before her case was due to be heard in a small claims court.British Gas said it was \"implementing the ombudsman's remedy\" for Beth, adding it was \"very sorry\" for how long it had taken.Beth told the BBC the process had been \"relentless and it's tiring and it's completely draining\".When she moved out of her flat, she asked British Gas for a final bill using the meter readings she provided. She also asked it to refund her £1,700 less a few hundred pounds she expected to owe for her final bill.\"It's a significant amount of money. Maybe not to British Gas but it is to me,\" said Beth, who had her first baby in December. \"That's almost £2,000 I could have done with. Then there's all the admin.\"Not legally enforceableWhen she didn't receive her final bill or refund she complained to British Gas.But Beth said she \"got nowhere\" so took her complaint to the energy ombudsman.It is an independent, impartial dispute resolution scheme that energy customers can complain to eight weeks after first complaining to their supplier.Energy suppliers are legally obliged as part of their licence conditions to be a member of an independent customer dispute scheme. But the energy ombudsman is not a statutory body and it cannot legally force suppliers to act.In 2024, there were 93,000 complaints accepted by the energy ombudsman with around 70% of those cases ruled in favour of consumers, with suppliers required to take action within 28 days.In the vast majority of cases, suppliers met that deadline, but in many thousands of cases the deadline was either missed or no action was taken at all.It has prompted the Department for Energy to look at ways to strengthen the energy ombudsman saying the number of decisions not being implemented quickly enough was too high.Beth KojderBeth's energy bill was for her small, one-bed flat in south east LondonIn Beth's case the ombudsman issued four resolutions in February 2025. British Gas actioned three minor ones including a written apology and a goodwill credit of £100 for shortfalls in service.But the decision also required British Gas to \"complete the final billing of the account... based on the [meter] readings already provided by Beth.\" But 11 months on and that still hadn't happened.Beth said the only option she had left was to go down a legal route via a small claims court.\"I just felt completely desperate and like it was the only option to try to get some traction,\" she said.Beth KojderBeth said it was frustrating how much intervention she, as a consumer, had to do to resolve the matterBBC Radio 4's Money Box first contacted British Gas about this case in early December and, up until late Thursday night, Beth was resigned to having to go to the small claims court to get what she strongly feels she's owed.Then, British Gas came back with an offer of everything Beth was asking for, which she has happily accepted.Beth said she was pleased to get the matter resolved but said she was frustrated that it had taken so many months to do so and felt British Gas had \"completely failed\" to engage with the ombudsman process.\"I still think the fact it's taken this long to reach [a resolution] is absurd. And the level of intervention that's been required on my part as a consumer is unbelievable.\"British Gas said: \"We're implementing the Ombudsman's remedy and, together with Ms Kojder, are finalising a resolution to her claim. We appreciate this has been difficult for her and we're very sorry for the length of time it has taken to put things right.\"Ofgem's deputy director of retail compliance, Jackie Gehrmann, told the BBC that in the last year suppliers have paid out £27m in fines and voluntary payment agreements in consumer related issues.\"The message to suppliers is really, really clear. When the ombudsman makes a ruling they should implement that ruling as quickly as possible,\" she said.The DESNZ told the BBC: \"We are strengthening the Energy Ombudsman so consumers can be confident that when it has ruled in their favour, action will be taken.\"",

    "body": "Rival chip shop-owning brothers call each night 'to see who's taken the most'3 days agoAngela FergusonBBC WalesLeanne JonesThe brothers said they were \"proud\" of the work the other had doneTwo brothers who both run award-winning fish and chip shops have spoken of the \"healthy\" rivalry they enjoy, saying they \"ring each other every night and see who's taken the most\".Ouday Hikary, 43, runs Hikary's Fish Bar in Neath, Neath Port Talbot, while his older brother Emir Hikary, 46, runs Hiks, which is just 10 miles (17km) away in Swansea.Both businesses have been named in the 2026 top 50 takeaways in the UK, which is put together by fish and chip shop industry trade publication Fry Magazine.The brothers said they were \"proud\" of the work the other had done.Emir first got into the industry after being made redundant from his job in a call centre, using his redundancy money to buy a van and sell fish and chips opposite Ouday's pub in Swansea. When the pub closed, the brothers opened Hiks together out of the same building in 2010, and a year later Ouday branched out by opening his own fish and chip shop in Neath.Leanne JonesOuday Hikary opened his business in Neath back in 2011He went on to win the Wales category of the National Fish and Chip Awards in 2016.\"He's my brother and I'm so proud of what he has achieved and if he does really well I'll be the first one to cheer him and be his biggest fan,\" Emir, who has five children,  told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, to which Ouday responded: \"I'm so proud of you.\"Leanne JonesOuday and Emir Hikary's businesses have both been named in the top 50 UK takeawaysRunning the business is a family affair for father-of-four Ouday, with his wife Kasia doing admin for the business and three of his children also helping out.He said he loved running his fish and chip shop as \"every day is different\" and he enjoyed the banter with the customers and being part of the community.Ouday said it was good to have won the award during what was a challenging time to run such a business, with the high cost of fish, coupled with factors such as the cost of living crisis.Emir said: \"We haven't had things handed on a plate to us. \"We worked together when we first started off and we have to work really hard.\"He said he was \"very happy\" that he and his brother had won the awards adding they were proud of their staff for the key role they played in the win.Leanne JonesHikary's Fish Bar in Neath has won a number of awardsThe brothers will receive a plaque which they plan to put in pride of place above the range in their respective shops.Emir said they wanted to thank fellow fish and chip shop owners at the Roma Fish Bar in Gorseinon, Swansea, saying they had supported them right from the beginning and \"they have always been there for us\".Both businesses have been previous winners in the top 50 UK takeaways awards, with Hiks also reaching the finals of the Wales category of the National Fish and Chip Shop Awards in 2020.More top stories",

    "body": "2 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorGetty ImagesProtests in support of Greenland took place in Denmark on SaturdayUS President Donald Trump's apparently coercive threat to force Western allies not to oppose his proposed annexation of Greenland, or face further damage to their trade with the US, is without both parallel and precedent.We've had some unusual and unexpected economic threats from President Trump over the past year, but I think it is safe to say this exceeds all of them, and takes us into both surreal and utterly dangerous territory.If taken at face value, it is a form of economic war being levied by the White House on its closest allies.That's because it targets allies at incredibly short notice and for a cause that essentially could break up Nato and the western alliance.This will be leaving officials from those countries absolutely baffled. In fact, it's so outlandish that they may indeed be more baffled than angry.Nobody in the world would assume that a threat like this - based on acquiring the land of your ally - would ever actually happen. Does Trump really have the backing in the US, in Congress, even in his own administration to do this?Is this, as some trade officials have to assume, the biggest TACO (Trump will Chicken Out) of all time? These things can come and go and, economically, these countries have handled the damage so far.Greenland: 'Diplomatic channels are the way to go', US speaker tells BBCThink of Canada. It has seen its trade with the US slump. But its prime minister Mark Carney's strategy has seen Canada's trade surge with the rest of the world by 14% - which amazingly is worth more than was needed to cover its trade lost with the US.Carney has been in China this week pushing \"a new world order\" and pursuing more trade with China, not the detachment sought by some US administration officials.\"This is China versus the world,\" the Trump administration was trying to persuade the rest of the world just three months ago.Carney is showing up this approach, something which is perhaps notable background context for the timing of today's intervention.If, however, we do take Trump's latest threats seriously, they are extremely troubling.Not so much because of the 10% tariff, but because of its rationale - taking land from an ally, and the act of publicly trying to coerce your allies. How would the world react if China or Russia had sent a threat like this to some of their allies?The basis of the threat is clearly deeply worrying.Many in capitals around the world will read Trump's social media announcement and question the functioning of American decision making.President Trump arrives to meet leaders of the allied countries whose economies he has just threatened at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.Most of the world will hope that, by that time, this unparalleled threat will have somehow disappeared.",

    "body": "A grizzly bear is on the loose after attacking a school group in Canada, leaving 11 people injured, two of them critically.The incident happened on Thursday afternoon on a walking trail in the town of Bella Coola, in the province of British Columbia (BC). Residents have been warned to remain indoors while armed officers try to track down the animal. Four of the injured remained in hospital as of Friday afternoon, BC's Health Services Authority has said.A male teacher \"got the whole brunt of it\" and some children were hit with bear spray as the adults tried to fend off the animal, Veronica Schooner, a parent, told the Canadian Press.Ms Schooner said her 10-year-old son was part of the school group, though he was not attacked. \"He said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,\" she said, adding that \"he even felt its fur\".British Columbia Emergency Health Services told the BBC in a statement that two people were critically injured in the attack, two more were seriously hurt, while seven others were treated at the scene.Patients had to be transported to a nearby airport so they could be airlifted to the closest hospital, officials said. The group were from Acwsalcta School, which is run by the Indigenous Nuxalk Nation in the remote town 700km (435 miles) north-west of Vancouver. \"Officers are armed\" the Nation wrote on Facebook. \"Remain indoors and off the highway.\" It added: \"It's hard to know what to say during this very difficult time. We are so grateful for our team and our students.\" The Nation's officials have temporarily shut the school and are offering counselling services.",

    "body": "14 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterSir Keir Starmer has said it will take time to turn the country around, telling voters to judge him at the next general election.The prime minister told the BBC his government had made \"good steps\", particularly on the cost-of-living, but \"we need to do more\".It comes after a dismal few weeks for the PM, who has faced growing criticism and speculation he could face a leadership challenge.The government is also facing a difficult Budget next week, when the chancellor is widely expected to increase taxes.In an interview with the BBC's Chris Mason in Johannesburg, South Africa, where the PM is attending the G20 summit of world leaders, Sir Keir was challenged over why some opinion polls suggest he is the most unpopular prime minister since modern polling began.\"We won an election last year on the manifesto that said we would change the country after 14 years of failure,\" he said.\"I always said that would take time because you can't turn around 14 years of failure in just 12 months or 16 months. \"I'm very conscious that we have to deliver on three things above all else. The first is making sure people feel better off, and that's bearing down on the cost-of-living, making sure the public services are better, in particular the NHS, which is why we put record investment in the NHS, and making sure people feel more safe and secure. \"And I have no doubt that I will rightly be judged against that at the next election.\"Sir Keir has insisted he will lead Labour into the next general election, which is not due until 2029, although he could choose to call one earlier.Last week, allies of the prime minister told journalists that he would fight any attempts by Labour MPs to remove him, with Health Secretary Wes Streeting among those named as plotting a leadership challenge.However, the attempt to strengthen Sir Keir's position appeared to backfire as it brought talk of threats to his leadership into the open and sparked further criticism of the PM.Streeting denied he was planning to challenge Sir Keir and hit out at a \"toxic\" culture within No 10, although he said he did not think the PM was behind the briefings.Sir Keir has insisted the attacks against Streeting had not come from Downing Street.Meanwhile, the PM has faced claims from the the Conservatives his government's Budget is already unravelling, after the chancellor backed away from raising income tax rates - a move which would break an election pledge. Asked if he was frustrated the achievements of his government were being \"drowned out\", Sir Keir told the BBC: \"Every minute that is spent talking about anything other than cost-of-living is a wasted minute in my book.\"The next major test for Sir Keir will come in May, when Labour are braced for major losses in Scottish, Welsh and English local elections.However, with the prospect of a tricky Budget next week, there has been speculation a leadership challenge could come sooner.Anyone mounting a leadership bid would need the backing of at least 80 Labour MPs.Only a small number of Labour MPs have publicly called for Sir Keir to be replaced but many more have raised concerns about his leadership privately.On Friday, Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome, who is on the left of the party, joined Labour backbencher Clive Lewis in calling for a new leader.\"Even if Keir Starmer had a radical change of direction, I don't think people would believe him. And I don't think people around him would allow that to happen,\" she said in an interview with former Labour candidate Ali Milani.\"So I think there has to be a change in leadership, a change in personnel, of the people in Number 10, and a completely different direction for the party.\"Earlier this week Rachael Maskell, who was recently readmitted to Labour's parliamentary party after a four-month suspension for leading a rebellion over proposed welfare cuts, suggested the PM should consider his position if next week's Budget does not deliver.\"Ultimately, the prime minister needs to look in the mirror and say 'Do I have the skills at this particular time in our history to lead the Labour Party?',\" the Labour MP for York Central told LBC.Challenged over her comments and whether he was the right man to lead the country, Sir Keir said he had proven his doubters wrong in the past by changing the Labour Party and winning a landslide election victory last year.\"Now people will say to me, 'It's not possible to change the country for the better.' I say it is,\" he told the BBC.\"I'm optimistic about the future of our country and I know that we can turn it around after 14 years of failure under the Conservatives.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesEvery winter, the search for the secret to staying well seems to intensify. Supermarket shelves fill with \"immune-boosting\" shots, cold water swimming groups grow and social media becomes crowded with tips on how to fend off seasonal bugs. But with so many remedies promising to keep colds and flu at bay, how much of it actually works and is it even possible to boost your immune system in the first place?Cold water swimming: A buzz, not a boostGetty ImagesCold water swimming has surged in popularity, with some enthusiasts convinced it keeps winter illnesses at bay.Immunologist professor Eleanor Riley tells BBC Radio 4's Inside Health podcast that the post-swim \"high\" is real, but it's driven by adrenaline and endorphins.\"If you take a blood sample before and after a cold swim, white blood cell levels do rise,\" she explains. \"But that's because the body thinks an infection might be coming, so cells move into the bloodstream. \"Within hours the levels go back to normal so your body hasn't created any more white blood cells.\" Professor Riley adds that part of the benefit of cold water swimming comes from building a social connection. Feeling \"brighter, more alert and more connected\" has real physiological effects.Professor John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist, says the benefits are mostly indirect and much of what makes people feel healthier in winter may come down to stress.\"It reduces stress because you're outdoors with nice people in nice places. But you could get the same from dancing, singing or going for a run.\"Being in nature can lower your blood pressure and stress hormones that can dampen immune responses. GP Dr Margaret McCartney explains that moderate exercise does show evidence of reducing viral infections, but that could be any form of exercise, not just cold water swimming. Kombucha: Interesting but little evidenceGetty ImagesMany people turn to fermented drinks like kombucha which promises to boost the microbiome and, by extension, the immune system.But Dr McCartney remains cautious. \"There are lots of theories about why a diverse microbiome is good, but we don't have strong enough real-world evidence to recommend kombucha to patients.\"Professor Tregoning adds that while it's true that the microbiome changes during infections, it usually returns to its previous state afterwards.Dr McCartney says while drinks like kombucha present \"interesting ideas about the role of the microbiome\", there isn't a clear link with how it can help boost your immune system. Supplements: Just expensive urineGetty ImagesVitamin C has long been sold as a winter essential, but according to Dr McCartney, the evidence simply isn't strong enough to recommend it when it comes to fighting off colds. She says the same goes for multi-vitamins which do very little beyond giving you \"expensive urine\". However, Vitamin D is slightly different as \"there's theoretical evidence of a small decrease in respiratory infections\". But, she explains that not everyone will see a benefit if they take it and it's only people \"with low vitamin D and pre-existing respiratory diseases\" who will likely benefit. Many people in the UK remain deficient in Vitamin D and Professor Tregoning suggests that winter sunlight and getting outdoors can help. Vaccinations: The only boost that worksGetty ImagesThe likes of turmeric shots, ginger drinks and fancy nasal sprays do nothing to boost your immune system, according to Dr McCartney.Professor Tregoning says that a nasal spray can help with a blocked nose but all you need is a simple saline spray which is just salt and water. \"The solution can dilute the blocked nose, stimulate turnover of mucus and relieve inflammation.\" All three experts agree that ultimately only one intervention can strengthen the immune system and that's vaccination.Professor Riley recommends the flu jab which takes from seven to 10 days after the jab to take effect.While you can't boost your immune system in the dramatic way winter wellness trends often promise, the experts advise supporting it by avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, finding a regular sleep routine and doing any activity that helps reduce stress. Dr McCartney says you can also reduce your risk of colds by being in well ventilated spaces and washing your hands regularly and properly.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSNSScotland fans shook the earth after Kenny McLean scored the fourth goal against DenmarkThe Tartan Army shook the earth as they celebrated Scotland's men qualifying for a first World Cup in 28 years.The British Geological Survey (BGS) recorded the equivalent to an \"extremely small earthquake\" after Kenny McLean lobbed Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to secure a 4-2 win.A second significant amount of seismic activity came moments later when the final whistle sounded on Wednesday night.Readings were recorded at the BGS station at Glasgow Geothermal Observatory in Dalmarnock – about 2km (1.2 miles) from Hampden Park.A small surge was also detected around the time Kieran Tierney curled in Scotland's third, three minutes into injury time.However, the BGS said the main peak of activity came between 21:48 and 21:50 – right as McLean scored from the halfway line.British Geological SurveyThe BGS recorded surges of seismic activity after the fourth goal and again after the final whistleAn official attendance of 49,587 was recorded at the game.The BGS said the activity registered between magnitude -1 and zero on the Richter Scale and produced the equivalent of 200kW of power, enough to power between 25 and 40 car batteries.It is also the same as blasting a football at about 900 m/s (2,013 mph).That is about 15 times faster than the fastest a ball has ever been struck, thought to be about 131.2 mph (58 m/s) by the Brazilian defender Ronny Heberson in Sporting Club de Portugal's win over Naval in 2007.SNSScotland players celebrate with Kenny McLean after the final goal of the 4-2 winTaylor Swift fans were also recorded as making the earth move during last summer's trio of concerts at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.But the BGS said it was unable to directly compare the two events due to \"different site conditions\".The BGS said about 300 naturally occurring earthquakes happen in the UK every year, but only about 30 are of significant power to be felt by people.A 3.3 magnitude earthquake was felt in homes across Perthshire last month.",

    "body": "4 days agoNardine Saadin Los AngelesUS film superstar Tom Cruise has received his first ever Oscar statuette.Cruise, 63, accepted an honorary Oscar at the annual Governors Awards in Hollywood alongside singer-philanthropist Dolly Parton, choreographer Debbie Allen and production designer Wynn Thomas.\"Making films is not what I do, it is who I am,\" the four-fold Oscar nominee said on Sunday, accompanying his long-awaited Academy Awards honour with an acceptance speech about his love of cinema.The Top Gun and Mission: Impossible actor paid tribute to film-makers in front of and behind the lens, those he has worked with during his 45-year career, as well as the power of the movies.Upon taking the stage, Cruise received a minutes-long standing ovation and raucous round of applause from film luminaries in the audience, including Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jerry Bruckheimer.Film-maker Alejandro G Iñárritu, who is directing an upcoming Cruise film, presented the actor with the Governors Award. \"The cinema, it takes me around the world,\" Cruise said in his speech. \"It helps me to appreciate and respect differences. It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. \"And no matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, we dream together. And that is the power of this art form. \"And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.\"Cruise made his film debut in 1981 and was previously nominated for best actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire. He was also nominated as best supporting actor in the film Magnolia and for producing Top Gun: Maverick.The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences selected Cruise for his \"incredible commitment to our film-making community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community\", the organisation said.The Risky Business actor told the ceremony that cinema made the world much larger than the one that he knew as a child. \"It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.\"The actor, who famously performs his own stunts, has also been a fervent advocate for cinema as the streaming industry and social media compete for viewers' time and attention.\"I want you to know that I will always do everything I can to help this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful - hopefully without too many more broken bones.\"Notably, earlier this year Cruise was reportedly set to be recognised by US President Donald Trump when he announced his picks for this year's Kennedy Center honours but the actor declined due to scheduling conflicts.",

    "body": "8 hours agoSeveral of Saturday's papers lead with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's \"agonising choice\", as the Daily Mail writes, over whether to accept a US-backed peace deal with Russia. \"Trump turns the screw\" is the Mail's headline, which reports that Ukraine has been told it has until Thursday to accept the \"humiliating peace deal\". Zelensky warns his country is facing a choice between \"losing US support or forfeiting its dignity\" over the peace deal, according to the Financial Times. European allies are caught \"off-guard\" by the plan, which was drafted by aides of the US and Russian presidents, and say it amounts to \"capitulation\" to Moscow's demands. Zelensky says he will not reject the initiative \"out of hand\", but will \"offer alternatives\" in dialogue with Washington.In an address to the country, the Ukrainian president says his country faces its \"most difficult moment in history\", the Independent leads. Elsewhere, the paper reports on a \"remarkable\" 19-wicket first day of the Ashes in Perth, in which captain Ben Stokes led a \"ferocious fightback against Australia\". Trump confirms the Thursday deadline for Ukraine to respond to the peace plan, but the White House denies reports that the US could \"cut off\" intelligence sharing if Zelensky rejects it, the Times reports. European leaders, alongside the UK, are working to \"strengthen\" the deal, \"amid concern that Ukraine would be at risk of further attacks if it weakened its armed forces\". The Daily Mirror leads on the jailing for 10-and-a half years of an \"ally\" of Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, for accepting pro-Russia bribes. Former Reform UK in Wales leader Nathan Gill, whom the paper describes as a \"former party bigwig\", took up to £40,000 from tycoon Oleg Voloshyn for \"making pro-Russian speeches\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is urging Farage to \"root out links between Reform UK and Russia\" following the conviction of Gill, the Guardian reports. The paper says the government believes Reform UK is \"vulnerable\" to criticism that Farage and his allies have been \"too pro-Russia\". Police have said there was no link to Farage in their investigation into Gill.The Conservative Party would retain just 14 seats if an election was called now, according to internal party polling leaked to the Telegraph. An insider tells the paper that the party faces an \"existential threat\" from Reform UK, which the poll forecasts would win a 46-seat majority. Another source says the Tories are at risk of being \"consigned to the history books\". Challenges facing the Labour Party are the focus for the i Weekend, which reports that the PM is \"losing control\" of his party's MPs ahead of the Budget. Some Labour MPs have become \"a bit feral\" over uncertainty about Sir Keir's leadership, according to ex-advisers to Downing Street. Backbenchers and ministers are urging more help for \"hard-up people\" amid the \"cost of living crunch\". Sarah Ferguson is \"considering offers\" for a \"tell-all TV interview\", the first since her ex-husband Andrew Mountbatten Windsor relinquished his titles over links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Sun reports. Some US networks are \"willing to pay six-figure sums to secure the chat\" with the former Duchess of York. MPs are considering whether to establish an \"injury-in-service medal\" for police officers who are forced to quit after sustaining injuries during active duty, the Daily Express reports. Finally, the Daily Star leads on a boss who has mandated his staff to take time off to see their children's Christmas events - including pantos. \"Oh, yes he did,\" the paper writes. The Times says Ukraine says Britain and other European allies are \"scrambling\" to \"strengthen\" the proposed US plan to end the war, with concern Ukraine would be at risk of further attacks if it weakened its armed forces. The paper suggests the UK's national security advisor, Jonathan Powell, could play a significant role as an intermediary between Kyiv and the White House.\"Trump turns the screws,\" is the headline in the Daily Mail, which says President Volodymyr Zelensky faces an agonising choice of accepting what the paper calls a \"humiliating\" peace deal or losing US support. It also highlights that the peace plan includes US deals with Russia for rare earth minerals. The Financial Times suggests Kyiv's European allies view the deal as a Ukrainian capitulation to Moscow's demands - and says European capitals \"reeled\" at the scale of US pressure on Ukraine to agree to it. The Daily Telegraph argues in its editorial that Europe needs to tell Trump that Ukraine has every right to reject the plan which the paper calls \"tawdry\".The i Paper says government whips are in \"disarray\" just days before the Budget, with the prime minister losing control of his MPs at a crucial time. The paper reports that multiple sources have claimed that the Chief Whip Jonathan Reynolds doesn't want his job, and that he's told MPs so - a suggestion which Reynolds himself has denied.The Daily Telegraph gives much of its front page to a poll which suggests the Conservatives would hold on to just 14 seats if an election were called now - with Reform winning a majority. The paper quotes one Tory insider as saying the party risked being \"consigned to the history books\". The poll was carried out by Stack Data Strategy during the summer. Allies of the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, say it wasn't commissioned by the party.And the Sun claims that the former Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, is looking for financial offers for a tell-all TV interview, after what the paper calls her public downfall over links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. US channels are said to be willing to offer six figure sums.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "10 hours agoGuy DelauneyBalkans correspondentSerbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, has described an allegation that he was involved in \"sniper tourism\" during the siege of Sarajevo as a \"lie\".It follows a complaint submitted to Italian prosecutors by a Croatian journalist, who claimed that video from the 1990s and subsequent testimony by Bosnian officials showed that Vucic was a \"war volunteer\" with Bosnian-Serb forces at positions overlooking Sarajevo.Speaking at a UK-Western Balkans business conference in Belgrade, Vucic said he had \"never killed anyone, wounded anyone, or done anything similar\". He added that he had \"never held a sniper rifle in my life\".Pictures purporting to show him with such a weapon actually show him carrying a \"camera tripod\", he said.He said the Croatian journalist was trying to \"present me as a monster, as an inhuman, as someone who not only has no emotions, but is a cold-blooded murderer\".More than 11,000 people died during the brutal four-year siege of Sarejevo. Yugoslavia was torn apart by war and the city was surrounded by Serb forces and subjected to constant shelling and sniper fire.Italian prosecutors opened an investigation earlier this month into allegations that wealthy foreigners had paid to shoot at civilians during the siege of Sarajevo. That followed a complaint by an Italian writer who had seen the 2022 Slovenian documentary film, Sarajevo Safari, which was the source of the allegations.Italians and others are alleged by writer Ezio Gavazzeni to have paid large sums to go on \"sniper safaris\" and shoot at civilians in the besieged city of Sarajevo during the war in the early 1990s.The claims by Croatian journalist Domagoj Margetic that Vucic had volunteered for a Bosnian Serb militia at a location above Sarajevo had earlier also been strongly denied by  Vucic's spokesperson Suzana Vasiljevic.She said in comments carried by the Times newspaper that the allegations were \"a textbook case of malicious disinformation, purpose-built to erode the institutional credibility of the Republic of Serbia and its president. This narrative is devoid of factual grounding and is operationally crafted to generate reputational damage.\"At the time Vucic had been working as a journalist and translator in nearby Pale \"without any contact with military structures or operational activities\", she said.She added: \"President Vucic did not participate in combat activities, did not use weapons, and had no role in any wartime operations.\"Similar allegations about \"human hunters\" from abroad have been made several times over the years. However, the chief prosecutor at the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals in The Hague has told the BBC that his organisation has no information about the allegations. Bosnia's war crimes prosecutor received a complaint in 2022, but has not issued any indictment. UK special forces troops who served in Sarajevo during the siege have told the BBC the allegations are an \"urban myth\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoPhilippa Roxby,Health reporter and Alison Holt,Social affairs editorGetty ImagesDetails of a new UK clinical trial to assess the risks and benefits of puberty-blocking drugs in children who question their gender have been announced.It follows the banning of the drugs for gender treatment last year after a major review raised concerns about the lack of clinical evidence over their safety for under-18s.Researchers from King's College London say the trial will involve around 220 children under the age of 16 who are going through puberty, and will examine the impact of the drugs on their physical, social and emotional wellbeing.Some clinicians and campaigners question whether the trial is ethical.Prof Emily Simonoff, study leader and professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London (KCL), said: \"We know there are ongoing societal discussions about gender transition, but this research is focused solely on informing and improving healthcare by better understanding how to support the physical and mental health of young people with gender incongruence.\"Puberty blockers, also known as puberty suppressing hormones (PSH), are drugs used to delay or prevent puberty happening.They were used to treat some young people with gender incongruence - when someone's gender identity doesn't match the sex they were registered at birth - or with gender dysphoria, when it causes significant distress.As a result of the uncertainty over the safety of the drugs, highlighted by the Cass review into gender care, led by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass, doctors can now only offer the treatment to under-18s as part of a research study.Last year, the government brought in a UK-wide indefinite ban on the drugs being prescribed privately or by the NHS to children and young people questioning their gender identity.The new clinical trial, called Pathway, will involve children who are currently accessing gender services and have a diagnosis of gender incongruence.They will all have reached puberty, but will be younger than 16 - and will have to meet strict criteria, undergo intensive medical and psychological screening before they are allowed to start taking puberty blockers.A team of specialist NHS doctors must have a full picture of the young person's wellbeing before deciding if they think they are suitable for the treatment.The young person will also have to show they have a good enough understanding of the potential impact of taking puberty blockers to give their consent, and their parent or legal guardian will need to agree. They will be provided with ongoing psychological support.To explore the impact of the drugs, the researchers plan to start one group on the treatment straight away and another group 12 months later. The children in these groups will be chosen randomly.The KCL researchers said there would be no minimum age for taking the drugs, but puberty normally starts around the age of 11 for girls and 12 for boys.The trial will look at issues such as bone density, brain development and mental health and wellbeing over time.The research team said the trial had been given ethical approval and was expected to start in January, with five to six children recruited every month. The first results should be available in around four years.Alongside this, a larger observational study involving 3,000 children will research different types of support and how effective they are.The puberty blockers trial has already proved controversial, with campaigners threatening legal action.Keira Bell, who took the Tavistock gender clinic to court in 2020 after she was given puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones as a teenager, said the trial should be halted immediately. If it is not, she says she and another campaigner will start judicial review proceedings at the High Court.She said it was \"disgusting\" that children were being put on the drugs when they had already been banned because they were \"unsafe\".In her case, the High Court ruled that under-16s were \"unlikely to be able to give informed consent\" to puberty blockers, but this was later overturned by the Court of Appeal which ruled that doctors can judge whether young people can give consent to the treatment.Some clinicians from the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender, which campaigns for rigorous science and improved treatment options for gender-questioning people, have also questioned whether the trial can be carried out ethically. A spokesperson for charity Stonewall, which campaigns for the rights of LGBTQ+ people, said all young people should have access to the very best medical care, guided by evidence.\"We urge the government and policymakers to invest in delivering excellent healthcare for trans young people and to make sure the voices of trans young people and their families are at its core.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoSteve RosenbergRussia editorEPAIt was quite a contrast.On Thursday, a US Pentagon delegation was in Kyiv. They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan to end the war in Ukraine.The same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on.\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader declared. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation.\"The Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post \"a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms\".Which brings us back to the peace plan.On Friday night, President Putin said he had seen the US settlement plan for Ukraine.Addressing a meeting of the Russian security council in Moscow, he described the American proposals as a \"modernised\" version of the plan discussed with Trump at the Alaska summit between the leaders in August.President Putin said he thought the plans could form the basis of final peace settlement.The 28-point proposal, which has been widely leaked and reported on, appeared after a visit to America by President Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev. He took part in three days of discussions in Miami with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.According to drafts of the peace proposal, Ukraine would cede to Russia parts of the Donbass still under Kyiv's control; the Ukrainian armed forces would be reduced in size and Ukraine would vow not to join Nato.\"The Russian military's effective work should convince Zelensky and his regime that it's better to strike a deal and do it now,\" President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously told journalists on a Kremlin conference call.A peace proposal does not automatically mean peace. What if there's no agreement?Pro-Kremlin commentators insist that, deal or no deal, Russia will prevail.\"Everyone thought that the idea of a peace deal had sunk in a swamp,\" wrote Russian news outlet Moskovsky Komsomolets. \"But suddenly, a rocket has shot out of this bog with a new, or rather an 'old new' peace plan, with something of the Alaska summit about it. It shot out like a jack in the box.\"How long and how far will this missile fly? Will it crash, sabotaged by Europe and Kyiv? Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"But after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.It's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.Many. But not everyone.Some elements of the peace plan haven't gone down well in Russia. Some reports suggest that Ukraine could be offered security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5. That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"The full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed. We may be entering another period of intense diplomacy.For now, though, Russia's war on Ukraine continues.",

    "body": "1 day agoVictoria GillScience correspondentgettyThe \"swarm\" of tens of thousands of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini earlier this year was triggered by molten rock pumping through an underground channel over three months, scientists have discovered.They used physics and artificial intelligence to work out exactly what caused the more than 25,000 earthquakes, which travelled about 20km (12 miles) horizontally through the Earth's crust. They used each of the tremors as virtual sensors, then used artificial intelligence to analyse patterns associated with them.One of the lead researchers, Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, said combining physics and machine learning in this way could help forecast volcanic eruptions.What happened in Santorini?The seismic activity started to stir beneath the Greek islands of Santorini, Amorgos, and Anafi in January 2025. The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt.Many tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956.The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm.The team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor.The researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors. Lead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something.\"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"Does this mean the Santorini unrest is over?For now, the researchers say, it appears to be over.\"The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,\" explained Dr Hicks. \"We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust.\"Volcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that.And these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe.\"Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,\" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, \"that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause\".",

    "body": "2 days agoHannah KarpelBBC NewsBBC\"It feels like I am constantly setting myself up for failure or disappointment,\" says AswanPerfectionism has a great reputation. It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.For many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.But what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.Even in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".It's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on the BBC Sounds podcast Complex with Kimberley Wilson, she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".That fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.Perfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".Breaking the cycleWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.Still, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.It starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.Was the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.Over the years, Dayna says she has learned to quiet her harsh inner criticFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\", it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna. \"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"At times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.Looking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"Not all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.But it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.Working through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says.",

    "body": "14 minutes agoKatie RazzallCulture and media editorShumeet Banerji is not a household name. In the three years, 10 months and 14 days that he spent on the BBC board, Banerji kept his thoughts on BBC matters firmly out of the public domain.Now he is making headlines. His resignation is the latest blow to the corporation, and it looks timed to add to the pressure.Banerji's role on the board was due to end on 31 December anyway but he has instead resigned early, three days before other board members are due to face a committee of MPs - and nearly two weeks after the BBC lost its director general and its CEO of news.The resignation, fairly or not, looks like a direct critique of the BBC's chair Samir Shah.Banerji, according to an insider, was known to be angry that Shah was - in his view - weak in not challenging a number of other board members and their assertion about systemic bias at BBC News.In this characterisation, the four political appointees to the board - Shah is the fifth - have banded together around the view that the BBC too often suffers from liberal groupthink, and the chair has been unable, or unwilling, to steer his board to a place of real consensus.In the end, after all the drama of the past few weeks - the leaked memo, the resignations, the apology over the Panorama edit and the threat of a defamation suit by Donald Trump - it boils down to one simple question. Is BBC News institutionally biased?Turness and Davie reject that. So does Shah. While acknowledging mistakes have been made, he told me \"the BBC News DNA and culture is to be impartial, to provide the best news we can and the most trustworthy news we can\".BBC News remains the most trusted source of news in the UK.But if some members of the board believe that the BBC does suffer from systemic bias, and others do not, where does this end?A senior TV executive told me Shah inherited \"a house divided but this board is melting down, it's very sad\". They added: \"It's a leadership issue.\"When I interviewed him after the resignations of Davie and Turness, Shah told me the board had \"a diversity of views, as there are in the public, as there are in the country itself… I want robust conversations, I want discussion\".But Banerji has now claimed he was not consulted over the events that led to those departures. If true, it will feed into the narrative advanced in some quarters that what has happened has been a coup by some members of the board. Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called on the government to remove Sir Robbie Gibb, an ex-BBC executive and former Downing Street director of communications to Theresa May, from the board.Shah told me the notion of a coup was \"fanciful\". He added that \"it's unfair and it's disrespectful to the members of the board to say that because they feel strongly about something, that somehow it's to do with their history\".In the last few days, prior to Banerji's resignation, I spoke to insiders at the BBC as well as people outside, who told me that Shah will remain as chair, whatever his perceived shortcomings. As one person put it to me, \"you can't have the DG, the CEO of News and the chair all resign\".Does Banerji's resignation shift the dial on his ability to continue in the role? It certainly makes Shah's appearance along with fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson in front of the Culture Media and Sport Committee on Monday even more critical.MPs on that committee voiced their reservations about whether he was qualified for the job when he was appointed as chair last year. He will need to demonstrate to those MPs, the industry, BBC audiences and staff at the corporation who will be watching, that he has the capabilities and support needed to steer the BBC through these turbulent times.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,in Washington, and Anthony Zurcher,North America correspondent, in WashingtonKey moments from Trump and Greene's public falloutMarjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will resign from office, an unexpected turn for the high-profile Republican.One of Donald Trump's Maga superstars and staunchest defenders, the Georgia congresswoman's relentless calls for releasing files related to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and recent criticism of some of his policies led to a bitter public feud.After the US president labelled her a \"traitor\", she said in a video announcing her departure: \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"Trump, who had threatened to support a Republican challenger to unseat Greene, called her resignation \"great news for the country\" in an interview with ABC News.She said in her video statement, posted on social media, that she would leave the US Congress on 5 January 2026.Greene said in the announcement that she did \"not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms\". She had been one of the loudest demanding the release of documents related to Epstein, an issue that once united Trump and his base but has since become divisive.Trump had spent months arguing that the issue was a distraction concocted by his political detractors to divert attention from his administration's achievements.\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said in her resignation letter.Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene announces resignation in video messageOver the last few months, she has gone on a number of high-profile news shows and was critical of Trump and fellow Republicans. She took issue with the president not doing enough to bring down living costs for voters and criticised his policy of introducing tariffs on imports. But above all, she criticised his administration for not releasing documents related to Epstein.Trump responded last week in a series of social media posts, calling Greene a \"traitor\" and \"wacky\". He said she should be unseated and vowed to back a challenger for her place in Congress.Days after their feud boiled over, with a growing number of Republicans calling for their release, Trump reversed course and said he would support their publication. He signed a bill this week that forces the US Justice Department to release the documents within 30 days. Greene was elected to Congress in 2020 amid a backdrop of headlines over her support and promotion of QAnon conspiracies, including claiming school shootings and the 9/11 terror attacks were staged. She has since apologised and sought to distance herself from those comments.In the video announcing her resignation, Greene ticked off a list of political achievements. She noted in her resignation letter that the comments from Trump were \"hurtful\". AFP via Getty ImagesGreene and Trump on the campaign trail in 2024While she announced her departure from the House of Representatives, US media reports have indicated Greene has shown an interest in running for state office - either as Georgia governor or for a Senate seat. The president has commented publicly about those ambitions, writing on Truth Social during their public feud that he had previously told her that she shouldn't run for either of those offices due to poor public polling. Greene has since said she did not plan to run for either of those offices. Before their public falling out, Trump and Greene had been close allies in championing the \"America First\" agenda. She joined him on the campaign trail and was one of the Republicans most vocal about Trump's false claims that he'd won the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden. Her departure will further close the gap in the Republican-led House of Representatives, who only hold a handful of seats more than Democrats. Control of the chamber will be up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections next November. ",

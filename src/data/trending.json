    "body": "4 hours agoAlex ForsythPolitical CorrespondentBBCReform UK could win more seats than any other party at the next general election - perhaps enough to form a government. Or so suggest repeated opinion polls, released since May. That was also when Reform won control of 10 English local authorities - so what does their first six months at the helm at local level show about what a UK government led by them could look like?Listen to Alex reading this articleLast month a leaked video recording showed Linden Kemkaran, Reform UK's leader in Kent, swearing at councillors from her own party and telling them to \"suck it up\" if they didn't agree with her.The footage became national news - insights into tensions within local government are, after all, rarely made public, and Kent is Reform UK's self-professed flagship council.Plenty of critics seized on the incident.Reform suspends four councillors after video leakLabour MPs in Kent labelled her \"unprofessional\" and \"not up to the job,\" and local Liberal Democrat and Green groups claimed Reform's running of the council had descended into chaos.Five of Kent's Reform councillors have been expelled from the party amid the upheaval. Kemkaran, meanwhile, remains firmly in post. And she has declared that it is \"business as usual\" at Kent County Council.To some the fallout was undoubtedly damaging and has prompted questions about whether this insurgent party, that is consistently topping national opinion polls, really is a credible force ready to run the country - something they are trying to prove.Danny Kruger, who is one of Reform's five MPs, has his own take. Last month he described the party as a bit of a pirate ship with an \"ill-disciplined\" crew and a \"buccaneering\" captain, but added: \"A powerful ship with a dangerous broadside, a terror to its rivals…\"The job… is to help turn this pirate ship into His Majesty's Royal Navy ship, ready to enter the King's service and serve our nation.\"Gareth Fuller / PAFive of Kent's Reform councillors have been expelled from the party. Linden Kemkaran (left) remains in postSo what can we glean from Reform's performance at local level about how they lead - and how well they have so far fared on delivering their promises?These are, after all, promises that are not dissimilar in nature to those they would need to keep if they were successful in their bid to reach Number 10.Reform's own version of DOGEIt has been exactly six months since the local elections saw Reform take outright control of 10 English local authorities, including six of 21 county councils.In all it won 677 seats - more than any other party, amounting to 41% of the total up for election.Before the elections, Nigel Farage addressed a packed rally in Birmingham promising his party would \"send in the auditors… get rid of the fraudulent contracts… cut spending\" if it won.Shortly after their success in the local elections, Reform launched a \"DOGE\" unit, based on billionaire Elon Musk's efforts to cut spending in the US with a Department of Government Efficiency.A photo call on the steps of Kent County Council followed, with a promise that a team of soft ware engineers, data analysts and forensic auditors would \"visit and analyse\" local authorities to identify \"wasteful spending\".But the unit has run into legal challenges in accessing sensitive council data. So far it is reported to have visited only a handful of the councils in England that Reform controls.AFP via Getty ImagesLocal elections saw Reform UK take outright control of 10 English local authoritiesZia Yusuf, Reform's head of policy who led the DOGE team until last month, acknowledges there is a limit on how much control local authorities have over their budgets, blaming \"overwhelming demands\" from Whitehall. Nonetheless he insists that hundreds of millions of pounds in savings have already been identified.\"The reality is there's a lot of information that can be shared… because it's in the public domain already,\" he says. \"[DOGE] has been working with every single one of our councils on an ongoing basis.\"He points to certain decisions by Kent County Council, including halting a planned office move and stopping net-zero schemes, as examples of the savings he says Reform has found.Carl Court /Getty ImagesZia Yusuf, a former Reform chairman, led the DOGE team until last monthCouncils spend the bulk of their budgets on statutory services that they have to provide by law, and the cost of these services has spiralled in recent years.The County Councils' Network, which represents some of England's largest local authorities, says its members spend on average 69% of their budgets on adult social care and children's services, with some spending up to 76% - an increase from 63% a decade ago.Reform's argument is that there's still \"waste\" to be found, with Yusuf saying: \"This idea that… because social care is statutory there's no point in finding those savings - we don't buy that.\"But Stuart Hoddinott, an associate director at the Institute for Government think tank, believes that the savings Reform have identified so far are \"minuscule\" in comparison to the financial challenge facing the sector.\"They've found things that are just so tiny to be completely insignificant or are cutting programmes that might actually end up saving money in the longer run. \"It has just been a complete sort of mirage so far... It's like somebody who makes £30,000 worrying about losing 2p per year.\"Budget pressures and a 'broken' systemThe pressure on council budgets across the country has been well-documented. Ahead of this year's spending review, the Local Government Association estimated councils would face a funding gap of £8.4bn by 2028/29.The controversial Kent council meeting, in which tensions boiled over, was a private discussion that seemed to focus, among other things, on both budgets and local government reorganisation.It is another illustration of how, when it comes to setting a budget, Reform is now facing many of the same challenges as parties that preceded it.Stuart Hoddinott acknowledges that Reform has entered a \"broken\" system, given the pressure on funding for statutory services and cuts already made across the board - but he accuses the party of \"bluster\" and \"outlandish promises\".\"They have focused on culture wars, things like 'Oh we'll just cut DEI (diversity equity and inclusion) programmes from local authorities and won't run a Pride flag up the pole every June, then that will solve our financial problems,'\" he argues.\"They were also very naive to think that they would be the ones to solve it [budget pressures] given that you have had 15 years of 300-odd local authorities all battling this and trying to come up with solutions.\"More from InDepthReform's DOGE unit has now had a change of personnel.Richard Tice, the party's deputy leader, has taken over, a change he says was simply a \"natural evolution\" from Yusuf.He has said billions can be saved, and that his focus will be on local government pension schemes, property and \"waste-related contracts\". The party, he adds, will also make announcements on support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, which is a cost pressure for councils.\"You'll be hearing over the next few weeks in areas where we have achieved savings, we have identified savings – and where we need to have some serious discussions about what actually is sensible in certain areas,\" he has said.But these are thorny issues that will likely prove controversial.PA MediaZia Yusuf (pictured with Nigel Farage) acknowledges there is a limit on how much control local authorities have over their budgets, blaming 'overwhelming demands' from WhitehallTony Travers, a professor in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics, argues that any benefits would likely take time to filter through.\"Reforming the pension system… might produce benefits for local government in the medium term, but it's probably not going to do it for next May, next April,\" he says.\"That's the trouble. With a lot of these things, they can't be done quickly or as quickly as Reform needs.\"He believes that Reform's cost-cutting narrative was, ultimately, \"never realistic\" - and in his view the party is now facing the \"dawning reality\" of an \"extraordinary period of financial constraint\" that other councils have faced before them.Future of council tax risesNow, as councils begin the process of setting budgets for next year, the picture looks bleak for many - including those led by Reform.Lancashire is facing a budget gap of £100m over the next two years; in West Northamptonshire the council has warned of \"tough choices\" as it tries to plug a £50m gap; while Worcestershire has asked residents for their views on a potential council tax rise of 10%, combined with millions of pounds of cuts.And Warwickshire council - led by George Finch, who was just 19 years old when he took office this summer - warned of \"difficult decisions to come\".Getty ImagesGeorge Finch was just 19 years old when he took office this summerEven though the government has increased the amount of funding available to councils this year and is introducing a new method of allocating funding from next year, claiming it is \"fixing a broken system\", this all still poses a challenge for Reform UK, if it is to fully meet its promises to cut costs and save money.Early indications are that Reform-led councils will raise council tax from April 2026 – something acknowledged by both Richard Tice and Zia Yusuf - though both say the focus is on keeping increases low.\"We never said we would cut council tax,\" Tice says. \"But if you can identify the savings, identify what you shouldn't be doing… then we can achieve lower increases than anybody else.\"Yusuf suggested the rises were unlikely to exceed inflation levels.\"I would expect certainly [in] most of our councils [for] council tax not to go up by more - it is their decision, but it will be a rise in line with inflation, as opposed to the council going into bankruptcy or a rise much more than 5%,\" he says.Getty ImagesReform has pointed the finger at Labour and the Conservatives for what they say are broken promises(His comments came before Reform-led Worcestershire signalled the possibility of a 10% rise.)But keeping council tax relatively low sometimes entails spending cuts – which might not prove popular.And the question now is whether Reform really can prove to be better custodians of public money than their predecessors – and avoid the effective bankruptcy that has hit some other local authorities, while providing value for money.Scaling up the challengeAt the start of the year, Reform UK, Labour and the Conservatives were all averaging about 25% in opinion polls registering voting intention. But in May that all changed: for more than five months Reform's average poll result has hovered around 30%, while the two other parties have now fallen below 20%.Prof Travers believes the party would likely encounter challenges similar to those it is currently facing in councils were it to win the keys to Number 10. It has previously promised tax cuts, and an overhaul of government spending to increase efficiency, echoing its programme for local government.Already there are signs they are realising what is realistic, and what is not. Earlier this week Farage rowed back on his party's previous promise to deliver tax cuts worth £90bn a year. \"Substantial tax cuts\" are not currently \"realistic\" because of the \"dire state\" of the public finances, he said, proposing instead \"relatively modest\" changes, such as raising tax thresholds and scrapping inheritance tax for family-run businesses.\"The truth is, the constraints of real government would be just as real if they got in at Westminster,\" Prof Travers says.\"Could you really cut benefits for millions of people? It's not that easy… So all of this is the kind of local version of the fact that even political parties who attempt to cut or reduce NHS spending, find themselves increasing it. It's just a local version of that.\"Ben Ramanauskas, a senior research fellow in economics at the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange, argues that Reform's instinct to look to cut back waste is right – despite the challenges. \"Definitely, any party should be looking for efficiency savings,\" he says. \"This is taxpayers' money being spent and the priority has to be essential public services. There are examples of where there is some waste going on.\"But it is a very tough job for local authorities and councillors,\" he adds. \"And I think any party in that position would possibly struggle, given just how our system operates.\"He argues it will be easier to \"scale up\" savings at a national level, with the ability to pull all the levers of power.Reform’s main risksLooking ahead to the next general election, it would be logical to assume that the fate of Reform - and whether or not it will win enough support to make the leap to Downing Street - rests in part on how it fares at the helm of the councils with these gnarly financial challenges.After all, Reform has pointed the finger at Labour and the Conservatives for what they say are broken promises - so what are the consequences if they cannot deliver on their own pledges in local government?Luke Tryl, director of focus group and polling company More in Common, argues that this link is not necessarily as direct as it may seem.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesDissatisfaction with the economy, NHS and immigration is driving support for Reform\"If you look at the reasons people went and voted for Reform in the local elections, they were number one – overwhelmingly - migration, and Channel crossings in particular. And number two, general disillusionment with the main parties.\"I'm just not sure that Reform's failure to find savings necessarily helps with that.\"Instead, he believes that one of the main risks for Reform that could cost it supporters would be a significant failing in one of the councils – such as a crisis in social care, or bins, or bankruptcy.\"I don't say that the message of 'Reform has put your council tax up' is going to be deterring people in the general election,\" he added.Getty ImagesReform UK could be the biggest party in the next parliamentAs to whether Reform is ready, based on the evidence so far from their leadership of England's councils, in the six months since May, the jury is out.\"It's very difficult to say exactly that Reform councillors are more or less chaotic than other councillors,\" says Stuart Hoddinott.\"They get more attention. So these stories tend to blow a bit more. Having said that, there does seem to have been a lot of incidents since the election.\"Meanwhile, the party's performance in councils has arguably faced even more scrutiny than their political opponents.And while the party says it is making progress on its promises, it is clear it is grappling with the same set of challenges as the parties that came before.So far, it seems the solutions are not proving easy to find for anyone.Top image credits: Gareth Fuller/ PA - Jacob King/ PA and Bloomberg/Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "4 hours agoDr XandMorning Live doctorGetty ImagesPopcorn in moderation can be a more nutritious choice than crisps as it is a fibrous wholegrainScroll through social media or glance at the supermarket shelves and you'll see endless products claiming to improve your gut health.It seems everyone's talking about looking after their microbiome - the trillions of tiny organisms living in our digestive system – which influence everything from digestion and immunity to mood and sleep.Gut health is all about having the right mix of bacteria and enough fibre-rich food to keep everything moving and your body feeling its best.The key to keeping the microbes happy is feeding them the right food and it's easier than you think to maintain a healthy gut.Instead of reaching for pricey probiotic shots or snacks, I recommend making these five easy food swaps to give your gut a boost.Swap crisps for popcorn. Popcorn is a wholegrain so it's packed with fibre that feeds the good bacteria in your gut and it's also lighter and far less processed than a bag of crisps.Swap sweets for dried fruit. This can be a hard swap to make if you love sweets but dried apricots, raisins or dates can still hit that sweet spot whilst also delivering fibre, vitamins and natural sugars that your gut and your energy levels will thank you for.Add lentils or chickpeas to your bolognese. Pulses are full of prebiotic fibre which acts as food for your gut microbes and they can help bulk out your meal, making it go further while adding texture and extra plant-based protein so it's a great way to eat less meat without feeling like you're missing outSwap flavoured nuts for plain ones. Flavoured nuts are often loaded with salt and sugar while plain nuts give you healthy fats and fibre without the additives your gut could do without.Swap ice cream for frozen berries and kefir. Ice cream might make your taste buds happy, but frozen berries with kefir (a tangy fermented milk drink) give you natural sweetness, antioxidants and live cultures that can help your microbiome flourish.Of course there are many other foods you can consume to improve your gut health like drinking kombucha or eating fermented food such as kimchi or sauerkraut, but it's not necessary to focus on that too much.The most important thing for your gut and overall health is eating a range of whole foods that are rich in fibre like fruits and vegetables.And when it comes to supplements and probiotics, my advice is the same - there's no evidence it will do you any good and products like probiotic drinks and powders promising miraculous results can cost you hundreds of pounds which I see as a waste of money.Additional reporting by Yasmin Rufo",

    "body": "The body of a hostage returned by Hamas via the Red Cross in Gaza has been identified as Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen, Israel has confirmed. The 19-year-old soldier's remains were returned on Tuesday as part of a Gaza ceasefire deal brokered by US President Donald Trump last month.\"Following the completion of the identification process... IDF representatives informed the family of the fallen hostage, Staff Sergeant Itay Chen, that their loved one has been returned to Israel and positively identified,\" the Israeli prime minister's office said.Earlier, Hamas's military wing said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in the eastern Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.Israel had allowed members of the group and Red Cross staff to search for the remains in the area, which is inside territory still controlled by Israeli forces.Chen was working at his base on the Gaza border when Hamas and its allies launched their attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023.His family lost communication with him after he told them his base was under attack.Chen was initially believed to have been taken hostage by jihadists was actually killed in the 7 October attacks, the Israeli military said in March 2024. It said he had died in combat and his body had been taken to Gaza.The Israeli government has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of the dead hostages since a US-brokered ceasefire deal took effect on 10 October.Hamas has insisted it is difficult to locate the bodies under rubble.Under the ceasefire deal, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was still holding within 72 hours.All the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 270 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Five of the seven dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Earlier on Tuesday, a hospital official in Gaza City said a man was killed by Israeli fire in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza.The Israeli military said its troops killed a \"terrorist\" who had crossed the \"Yellow Line\", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory, and posed a threat to them.",

    "body": "Watch: Virginians \"chose pragmatism over partisanship\", says Spanberger after winDemocrat Abigail Spanberger has been projected as winning the race for Virginia governor after a closely-watched election which her party hoped could signal a national trend. The former congresswoman and CIA officer defeated the state's Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears.Virginia's leadership usually swings between Democrats and Republicans, meaning the outcome might serve as a bellwether for the electorate's mood going into next year's midterm elections.Democrats also picked up a win in a governor's race in New Jersey and another in New York City which elected its first Muslim mayor, Zohran Mamdani.She will take over after four years under Republican Glenn Youngkin.Virginia is bordered by the liberal-leaning Washington DC to the north, where many residents work in the nation's capital or for the federal government. But the state also has large pockets of conservative voters throughout its rural districts, and swing voters.Spanberger had highlighted the economic impact of Trump's cuts to the federal government, which have impacted Virginia's employment, and ran on a platform of increasing affordability. Fellow Democrat Ghazala Hashmi was also projected to win Virginia's lieutenant governor's race against Republican John Reid. The governor and lieutenant governor do not run on a joint ticket in the state. Hashmi's victory made her the first Muslim woman elected statewide office in the US. The Democratic National Committee hailed Spanberger's victory as \"a resounding rejection of the self-serving and corrupt Trump establishment\".\"It's time for Republicans to cherish their short time in power - because Democrats are going to keep winning, and we have a vision for this country that's a lot bigger than building a ballroom,\" said DNC chair Ken Martin.Republican Earle-Sears touted Virginia's economy under conservative leadership and leaned into cultural topics like transgender issues, which Republicans used successfully as a wedge issue in last year's presidential election.Trump had not formally endorsed Earle-Sears, although he encouraged Virginia voters to back all the Republican candidates up for election.

    "body": "Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a New Jersey lawmaker serving in the US House of representatives, is projected to win the governor's race in the Garden State.In one of several races that are seen as both a referendum on US President Donald Trump and a bellwether for the 2026 midterm elections, Sherill will succeed fellow Democrat Gov Phil Murphy.The US Naval Academy graduate, helicopter pilot and former federal prosecutor first entered politics in 2018 as anti-Trump sentiment washed over the US during his first term.The congresswoman edged out Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state legislator. Her victory comes after fellow liberal Abigail Spanberger won the governor's race in Virginia. At a victory rally, Sherrill said her election victory would bring a \"new day\" for the state. \"I know these are tough times. I know not everyone voted for me - but I'm working for everyone,\" she said. She told supporters she would follow the country's founding principles and noted this election sent a message to US President Donald Trump. \"We're going to follow Lady Liberty's beacon. We're not going to give in to our darker impulses,\" she said. \"Here in New Jersey, we know that this nation has not ever been, nor will it ever be ruled by kings. We take oaths to a Constitution, not a king.\" The race to lead the state was neck and neck between Ciattarelli, who was endorsed by President Donald Trump, and Sherill in the weeks leading up to the 4 November general election in a reliably blue state that is also considered a bellwether for next year's midterm elections, where Democrats hope to tilt control of Congress in their favour.Both focused on cost of living, with Ciattarelli, a businessman and former Republican state representative, proposing lowering personal and corporate tax rates and using a new school funding formula to lower taxes across the state. Sherrill campaigned on proposed tax incentives for new housing developments and a freeze on utility rate hikes.State governors are key figures in the US with enormous power that control many aspects of American life, including things ranging from education to abortion rights. Governors have a say on issues decided at the state level.In New Jersey, governors are limited to two consecutive terms. But they are not limited in non-consecutive terms. The third US state, and one of the original 13 US colonies, New Jersey last had a Republican governor in 1988.As polling stations opened on Tuesday, the BBC's US partner CBS reported that some polling locations received bomb threats that caused temporary closures and police response.Sherrill called the threats \"a clear attempt to undermine our democratic system and intimidate New Jerseyans from going to the polls to exercise their right to vote\".Her opponent Ciattarelli told CBS that \"there's no place in politics for nonsense like this\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoGetty ImagesChildren will be taught how to budget and how mortgages work as the government seeks to modernise the national curriculum in England's schools.They will also be taught how to spot fake news and disinformation, including AI-generated content, following the first review of what is taught in schools in over a decade.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the government wanted to \"revitalise\" the curriculum but keep a \"firm foundation\" in basics like English, maths and reading.Head teachers said the review's recommendations were \"sensible\" but would require \"sufficient funding and teachers\".The government commissioned a review of the national curriculum and assessments in England last year, in the hope of developing a \"cutting edge\" curriculum that would narrow attainment gaps between the most disadvantaged students and their classmates.It said it would take up most of the review's recommendations, including scrapping the English Baccalaureate (EBacc), a progress measure for schools introduced in 2010.It assesses schools based on how many pupils take English, maths, sciences, geography or history and a language - and how well they do.The Department for Education (DfE) said the EBacc was \"constraining\", and that removing it alongside reforms to another school ranking system, Progress 8, would \"encourage students to study a greater breadth of GCSE subjects\", like arts.The former Conservative schools minister, Nick Gibb, said the decision to scrap the EBacc would \"lead to a precipitous decline in the study of foreign languages\", which he said would become increasingly centred on private schools and \"children of middle class parents who can afford tutors\".Other reforms coming as a result of the curriculum review include:Financial literacy being taught in maths classes, or compulsory citizenship lessons in primary schoolsMore focus on spotting misinformation and disinformation - including exploring a new post-16 qualification in data science and AICutting time spent on GCSE exams by up to three hours for each student on averageEnsuring all children can take three science GCSEsMore content on climate changeBetter representation of diversityThe review also recommended giving oracy the same status in the curriculum as reading and writing, which the charity Voice 21 said was a \"vital step forward\" for teaching children valuable speaking, listening, and communication skills.However, the government is not taking up all of the review's recommendations.It is pushing ahead with the reading tests for Year 8 pupils reported in September, whereas the review recommended compulsory English and maths tests for that year group.Asked why she stopped short of taking up the review's recommendation, Phillipson told the BBC that pupils who are unable to read \"fluently and confidently\" often struggle in other subjects.And she addressed the claims that scrapping the EBacc could lead to fewer pupils taking history, geography and languages at GCSE, saying the measure \"hasn't led to improved outcomes\" or \"improvement in language study\".\"I want young people to have a good range of options, including subjects like art and music and sport. And I know that's what parents want as well,\" she said.She said ministers recognised \"the need to implement this carefully, thoroughly and with good notice\", adding that schools would have four terms of notice before being expected to teach the new curriculum.Prof Becky Francis, who chaired the review, said her panel of experts and the government had both identified a \"problem\" pupils experience during the first years of secondary school.\"When young people progress from primary into secondary school, typically this is a time when their learning can start falling behind, and that's particularly the case for kids from socially disadvantaged backgrounds,\" she told the BBC.Professor Becky Francis led the curriculum and assessment reviewShe said the approach to the review was \"evolution not revolution\", with England's pupils already performing relatively well against international averages. She said the call for more representation of diversity in the curriculum was not about \"getting rid of core foundational texts and things that are really central to our culture\", but was more about \"recognising where, both as a nation but also globally, there's been diverse contribution to science and cultural progress\".Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott said the changes \"leave children with a weaker understanding of our national story and hide standards slipping in schools\".\"Education vandalism will be the lasting legacy of the prime minister and Bridget Phillipson,\" she added.Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the review had proposed \"a sensible, evidence-based set of reforms\".But he said delivering a \"great curriculum\" also required \"sufficient funding and teachers\", adding that schools and colleges did not currently have all the resources they need.He said a set of \"enrichment benchmarks\" - which the government said would offer pupils access to civic engagement, arts and culture, nature and adventure, sport, and life skills - had been announced \"randomly\" and \"added to the many expectations over which schools are judged\".Additional reporting by Hope Rhodes",

    "body": "2 hours agoSeveral papers lead on the aftermath of a speech by the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, in which she did not rule out a U-turn on Labour's manifesto general election pledge not to hike income tax. Despite the chancellor saying she will make \"necessary choices\" in the Budget, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch says Britain watched the speech \"in horror\" and that Reeves is \"blaming every else\" for chaos, according to the Daily Express.A hike in income tax would be the first since 1975, and break a \"50-year taboo\" against the policy, the i Paper reports. Economists cited by the paper say Reeves must add 2p on income tax if she wants to make the UK's public finances \"more resilient, and avoid having to return for more\" in the near future.\"We will all have to do our bit\" is the chancellor's quote featured in the Times. The paper reports more lines from Reeves' speech where she vowed to put \"national interests\" before \"political expediency\". Elsewhere, a photo of Sir David Beckham receiving his knighthood at Windsor Castle is front and centre.\"Reeves's waffle bomb\" is the Daily Mail's take. The paper also reports that Labour has been accused of \"educational vandalism\" after ministers announced they would scrap a number of Tory reforms on education. The changes will include cutting GCSE exams and simplify primary school tests. \"Labour dumbs down schools\" is the headline.\"Make it fair, Rachel\" is the Daily Mirror's headline as it leads with a plea from trade unions to the chancellor, calling on her to tax the wealthiest before targeting ordinary workers. Sharing the top spot, \"bend a knee like Beckham\" is the paper's take on Sir David Beckham's knighthood.The Daily Star's headline is \"Rach sparks tax rise fury\", as it reports on the chancellor's \"first pre-Budget speech for 50 years - hinting at huge tax rises\".\"Reeves puts Britain on notice,\" says the Independent. The paper reports that a think tank has warned that a 2p income tax rise might not be enough to fix the country's finances. A smiling Sir David Beckham holding his knighthood medal also fills the front page as the paper declares: \"Arise Sir Becks!\"\"Finally... Sir Goldenbawls\" follows the Sun, as it reports that Sir David Beckham admitted he was \"crying for months\" after learning of his long-awaited knighthood. \"It's been been a very emotional day,\" he said after the ceremony at Windsor. The Guardian's front page spotlight's Sir David calling his knighthood \"my proudest moment\". Also prominent, the paper reports on Health Secretary Wes Streeting's warning that NHS staff are bearing the brunt of \"ugly\" racism. In an interview with the paper, Streeting says incidents of verbal and physical abuse based on people's skin colour are happening so often that it has become \"socially acceptable to be racist\".The Telegraph says that pressure is mounting on the BBC's senior executives after a leaked dossier revealed \"serious and systemic\" editorial bias. The paper says Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for \"heads to roll\" over the allegations. A BBC spokesperson said: \"While we don't comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.\"Finally, the Metro celebrates the story of the LNER rail staff worker who has been praised as a \"hero\" for saving passengers' lives during the Cambridgeshire train attack. The paper quotes Samir Zitouni's family who say: \"He's always been a hero.\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "4 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorThe 'godmother' of AI, Professor Fei-Fei Li has told the BBC that being the only woman amongst seven pioneers of artificial Intelligence being presented with a top engineering prize by the King today makes her \"proud to be different\".The King will present the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering to Prof Li and six others during a ceremony at St James's Palace.  Those honoured alongside her are Prof Yoshua Bengio, Dr Bill Dally, Dr Geoffrey Hinton, Prof John Hopfield, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang and Meta's Chief AI Scientist Dr Yann LeCun.They are being recognised for their contributions to the development of modern machine learning, a field that underpins the rapid advancement of AI.Dr Hinton, Prof Bengio and Yann LeCun, currently Chief AI Scientist at Meta have widely been recognised as the \"Godfathers of AI\" since they were jointly awarded the 2018 Turing Award.  There is however only one so-called \"godmother\" of AI and Prof Li told the BBC she has grown to accept the moniker.\"I would not call myself godmother of anything,\" she said.  She said a few years ago when people started calling her that, she had to \"pause and recognise if I rejected this, it would miss an opportunity for women scientists and technologists to be recognised this way\".\"Because men are pretty easily called godfathers or founding fathers.\"\"For all the young women I work with and the generations of girls to come, I'm okay now accepting this title,\" she added.Born in China, Prof Li emigrated to the US as a teenager and went on to excel in computer science. She is co-director at Stanford Computer Science Department, and co-founder and CEO of World Labs.It is her work on ImageNet a project which enabled major advances in computer vision for which she is recognised. She and her students created large-scale image recognition datasets upon which a lot of artificial intelligence technology is now built. It paved the way for computer vision – working out how computers could 'see'.She says the importance of that data set \"open the floodgate of data-driven AI\".She thinks the next AI milestone will come when it is able to interact with the world around it.This ability was is \"innately important and native to animals and humans\", and if this could be unlocked in AI, it could \"superpower\" humans in many ways, \"including creativity, robotic learning, design and architecture\".This will be the first time all seven laureates have come together in person. The three \"godfathers\" have publicly stated opposing views on how dangerous AI could be. Dr Hinton has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the potential for AI to pose an \"extinction-level threat\".  But Prof LeCun, who also works at Meta has written that apocalyptic warnings are overblown.Prof Li says she takes a more \"pragmatic approach\" and says the disagreement amongst scientists is \"healthy\".\"We're used to even disagreement, and I think that's healthy. A topic as profound and impactful as AI requires a lot of healthy debate and public discourse.\"I think in the case of AI, both extreme rhetorics concern me…I have always advocated for a much more science based, pragmatic method in communicating and educating the public.\"So, yes, I would like to see our communication of AI to be much more moderated and grounded in facts and science instead of the extreme rhetorics\".The Queen Elizabeth prize is awarded annually to engineers responsible for groundbreaking innovations which globally benefit humanity. Previous recipients include Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.Lord Vallance, chair of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, said the winners \"represent the very best of engineering,\" adding that their work \"demonstrates how engineering can both sustain our planet and transform the way we live and learn.\"Additional reporting by Philippa Wain",

    "body": "25 minutes agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondentZohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York City, is notable in many ways. He will become the city's youngest mayor since 1892, its first Muslim mayor and its first mayor born in Africa.He entered the race last year with next to no name recognition, little money and no institutional party support.That alone makes his victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Silwa remarkable. But more than that, he represents the kind of politician that many in the Democratic Party's left have been seeking for years.He is young and charismatic, with his generation's natural comfort with social media. His ethnicity reflects the diversity of the party's base. He hasn't shied away from a political fight and has proudly espoused left-wing causes - such as free childcare, expanded public transportation and government intervention in free market systems. Mamdani has also shown a laser-like ability to focus on the kind of core economic issues that have been a priority for working-class voters who have drifted from the Democratic Party recently, but he hasn't disavowed the left's cultural principles.But critics have warned that such a candidate is unelectable in broad swathes of America - and Republicans have gleefully held the self-avowed democratic socialist up as the far-left face of the Democratic Party. Still, on Tuesday night in New York City, he was a winner.Follow live updatesDemocrat Spanberger wins race for Virginia governorBy running against and defeating Cuomo, a former New York governor who is himself the son of a governor, he has vanquished the entrenched Democratic establishment viewed by many on the left as woefully out of touch with their party and their nation.Because of this, Mamdani's campaign for mayor has generated voluminous media attention, perhaps more than a municipal election, even one for America's largest city, deserves.It also means that, as mayor, his successes - and failures - will be closely scrutinised.Twelve years ago, Democrat Bill de Blasio won his race for mayor on a platform of addressing New York City's economic and social inequalities. Like Mamdani, Americans on the left had high hopes that his administration would provide a national example of effective liberal governance. De Blasio, however, departed office eight years later widely unpopular and with a mixed record of achievements as he struggled with the limits of his mayoral power to implement new policies.Mamdani will have to grapple with those same limits - and those same expectations.Mamdani: From rank outsider to New York mayorTrump says it would be 'hard' to fund New York if Mamdani winsWho is Zohran Mamdani?New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat, has already said she opposed raising the kind of taxes necessary to fund Mamdami's ambitious agenda. And even with sufficient funding, Mamdani would not be able to implement programmes unilaterally.He campaigned as a sharp critic of the corporate and business elite that call New York City their home, and have made Manhattan the financial capital of the world. To effectively govern, he will probably have to make some form of peace with those interests, however - a process he has already begun in recent weeks.He has also condemned Israel's conduct during the Gaza war and pledged to arrest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a war criminal if he sets foot in New York City, a promise that could be tested at some point during his term.All those are problems for a later date, however. For now, Mamdani will need to set about the task of defining himself on the public stage - before his opponents do. While his campaign has generated national attention, he is still a blank slate for much of America.A recent CBS poll indicated that 46% of the American public were following the New York mayoral election \"not closely at all\". That provides both an opportunity and a challenge for Mamdani and the American left. Conservatives from President Donald Trump down will be trying to paint the newly elected mayor as a socialist menace, whose policies and priorities will bring ruin to America's largest city and present a danger if embraced by the nation as a whole. They will amplify every stumble and highlight every negative economic indicator or crime statistic.Watch: 'Hard' to send money to New York City if Mamdani wins mayoral race, Trump saysTrump, who has a personal connection to New York, is sure to welcome a political tussle with Mamdani and he has a wealth of ways to complicate life for the new mayor.Mamdani will also be pressed to win over Democratic leaders, like New York senator and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who never backed his campaign.The opportunity for Mamdani, however, is that he is not burdened by his past, which his political opponents unsuccessfully tried to wield against him during the campaign. When he is inaugurated in January, he will have the chance to build his political reputation from scratch. And if Trump does feud with him, he will only give Mamdani a larger platform on which to work.His political talent and abilities have gotten him this far, which is no small feat. But that is nothing compared to the tests that await him in the years ahead.New Yorkers like to think their city is the centre of the universe, but its mayoral race was not the only electoral contest taking place on Tuesday. In fact, it in all likelihood wasn't even Tuesday's best indication of the current electoral mood.Both New Jersey and Virginia - states Democrat Kamala Harris narrowly carried against Trump last year - held governor elections. And in both cases, the Democrats won by more comfortable margins. The New Jersey contest was closer and the final results suggest the inroads Trump made in the state last year among working class and minority voters did not hold up without the president's name on the ballot.Unlike Mamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger ran establishment-backed centrist campaigns with more modest policy prescriptions. All three, however, focused on affordability and cost-of-living issues. Exit polls showed the economy, once again, was the topic voters cared about most.With Democrats on the left and centre winning on Tuesday, it may prove difficult for those looking to glean some insight on the kind of policies and candidates Democrats should advance to ensure future electoral success.Last week, however, Mamdani insisted there was plenty of room in the party for all kinds of viewpoints.\"I think this has to be a party that actually allows Americans to see themselves in it and not just be a mirror image of just a few people who are engaged in politics,\" he said. \"To me, what binds all of us together is who we are fighting to serve, and that is working people.\"That view will be put the test next year, as Democrats across the nation head to the polls to select their candidates for the congressional midterm elections. Tensions are sure to mount and traditional fault lines could re-emerge.For one night, however, the Democrats are one big, happy party.",

    "body": "4 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe report said that a 22-year-old who falls out of work for health reasons could lose out on £1m over the course of their lifetime.The number of sick and disabled people out of work is putting the UK is at risk of an \"economic inactivity crisis\" that threatens the country's prosperity, according to a new report.There were 800,000 more people out of work now than in 2019 due to health conditions, costing employers £85bn a year, according to the review by former John Lewis boss Sir Charlie Mayfield.The problem could worsen without intervention, but Sir Charlie, who will lead a taskforce aimed at helping people return to work, said this was \"not inevitable\".The move has been broadly welcomed, but some business groups said Labour's Employment Rights Bill included some disincentives to hiring people with existing illnesses.One in five working age people were out of work, and not seeking work, according to the report, which was commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions by produced independently. Without intervention, another 600,000 people could leave work due to health reasons by the end of the decade.Sir Charlie said sickness cost employers £85bn a year through issues including lost productivity and sick pay, but it also cost the broader economy.\"For employers, sickness and staff turnover bring disruption, cost and lost experience,\" he said. \"For the country, it means weaker growth, higher welfare spending and greater pressure on the NHS\".Speaking to the BBC, he said that \"on the whole, work and health are mutually reinforcing\". \"So keeping people in work, keeping them active, actually helps them to stay healthier.\"The state spends £212bn per year on illness-related inactivity, or nearly 70% of income tax, through lost output, increased welfare payments and additional burdens on the NHS.People could be encouraged to stay in work if health is viewed as \"a shared responsibility between employers, employees and health services\", he said.'I want to find a job'Loz Sandom has mental and physical health conditions which has made it difficult to find a job, and the last time they worked was a year ago. \"I am willing to do the work, and I want to. I want to find a job,\" said the 28-year-old, who has a degree in illustration and has previously worked as a digital marketing executive.  They said that part of the challenge was employers did not realised they had \"a duty to provide reasonable adjustments.\"\"It's such a shame because they're missing out on so many fantastic disabled people that can do fabulous jobs.\"And I'm not blaming employers entirely. They need support as well,\" Loz added. \"There are things that can be put in place to help employers, help save people.\"Responding to the report, the government announced a major partnership with over 60 companies, many of them large employers, to \"tackle the rising tide of ill-health that is pushing people out of work\".The companies include Tesco, Google UK, Nando's and John Lewis.Over the next three years, they will \"develop and refine workplace health approaches\" which aim to \"reduce sickness absence, improve return-to-work rates, and increase disability employment rate\".The government is aiming to develop these changes into a voluntary certified standard by 2029.Speaking to the BBC, Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the report was a \"win-win for employees and employers because its' aimed at keeping people with sickness issues or developing disability issues in work\". \"That's in the interests of employers because these are good experienced staff and it's in the interests of employees too because most people want to stay in work if they possibly can.\"\rThe Resolution Foundation think tank's chief executive Ruth Curtice said: \"The review has accurately identified a culture of fear, a dearth of support and structural barriers to work as key challenges to overcome in turning the tide for Britain's economic inactivity problem – which is currently trending in the wrong direction.\"The CIPD, which represents HR professionals, welcomed the government's vision for a preventative approach to illness in the workplace.But its chief executive Peter Cheese said: \"The report's success will depend on the extent to which these recommendations are understood by business in driving positive outcomes and backed by policy makers at a national and regional level.\"The report comes as the government tries to move ahead with its Employment Rights Bill – which some businesses say will stifle growth.The proposed new law includes a right to guaranteed hours and cracks down on zero-hour contracts without the offer of work.As well as that bill, Chancellor Rachel Reeves is aiming to guarantee paid work to young people who have been out of a job for 18 months.Those who do not to take up the offer could face being stripped of their benefits.",

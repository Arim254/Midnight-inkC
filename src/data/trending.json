From the Epstein Files to the cost of living, Greene has been vocal in her criticism of the current administration.  It’s notable because MTG has been one of Trump’s most loyal allies and a powerful leader of the MAGA movement, and also because her interventions have been influential. \nSarah, Anthony and Marianna look back at Marjorie Taylor Greene’s rise and why she has been such an influential figure within Donald Trump’s MAGA base. \nAnd, Anthony’s in Tennessee for a special election where a House seat is being contested. We assess the Democratic party’s chances of winning this traditional Republican seat.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

    "body": "7 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsAn Australian man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed Hollywood star Ariana Grande has been deported and banned from Singapore.Johnson Wen, 26, was sentenced to nine days in prison for being a public nuisance and has now been \"barred from re-entering Singapore\", the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) told local media. Wen pushed past photographers and charged at the actress and singer, who was attending the Asian premier for Wicked: For Good on 13 November. Co-star Cynthia Erivo wrestled him away from Grande. Wen has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year.The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, with many accusing him of re-traumatising Grande. The pop star has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her concert in Manchester in May 2017 killed 22 people and injured hundreds.During Wen's trial, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the film's premiere twice, according to Singaporean media.He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and pinned him down.Wen later posted videos thanking Grande for letting him on the carpet and said he was \"free\". Police arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance, to which Wen pleaded guilty. The District Judge Christopher Goh was quoted by Channel News Asia as saying that Wen was \"attention seeking\", adding that he was wrong to think he would not suffer any consequences. Grande has not commented on the case. Erivo spoke about the incident to NBC, saying that she \"just wanted to make sure my friend was safe\".\"I'm sure he didn't mean us harm, but you never know with those things, and I wanted to make sure that she was OK. That was my first instinct,\" she said. ",

    "body": "7 minutes agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , BeirutIsrael has carried out an air strike on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, for the first time in months, targeting a senior member of the militant group Hezbollah, despite a ceasefire.The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the target was Hezbollah's chief of staff. Israeli media reports identified him as Ali Tabtai, describing him as the group's number two.Lebanon's health ministry said at least five people had been killed and 28 others wounded in the strike, which hit an apartment building in the densely populated Dahieh district. It was not immediately clear if the person killed was Tabtai.Hezbollah confirmed the strike targeted a senior commander but didn't disclose their identity.The attack happens as Israel has escalated its campaign on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group supported by Iran - despite a ceasefire brokered by the US and France that came into effect last November.Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been trying to rebuild its military capabilities, is smuggling weapons into Lebanon and stepping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles, and there are growing fears of an escalation of hostilities.Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel - which continues to occupy at least five locations in southern Lebanon - to stop the attacks and withdraw from the country, saying the Israeli actions are a violation of the agreement that put an end to 13 months of conflict.The Lebanese government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but the group has rejected calls to discuss the future of its weapons before Israel stops its attacks, fully withdraws from Lebanon, and releases Lebanese prisoners. A Western diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the authorities are under pressure from the Trump administration, which is growing impatient with what they see as the slow progress against the group, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and UK.The latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted after the Lebanese group started firing rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.The US government imposed sanctions on Tabtai in 2016 and designated him a terrorist. It has a $5m (£3.8m) award on offer for information about him.",

    "body": "The granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy has announced her diagnosis with an aggressive form of cancer.Tatiana Schlossberg said she has been given less than a year to live.The 35-year-old shared the news in an essay published in The New Yorker on Saturday - the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather's assassination.The mother-of-two climate journalist has been an outspoken opponent of her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr's position as US health secretary under President Donald Trump. In her essay, Schlossberg describes her alarm at watching her cousin be approved to the post as she was battling her illness. Schlossberg is the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy. She is the granddaughter of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. According to Schlossberg's essay titled A Battle With My Blood, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia after giving birth in May 2024.She described her previously healthy lifestyle, which included running, skiing and even once swimming in New York's Hudson River, \"eerily, to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society\".Despite treatment, including a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, she said doctors have told her the outcome does not look good. \"During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,\" she writes. \"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me.\" Schlossberg's son was born in 2022 and her daughter in 2024.Schlossberg, whose uncle John F Kennedy Jr died in a plane crash at age 38 and whose grandmother Jacqueline died of cancer when Schlossberg was a toddler, also describes the pain she fears her death will cause her mother, who previously served as US ambassador to Australia and Japan. \"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" she writes. \"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\" She also described her upset at watching her cousin, known as RFK Jr - whose father Robert F Kennedy was also assassinated while running for president - become Trump's health secretary.\"I watched from my hospital bed as Bobby, in the face of logic and common sense, was confirmed for the position, despite never having worked in medicine, public health, or the government,\" she writes. \"Suddenly, the healthcare system on which I relied felt strained, shaky.\"Earlier this month, her brother Jack Schlossberg announced that he is planning to run for Congress in New York. He shared her essay online on Saturday, with the caption: \"Life is short - let it rip.\"The Kennedy family's generations-spanning participation in US politics - along with the personal tragedy which has often touched its members - has garnered it a prominent reputation in American life.",

    "body": "Image source, BBC Weather Watchers/Ambulance ManByStav DanaosLead Weather PresenterFreezing temperatures? Tick. Snow? Tick. Nights drawing in? Tick. Must be winter right? Well not so hasty. As far as the meteorological calendar is concerned, we are still counting down the final days of autumn, notable this year for its vibrant autumn colours and changeable, whiplash-like weather patterns. We've had records for the warmest November overnight minimums to the coldest November nights for 15 years.So, if after the Arctic blast we've just experienced this is still autumn, when will we see the official start of winter?Defining the start of winterThere are two common ways to define the start of our seasons in the UK-  meteorological and astronomical.BBC Weather follows the meteorological calendar, where winter always begins on 1 December and ends on the last day of February. Meteorologists use fixed three month periods for each season, which makes year-on-year comparisons between them easier. Astronomical winter starts on the 21 December, known as the winter solstice and is the shortest day of the year. The season then runs until the vernal or spring equinox which in 2026 is Friday 20 March. Image source, BBC Weather Watcher / One Man MarvelImage caption, The recent chilly snap created this perfect snowy scene in North YorkshireWhat makes winter winter?We define winter as the three coldest months - December, January and February - and when we look at a list of record low temperatures from across the UK we can see why. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK is –27.2C (–17.0F), reached on three separate occasions in Scotland:Braemar, Aberdeenshire, on 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982Altnaharra, Sutherland, on 30 December 1995Other national record lows include:England: –26.1C (–15.0F) in Newport, Shropshire, on 10 January 1982Wales: –23.3C (–9.9F) in Rhayader, Powys, on 21 January 1940Northern Ireland: –18.7C (–1.7F) in Castlederg, County Tyrone, on 24 December 2010But the UK does not often experience prolonged very cold weather, and some winters are so mild that it feels as if we skipped the season all together.In February 2019 England and Wales saw an exceptional spell of warmth, with temperatures rising above 20C on more than one occasion. What impact is climate change having on winter?Image source, BBC Weather Watcher / HanaImage caption, Mild and sunny winter scene in Stornoway in the Western IslesUK winters are becoming warmer and wetter due to human-driven climate change. Long term data shows rising average temperatures and fewer cold weather extremes.With global temperatures continuing to rise UK winters are now about 1C warmer than a century ago. The decade 2015–2024 has been 1.24C warmer than the 1961–1990 average. Indeed, six of the ten warmest UK winters on record have occurred since 2000.Globally 2023 was the warmest year on record where most days in December broke temperature records.Air and ground frosts have fallen by around 25% since the 1980s, and snow days are becoming increasingly rare across the UK.A warming world means we are more likely to see winter precipitation fall as rain rather than snow, external.However, even in a warming climate the UK can still experience spells of extreme cold. In 2018 the infamous Beast from the East brought severe wintry conditions to many parts of Europe leading to significant disruption, and its impact lingered well into meteorological spring.",

    "body": "A Ukrainian refugee has become the first person from his country to win an elite-level sumo tournament.Danylo Yavhusishyn - known by his sumo ring name Aonishiki - arrived in Japan as an 18-year-old in 2022 after the Russian invasion of his country.Now aged 21, he is the first Ukrainian to claim the prized Emperor's Cup and the first European in almost eight years to do so.He is now on the verge of being promoted to the second-highest rank of Ozeki, in what would be the fastest promotion in history.Aonishiki finished the 15-day tournament in Fukuoka, Japan, with a record of 12 wins and three losses and went on to win the championship play-off against Yokozuna grand champion Hoshoryu, a 26-year-old Mongolian who won last month's London tournament.In his winning ceremony interview, Aonishiki was asked if he felt satisfied with his results after three years in sumo.\"No, I think this is just the beginning,\" he replied.The name Aonishiki contains the Japanese character for \"blue\" - a reference to the Ukrainian flag.Aonishiki is only the second Ukrainian in the top division in sumo. He first tried sumo aged seven, after also practicing judo and freestyle wrestling.He impressed in youth amateur sumo competitions, and fled to Germany with his family after Russia's invasion.He moved to Japan by himself in April 2022, without knowing the language, with the help of a university sumo club captain he met previously at a youth championship event.Despite only being in professional sumo for a short time, he has gained fans in Japan and worldwide with his impressive skills, constant improvement and competitiveness.He often defeats opponents with seldom-used techniques, receiving praise from both professionals and sumo enthusiasts.Aonishiki, who was one of the most cheered wrestlers at last month's Grand Sumo Tournament at the Royal Albert Hall in London, is tipped by many to become the first-ever European to reach sumo's highest rank of Yokozuna grand champion.",

    "body": "13 minutes agoRichard Kagoe,Nairobi, Kenya and Wedaeli ChibelushiFifty of the 315 children kidnapped by gunmen from a Catholic school in Nigeria's Niger State on Friday have escaped. The Christian Association of Nigeria says they have been reunited with their families.A major military-led search and rescue operation is under way for the remaining 265 children and 12 teachers who were taken with them.Calling for the release of the abductees, Pope Leo XIV expressed \"immense sadness\" and urged the authorities to act swiftly.Authorities in several Nigerian states ordered schools to shut following the mass abduction in Niger and another smaller hostage-taking in Kebbi state on Monday when 20 pupils were kidnapped from a boarding school.  Orders were given for many schools to close in the states of Kebbi, Niger, Katsina, Yobe and Kwara.News of the children's escape brought welcome relief for families and for a country that has been agonising over the fate of hundreds of schoolchildren abducted in Nigeria's northwest. According to a Christian group involved in the case, the pupils managed to escape between Friday and Saturday in what is being described as a brave and risky attempt to flee their captors.The students and teachers were taken from St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state. earlier reports spoke of 303 students and 12 teachers being taken. Their number surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014.Local police say armed men stormed St Mary's at around 02:00 (01:00 GMT), abducting students staying there.Niger state governor Mohammed Umaru Bongo announced on Saturday that all schools in the area would close, warning that was \"not a time for blame game\".Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... It took everybody by surprise.\"One distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13, had been kidnapped, adding: \"I just want them to come home.\"The military, police and local vigilantes are conducting a search for the children, combing nearby forests and remote routes believed to have been used by the gunmen.Authorities in Niger state said St Mary's School had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks. The school has not commented on that allegation.The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs, but it has had little effect.On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kebbi state.Authorities there have now ordered all secondary schools and colleges to close.A church was also attacked further south in Kwara state, with two people killed and 38 others abducted.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu postponed foreign trips - including to this weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address the security concerns.This week's attacks follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria.For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians. The Nigerian government has dismissed this claim.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".In the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority-Muslim north of the country.In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.The militant Islamist group Boko Haram took 276 girls from their school in the town of Chibok in 2014.The incident drew international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.Many have since either escaped or been freed, but as many as 100 remain missing.",

    "body": "16 hours agoOlga Prosvirova & Zlata OnufrievaBBC News RussianAishat Baimuradova/Getty/BBCAishat told her friends she had been raised in a strictly religious familyWhen 23-year-old Aishat Baimuradova fled her home earlier this year, she believed she finally had a chance to live the way she wanted.Coming from Chechnya, a conservative Muslim republic in Russia, she cut her hair short, stopped covering her head, shaved off part of her eyebrow and posted quirky selfies on Instagram.She told her new friends she could finally breathe.In October, Aishat was found dead in a rented flat in neighbouring Armenia. Police say she was murdered.Two people were seen leaving the building where she was found, including a woman Aishat had befriended not long before her death. Both reportedly left for Russia soon afterwards.Russians do not need a passport to enter Armenia; their internal ID is enough. That also makes it an easy route for anyone trying to flee.Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus, is often described by rights groups as a state within a state - a place where power is highly personalised and loyalty to long-standing leader Ramzan Kadyrov often over-rides laws and formal institutions.For years, human rights organisations have documented enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings in the republic, as well as systematic persecution of those who dissent.Chechen officials have consistently denied these allegations, complaining of fabrications aimed at discrediting the region.Aishat Baimuradova/InstagramHer friends say Aishat was a very open person seeking connection with peopleSeveral high-profile critics of Chechen authorities have been killed abroad.In 2009, Umar Israilov, a former bodyguard of Ramzan Kadyrov, was shot dead in Vienna, where he had sought asylum. Austrian authorities called the assassination politically motivated and linked the killers to Chechnya.Former Chechen rebel Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot dead in a Berlin park in 2019, in an attack blamed on Russian security services.But Aishat Baimuradova is the first known Chechen woman to have died in suspicious circumstances, not long after fleeing Russia.Like many other women who escape the region, she had complained of being controlled by her family. She said she was forced into a marriage, monitored, and barred from leaving home or using her phone. The BBC was not able to reach her family for a comment.Aishat arrived in Armenia with the help of SK-SOS, a crisis group that helps people facing danger in the North Caucasus. She had complained openly of conservative gender rules and the suffocating control women face in Chechnya.At first, she worked in a small town, then moved to the capital, Yerevan, hoping for a better job and more opportunities.To many who flee, such visibility is unthinkable. Most use false names, avoid showing their faces, and refuse to meet new people. Aishat chose a different path. \"She really wanted a normal life,\" her friend who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC. \"And she wanted to trust people.\"ReutersRamzan Kadyrov has ruled Chechnya since 2007. Critics accuse him of turning the Russian republic into a state within a stateHer family tried to persuade her to come back, but when nothing came of it they disowned her, according to SK SOS.\"They said to her: 'You are no longer our daughter or our wife. We won't touch you - just don't touch us,\" Alexandra Miroshnikova, spokesperson for SK SOS, told the BBC.Her uncle told local media the family had no involvement in her death.On the night of her death, Aishat was with a woman she had recently met online, who claimed to come from Dagestan, another Russian republic in the North Caucasus.People who knew Aishat told the BBC it was the woman who had first made contact with her on social media, later coming to Armenia and inviting her to parties.A man captured with her on CCTV as they left the building where Aishat's body was found was reported by a popular Russian Telegram channel to be of Chechen origin. Investigative outlet Agentstvo identified him as a relative of a businessman close to Ramzan Kadyrov.Chechen authorities deny any connection to Baimuradova's death, condemning such suggestions as a \"terrorist information attack\". Officials have also criticised groups assisting women who flee, accusing them of \"destroying family traditions\".VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty ImagesChechen women who have sought refuge in Europe often avoid communicating with the diasporaArmenian authorities say they are investigating two unnamed people in connection with Aishat Baimuradova's murder, but they have released no further details about them.Ramzan Kadyrov is sensitive to people criticising Chechnya from abroad, says Michael Dennis, an expert on Chechen politics at the University of Texas.\"The very existence of a diaspora is a clear signal to the entire world that something is wrong in Chechnya. It's a matter of personal pride and political image,\" Mr Dennis told the BBC.Since the early 2000s, asylum seekers from Chechnya have been coming to Europe - fleeing first the war and later Kadyrov's repressive rule.But changes to EU migration policy, followed by visa restrictions for Russians because of the war in Ukraine, have all but closed that route.That leaves the South Caucasus, where Russians can travel visa-free, as the easiest escape route, but far from the safest.In July, another escapee, 24-year-old Laura Avtorkhanova, was found in a shelter in Georgia by a group of male relatives who reportedly tried to coerce her into returning to Russia. After being questioned by police she was able to stay safely in Georgia.For other Chechen women who have fled, Aishat's death has reinvigorated a fear that has haunted them since they left Russia.Several have told the BBC how even before her murder they had steered clear of community events, avoided speaking Chechen in public and restricted their social media presence. Now they worry it may not be enough to hide from those who may want to punish them.\"The fear I've lived with all my life - embedded in my DNA - has reawakened with renewed vigour,\" said one escapee living in Western Europe, who asked to hide her name and precise location.\"It's like sleep paralysis: a monster appears, and I lie there frozen, staring into its eyes. It's the fear of being killed.\"\"You can escape,\" she said, \"but you never really feel free.\"",

    "body": "13 hours agoBen ChuPolicy and analysis correspondent, BBC VerifyGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming Budget is expected to justify tax increases as a vital measure to keep the UK's national debt under control.Some have argued keeping the national debt down protects the financial interests of younger people. That's because if the country's debt went up drastically, it is younger people who would have to foot the bill to pay for the interest on it. And it would be taken directly from their payslips through higher taxes.Generation Z, or those born between 1997 and 2012, have been hit in the pocket over the past 15 years by benefit cuts and dramatic increases in university tuition fees. Meanwhile, the homeownership rate of those born since the 1990s is well below that of earlier generations, due to the relative difficulty they have faced in getting on the housing ladder.However, most politicians, including the chancellor, are also committing to keep paying for the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees it rises each year by the highest of average wages, inflation or 2.5%.There's growing concern that current tax and spending policies help pensioners but are unfair on younger generations, and that the triple lock in particular will push up public spending and the national debt in the long term.So will this budget really help younger generations? Or could it help saddle them with higher taxes and more debt?BBC Verify has been looking at the numbers.Why is the national debt a concern?The UK's national debt currently stands at just under 100% of UK GDP, which is the value of all the goods and services produced by the economy in a year.The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned it could rise above 250% over the next 50 years unless taxes are raised or public spending is reduced.Some economists doubt such a steep and sustained debt surge would actually materialise, arguing it would likely trigger a bond market crisis long before then and see UK government borrowing costs pushed to extreme levels by private investors, which would instead force a change in tax policy or spending.Yet the OBR says the purpose of its long-term projection is to highlight that the UK's public finances are currently on what it calls an \"unsustainable\" trajectory.The biggest driver of rising long-term spending, and therefore the increase in the national debt according to the OBR, is our ageing population, which means the government needs to spend more money on the NHS, social care and the state pension each year.The number of people over 65 is projected to rise from 13 million to 22 million over the next five decades. That would push up the old age dependency ratio - the proportion of older people over the age of 65 relative to people aged 16 to 64 - from around 30% today to almost 50% by 2070.Today the state pension age is 66, but for people born after 1990 it's likely to be pushed higher to keep people working longer and reduce the old-age dependancy ratio.Even so, the national debt would still likely increase significantly from today's level because of these old age spending pressures.Do younger people lose out on public spending decisions?Since 2010, government policy on benefits has tended to help older generations and to take money away from younger generations.Over the past 15 years, the over 65s have received on average an extra £900 a year, while those under 65 have lost an average of £1,400 a year, according to calculations by the Resolution Foundation think tank.The driving force behind this has been the value of the state pension increasing faster than average wages since 2010 because of the triple lock, alongside government cuts to working-age benefits, including housing benefits, unemployment benefits and universal credit.The OBR projects that the triple lock will continue to push up state pension spending further in the coming decades.If the state pension were only tied to increases in average wages then its share of GDP would only rise from 5% today to 6% in 2070, according to the OBR. But instead it projects the cost of the triple lock will push government spending on the state pension to nearly 8% over the next 45 years.That might only be two extra percentage points, but it equates to around £60bn in today's money, and it would be younger working age people who would have to pay for it through their taxes.Which generations will benefit and lose from the Budget?The impact on different age groups will depend on which taxes increase and which benefits are protected.For instance, if high value homes were to face extra taxes, it would affect older people more as they tend to have greater property wealth.If you look at earnings, pensioners still have to pay income tax but are no longer subject to employee National Insurance.And younger people are deemed to have been hit harder by the increase in employer National Insurance contributions Rachel Reeves introduced in her first budget in October 2024, which appears to have slowed down job hiring rates.All taxpayers have a shared interest in seeing the debt burden brought under control as a share of the size of the economy. Though one of the reasons the government borrows is to pay for investment in infrastructure such as roads and housing. Some economists warn that if ministers reduced that kind of spending and borrowing out of concern over the national debt it could prove counterproductive and ultimately damaging to younger people.As for the triple lock, younger people could benefit from its continuation when they eventually retire themselves - and polling shows that 18-49 year olds are broadly in favour of keeping the policy.Nevertheless, in the context of the past 15 years, many economists argue younger people also have an interest in seeing a rebalancing of the treatment of older and younger generations through the tax and benefit system.",

    "body": "3 days agoLori CarnochanSouth Scotland reporterBBCDavid Finlay has been pioneering the cow-with calf dairying systemAt most, traditional dairy farms calves are separated from their mothers within 24 hours of their birth. It allows farmers to collect the milk that the calves would naturally drink and sell it to be made into dairy products.But one farmer in the south of Scotland is pioneering an unconventional method of commercial dairy farming - keeping cow and calf together for about six months. David Finlay, who farms 130 dairy cows near Gatehouse of Fleet, claims the system results in higher animal welfare standards and a more profitable business. Now he is calling for the Scottish government to fund a radical new cow-with-calf development programme.  However, some farmers believe Mr Finlay's system is not viable for many in the industry. David Finlay runs a herd of 130 cows at Rainton Mr Finlay and his late wife Wilma decided to explore the cow-with-calf dairy system at Rainton Farm in 2012. Mrs Finlay, who did not come from a dairy farming background, could not understand why the mothers and newborns were separated.The unconventional new method had only been trialled on small-scale farms in places like the Netherlands. Mr Finlay said: \"Basically, it's leaving the calves with their own mothers instead of for less than a few hours, it's now leaving them for five to six months. \"And we're trying to see if we can harness the natural health and productivity of a system where it is more natural for the cows and calves.\"Cows and their calves are kept together for about five to six months at RaintonThe Finlays implemented the cow-with-calf system with their herd, but the decision almost bankrupted the business when they did not have enough milk left to sell to market.After overhauling their business plan and adopting a new approach, the couple found a way of making the system financially viable. David claims that among the benefits are happier cows and staff, healthier animals and an increase in life-expectancy.\"What we've found is we can carry 25% more cows on the farm, because the young stock are growing and maturing so much faster and the cows are yielding 25% more milk,\" he said.\"So even with the calves drinking a third of their mother's milk, the system is actually more efficient, more productive and more profitable.\"The calves do not take all their mother's milk, so cows can still provide milk for market while they are with their young. Rainton Farm is now the largest commercial cow-with-calf dairy farm in Europe.Scotland's agriculture minister Jim Fairlie says the government is committed to supporting high animal welfareMr Finlay is asking the Scottish government for a multi-million pound funding commitment, to match the EU's research on system economics, environmental and animal welfare impacts.Agriculture Minister Jim Fairlie said the government is committed to high animal welfare standards and has previously committed to trialling cow-with-calf research projects.\"I will always encourage those in the sector to look for innovative approaches to farming that push Scotland to be a global leader in sustainable and regenerative agriculture,\" he said.\"For this reason the adoption and use of sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices is one of the key objectives of the Agriculture and Rural Communities (Scotland) Act 2024 and it is great to see progressive businesses taking the initiative and adopting these practices already.\"David McMiken from Ernespie farm does not believe the system is suitable for most dairy farmsDairy farming is big business in south-west Scotland, with Dumfries and Galloway home to almost half of Scotland's dairy herds.However, the Finlays have their fair share of sceptics and critics. David McMiken, a third generation dairy farmer who runs 300 cows on his farm at Ernespie near Castle Douglas, said he would welcome more investment into the dairy industry as a whole but the cow-with-calf system was unlikely to be widely adopted.\"Ultimately this system is a more expensive way to produce milk,\" he said. \"It comes with increased labour costs, increased feed costs, and unfortunately that's not viable in a lot of farms. \"Using a conventional set-up, we also have independent disease control between the mothers and calves. \"Scotland has some of the highest welfare regulations in the world and we're very proud of the sector that we've built.\"Mr McMiken said it could be argued that separating cows and their calves after five to six months could be even more stressful for the animals, as they have had time to developed a maternal bond. SRUC is part of a European research programme looking at cow-with-calf systemsMr Finlay was recently awarded an Honorary Fellowship by Scotland's Rural College (SRUC), for his commitment to innovation, sustainability and education. The college is part of an EU's Transform Dairy Net project, which is bringing together 26 partners and 11 farmer-led innovation hubs to study cow-with-calf systems.Dr Holly Ferguson, a precision dairying scientist with SRUC, said: \"People are beginning to question more whether it's a system they could run and are getting a bit more interested in the challenges and the pitfalls.\"People like David pioneering this system and helping farmers understand what works and what doesn't are really useful and it's what we need - more people to create that blueprint that would let people take up cow-with-calf systems in the UK.\"Finlay familyWilma Finlay was an integral part of the pioneering projectThe Finlay's journey from traditional dairy farming to pioneers of this radical new system has been captured on film and made into the award-winning documentary A Dairy Story by Dumfries filmmaker Ian Findlay. The film has been made more poignant as Mrs Finlay died with cancer in March 2025. Mr Finlay said he struggles with the fact that his wife is not around to see the success of the documentary, or the continued success of the system she helped to develop.He said: \"It's tragic. It's such a shame. But the fact that we have a viable system that works as a business and we have found a way to farm that is better for our animals and our staff is testament to Wilma.\"",

    "body": "Rupert Grint: 'I'll never step out of Ron Weasley's shadow'15 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesRupert Grint has told the BBC he’s unlikely to ever \"step out\" of Ron Weasley's shadow, some 14 years after the release of the final Harry Potter film.\"I'm fine with that. I think it's great,\" he said. \"I love meeting people who really felt this was part of their childhood.\"Grint, 37, who played Ron in all eight of the franchise's movies, also revealed he has written a letter to the child actor playing Ron in the upcoming TV series.\"It's quite strange to have the cycle happening again,\" he said. \"I'm really intrigued what it's going to be like.\"Grint was speaking to BBC News at an event to switch on the Christmas lights in Highgate, north London, on Wednesday.The actor, who lives locally with his partner, actress Georgia Groome, and their two daughters, drew a crowd of fans to the Highgate Literary and Scientific Institution and Highgate Society.Getty ImagesEmma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint were the main stars throughout the film franchiseAs children, Grint and his co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson had their lives transformed by their wizarding roles in the big-screen adaptation of JK Rowling's books between 2001 and 2011.Grint was 11 when he was cast as Ron - who is characterised as one of Harry Potter's best friends at Hogwarts - and now describes the experience as being \"crazy\".\"It changed my whole life quite quickly,\" he said. \"I was a huge fan of the books, so for me it was like stepping into the books, and that was very special.\"Would Rupert Grint step back into the Harry Potter universe?Grint has switched on the Christmas lights in Highgate in the past as well.The festive free event was arranged by volunteers from the local community and funded by local businesses, schools and residents.Since the Potter films ended, Grint has had roles in films including Into the White, and in Apple TV series Servant. He's also appeared on stage, and in a number of Ed Sheeran's music videos.He told us he has \"a couple of things\" coming up next year, though he is not able to talk about them yet.But compared with Radcliffe and Watson, Grint has found it relatively hard to break out of his Potter role.Is he fed up of always being linked to a part he played decades ago? \"No, absolutely not, I love it,\" he said.\"It has a quite deep meaning to a lot of people of my generation, and even more to generations who are finding it now. It's great. It gives me a lot of pride. It was such a huge thing.\"I don't think I'll ever quite step out of his shadow, but I'm fine with that.\"Getty ImagesDaniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint on the set of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2006The three child actors who will play Harry, Ron and Hermione in the new HBO series were announced in May.Earlier this week, Radcliffe revealed he had sent a letter to Dominic McLaughlin, who is taking over the role of Harry.McLaughlin, 11, is also starring in a new iPlayer drama, Gifted, which starts on Monday on CBBC and iPlayer.Grint told us he has also written a letter to Alastair Stout, who will play Ron.\"I wrote him a letter, before they started, passing the baton as it were,\" he said.HBOArabella Stanton, Dominic McLaughlin and Alastair Stout were announced in May as the stars of the upcoming Harry Potter TV series\"It was really just wishing him all the best with it. I had so much fun stepping into this world, and I hope he has the same experience,\" he said.Grint said that when the new actors were announced, it took him \"straight back\" to when he, Radcliffe and Watson were cast. \"I still remember every second of it,\" he said.He sees \"a bit of family resemblance\" between himself and Stout.\"I think it's great that it's a whole new thing. It's going to be its own thing, and I think that will be fun,\" he added.He wouldn't discourage his children if they wanted to take on roles in the TV adaptation in the future, though.\"I don't see why not. It was so much fun,\" he said.Grint added the films were \"still a little bit too scary\" for his five-year-old daughter, named Wednesday, but she has watched some clips. \"And she loves it,\" he added.Getty ImagesRupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson with author JK Rowling at the world film premiere of Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone in 2001While Grint has largely been less prolific since the heyday of the Harry Potter films, in 2020, he was one of several stars of the Potter franchise who distanced themselves from Rowling when the author spoke out against trans activism, which Rowling said had eroded the concept of biological sex.As a row grew, the writer was accused of being transphobic, which she denied, saying she was worried about the effect on women in single-sex spaces.In September, Watson said she still loves Rowling and refused to \"cancel her out\" despite their differences on the subject. But her remarks were met with a stinging response from Rowling, who dismissed her as \"ignorant\".Grint, for his part, declined to comment on the row when we asked him about it on Wednesday.Could the future spell a return to wizardry for Grint? When asked whether he would follow in the footsteps of co-star Tom Felton - who recently returned as Draco Malfoy on Broadway - he said: \"Maybe in the future. Never say never.\"Getty ImagesTom Felton, who also starred in the Harry Potter films, has recently taken on a new Broadway role\"But for now, I think as much as I loved it, I'm enjoying stepping outside of that world,\" he added - even as Ron's shadow looms large.And if that wizardry could offer him the benefit of hindsight, which Hogwarts house would he be sorted into? \"I think I'm probably more Hufflepuff than Gryffindor,\" he admits.\"I like the vibe of Hufflepuff, I think. But Gryffindor is a close second.\"",

    "body": "In Ukraine's 'kill-zone', robots are a lifeline to troops trapped on perilous eastern front9 hours agoAbdujalil AbdurasulovIn eastern UkraineA robot being sent on a mission by Ukraine's fifth brigade to deliver supplies to troops on the frontline\"The toy is delivered,\" a Ukrainian soldier whispers into the radio.In the dead of night, he and his partner move quickly to roll out their cargo from a van. Speed is crucial as they are within the range of deadly Russian drones.The fifth brigade's new \"toy\" is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), a robot that provides a lifeline for Ukrainian troops at the front in Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine.Russian forces are relentlessly trying to cut off Ukraine's supply routes in the area.Without fresh food and ammunition, Ukraine's frontline soldiers would face a choice of either surrender or a costly retreat.Kyiv has sent special forces, elite assault units and drone groups to reinforce its troops in and around Pokrovsk, but Russia's grip on routes into the city means going in with armoured vehicles would bring almost certain death.Transporting heavy supplies on foot would be just as dangerous.This is where the robot, also known as a land drone, comes in place of traditional troop deployments.The battle of Pokrovsk will probably go down in history as the first in which unmanned ground vehicles were used on a mass scale, largely to deliver supplies and evacuate wounded.The robot is small enough to squeeze into a bicycle lane and looks like a mini tank without a turret.UGVs are difficult to spot, they are harder to jam than an aerial drone and, most importantly, soldiers can operate them remotely from a safer location.They save soldiers' lives and are the future of the army, according to Ihor, the head of unmanned systems for the 7th Corps of the Ukrainian army.About 90% of all supplies for Pokrovsk frontline are now delivered by UGVs, he says.Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to capture the city by choking the supply chains and relentlessly launching remote-controlled drones to target anything that moves in what is widely called \"the kill-zone\".This 30km-wide stretch of territory along the frontline is within reach of drones from both sides.Constant aerial reconnaissance means any movement in the kill-zone is quickly detected and attacked, by drones as well as conventional weapons such as artillery, mortar rounds and aerial bombs.It's a situation that military doctor Vitsik and his land drone operator Auditor know only too well. These are their call signs, not their real names.When they tried to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers from Pokrovsk last month they were quickly spotted and had only seconds to rush to a nearby house to escape the buzz of Russian drones.\"One drone after another attacked us,\" Vitsik recalls. \"As soon as the drone hit the ground and exploded, immediately the next one appeared. They also fired from artillery and mortars trying to kill us.\"The walls Vitsik and Auditor hid behind shook with each explosion. The barrage lasted for 59 minutes and they eventually slipped into a neighbouring building and escaped.Inside Pokrovsk the drone threat from above is ever present.\"We run from one bush to another, from one house to another, from one street to another,\" says Vitsik.Vitsik via BBCCombat medic 'Vitsik' was caught up in an almost hour long drone attack in the \"kill-zone\" when attempting to evacuate the woundedThanks to those \"first-person view\" drones, Russian troops are close to cutting off all routes leading to Pokrovsk.They claim to have surrounded the entire area, but Kyiv has repeatedly denied that.The head of Ukraine's HUR intelligence agency, Kyrylo Budanov, has told local media the situation in Pokrovsk is \"extremely difficult\" but Ukraine is \"still holding on there\".And yet moving troops into and around the city is extremely dangerous and Ukrainian forces have tried to limit rotating people in and out due to the high risks.As a result, soldiers remain in frontline positions for weeks, sometimes even months.It has made delivering supplies an even more pressing task, and that means the demand for unmanned ground vehicles is growing.A single unit of the 5th brigade can carry out several logistical missions with UGVs in one day.Each assignment starts in an old, shabby garage and the mission I watch is delivering water, ammunition and fuel to drone pilots.Vitsikkk via BBCPokrovsk is largely deserted but as a key road and rail junction, it is essential for Ukraine to keep the city from Russian controlSupplies are loaded on a land drone called Termit, capable of carrying about 200kg. The operator drives it by remote control into the back of a van which takes it closer to the frontline to preserve its battery.When it is dark, two soldiers jump out of the van and roll out the UGV.One of them informs the control room via radio that the land drone has been offloaded. Within seconds the operator several kilometres away confirms he is connected to the machine and Termit heads off to its destination.Machines like Termit have been used by some Ukrainian brigades since last year but they have become increasingly popular in recent months.At a workshop for the 79th brigade, engineers who previously made only aerial remote-controlled drones are now tasked with upgrading unmanned ground vehicles for use in combat zones.They apply camouflage, weld new platforms and add hardware for extra communication. But even with these improvements, UGVs are still vulnerable to drone attacks.Engineers are increasingly tasked to make the land drones combat zone ready adding camouflage and extra communication links \"No matter how well it is concealed, no matter what connection you use and how quickly it moves\", the machine can still be detected and destroyed, says a UGV operator with the call sign \"Lawyer\".During one mission to evacuate a wounded soldier from Pokrovsk, his unmanned vehicle hit a landmine damaging its tracks.Another land drone was sent on a rescue mission from a different unit, but it was destroyed too. Lawyer still does not know if the wounded soldier made it out alive.On average just one out of three UGVs manages to reach the city, says Ihor, from the unmanned systems department of the 7th Corps. While the majority of the small robots won't make it, the troops on the frontline are reliant on those that do.",

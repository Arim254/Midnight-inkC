    "body": "5 days agoMegan BonarBBC ScotlandPA MediaThe US talk show host was invited to dinner by members of the Royal Regiment of ScotlandA kilt might not be the first thing on your list when you're a TV superstar packing for an autumnal holiday in Scotland.But that's exactly what American comedian and talk show host Jimmy Fallon was left scrambling for when he was unexpectedly invited to a black-tie dinner while on a trip to Aberdeenshire.Luckily, his hotel's night manager was on hand to give him a loan of his own kilt.The comedian was welcomed to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater by officers from the 5Scots regiment who served him Scotch eggs and Buckfast.Fallon rose to fame as a cast member on the comedy sketch series Saturday Night Live before becoming the host of a late-night talk show.PA MediaJimmy dined on Scotch eggs and Buckfast tonic wineSpeaking about his trip, in a video shared on TikTok, Fallon said he travelled to Scotland to take a trip on the Royal Scotsman when he had a chance encounter with some soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland.The comedian was visiting the River Dee near Balmoral Castle when some members of the King's royal guards, the 5Scots battalion, recognised him and invited him to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater for dinner.The invitation, along with its black-tie dress code, left him with a dilemma - where to get a suit or a kilt, at such short notice.He approached staff at the Fife Arms where he was staying who went the extra mile to help their guest.Fallon said: \"I called the night manager and I talked to him. I said 'I need to get a kilt tonight' and he goes 'I'll figure something out', so Muir gave me his own kilt.\"The manager pieced together a full ensemble of kilt, jacket, sporran, hose and brogues.Scotch egg and BuckfastThe SNL actor said his hosts were \"psyched\" he wore a kilt and he \"had the best dinner ever\".He dined on venison Scotch egg washed down with Buckfast tonic wine, which Fallon said had left him feeling a bit worse for wear.He left the evening with his very own kilt, fitted by the battalion's tailor and a Glengarry hat he proudly wore during the video.Major Thomas Blair, commanding officer of 5Scots, said: \"What started as a chance meeting near Balmoral turned into a brilliant evening.\"It's not every day you get to meet a Hollywood A-lister, and we were delighted to welcome him to Scotland - in true Scots style.\"Within 5Scots, Balaklava company has a number of ceremonial roles in Scotland and forms the royal guard at Balmoral.The infantry company welcomed the King to Balmoral when he arrived for his summer residence earlier this year.",

    "body": "41 minutes agoHarry LowLondonEPAThe Met says it has solved three child sexual exploitation cases in the last 12 monthsNine thousand cases of child sexual exploitation are being reviewed by the Metropolitan Police, the force has confirmed.In a statement, the Met said it was reinvestigating the cases which involve \"intra-familial, peer-on-peer and in institutional settings, along with those which do not fit the common understanding of a 'grooming gang'\".The cases are being re-examined following a national review into group-based child sexual exploitation which found it was more widespread, organised, and underreported than previously acknowledged.The force said it took all \"allegations or concerns about child sexual exploitation and child criminal exploitation incredibly seriously\".Baroness Casey's report, the National Audit on Group-based Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, also found a \"mismatch\" in the way the way the Metropolitan Police and local authorities record child abuse.Published in June, it found the ethnicity of people involved had been \"shied away from\" by authorities.On Saturday, Scotland Yard said group-based offending was \"particularly insidious and devastating in its profound impact on the children affected\".In a statement, the force added: \"Since 2022, there have been significant improvements to how the Met identifies and investigates group-based offending, including training for 11,000 frontline officers and the expansion of our child exploitation teams. \"In the last year we have solved three times more cases of child sexual exploitation – representing 134 more suspects charged.\"Our commitment to safeguarding all victims of such terrible offences and bringing those responsible to justice is absolute.\"'Woefully let down'The cases the force is now reviewing cover a 15-year period, which the Met said was the same time period covered by Baroness Casey's report.A spokesperson for Sir Sadiq Khan said the information had been published because \"the mayor demanded full transparency and has consistently asked the Met to leave no stone unturned when investigating these appalling crimes\".The spokesperson added: \"Any individuals or gangs exploiting children for sex are utterly abhorrent. \"Sadiq is quite clear that they must face the full force of the law. \"These children have not only suffered terrible abuse at the hands of the perpetrators but have been woefully let down by the authorities meant to protect them from harm.\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said he would like to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his upcoming trip to Asia.\"I would. If you want to put out the word, I'm open to it,\" the US president told reporters onboard Air Force One as he departed for the region, adding that he \"had a great relationship\" with Kim. Trump made history during his first term, becoming the first sitting US president to set foot into North Korea when they last shook hands in 2019.His trip to Malaysia and Japan will see him meet a number of world leaders including China's Xi Jinping, amid trade negotiations sparked by Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs earlier this year.Trump has taken an atypical approach to North Korea - a secretive communist totalitarian state largely isolated on the world stage - and its attempts at creating nuclear weapons, initially taunting Kim as a \"little rocket man\".The pair met face-to-face three times during Trump's previous tenure in the White House but failed to agree a denuclearisation programme. North Korea has since conducted multiple tests of intercontinental missiles, its neighbours say.Asked if he would recognise North Korea as a nuclear state, Trump told reporters late on Thursday: \"I think they are sort of a nuclear power... They got a lot of nuclear weapons, I'll say that.\"Kim has said he was open to meeting Trump again, provided the US stopped pursuing its \"absurd\" demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. \"I still have a good memory of President Trump,\" Kim said in a speech last month, according to state media.Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this timeSouth Korea's Unification Minister Chung Dong-young, who handles relations between the North and South, said there was a \"considerable\" chance the two leaders might meet while Trump is in South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum, according to news agency AFP.A senior US official told reporters that a meeting was not in Trump's schedule, according to the Anadolu Agency - though their last meeting in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas came off the back of an invitation by Trump on social media.Trump's first stop will be in Malaysia, where he will attend Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit.He is expected to land in the South Korean city Busan on Wednesday ahead of the Apec summit. He will meet South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung, who discussed peace on the Korean peninsula and the possibility of a Trump-Kim meeting while visiting the White House in August.Lee told the BBC he was open to a deal between Trump and Kim in which North Korea agreed to freeze production of its nuclear weapons.Trump's meeting with China's President Xi comes on the backdrop of a trade war between the two nations.The two have agreed to hold off triple-digit tariffs threatened against one another while seeking a trade agreement - but that detente is in jeopardy after Trump said he would level a 100% trade levy on Chinese goods over Beijing's curbs on rare earth exports.The minerals are essential for many electronics and China is currently responsible for around 90% of exports of their refined form.",

    "body": "3 days agoHsin-Yi LoSouth EastBears 'enjoy life to the full' after major rescueTwo bears rescued from \"deplorable conditions\" in Armenia by an East Sussex charity have been making the most of their new lives in a bear sanctuary.Giant Siberian bear Max and Syrian bear Minnie were living in a bus depot for the entertainment of travellers until they were saved in 2018. The rescue operation was carried out by International Animal Rescue (IAR), based in Uckfield, and the Foundation for the Preservation of Wildlife and Cultural Assets in Armenia.Alan Knight, IAR president, told the BBC it was \"heart-warming\" to see how healthy and playful Max and Minnie were \"after years of cruelty and neglect\". \"They are seizing a second chance to enjoy life to the full,\" he added.International Animal RescueMax had to be anaesthetised with a blow dart before the rescue crew cut through the bars of the cage using an angle grinderThe IAR said it took a year to persuade the bears' captor to agree to their release. Mr Knight said the pair had been kept in a cage that had been welded shut for more than 10 years.\"Being kept in such a small cage and knee deep in excrement, we couldn't get into the cage to rescue them,\" he said.International Animal RescueKeepers say Minnie enjoys applesAs Max weighed 500kg (1,102 lb) he had to be moved in a horse trailer while Minnie was transported on a deep bed of straw in a transport crate.Mr Knight said Max had to be anaesthetised with a blow dart before emergency services cut through the bars of the cage using angle grinders.\"The bears were kept in deplorable conditions and we were desperate to set them free,\" said Mr Knight.International Animal RescueKeepers say Max is \"playful\" and \"keeps everyone entertained\"The charity said Max and Minnie have learnt to forage for food hidden in their enclosure in the wildlife rescue centre in Urtsadzor, and are responding to natural bear instincts, including going into hibernation.It adds the bears are regularly treated with fruits, vegetables, fish and meat. The keepers say Max is the \"playful one\", enjoying tree-climbing, tossing logs and balls into the pool and \"keeping everyone entertained\". Meanwhile, Minnie leaves the hard work of shaking apples out of the wobble tree to Max, while waiting patiently to retrieve her share of the fallen fruit.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "'I just love yapping': Spud sellers, posh-girl comedy and bus-loving gran among  TikTok award nominees17 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsSarelSarel is best known for her Love Island debriefs after each episode When Sarel presses record on her phone, there's no script, no set and no meticulous plan for what she's about to say. \"I'm usually wearing my bonnet, no makeup and I just pick up the phone and start yapping,\" she says. \"I believe in maximum output for minimal effort, so if I have to do more than the bare minimum, I likely won't do it. That's why I just talk to the camera and post.\" In only a few years, Sarel's unfiltered style has turned her from an ordinary voice online into one of TikTok's most distinctive personalities, with more than one million followers on the platform. Famous for her Love Island debriefs, Sarel is among the nominees at the second annual TikTok awards - a celebration of the creators shaping online culture in the UK. There are 72 nominees across 12 categories including education, beauty, comedy, food and sport. The nominees have a combined following of more than 83 million followers.From breakout comedians to beauty innovators, this year's nominees include jacket potato entrepreneurs, tap dancing brothers, a bus loving aunty, a BookTok aficionado and a film location fangirl. Sarel Sarel can't quite believe that the thing she does most naturally - talking - has gained her millions of followers and likes.\"It's mad people want to watch me yap,\" she says. But the simplicity of her process is part of the appeal and \"you really do see 100% of me on the camera\". Her journey has also taken her beyond the screen, and in 2023 she performed at the Edinburgh Fringe festival with fellow TikTok stars. \"I've got a whole new respect for comedians after doing that,\" she says. \"With content, if people don't like it, they scroll away, but if you bomb on stage, the whole room is looking at you like, 'That's terrible'\".With visibility comes scrutiny, and Sarel says it's not always easy dealing with the darker side of social media. \"The hate is always louder than the love,\" she says. \"Five years ago, I'd clap back in the comments, but I'm 31 now and I'm too tired for that so I just block it out and ignore it.\" Because she started sharing later in life, Sarel is still figuring out how much of herself to put online. \"I go off how I feel in the moment, and my audience respects that,\" she says. \"I started off like I was just talking to friends, but now I protect parts of my life I don't want everyone's opinion on.\" While social media is full of people turning major life events into months-long content strategies, Sarel isn't interested in that and even significant milestones tend to pass with little fanfare on her feed. \"I recently got married and I did two videos, then I was like, 'Let's talk about The Traitors.' I've got ADHD, so I move on quickly.\"Henry RowleyHenry RowleyThe 27-year-old was a marketing executive before finding fame on TikTokBest known for his \"husky posh girl\" sketches, Henry Rowley has become one of TikTok's sharpest comedy voices. The Leicester-born performer discovered his now signature characters while studying at Bristol University, where he found himself \"surrounded by a whole new world of posh\" and he couldn't resist turning it into material.\"Some of those posh people were my friends and I found everything they said hilarious, so I started making videos about things they'd say on nights out.\"His sketches, which more recently include impressions of Harry Potter characters as if they were Scottish, has earned him more than a million followers on TikTok. He's also tried to carve a space in stand-up - a move he admits has been challenging. \"It's entirely different doing content and comedy on stage,\" he says. \"Stand-up takes a lot of work and before the Fringe and my tour, there were so many pubs and awful gigs where I did a 20-minute set to zero laughs. It's certainly humbling.\" Despite his rising profile, Rowley protects much of his life from the public eye. \"I mainly post characters and sketches so people who follow me don't know that much about me, which is really nice. I like having that balance,\" he says. His advice for other people starting out creating content is similar to what most of the nominees said: \"Don't try and go viral but instead focus on doing something you are genuinely interested in.\" Bemi OrojuogunBemi, known as Bus Aunty, is nominated for best video of the year which has been watched 49 million timesIf London has an unofficial ambassador for its buses, it might just be Bus Aunty. Often seen smiling beside a passing double-decker, she's turned her lifelong love of the capital's transport network into a viral celebration of city life.\"My love for buses comes from a long time ago, from the early 90s,\" she says. \"I have always taken a picture of myself with buses and one random day I chose to post one on TikTok and it went viral, and now here we are.\" One of her videos, which is nominated for best video of the year, has been viewed amost 50 million times and Bemi now has collaborations with Burberry and Ikea. The mental health nurse has become one of TikTok's most unexpected success stories and she admits \"it's slightly overwhelming that everyone recognises me\".\"I get recognised in the streets sometimes and people say, 'Oh, hello, Bus Aunty.' I never thought people would be stopping me in my wildest dreams and it's taken some getting used to.\" \"To be nominated is amazing,\" she says of her TikTok Awards nod. \"If I'm nominated, it means I deserve to be here, and I really do love buses and love London and hopefully that shows.\" She's also proud to represent a different side of the app's community. \"You're never too old,\" she says firmly. \"I would never have thought I could do TikTok and be nominated for awards, but here I am, having only posted for just over a year.\"Never give up on your dream because what I love about London has got me here.\"Jack Edwards Jack EdwardsIf TikTok has a resident librarian, it's Jack Edwards, who has built a devoted following by sharing his love of reading. But he says his journey into social media stardom began with rejection.\"It was lockdown and I was looking for a job in publishing and no-one wanted to hire me,\" he recalls. \"My inbox was snorkelling in a sea of rejection and every email started with the word unfortunately.\"So I started talking about the books I was reading on social media.\"What began as a side project quickly turned into a full-time career, and Edwards ended up leaving the job he'd eventually secured in publishing. He says his advice to would-be creators is finding what makes their content personal.\"You have so many interests,\" he explains. \"If you were to create a Venn diagram of them all, the crossover in the middle is what you should make content about. For me, the cross-section is books, travel and pop culture.\"Edwards adds that he's careful about how much of himself he reveals to his audience. \"I talk about the books and art I love, but never the people I love,\" he says. \"But of course when you talk about books, you end up talking about everything from trauma, to politics, to sexuality.\"That openness has seen him create a community that stretches far beyond the screen.\"People say, 'Hi' in the street and it's the best thing ever. We have a mini book club right there on the pavement, an instant Jane Austen love-fest, and I know it's so strange but honestly it's really special for me.\"Still, internet fame brings its odd moments. \"Sometimes you get a message saying, 'Oh, hi, I just saw you at the urinal,'\" he laughs. \"Being spotted in those kinds of places never gets normal.\"",

    "body": "17 hours agoRuth CleggHealth and wellbeing reporterGetty ImagesIt's been described as the mineral of the moment.Millions of us are taking magnesium for a whole range of reasons. Can it help us sleep better? Sort our digestion problems? Give our busy brains a moment of peace?In the fast-moving world of supplements, it's magnesium's time to shine.And the industry is booming. The global magnesium market is worth nearly £3bn and that's set to nearly double over the next decade.In a small factory, nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, huge plastic barrels of white powder are stacked up next to giant whirring machines.Workers in hazmat suits carefully weigh out magnesium citrate - a compound made by mixing the mineral with citric acid - into shiny, steel containers.Ruth Clegg/BBCMillions of magnesium tablets are produced in this factory every day\"We are sending our supplies all over the world,\" Andrew Goring, manager director of Lonsdale Health, explains. \"Around the UK, obviously, but also to Australia, parts of Asia, Kuwait, Iraq.\"It's one of our biggest sellers and the market just keeps growing.\"He is shouting over the hum of the pill presser, a machine that resembles a Dalek, which pops out dozens of small white magnesium tablets a second.\"Do we actually need it?\" I bellow back. \"And why now, why has it become so popular?\"\"Influencers, social media - that's what's pushing it,\" Mr Goring explains. \"We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream.\"I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.\"Clever marketing schemes,\" Ms Jackson says, \"magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health.\"But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. The recommended daily amount for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.It might make up less than 1% of us but \"it is involved in over 300 different processes\", Ms Jackson explains.It is \"especially important for our brain and mood,\" she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.Katie CurranKatie says magnesium supplements have helped improve her sleep and calmed her racing thoughtsFor Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.\"A year ago, I was struggling,\" she confides. \"It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later.\"Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, an amino acid with limited evidence linking it to better sleep.After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.\"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle.\"While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with \"commission paid\" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation. The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.\"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die',\" Ms Stavridis says, \"'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.\"Many of us are not getting enough magnesium,\" she continues, \"around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the recommended daily intake.\"But just taking a supplement is not the answer.\"Getty ImagesSeeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are all rich in magnesiumTake sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also affect the absorption rate of magnesium.Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of \"take this\" and you'll be fixed.She recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.If healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in \"expensive urine\", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.For those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.Dietitian Kirsten Jackson also says most people should \"100% look at diet first\".Foods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.She warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.\"One magnesium supplement is not going to sort all that.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "Parents are being urged to get their children vaccinated against flu over half-term as the NHS warned of rising cases of the disease.There is an early flu season, health officials say, and the latest data for England showed cases and hospitalisations were increasing.NHS England said many school children will have already received the vaccine at school but there are still options for those who have not, including pop-up clinics.GP surgeries can give flu vaccines to school-aged children with certain health conditions, as well as two to three year olds, while preschoolers can also be taken to pharmacies for the vaccine.Most children are offered the vaccine in a nasal spray rather than an injection.NHS England's weekly flu and Covid surveillance report said there was increased flu activity \"particularly among children\".Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England, said it was concerning that the flu had hit early this year and the increase among children was \"worrying\".\"Flu can spread like wildfire across schools and can make children really unwell,\" he said.\"The virus changes each year, so vaccination remains the best way to shield your child from getting seriously ill.\"He urged parents to make sure they had opted their child in for an in-school vaccine or find their nearest clinic.Pop-up clinics were being held in places like bowling alleys and fire stations, Mr Burton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the vaccine was \"quick, easy and safe\".Dr Fari Ahmad told BBC Breakfast that while she was seeing cases, \"I don't think we've quite hit the peak yet\".\"With flu, this is a war we have every year. Flu is unpredictable, it still kills people and every year we try to get enough people vaccinated so that when the big surge comes we are not decimated,\" she said. Dr Ahmad said that getting enough school-age children vaccinated meant that it made that surge better, \"because they are spreaders\".\"It will be great for the kids individually but it will also be better for all of us,\" she said.NHS England said more than 10 million vaccines have already been delivered in the latest campaign, including to almost 1.5 million school-aged children and more than 300,000 eligible two and three year olds.Free vaccines are available to those older than 65, with certain long-term health conditions, are pregnant, live in a care home, the main carer for an older or disabled person or live with someone who has a weakened immune system.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship3 hours agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the world's largest warship to be sent to the Caribbean.The USS Gerald R Ford can carry up to 90 aircraft and its deployment marks a massive increase in US firepower in the region.The US has conducted 10 air strikes on vessels in the area as part of what it says is a war on drug traffickers. US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power. The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?The Pentagon said on Friday that the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organisations\", spokesman Sean Parnell said.Maduro accused the US of seeking \"a new eternal war\" in his address.\"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,\" he told state media.The carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela, saying earlier this week that the US is \"looking at land now\" after getting \"the sea very well under control\".\"We stopped all drugs from coming in by sea. I will stop all drugs from coming in by land very shortly. You'll see that starting,\" he told reporters at the White House on Saturday before departing for a trip to Asia.The US has also bolstered its air presence in the region. BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.Military analysts have pointed out that intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroOn Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed in an operation in the Caribbean.He said the boat had belonged to the Tren de Aragua - a transnational criminal organisation which has its base in Venezuela and has been proscribed as a terrorist group by the US State Department.The US air strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. \"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up was intended to \"strike fear\" into the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike was the latest the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean as well.At least 43 people have been killed.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic senators wrote to the White House, alleging the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval. Trump has said he has the legal authority to order the strikes.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC that the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has appeared unwilling to challenge. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group.  ",

    "body": "6 hours agoAndrew RogersBBC NewsbeatMicrosoftThe Halo series has gone to new worlds, and now it's going to new consoles tooMicrosoft is taking one of its most popular and recognisable game series to a rival console for the first time.Halo, a sci-fi shooter fronted by the armour-clad Master Chief, is heading to PlayStation 5 next year, something that would have been unthinkable for gaming fans when the title first launched in 2001.A remake of the first game Halo: Combat Evolved has been announced for Microsoft's own Xbox hardware, as well as for Sony's PS5, under the name Halo: Campaign Evolved.It will also launch on PC, and will be playable on mobile phones and tablets through Microsoft's cloud streaming technology.It's the latest sign Microsoft is moving away from the traditional approach of console makers keeping their own franchises and characters as exclusives.The end of console wars?Halo is often credited with helping Microsoft first break into the gaming market with its original Xbox, despite arriving after consoles from Nintendo and Sony were already popular.But while Microsoft has rapidly expanded its presence in the industry, buying up several rival studios - including Call of Duty maker Activision for $69bn (£56bn) - it's struggled to convince gamers to buy its latest consoles.Globally, the PlayStation 5 has reportedly outsold Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X consoles by more than two to one. Nintendo's hybrid Switch console has been even more successful.Microsoft has instead been pushing a strategy of being able to play its games in more places, including on PCs, tablets, phones, and its new handheld console, the ROG Xbox Ally.This has included promoting its subscription service Game Pass, where a monthly charge gets players access to a library of games, similar in style to services like Netflix and Disney+.Increasing the Halo: ReachWhile there's long been rivalry between PlayStation and Xbox players, some fans of the Halo series are happy to see it reach more people. YouTuber Kara, who streams under the name @Eldeeable, tells BBC Newsbeat that Halo's been a big part of her life. \"Combat Evolved was one of the first games I ever played on Xbox,\" she says. \"I played it with my little brother split-screen and I loved it.\" She says the announcement is \"massive\" and \"broke the internet a little bit\". @EldeeableKara, 29, says Halo has been a big part of her life, growing up as an \"Xbox girly\"Some Xbox owners have criticised Microsoft for not keeping Halo as an exclusive game, but it reflects a broader move away from exclusivity - with PlayStation releasing games from its The Last Of Us and Horizon series on PC, and even Nintendo making some games with its characters available on mobile phones.For Kara, this shouldn't be seen as a bad thing.\"I know there's a bit of controversy about it coming to PlayStation, but I don't see any reason why it should be like that at all\", she says. \"I just think it's a win for all gamers.\" The game's executive producer Damon Conn agrees, promising that the remake will appeal to old and new fans.\"At its heart, Halo is about connection, we're thrilled to meet a new generation of players on their platforms of choice to fall in love with Halo the same way we did,\" he says.\"We're not trying to rewrite Halo's legacy - we're trying to immerse you in it like never before.\"Additional reporting by Georgia Levy-Collins and Peter Gillibrand.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.Related topics ",

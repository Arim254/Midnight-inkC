    "body": "39 minutes agoGetty ImagesThe robbers reached a first-floor window and cut through glass panes to gain access to the gold gilded Apollon WingThe Louvre Museum in Paris has been forced to close while police investigate a brazen heist which reportedly targeted France's priceless crown jewels. Thieves wielding power tools broke into the world's most visited museum in broad daylight, before escaping on scooters with items said to be of \"incalculable\" value. Here is what we know about the crime which has stunned France.How did the theft unfold?The theft occurred on Sunday between 09:30 and 09:40 local time, shortly after the museum opened to visitors. The thieves appear to have used a mechanical ladder to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon via a balcony close to the River Seine. Pictures from the scene showed a vehicle-mounted ladder leading up to a first-floor window.The thieves are then said to have cut through glass panes with an angle grinder or chainsaw to gain access to the museum. Culture Minister Rachida Dati told French news outlet TF1 that footage of the theft showed the masked robbers entering \"calmly\" and smashing display cases containing the jewels.No one was injured in the incident, with Dati saying there been \"no violence, very professional\".She described the thieves as seemingly being \"experienced\" with a well-prepared plan to flee on scooters.Investigators believe three or four suspects were involved and are studying CCTV footage from the escape route. The whole raid happened \"very, very fast\", Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France Inter radio, and was over in a handful of minutes.One witness described scenes of \"total panic\" as the museum was evacuated. Later images showed entrances closed off with metal gates. Getty ImagesThe thieves approached the building from the River Seine banksideWhat was stolenFrench authorities have not confirmed which items were taken but the wing which was targeted houses jewels and riches from France's royal past.Dati said one item was found outside the museum, apparently having been dropped during the escape. Le Parisien newspaper reported it may have been the crown of Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III.The newspaper said the Regent Diamond - the 140-carat centrepiece of the gallery - was not stolen.BFM reported that the stolen pieces were believed to include jewels belonging to Napoleon III, and that a second cabinet containing other regal treasures may also have been targeted.Nuñez described the stolen jewels \"priceless\" and \"of immeasurable heritage value\".Getty ImagesThey would not confirm which items were taken but said the thieves targeted two glass display cases in the Apollon WingHave similar thefts happened before?In 1911, an Italian museum employee was able to make off with the Mona Lisa under his coat after lifting the painting - which was then little-known to the public - straight off the wall of a quiet gallery. It was recovered after two years and the culprit later said he was motivated by the belief the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece belonged in Italy.Fewer chances are taken with the Mona Lisa these days: the painting, perhaps the most renowned in the museum's collection, hangs in a high-security glass compartment.In 1998, the Le Chemin de Sevres - a 19th century painting by Camille Corot - was stolen and has never been found. The incident prompted a massive overhaul of museum security. There has been a recent spate of thefts targeting French museums.Last month, thieves broke into the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges and stole porcelain works reputedly worth €9.5m ($11m / £8.25m).In November 2024, seven items of \"great historic and heritage value\" were stolen from the Cognacq-Jay Museum in the capital. Five were recovered a few days ago.The same month, armed robbers raided the Hieron Museum in Burgundy, firing shots before escaping with millions of pounds worth of 20th century artworks.",

    "body": "World of cricket's farewell to umpire Dickie Bird30 minutes agoGrace Wood & Adam LaverYorkshirePA MediaDickie Bird's funeral cortege passes the umpire's statue in BarnsleyCricketing stars from Yorkshire and beyond were among the mourners who gathered to say farewell to legendary umpire Dickie Bird at his funeral earlier.The Barnsley-born son of a miner was 92 when he died \"peacefully at home\" on 22 September, according to Yorkshire County Cricket Club.The service at St Mary's Church in Barnsley was attended by former England cricketers Sir Geoffrey Boycott and Michael Vaughan and was followed by a private family-only cremation and a wake at the town hall.Well-wishers gathered at the statue of Bird on Church Lane where the funeral procession paused for a moment of reflection.Anthony Devlin/PA WireDickie Bird died on 22 September aged 92The invited guests also included Yorkshire chair Colin Graves and former director of cricket Martyn Moxon, the sports commentator John Helm and the ex-sports minister Richard Caborn.Sir Geoffrey and Graves both gave eulogies and a poem by local poet Ian McMillan was read out.Sir Geoffrey made sure the colourful character of his friend of almost 70 years shined through.\"I first met Dickie Bird when I was 15, at the time I was playing cricket for Hemsworth Grammar School,\" Sir Geoffrey said to a packed church.\"He called me Gerald for years.\"He added: \"Surprisingly with all the nerves he had as a batsman, he became a great umpire because he could channel all that nervous energy into good decisions.\"Dickie was refreshingly different. Eccentric but fair. It would be hard to find anyone who didn't like him.\"PA MediaSir Geoffery Boycott paid tribute to his old friend Dickie BirdBird officiated in 66 Tests and 76 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals, between 1973 and 1996.He began as a player, batting for Yorkshire and Leicestershire before an injury cut short his career in 1964.Bird was awarded an MBE in 1986, an OBE in 2012 and the Freedom of Barnsley in 2000.In 2009 he was immortalised by a statue in Barnsley that depicted him raising his index finger to indicate a batsman was out.At Yorkshire's home ground, Headingley, he paid for a balcony outside the dressing room for the players to sit and watch the game. Both the balcony and a clock at the ground bear his name.ReutersDickie Bird retired as an umpire at the age of 65 after a career spanning 30 yearsFormer England and Yorkshire cricketer Ryan Sidebottom said Bird was so committed to Yorkshire cricket that he would be on the pitch even for county matches he wasn't umpiring.He said: \"He'd be out looking at the wicket and wandering around. But it looked like he'd just come in from a night out, like an 1980s John Travolta, because he had the full suit on with a large collar and tie and really fancy suits and flared trousers.\"We used to see him regularly with different suits, some naughty suits, some proper naughty suits.\"Bowler Sidebottom retired in 2017, after taking more than 1,000 career wickets, and he said Bird \"absolutely loved\" the sport.\"Great bloke and a lovely man who would do anything for Yorkshire cricket. He just loved Yorkshire, he was so passionate about the game and Yorkshire in general,\" he said.And it was love for Yorkshire, and its people, that chair of Yorkshire County Cricket Club Colin Graves remembered at his funeral.\"He had a reputation for not being the first at the bar, but he was a very generous man indeed,\" he said, adding that almost 1,000 children had been recipients of grants from him.Among the junior cricketers to have received financial awards from Dickie was Harry Brook - now an England international.Paul Barker/PA WireDickie Bird was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Leeds in 1997Speaking to the BBC when he turned 90 two years ago, Bird said his secret to a long life had been his love of sport and exercise.\"I run, I go out down to the local football ground here in the local park and I lap around the ground. I feel that's done me good.\"I'd like people, elderly people, if they could to just try and do a few exercises, move your arms, run on the spot, it occupies the brain. \"I'll keep my exercises up as long as I can.\"As a young man, he played for Barnsley Cricket Club alongside Boycott and the journalist and broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson.Dickie Bird shares secret to healthy life at 90Related stories",

    "body": "1 hour agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThe Metropolitan Police said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection.\"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made,\" the force said on Sunday.Ms Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year, said she was among the girls and young women sexually exploited by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy circle.Prince Andrew has not commented on the reports, but consistently denies all allegations against him. Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment.Ms Giuffre also claimed that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London, in 2001.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges related to Epstein, her former boyfriend.According to the Mail on Sunday, Prince Andrew asked his police protection officer to investigate her just before the newspaper published a photo of Ms Giuffre's first meeting with the prince in February 2011.The paper alleged that he gave the officer her date of birth and confidential social security number.The Sunday Telegraph also claimed that Prince Andrew \"sought to dig up dirt\" on Ms Giuffre.Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, called it \"deeply concerning\", adding that if true, \"it's absolutely not the way that close protection officers should be used\".On Friday, Prince Andrew announced that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles and giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.He will no longer use his Duke of York title, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.The prince had already ceased to be a \"working royal\" and had lost the use of his HRH title and no longer appeared at official royal events. His role now will be even more diminished.Prince Andrew email to Epstein does not suggest he broke off friendship - Emily MaitlisEmily Maitlis, who conducted the now-infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 with the prince, said the move had been \"a long time coming\", adding: \"Six years has been quite a long time to wait for this.\"In the interview, the prince claimed he had severed all ties with Epstein in 2010 during a visit to his New York home. Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Maitlis said she felt \"quite sick\" when emails emerged that had been sent in February 2011 from the prince to Epstein, suggesting their friendship had not ended.She had questioned Prince Andrew on his decision to \"spend four days - four nights - in a convicted paedophile's home\" to end their friendship, to which he had responded he had a tendency to be \"too honourable\".The February 2011 emails including one from the prince that read: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!\", suggesting he had stayed in touch with him. \"The tenor of it, the idea not just that he was saying we're in this together, but signing off 'let's play some more soon', does not suggest that he had ever finished that friendship, that he had ever broken off with Epstein,\" Maitlis said.\"You're left really questioning, why he said that, whether the conversation ever existed, and how much more there is in that interview that we have to now go back and question,\" the journalist added.Prince Andrew has faced a series of scandals over recent years, including making an out-of-court settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him.A posthumous memoir by Ms Giuffre to be released next week is likely to cast further attention on the prince's involvement with her and Epstein. On Friday evening, Ms Giuffre's brother Sky Roberts told BBC Newsnight his sister would have been \"very proud\" of the latest development regarding Prince Andrew's titles, but that he would like the King to go a step further and remove the title of prince.\"I think anybody that was implicated... should have some sort of responsibility and accountability for these survivors,\" he said.Former BBC royal correspondent Jenny Bond told the BBC she believed \"public clamour for more action against Andrew is going to continue because these headlines are going to continue\". \"We have to remember at the heart of all this is not really the royal family at all - it's the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and Virginia Giuffre being one of them.\"",

    "body": "Why John Bolton case is more serious than those against other Trump critics4 hours agoKayla EpsteinBloomberg via Getty ImagesFormer national security adviser John Bolton arrives at court on Friday.President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to see his critics investigated, pressuring the Justice Department to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" the president wrote last month in a Truth Social post.\"They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!)\" he said, referencing the four criminal cases he faced after leaving the White House in 2021 and James's civil case.Both have since been charged, in cases that many experts have said appear to be politically motivated and difficult to win in court.But the latest charges against a Trump critic, former national security adviser John Bolton, stand apart, legal specialists and former prosecutors say.\"I would say, comparing Bolton's charges to Comey's and James' is like comparing apples to oranges,\" said Mark Lesko, a former acting US attorney for the Eastern District of New York.Bolton has been criminally indicted on federal charges pertaining to the alleged mishandling of classified information. Since leaving the White House in 2019, he has become a vocal Trump critic, going so far as to call him \"stunningly uninformed\" and unfit for office in his memoir.Experts say that while there may be political reasons to go after Bolton, the procedures used to secure an indictment and the evidence compiled against him indicate a potentially stronger case than the Justice Department brought against Comey or James. \"This misconduct that's being alleged is both more serious and appears to have occurred over a significant period of time,\" said Carissa Byrne Hessick, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law.During his time as Trump's national security adviser, and after his 2019 White House departure, prosecutors alleged that Bolton put the country at risk by improperly retaining and transmitting classified information to family members using insecure means, including AOL. Some of the documents were labeled top secret.The indictment alleges that at one point a hacker gained access to Bolton's account where documents were stored and sent an apparent threat to cause \"the biggest scandal since Hillary [Clinton]'s emails were leaked\".Bolton pleaded not guilty during a court appearance on Friday to 18 separate charges of mishandling classified information.Retribution or a strong case?The timing of his indictment - coming on the tails of charges against Comey and James - has renewed questions about political pressure on the justice system.Trump once suggested Bolton belonged in jail, and called him a \"sleazebag\". Bolton, for his part, wrote a book about his time in the Trump administration that was highly critical of the president.\"There's no question that the timing of this indictment, when combined with others, has raised questions about the strength of these charges, and why these charges are being brought now,\" said Jamil Jaffer, founder and executive director of the National Security Institute at the George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School.However, he added, \"if the Justice Department is able to prove the facts alleged and demonstrate the information is properly classified, his conduct may very well have violated the law\".Charging such a high-ranking official for mishandling classified documents is \"rare\" but not unprecedented, said Carrie Cordero, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\"Cases that involve classified information present challenges to prosecute, but they can and are brought against both low-level and high-level officials, from time to time,\" she said.Similarities to investigations into Trump and BidenTrump similarly faced charges of improperly storing classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and obstructing their return, but that case was ultimately dismissed by a federal judge and negated by his re-election as president. A special counsel also found that former President Joe Biden improperly stored classified documents from his time as vice president, but did not criminally charge him.Bolton's case bears similarities to Trump's and Biden's classified documents issues, said Mr Lesko, who also held a top national security role at the Justice Department.Strict procedures govern the handling of classified documents. To win a conviction, the government must prove that Bolton knew the information he was transmitting was classified, and he had to knowingly transfer it to someone not entitled to receive it.\"Because of the classified nature of the material at issue in this case, we don't have a lot of details about why the government believes things like the diary entries and the other information he communicated by email, and why there were classified,\" said Mr Jaffer.A more traditional prosecution The process by which the Justice Department brought this case will be under scrutiny, after Trump publicly posted his desire to see his political opponents prosecuted and some of those indictments came to fruition.But Mr Lesko said in Bolton's case, prosecutors seem to have followed protocol. \"The Bolton prosecution and ultimately the indictment seemed to have followed the regular process including the rules and norms within the Department of Justice,\" he said.Unlike Comey's brief, two-page indictment, Bolton's was a more \"traditional\" document that \"clearly sets forth the details involving the facts and circumstances here,\" Mr Lesko said.\"It seems fairly consistent with a long line of cases... where government officials mishandled and transmitted classified material.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoRachel HaganEPAThe Taliban has accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks on the Afghan capital KabulPakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government have agreed to an \"immediate ceasefire\" after more than a week of deadly fighting.The foreign ministry of Qatar, which mediated talks alongside Turkey, said both sides had agreed to establish \"mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability\".Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said ending \"hostile actions\" was \"important\", while Pakistan's foreign minister called the agreement the \"first step in the right direction\".Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy casualties during the clashes, the worst fighting since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.Islamabad has long accused the Taliban of harbouring armed groups which carry out attacks in Pakistan, which it denies. Clashes intensified along the 1,600-mile mountainous border the two countries share after the Taliban accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks on the Afghan capital Kabul.Rumours had circulated the blasts in Kabul were a targeted attack on Noor Wali Mehsud, the leader of Pakistan Taliban. In response, the group released an unverified voice note from Mehsud saying he was still alive.In the days that followed, Afghan troops fired on Pakistani border posts, prompting Pakistan to respond with mortar fire and drone strikes.At least three dozen Afghan civilians have been killed and hundreds more wounded, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said on Thursday.A temporary truce was declared on Wednesday night as delegations met in Doha, but cross-border strikes continued.On Friday, the Taliban said Pakistan had carried out an air strike which killed eight, including three local cricket players.Under the new agreement, the Taliban said it would not \"support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan\", while both sides agreed to refrain from targeting each other's security forces, civilians or critical infrastructure.Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said the latest ceasefire meant \"terrorism from Afghanistan on Pakistan's soil will be stopped immediately\", with the two sides set to meet in Istanbul for further talks next week. Pakistan was a major backer of the Taliban after its ouster in 2001 following a US-led invasion. But relations deteriorated after Islamabad accused the group of providing a safe haven to the Pakistan Taliban, which has launched an armed insurgence against government forces.The group has carried out at least 600 attacks on Pakistani forces over the last year, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.",

    "body": "Housing designed to combat loneliness wins top architecture award3 days agoIan YoungsCulture reporterPhilip Vile/RibaA modern answer to the traditional almshouse, designed to combat loneliness, has won a prestigious architecture award for Britain's best new building.Appleby Blue Almshouse, which provides affordable flats for over-65s in Southwark, south London, has won this year's Royal Institute of British Architects' (Riba) Stirling Prize.The complex, in Bermondsey, has 59 flats plus communal facilities, including a roof garden, courtyard and community kitchen.The Stirling Prize judges said it \"sets an ambitious standard for social housing among older people\".Philip Vile/RibaArchitects Witherford Watson Mann have crafted \"high-quality\" and \"thoughtful\" spaces to create environments that truly care for their residents\", according to jury member Ingrid Schroder, director of the Architectural Association (AA) School of Architecture.Philip Vile/RibaThe building was praised for its \"generous\" homes, terracotta-paved hallways with benches and plants, and a water feature that gives the building the \"sense of a woodland oasis\".That all creates an \"aspirational living environment\" that stands \"in stark contrast to the institutional atmosphere often associated with older people's housing\", Riba said.Philip Vile/RibaThe Appleby Blue Almshouse was built on the site of an old care home by United St Saviour's Charity, which subsidises the flats for people on low incomes.Almshouses were traditionally built from the Middle Ages to provide charitable accommodation for people in need.Philip Vile/RibaAppleby Blue beat a range of other nominated buildings and architecture projects to this year's Stirling Prize, ranging from the restoration of the Big Ben tower in London to a new fashion college campus, a science laboratory and an \"inventive\" home extension.The other contenders were:House of CommonsRory GaylorThe Elizabeth TowerHastings HouseThe prize is given to the building judged to be \"the most significant of the year for the evolution of architecture and the built environment\", and is judged on criteria including design vision, innovation and originality.This is Witherford Watson Mann's second time as winning architects, 12 years after they were selected for their design for a groundbreaking modern holiday home inside the ancient Astley Castle in Warwickshire.The Elizabeth line - London's east-west train line - won the prestigious award last year.Other previous winners of the prize - first presented in 1996 - include Liverpool's Everyman Theatre, Hastings Pier and the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh.Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.",

He was not present for Fleetwood's maiden PGA Tour victory in August and was not old enough to attend the world number five's last win on the DP World Tour, in January 2024.\"That was all day today what I had in my mind - could I put myself in a position where I could actually make that happen?,\" said Fleetwood, 34, after embracing his son on the green.\"It's just one of those little things. It means so much to me and that was really cool...that's what I wanted to do all day.\"I hope there are going to be many more times when we hopefully get the chance to do that.\"Fleetwood had started the final round in second place, two shots behind Japan's Keita Nakajima.New Zealander Daniel Hillier - ranked 218th in the world - leapfrogged them into a surprise lead, after moving to seven under for his round, but was unable to recover from a double bogey six on the 14th.Nakajima, meanwhile, could not summon up the fireworks of his third-round 65, and had to settle for his third second-place finish on the DP World Tour.However Englishman Fleetwood, whose putter had run cold during a frustrating third round on Saturday, had a run of four consecutive birdies around the turn - from the seventh to the 10th - followed by fine birdie putts on the 14th and 17th, to go down the last with a comfortable two-shot advantage.His latest victory ensured he would qualify for the season-ending tournaments and continued a recent run of form that also included a star turn in Europe's Ryder Cup win over the United States in New York. \"There's been plenty of times when things haven't gone my way, but the last two tournaments I have been in contention in I have won, so maybe things are starting to even out a little bit,\" added Fleetwood following the latest achievement of a remarkable season, in which he has claimed eight top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour.Fellow Englishman Alex Fitzpatrick rolled in for a birdie at the last to finish with a third consecutive round of 67, which moved him to 18 under and a tie for third place alongside Ireland's Shane Lowry.Viktor Hovland finished his week with a flourish, moving up to 17 under and a share of fourth place after chipping in for an eagle at the last.Rory McIlroy, meanwhile, finished in a tie for 25th on 11 under.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesVice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the US Marine Corps at an event that included a live artillery demonstration.That demonstration - which took place at Camp Pendleton in Southern California - drew the ire of the state's governor Gavin Newsom, in part because the exercise closed a section of a popular interstate.\"Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn't just wrong - it's dangerous,\" Newsom, a Democrat who has often disagreed with the Trump administration, said in a statement.During his remarks, Vance recalled his time in the Marines, railed against what he called a Democrat-caused government shutdown and critiqued previous military diversity initiatives.Getty ImagesThe Marines fired live artillery as part of a demonstration commemorating their 250th anniversary The demonstration was the largest in a decade in the continental US, the Marines said, and involved fighter jets, Navy vessels, helicopters and live fire from a towed howitzer.In response to the exercise, Newsom said he closed a section of Interstate 5 in Southern California \"due to extreme life safety risk and distraction to drivers, including sudden unexpected and loud explosions\".But officials in the vice-president's office disputed Newsom's remarks that the demonstration was dangerous and accused the California governor of trying to stoke fears.Watch: Vance views military drills involving jets, helicopters and amphibious landings\"If Gavin Newsom wants to oppose the training exercises that ensure our Armed Forces are the deadliest and most lethal fighting force in the world, then he can go right ahead,\" William Martin, Vance's communications director, told CNN. \"It would come as no surprise that he would stoop so low considering his pathetic track record of failure as governor.\"Vance, who spoke in front of hundreds of marines, praised his time in the military. \"I would not be here today, I would not be the vice president of the United States, I would not be the man I am today were it not for those four years that I served in the Marine Corps,\" he said.Vance spent four years in the Marines and served a tour in Iraq in 2005.But his remarks largely focused on politics, and in part he attacked \"woke\" aspects of the military. \"It is our common purpose, it is our common mission and it is the fact that every single person here bleeds Marine Corps green,\" the vice president said.Getty ImagesOne of the Trump administration's focuses has been eliminating diversity initiatives, particularly within the Pentagon. Vance also used the stage time to rail against the nearly three-week long government shutdown and put blame on Democrats, particularly Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\"I bring greetings today from our commander in chief, Donald J Trump, and he wanted me to tell each and every single one of you that he's proud of you, that he loves you and that despite the Schumer shutdown, he is going to do everything he can to make sure you get paid exactly as you deserve,\" he said.While thousands of federal workers are working without pay, the Defence Department is paying troops.

Andy Carter, senior winners' advisor at The National Lottery, said: \"They've clearly got some amazing and memorable moments ahead and I hope they especially love taking a big bite of the Big Apple.\"Related stories",

He attended the concert in Sheffield with his friend Mia Lloyd and his mother Sharon, as well as two of her friends. After being invited on to the stage, Mr Hatcher danced with the Roar and Firework star before Perry sang an off-the-cuff song about Monyash, Bakewell and Derbyshire.\"I'm sure she had no idea where it was but it was crazy that she name dropped the places,\" he said.Ben HatcherMr Hatcher went to the concert with his mother Sharon and his friend Mia LloydOn the experience itself, Mr Hatcher said: \"I think I foreshadowed it, me and my friend were screaming the entire time and she did look over a few times. \"We were just vibing and when she was choosing people to come on to the stage we were screaming and our seats were really good, we were directly in her eyesight.\"I was pointing at myself and I couldn't believe it when she picked me, it was so surreal.\"Making most of the opportunity, he managed to get a selfie with Perry as a memento.SuppliedMr Hatcher posed for a selfie with the pop star on stageMr Hatcher, a student of Chinese and economics at SOAS University of London, said he was recognised by other fans after his appearance on stage.\"There was this one nine-year-old girl in the car who rolled down the window after the show and screamed 'Ben you legend',\" he added.\"This has been an all-time high and my small claim to fame. People will get tired of hearing it but I won't get bored of talking about it.\"More on this story",

    "body": "3 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterThe government has announced plans to train and recruit more workers for the UK's clean energy sector, promising to create 400,000 extra jobs by 2030.Plumbers, electricians and welders are among 31 priority occupations that are \"particularly in demand\", with employment in renewable, wind, solar and nuclear expected to double to 860,000 in five years, ministers have said.Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said thousands of jobs were needed to develop Britain's clean energy sector to \"get bills down for good\".Welcoming the proposals, Unite the union said: \"Well-paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition.\"As part of the government's strategy, five \"technical excellence colleges\" will be set up to train workers with clean energy skills, with £2.5m in funding going towards pilot schemes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire, and Pembrokeshire, according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).A new programme is to be launched to match veterans with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories and nuclear power stations, while oil and gas workers could benefit from up to £20m from the UK and Scottish governments for bespoke careers training in clean energy roles.There would be also be tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed.He said 10,000 extra jobs would be needed to support the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk and described how the Siemen's wind turbine factory in Hull was \"booming\".Miliband also told the BBC he stood by his pledge to reduce energy bills by £300 by 2030, after bills went up by 2% for millions across the UK under Ofgem's latest price cap, which sets the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity for millions of households in England, Scotland and Wales.The increase for October to the end of December means a household using a typical amount of energy will pay £1,755 a year, up £35 a year.In a statement, Miliband said the plan would bring \"a new generation of good industrial jobs\" to communities across the UK.\"Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.\"Thanks to this government's commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.\"However, Shadow Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho told the BBC the current goal of reaching net zero by 2050 was \"making electricity really expensive\".She said: \"You need to look at the whole of the economy. We're losing thousands of jobs in the North Sea, we're losing thousands of jobs in industry.\"We have the most expensive electricity in the world and we have to bring that down.\"According to DESNZ, jobs in the clean energy sector command average salaries of more than £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000.Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said: \"We're giving workers the skills needed to switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry, and will drive growth across the nation.\"Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country's future.\"Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, said the government's strategy could \"help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs\".\"Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future,\" she added.Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the UK energy industry, said: \"Today's announcement is a critical step forward in building the workforce required to deliver our future energy system. \"It rightly recognises the need to tackle the skills challenge collectively by investing in both new talent and our existing workforce.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterBBCThe government is looking at the possibility of cutting the rate of VAT on energy bills, Ed Miliband has suggested.The energy secretary said he would not speculate ahead of the chancellor's Budget in November. But asked if the government would consider scrapping the 5% rate, he told the BBC the country was facing a \"cost-of-living crisis that we need to address as a government\" and \"we're looking at all of these issues\".The government is under pressure to reduce household energy costs and before the election Labour pledged to lower average bills by £300 a year by 2030.Miliband told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme he stood by that promise but the reason bills were so high was \"because of our dependence on fossil fuels\".He added: \"There is only one route to get bills down, which is to go for clean power, home-grown, clean energy, that we control, so we're not at the behest of the petrol states and the dictators.\"Pressed over whether the government was considering scrapping the 5% VAT rate on energy bills in November's Budget, Miliband said: \"The whole of the government, including the chancellor, understand that we face an affordability crisis in this country.  \"We face a cost-of-living crisis, a longstanding cost-of-living crisis, that we need to address as a government. We also face difficult fiscal circumstances... so obviously we're looking at all of these issues.\"A Treasury spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on speculation.\"Scrapping VAT on domestic energy bills would save the average household £86 per year and cost an estimated £2.5bn per year to implement, according to the charity Nesta.There was a rapid spike in energy prices in 2021, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and although costs have gone down, they have remained high by historical standards.This month bills went up by 2% for millions of households, under the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap.It means a household using a typical amount of energy will pay £1,755 a year, up £35 a year on the previous cap.Earlier this week Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC she was planning \"targeted action to deal with cost-of-living challenges\" in her Budget next month.The BBC understands this could also include reducing some of the regulatory levies currently added to energy bills.Levies known as \"policy costs\" - which are used to fund environmental and social schemes such as subsidies for renewables - made up around 16% of the average electricity bill and 6% of the average gas bill last year.Some energy bosses have argued green levies are partly to blame for rising bills and the government's independent adviser, the Climate Change Committee, has long recommended removing policy costs from electricity bills to help people feel the benefits of net-zero transition.Asked whether these could be funded through taxes rather than coming off energy bills, Miliband said: \"That's always a judgement for the chancellor, but let's be honest we know we've got really difficult fiscal circumstances that we inherited... but absolutely we look at those things.\"He argued the government had to invest in \"aging electricity infrastructure\" but there needed to be a \"balance between public expenditure and levies\".The cost of household energy bills has become a major political battleground, with the Conservatives and Reform UK blaming net-zero policies for higher prices. The Conservatives have said they would scrap the Climate Change Act, which legally requires the UK government to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050, as well as ditch carbon taxes on electricity generation and cut a funding scheme for renewables.Shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho said her party's plans would cut electricity bills for everyone by 20%.\"[The public] care about climate change but what I don't think they are signing up for is much higher bills and jobs being lost to countries abroad,\" she told the BBC.In an interview with the same programme, Green Party leader Zack Polanski argued nationalising energy companies would help cut costs for customers.His party has also proposed a new tax on carbon emissions to drive fossil fuels out of the economy and raise money to invest in the green transition.Challenged over whether businesses would simply pass on these costs to customers, Polanski rejected this and said the tax would be \"vital for tackling the climate crisis\". \"What we need to be doing is finding other ways to support particularly small and local businesses... We know the big corporations are destroying our environment, our democracy and our communities,\" he said.\"They can make a profit, sure, but this isn't about squeezing out every single profit they can make.\"",

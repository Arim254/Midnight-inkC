    "body": "The tech firms embracing a 72-hour working week20 hours agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentBBCThe recruitment website is jazzy, awash with pictures of happy young workers, and festooned with upbeat mini-slogans such as \"insane speed\", \"infinite curiosity\" and \"customer obsession\".Read a bit lower, and there are promises of perks galore: competitive compensation, free meals, free gym membership, free health and dental care and so on. But then comes the catch.Each job ad contains a warning: \"Please don't join if you're not excited about… working ~70 hrs/week in person with some of the most ambitious people in NYC.\"The website belongs to Rilla, a New York-based tech business which sells AI-based systems that allow employers to monitor sales representatives when they are out and about, interacting with clients.The company has become something of a poster child for a fast-paced workplace culture known as 996, also sometimes referred to as hustle culture or grindcore.In simple terms, it puts a premium on long working hours, typically 9am to 9pm, six days a week (hence \"996\").For most of us, that would be gruelling. But according to Will Gao, head of growth at Rilla, its 120 employees simply don't see it that way.\"We look for people who are like Olympian athletes, with characteristics of, you know, obsession, infinite ambition.\"It's people who want to do incredible things and have a lot of fun while doing so,\" he says.Will GaoWill Gao says the company Rilla looks for people \"like Olympian athletes\"He insists that while the hours are generally long, there's no rigid structure. \"If I'm like, 'Holy cow, I have a super idea I'm working on', then I'll just keep working until 2 or 3am, then I'll just roll in the next day at noon or something\", he explains.This kind of approach has become extremely popular in the technology sector over the past few years, and for good reason. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has been taking place at a breakneck pace, and companies around the world are now working flat-out to develop ways in which it can be exploited and monetised.Huge amounts of money are being ploughed into AI ventures, many of them start-ups. But for every ambitious company founder, the ever-present fear is that someone else will get there first. Speed is of the essence – and tech sector workers are under pressure to work harder, and longer, to get results quickly.'Slackers are not my brothers'The 996 culture first came to the fore in China a decade ago. It was embraced by tech companies and start-ups at a time when the country was increasingly focused on transforming itself from the world's workshop for cheap goods into a leader in advanced technologies.It had some powerful advocates. They included Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of the retail behemoth Alibaba.com.\"I personally think that being able to work 996 is a huge blessing\", he wrote in one blog post for employees.\"It's not just entrepreneurs; most successful or ambitious artists, scientists, athletes, officials, and politicians work 996 or more\", he said in another. \"It's not because they have extraordinary perseverance, but because they are deeply passionate about their chosen careers\", he added.Getty ImagesJack Ma, former chairman of the Alibaba Group, called the 996 trend a \"blessing\"Another enthusiast was Richard Liu, founder of the retail behemoth JD.com, who at one point railed against what he saw as the country's declining work ethic. \"Slackers are not my brothers!\", he wrote in a controversial email to staff in 2019.But such an attitude prompted a backlash, including a wave of online complaints that companies were ignoring labour laws and failing to pay overtime, while forcing employees to work excessive hours. By 2021 this chorus of disapproval had become too loud for the authorities to ignore – and prompted a legal crackdown.In China, 996 has not disappeared, but its advocates have generally been a lot quieter. A notable exception was Baidu's one-time head of public relations, Qu Jing, who posted a series of videos on social media in 2024, aggressively defending a hard-working culture. Her brusque dismissal of employees' wellbeing, with the comment \"I'm not your mother, I only care about results\" provoked outrage. She later apologised, but it ultimately cost Qu her job.Yet the culture still has fans elsewhere. Last year, Narayana Murthy, the founder of Indian software giant Infosys, spoke admiringly about China's use of 996. He remarked in a TV interview that \"no individual, no community, no country has ever come up without hard work\".So why has the US tech industry chosen to embrace the trend? A key factor appears to have been the headlong rush to develop ways of using AI.\"It's mainly AI companies,\" explains Adrian Kinnersley, who runs recruitment businesses in Europe and North America. \"It's those that have some funding from venture capitalists, that are in a race to develop their products and get them out to market before someone else beats them to it. That's led them into the idea that, if you work longer hours, you win the race.\"One of those AI start-ups is run by Magnus Müller, a young German-born entrepreneur. He co-founded Browser-Use, a business that is developing tools to help AI applications interact with web browsers. He lives in a \"hacker-house\", a shared living and workspace, where he and his colleagues continually swap ideas, and believes working long hours is just a fact of life.Magnus MüllerMagnus Müller lives in a \"hacker house\" - a shared home and workspace where he and his colleagues constantly exchange ideas\"I think it's hard, what we're trying to build. I think it's the problems we're trying to solve, giving AI these extra capabilities. It's super hard, and very competitive, and most often the returns come when you just immerse yourself very deeply into a problem… then suddenly fascinating things happen.\"Browser-Use currently has just seven staff, but it is recruiting more. Müller says he is looking for people with the same kind of mentality as himself. Anyone who wants to work a 40-hour week, he says, is unlikely to fit in.\"We really look for people who are just addicted, who love what they're doing\", he emphasises. \"It's like gaming, OK? It's like you're addicted to gaming… for us, it doesn't really feel like work. We just do what we love.\"Others disagree. Deedy Das is a partner at Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm which has a near 50-year record of investing in technology businesses. He thinks the most common mistake young entrepreneurs make is insisting their employees work 996-style hours.Deedy DasDeedy Das says working long hours does not mean staff are being productive or working efficiently\"I think the thing young founders get wrong is they view hours worked in and of itself as necessary and sufficient to think of themselves as productive. And that's where the fallacy lies\", he explains. \"Forcing your employees to come in, and hustle, is a downstream artefact of such a mindset.\"He thinks such an approach can alienate those with families, as well as experienced older workers who \"can actually work far less and achieve much more because they know what they're doing\". He adds that continual long hours will lead to long-term burnout.However, he concedes that for company founders themselves, with skin in the game and the potential to become very wealthy if their business succeeds, different rules apply.\"Frankly, I would be shocked if a founder wasn't working 70-80 hours per week. I can personally say… if I'm investing in an early-stage founder, if they're not working 70-80 hours a week, it's probably not a great investment.\"Academic and author on workplace culture, Tamara Myles, says hustle culture is unsustainable, especially if people feel compelled to be working at all times. But she concedes there are grey areas.More from InDepth\"The nuance here is that a lot of these tech companies that are living this 996 culture are actually not hiding it, they're advertising it. They're selling it as a badge of honour, almost,\" she says.But that doesn't mean everyone who agrees to work 996 actually wants to, she argues. \"You might be staying because the job market is tough right now, or you might be here for a visa, and you depend on it. So there might be power dynamics at play.\"Health risksYet those who do choose to burn the midnight oil could end up paying a heavy price.Concerns over the health impact of working long hours are certainly not new. In Japan, a country with a long-established hard-work culture, where so-called salarymen have notoriously supported the post-war economy with utter dedication to their employers, there is even a word for it: Karōshi.It means death through overwork, and refers principally to strokes and heart attacks suffered by people working very long hours. Karōjisatsu, meanwhile, refers to people taking or attempting to take their own lives due to workplace stress.Both are recognised in Japanese law, and families are in theory eligible for compensation from a government scheme, although in practice proving a death derives from overwork can be difficult.More broadly, analysis published in 2021 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) concluded that long working hours - defined as more than 55 hours per week - had led to 745,000 deaths worldwide from stroke and heart disease in 2016.It concluded that working 55 hours or more a week increased the risk of dying of heart disease by 17% compared to working 35-40 hours, and raised the risk of a stroke by 35%.The productivity thresholdThen, there's productivity - broadly speaking the amount that actually gets done for every hour worked. Studies have shown that as hours go up, productivity initially increases - but once a threshold is reached it starts to decline again as physical and mental exhaustion sets in. The 'sweet spot' is widely recognised to be around 40 hours per week.As one recent study put it: \"At around 40h per five-day work week, workers seem to be able to maintain productivity fairly well, but when individuals exceed this threshold and engage in longer work hours, their job performance gradually weakens because of increased fatigue and underprivileged health conditions.\"In other words, once this threshold is reached, the extra output from every hour worked starts to decline. Even so, there will always be a temptation for companies to employ fewer people and get them to work for longer. This is because each extra employee comes at a cost: they have to be recruited, trained if necessary, and paid.Getty ImagesOffice workers in the 1980s in Japan, where a culture of dedication to the employer has its own word, KarōshiBut research suggests this approach can backfire. According to Michigan State University, productivity can fall so sharply that \"an employee working 70 hours per week has almost no difference in output than an employee working 50 hours per week\".This isn't a new concept. A century ago, Henry Ford set an example that other major industrialists would follow, when he cut working hours for staff in his car factories and adopted a 40-hour, five-day week.100-hour weeksNevertheless, there are those who believe that British companies today could take a leaf out of the US tech sector's book.For example, the co-founder and former CEO of BrewDog, James Watt, posted a widely-shared video in which he said: \"I think the whole concept of work-life balance was invented by people who hate the work they do. So if you love what you do, you don't need work life balance, you need work-life integration.\"He subsequently pointed to a study by academics at King's College London that showed people in the UK are among the least likely to believe work should always come first. He said it showed the UK to be \"one of the world's least work-oriented countries\".In a BBC documentary in 2022, Watt himself was accused of inappropriate behaviour and abuse of power in the workplace. He apologised to anyone who felt uncomfortable because of his behaviour but hit out at \"false rumours and misinformation\". BrewDog's new chief executive James Taylor said last year the business is  \"well past\" its previous controversies.HBOHBO's TV drama Industry, written by two former investment bankers, highlights the tough work culture at some financial institutionsFor some in the UK, talk of 996 culture could feel rather familiar. Jobs at large corporate law firms here pay high salaries, but many demand long hours in return. According to a survey carried out last year by the website Legal Cheek, it is not uncommon for average working days to be 12 hours or more.Investment banking - the wheeling and dealing side of the financial industry, which looks after mergers, acquisitions and stock market launches - is also notorious for long hours. Industry sources suggest 65 to 70 hours a week are relatively common, and can extend up to 100 hours when a major deal is being finalised.'Working smarter'?Is it legal here? UK law, under the working time regulations, states that most employees should not have to work more than 48 hours a week on average. But people can choose to opt out and work longer if they choose. So provided the employee gives their consent, 996 is allowed.However Ben Wilmott, head of public policy at the human resources professionals' association CIPD, thinks it is wrong to believe that long hours lead to better performance.\"There doesn't seem to be any correlation at all between working long hours and productivity\", he says. \"There is quite good evidence which shows there's a risk of ill health if you work long hours… there's a higher risk of stroke and heart disease.\"So I think the focus should be on working smarter rather than longer… improving management capability, technology adoption, adoption of AI to improve productivity, rather than a focus on increasing working hours.\"Universal Images GroupSeeing exhausted 'salarymen' fast asleep on the Tokyo underground is not an uncommon sightSome campaigners believe the UK could actually benefit from a reduction in working hours, and the adoption of a four-day week.They point to the results of a pilot project carried out in 2022, in which 61 organisations agreed to cut working hours for all staff for six months without any reduction in pay.It concluded that this significantly reduced stress and illness in the workforce, and helped companies retain staff, without losing productivity.Recruitment expert Adrian Kinnersley believes the current enthusiasm for 996 remains largely confined to the technology sector, and for a good reason.\"Whether you need to work 80 hours a week is debatable, but I think you would struggle in the current environment to compete with a relaxed 35-hour week culture,\" he says.For Browser-Use founder Magnus Müller meanwhile, the hours he and his peers work in Silicon Valley are really nothing remarkable.\"I'm from a tiny village in south Germany\", he says. \"The farmers there, they get up at five every day and work more than 12 hours per day, seven days a week. And they don't take any holidays, or maybe just two to three days when they can get someone to take care of their cows.\"So I think there are so many industries where people have so much harder jobs, and struggle so much harder, and work so much harder. I would say it's more like kindergarten, what we are doing compared to them.\"Top image credit: Getty.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "2 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analystISNAEbrahim Asgharzadeh (L), Azar Mansouri (C), and Mohsen Aminzadeh (R) are among those reported to have been arrested The head of Iran's main reformist coalition, Azar Mansouri, is among at least five prominent opposition figures reported to have been arrested in recent days.The move represents a widening of the regime's crackdown on dissent in response to the mass anti-government protests in January.Iranian human rights groups have said they have confirmed the killing of more than 6,000 protesters when security forces brutally put down the demonstrations - and they have suggested that the final figure could be much higher.Mansouri had called for the truth of what happened not to be covered up.In a statement last week, she said: \"We will not allow the blood of these dear ones to be consigned to oblivion or the truth to be lost in the dust.\"The other reformists who are reported to have been arrested include Hossein Karroubi. He is the son of Mehdi Karroubi, who stood as a reformist presidential candidate in a disputed election in 2009 that sparked mass protests and was subsequently held under house arrest for many years.The spokesman for the reformist coalition, Javad Emam, is also reported to have been detained, along with two other members, Ebrahim Asgharzadeh and Mohsen Aminzadeh.The prosecutors' office in Tehran has accused those arrested of \"targeting national unity\" and acting in league with the US and Israel.The campaign is a blow to President Masoud Pezeshkian, whose election in 2024 owed much to reformist support.He had expressed a more conciliatory view of the protesters, but appears to have been largely sidelined.Pezeshkian has also called for an inquiry into the protests, but the weakness of both his personal position and that of the presidency itself within the Iranian theocratic system appears to have been exposed once again.The crackdown on the prominent reformists sends a signal that more moderate voices are being further silenced, just days after Iranian and US officials held talks on trying to reach a deal on Iran's nuclear programme.Both sides have described the initial discussions in Oman as positive, although no concrete progress appears to have been made so far.In another indication that hardliners in Iran are still calling the shots, the semi-official Tasnim news agency says that Ali Larijani - a close adviser to the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council -  is to head to Oman for talks with Omani mediators on Tuesday.Negotiations with the Trump administration are said to be focusing on Iran's nuclear programme.That's led protesters inside Iran and their supporters outside to bemoan an apparent change of approach by the US from its initial stance of vowing a decisive response if the regime killed people participating in the demonstrations.The huge build-up of US military forces in the region remains in place, with its threat of an all-out attack on Iran.The Iranian regime is hoping to avert this through negotiations and possible concessions.But this latest move against what's left of the opposition is likely to make building any sense of trust with Washington more elusive.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBrandon DrenonUS boards oil tanker in Indian Ocean it tracked from CaribbeanThe US military boarded an oil tanker after tracking it for thousands of miles from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, the Department of Defense said.US officials said the ship - named Aquila II - was operating in defiance of a US \"quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean\".\"It ran, and we followed\", the department said on social media, adding that \"by land, air, or sea, our Armed Forces will find you and deliver justice\".Forces boarded and inspected the ship, officials said. At least seven oil tankers have been seized by the US since last year, as the Trump administration moves to control the supply of Venezuelan oil, the country's main economic resource. The US military seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from his home in Caracas during a raid in December and implemented a blockade of oil shipments. \"When the (defence department) says quarantine, we mean it,\" the department wrote on X. Nothing will stop the US military from enforcement, \"even in oceans halfway around the world\".A video that accompanied the social media post showed US servicemembers in military fatigue uniforms boarding the ship from a helicopter that hovered above. The defence department said it \"tracked and hunted\" the Aquila II from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, thousands of miles away. The US blockade has sharply curtailed Venezuelan oil exports, with only ships associated with Chevron and bound for the US operating as usual.Loadings fell roughly in half in January to about 400,000 barrels per day, Matt Smith, head of US analysis at Kpler, told the BBC last month.

    "body": "4 hours agoHafsa KhalilPA MediaMonday morning brought flooding to roads in Leicestershire, with more heavy rain forecast in other parts of the country More than 90 areas across the UK face flooding as heavy downpours drenched parts of the country on Monday, with forecasters warning there is \"no sign\" of a prolonged dry spell for at least a week.Heavy rain in south-west England and south Wales has also prompted a Met Office yellow warning, which will remain in place until the end of the day.The forecaster has warned that downpours are set to continue, with further weather warnings likely to come into force.Met Office rain warnings have also been issued for Tuesday and Wednesday in parts of eastern Scotland.A flood warning means flooding is expected, and an alert means flooding is possible.\"There will be some heavy rain and the rain is falling on saturated ground so further flooding is possible, particularly as we move into the evening,\" Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said on Monday.He added there was potential for \"surface water on the roads\", which could cause travel disruption.And the weather is \"set to remain unsettled throughout the remainder of the week\", Met Office operational meteorologist Simon Partridge said.He added there is expected to be \"further spells of wet and windy weather for many areas of the UK\", and \"currently no sign of any prolonged dry weather for the next seven to 10 days\".The Met Office previously confirmed that rain fell every day of 2026 in south-west England and south Wales, with both areas seeing 50% more rainfall than usual.The Environment Agency estimated at least 300 properties had been reported as flooded on Sunday, with about 16,200 more now having been protected.\"We urge people not to drive through flood-water - it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm of flowing water is enough to float your car,\" Sarah Cook, the agency's flood duty manager cautioned.PA MediaNew Road cricket ground in Worcester was submerged in floodwater after the river Severn burst its banksMonday to Wednesday will be cloudy with intermittent rain for most areas. The heaviest downpours once again will be focused around south-west England and south Wales where rain will fall on very saturated ground.From midweek onwards, a trend to colder and drier conditions is expected.Snow showers are likely over hills and mountains in Scotland and perhaps northern England for a time but most parts of the UK should see a return to drier weather and sunshine throughout Thursday and into Friday.Flood warnings are clustered in Devon and Hampshire, as well as between Gloucester and Worcester. However flood alerts are scattered across much of England, apart from the far north and East Anglia.Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service warned that flooding was \"imminent\" after \"heavy prolonged rainfall\" had caused local levels at the River Dene to rise.PA MediaFlooding caused by heavy rainfall also disrupted road travel in HampshireFloods Minister Emma Hardy said her thoughts were with those affected as she urged residents to follow local advice over the coming days.Northern Ireland has had its wettest January in 149 years, while County Down and Cornwall had the wettest January on record, according to the Met Office.February has also seen similarly intense rainfall.Provisional Met Office data shows some parts of the UK recorded more rainfall in the first five days of the month than it would normally expect over the course of the whole month.Aberdeenshire has been one of the wettest places of all, with Aboyne receiving more than 130% of its normal February rainfall in just five days.Last month, Storm Chandra brought flooding and travel disruption, and saw dozens of schools close.It was the third named storm to batter the UK so far this year, after Ingrid and Goretti.More on this story",

    "body": "3 hours agoSally Molyneux and David SutherlandThe walrus was spotted resting on rocks off the coast of Elie A walrus has been spotted off the coast of Fife in a \"rare sighting\".It was seen resting on rocks near Elie and was reported to the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR).The walrus was spotted on 31 January but the marine wildlife charity decided not to make the sighting public to protect the animal.Volunteers said it appeared to be healthy but were concerned that if its location was revealed it would have been disturbed by large crowds and drones - something that has happened in the past. The charity monitored the walrus for the rest of the day.It said the area remained quiet and the animal was not disturbed. The following morning it had left and has, so far, not been seen again.Sally Molyneux and David SutherlandThe walrus was monitored and had left by the next morning Emily Mayman, from the BDMRL, told BBC Scotland News: \"Walruses are rare but occasional visitors to the shores of the United Kingdom and wider Europe, with several individual animals recorded in recent years.\"These animals originate from the Arctic, and their presence further south may be linked to environmental changes affecting their natural habitat, including the ongoing reduction in sea ice associated with climate change.\"She added that young, male Atlantic walruses were most likely to roam and were capable of travelling very long distances.\"When they appear in the United Kingdom, minimising disturbance is exceptionally important, as these animals may already be fatigued from extended journeys and require prolonged periods of undisturbed rest to recover before moving onwards,\" she said.\"While not a native species to the UK, walruses are a nationally protected species under UK law, and disturbance of them is prohibited.\"In the past few years, three well-known individuals named Wally, Freya and Thor have all passed through the UK, hauling out in several locations.They remained for weeks, becoming significant public attractions requiring intensive management from the BDMLR, other organisations and authorities.\"Sadly, incidents of disturbance still occurred despite the presence of volunteers, police and statutory body staff as a small minority of people wilfully ignored cordons and direct advice on watching respectfully,\" a spokesperson said.Wally and Thor were later seen in Iceland. Freya moved on to Norway, where the authorities shot her. The BDMLR said the Norwegian authorities had failed to employ crowd control measures, instead claiming she was causing danger to people despite not displaying any aggressive behaviour.\"We hope this latest individual has moved northwards back towards the normal habitat for this species and is able to continue their journey safely without intervention,\" the spokesperson added.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentEPAKing Charles carried out engagements in Lancashire on MondayKing Charles has made his first intervention in the Epstein scandal, saying Buckingham Palace is ready to support the police as they consider allegations against his brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\"The King has made clear, in words and through unprecedented actions, his profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's conduct,\" a Palace spokesman said.\"While the specific claims in question are for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police we stand ready to support them as you would expect,\" he said.Thames Valley Police confirmed it is assessing whether there are grounds to investigate a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic, which reported Mountbatten-Windsor for suspected misconduct in public office and breach of official secrets.Emails from the recently-released batch of Epstein files appear to show the former prince passing on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam and confidential details of investment opportunities.After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then-special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.There were also details of investment opportunities in Afghanistan, described as \"confidential\", which appear to have been passed on to Epstein.Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.The Buckingham Palace statement says that the King and Queen's \"thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse\".Earlier on Monday the King had travelled to Clitheroe where a heckler shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew?\" The rest of the crowd booed the man putting the question.\"Their thoughts remain focused on the victims,\" said a Kensington Palace spokesperson, ahead of Prince William's visit to Saudi Arabia this week.Since the release of three million more documents related to Epstein, there has been growing pressure on Mountbatten-Windsor, with claims a second woman was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with him. Photographs appearing to show him kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground were also included in the latest batch of files. There has also been embarrassment for his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson. Emails signed \"Sarah\" show appeals for support and money from sex offender Epstein.Last week, Andrew was moved more quickly than expected from his home at Royal Lodge in Windsor to the King's private estate in Sandringham.In October 2025, after a previous wave of revelations about his links to Epstein, Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his titles as a prince and a duke. Andrew has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct.",

    "body": "6 hours agoGiancarlo RinaldiBBC Scotland NewsPhil WilkinsonHamlet was relocated to southern Scotland from the Outer HebridesPolice have appealed for information after a four-year-old golden eagle was shot in the south of Scotland.The bird was discovered injured by a gamekeeper on an estate in Stanhope, near Tweedsmuir, on 15 January.The eagle - which was wearing a satellite tracking device - had relocated from the Outer Hebrides to the area in 2023 as part of project to boost numbers in the area.The bird, called Hamlet, was examined by a vet, who confirmed shotgun pellet injuries to his wing. He received treatment and has since been returned to the wild.Scottish SPCAExaminations confirmed that the bird had been shotFollowing a review of tracking data, and consultation with experts, it is believed Hamlet was shot during the first week of January.It is thought he was injured in an area between Stanhope and Glenbreck off the A701 Broughton to Moffat road.Det Sgt David Lynn said: \"It is extremely disappointing that we are investigating another golden eagle persecution crime.\"Very few people would have the means, opportunity and motive to commit this crime and I would urge anyone with any information to contact us so we can identify whoever is responsible for shooting Hamlet.\"Police are working with the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit and anyone with information has been asked to come forward.Hamlet was relocated to the area as part of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP) which has boosted bird numbers in the area.Phil WilkinsonThe bird has been release back into the wildDumfriesshire farmer Michael Clarke - who chairs Restoring Upland Nature, the new home of the SSGEP - said it was \"incredibly relieved\" the eagle was fit to fly following his \"traumatic shooting\" and thanked the Scottish SPCA for its help.\"We are angry, upset and disappointed that Hamlet was injured at the hands of an individual or individuals who consider themselves above the law,\" he said.\"Whoever committed this deplorable wildlife crime should hang their heads in shame.\"Ross Ewing, director of moorland and strategic projects at Scottish Land and Estates, praised the swift action of gamekeepers who reported the injured bird promptly.Conor Kelly, one of the gamekeepers involved in recovering Hamlet, added that he hoped the bird could make a \"full recovery\".\"Golden eagles are a regular presence on our estate and across the region, and providing the right habitat for them to thrive is an important part of our work,\" he said.\"Incidents like this are concerning, and we would encourage anyone with information to assist the police with their inquiries.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterGetty ImagesFriends has been available to watch on Netflix in the UK since 2018HBO Max will join the UK's streaming wars with a little help from its Friends - and Euphoria and Harry Potter - after the service confirmed its launch plans.A launch date of 26 March has been announced for HBO Max in the UK and Ireland, with monthly plans ranging from £4.99 up to £30.99 including TNT Sports.The service will try to persuade viewers to sign up by offering shows like Friends - which has been in streaming limbo since leaving Netflix in the UK at the end of 2025 - as well as DC shows like the forthcoming Lanterns, based on the Green Lantern characters.It will also be the home of the forthcoming Harry Potter TV series, and will allow UK viewers to finally watch hit US medical drama The Pitt.The Pitt won best drama at the Emmys and Golden Globes, and will become available almost 15 months after it launched in the US.Warner Bros DiscoveryNoah Wyle won an Emmy last year for best drama actor for The PittHBO Max will attempt to convince viewers to sign up for another subscription, doing battle with the likes of Netflix, Disney+ and Apple TV.It arrives with the promise of some heavyweight titles. They will include Lanterns this summer and the Harry Potter TV show next year.The third season of Euphoria is due to be released in April, and the third season of House of the Dragon is expected to be available later this year.Existing shows in the catalogue will include Succession, The Sopranos and Game of Thrones.HBO shows have previously been available in the UK through Sky and its streaming service Now. Sky customers will keep programmes that began before the end of 2025, but new original HBO-made programmes will be exclusive to HBO Max.An agreement between the two companies means a membership bundle including both Now and HBO Max will be available, which all existing Now Entertainment subscribers will automatically be moved to.Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis, said there was \"no way that Max could have successfully launched here without a deal with Sky\", and that the agreement means HBO Max will be in more than 10 million households from launch.\"All the big continuing shows (House of the Dragon, Last of Us, White Lotus) will continue to be on Sky, so Max would be relying completely on new shows, especially Harry Potter, to grow a business from scratch,\" he said.\"On the content side, it's worth noting that HBO's hit rate is quite phenomenal - they don't release a lot but always have a few current shows with considerable cultural cut-through.\"HBO Max will also offer films including Superman, Oscar hopefuls One Battle After Another and Sinners, and A Minecraft Movie; and will be the streaming home of TNT Sports, which has rights including the Premier League, FA Cup, Prem rugby, UFC and Grand Slam tennis.HBO Max's long-term future is uncertain, though. Its launch comes as Netflix pursues a deal for the streaming and film divisions of HBO Max's parent company Warner Bros Discovery (WBD).A successful purchase would raise the prospect of HBO Max and Netflix combining as a single streaming service.\"Of course, the questions around WBD's future ownership makes the future of the service anyone's guess,\" Harrington said.Analyst Mike Proulx of Forrester Research said: \"If Netflix ends up making it through regulatory hurdles, both in the US and the UK, then it obviously will own HBO Max, and it is unclear as to the fate of that streaming service.\"Will it remain a separate, standalone streaming service that is operated by Netflix, similar to what Disney does with Hulu? Or will Netflix combine the IP of HBO Max into one mega Netflix streaming service? We don't yet know.\"",

The house is on the market for £210,000, with one of the three bedrooms best known for being Uncle Bryn's state-of-the-art gym.Chris Davies Estate AgentsThe three-bedroom house on Trinity Street is up for sale for £210,000Located on Trinity Street, Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, the house is opposite Gwen's where Bryn would frequently pop in for an omelette and the occasional mint Baileys.It is also in this house where Bryn famously \"surfed the world wide web\" to give Gavin directions from Barry to Essex in the first series.As well as his family, Bryn entertained Gavin's mates with mini burgers and Subbuteo before a big night out in Cardiff, where thankfully no-one mentioned the fishing trip. Bryn and his house also played a big part in the 2019 Christmas special as the host and head chef of the mammoth dinner for more than 13 people. Chris Davies Estate AgentsThe living room where Christmas dinner was hosted in the 2019 specialA virtual tour of the property has been posted to social media by Chris Davies Estate Agents.Branch manager Sarah Lawrence said: \"There's a lot of potential with this property.\"We did kind of put the asking price up ever so slightly because it's such a desirable kind of famous home, but it's not by much at all as we still wanted to keep it really realistic.\"We just kind of priced it based on comparable from the area.\"The agents said the series had helped \"tremendously\" to bring tourists to the area, with a Dave's Coaches bus tour taking visitors to filming locations across the town. Toffee International Ltd.The house on Trinity Street is also a stop on the unofficial Dave's Coaches bus tour, based on the company owned by Dave CoachesAcross the street, Lisa Molloy and her husband Chris purchased Doris's house in November 2025, as well as some of the furniture that was in the house when Gavin and Stacey themselves lived there.She said: \"We're massive fans and we were fortunate enough to be able to buy the property and feel very privileged and honoured to own it.\"You still can't believe the actors that have been in the property.\"Compared with Doris's house, Lawrence says the house is in need of modernisation, but is a good investment opportunity for buyers.Unfortunately, Uncle Bryn's state-of-the-art gym equipment is not included.

    "body": "3 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGetty ImagesDiscord will soon require all users globally to verify their age with a face scan or by uploading a form of ID if they want to access adult content.The online chat service, which allows people to create and join groups based on their interests, says it has more than 200 million monthly users.Its new safety measures are designed to protect people by placing everyone into a teen-appropriate experience \"by default\".Discord already makes some users in the UK and Australia verify their age to comply with online safety laws - but it will roll out the age checks to all users worldwide from early March.\"Nowhere is our safety work more important than when it comes to teen users,\" said Discord policy head Savannah Badalich.\"Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord's existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility.\"The platform says the new default settings will restrict what people can see and how they can communicate, with only those who prove they are an adult able to access age-restricted communities and unblur material marked as sensitive.Users will also not be able to see direct messages sent to them from someone they do not know unless they complete Discord's age checks.\"The sentiment behind creating a safer community for all social media users is a positive move,\" said Drew Benvie, head of social media consultancy Battenhall.But he told the BBC putting the new system into place could be \"fraught with issues\" considering the platform has millions of communities.\"Discord could lose users if its implementation of age verification backfires, but it could equally attract more new users who will be drawn to its new standards for online safety by design,\" he said.Safety concernsUsers can either upload a photo of their ID to confirm their age or take a video selfie, where AI will be used to estimate their facial age.Discord said information used for age checks will not be stored by the platform or the verification company.It said face scans would not be collected, and ID uploads would be deleted after the verification is complete.Privacy campaigners have previously warned such methods could pose a risk to people's privacy.Discord faced criticism in October after official ID photos of around 70,000 users were potentially leaked after a firm which helped it verify ages was hacked.With its new measures - which include a teen advisory council - Discord is also echoing Meta's Facebook and Instagram, TikTok and Roblox.\"While forced age verification and safe content by default could be a combination of changes that we see other social networks adopt, I expect they will all be watching how Discord's implementation lands with its users,\" Benvie said.Social platforms have rolled out a slew of measures to protect teens and children on their sites in recent years after facing increased pressure from lawmakers.Discord's boss Jason Citron was grilled about his company's child safety measures at a fiery US Senate hearing in 2024, alongside alongside Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Snap boss Evan Spiegler and TikTok's chief Shou Chew.",

    "body": "Businesses face extinction unless they protect nature, major report warns8 hours agoHelen Briggs,Environment correspondentandGwyndaf Hughes,Science videographerWWTExperts are calling for urgent action to restore the natural systems that keep the economy runningBusinesses risk extinction themselves unless they protect and restore the natural world, scientists across the globe are warning.A major new report sets out how companies can shift from harmful approaches to ones that help restore nature. It comes amid major concerns over UK nature loss.The assessment, by Ipbes (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services), is based on contributions from leading scientists and approved by 150 governments.Businesses can either lead the way or \"ultimately risk extinction... both of species in nature, but potentially also their own\",  said co-author Matt Jones, from the UN World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge.GettyMore companies are getting involved in local projects, such as community tree plantingIpbes found that all businesses, even those seemingly far-removed from it, rely on the services nature provides for free, from clean water to fertile soils.Co-chair,  Prof Stephen Polasky, said the loss of biodiversity is among the most serious threats to business, \"yet the twisted reality is that it often seems more profitable to businesses to degrade biodiversity than to protect it\". WWTA herd of cattle stands near a muddy channel cutting through coastal wetlands at Steart, SomersetCommenting on the report, Leigh Morris, International Director of the consortium of UK wildlife charities, The Wildlife Trusts, said we need \"clear metrics and toolkits so businesses can get their own houses in order on biodiversity\". For many UK businesses, engaging with nature protection has gone from \"a nice-to-do\" to a \"must-do\", he added.One example of how companies are working hand-in-hand with nature is at Steart Marshes in Somerset.Farmers and conservationists are managing land in ways that support both wildlife and agriculture. Cattle are grazed across the marshes to create healthy habitats for birds, insects and plants.Local farmer, Andy Darch, said the animals are helping in conservation.\"They are eating different types of grasses and trampling areas that are important for wildlife,\" he said. \"And because they are eating such a variety of plants, it produces a really high-quality beef at the end of the day.\"WWTSteart Marshes – one of the UK's largest new wetland reserves - creates habitat for wildlife and agricultureSteart Marshes also demonstrates how restoring nature can benefit local communities. Newly engineered flood banks protect nearby villages from rising waters, while the wetlands help absorb carbon and reduce pollution.Alys Laver, from the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, which runs the nature reserve, said farming and conservation are working hand-in-hand.\"Not only are those flood banks an engineering marvel, they're providing flood protection for the local villages,\" she says.\"On the back of that we're getting a product the farmers can utilise. So it's not a loss of farming it's just a change.\"WWTA flock of wigeon take flight over wet grassland at Steart marshesThe report pointed to everyday incentives that are driving nature's decline:Large subsidies that damage biodiversity rather than repair it, fuelled by lobbying from businesses and trade associationsConfusion and a lack of meaningful action on how businesses measure their impacts and reliance on nature.It said better stewardship of nature is not a distant environmental issue but a core challenge for every boardroom.Yet, less than 1% of publicly reporting companies mention their impacts on biodiversity in their reports.",

From the Epstein Files to the cost of living, Greene has been vocal in her criticism of the current administration.  It’s notable because MTG has been one of Trump’s most loyal allies and a powerful leader of the MAGA movement, and also because her interventions have been influential. \nSarah, Anthony and Marianna look back at Marjorie Taylor Greene’s rise and why she has been such an influential figure within Donald Trump’s MAGA base. \nAnd, Anthony’s in Tennessee for a special election where a House seat is being contested. We assess the Democratic party’s chances of winning this traditional Republican seat.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

As a result, no-one will be eliminated in a dance-off on this week's show, with the votes being carried over. La Voix is the alter ego of Chris Dennis, who said ahead of the series that he wanted viewers to get to know the man behind the drag act.The character became a fan favourite last year while finishing as a finalist on RuPaul's Drag Race UK.Exact details of the injury were not revealed. \"My spirit wanted to keep dancing but my foot has other ideas,\" La Voix said in her Instagram post. She added: \"Due to an injury, I've been advised that I'm unable to perform.\"In recent weeks, Strictly viewers have seen La Voix and Škorjanec jive, waltz and foxtrot around the Strictly dancefloor.Last month, actor and Neighbours star Stefan Dennis withdrew from Strictly because of injury while in September, TV personality Dani Dyer pulled out before the show got under way after breaking her ankle. She was replaced by actress Amber Davies.",

    "body": "14 minutes agoA majority of Sunday's papers feature comments from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer about US politicians wanting to question Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor over his links to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Sir Keir's suggestion that Andrew should give evidence echoes one he made earlier this month, it nonetheless \"adds to pressure on the disgraced royal\", Sunday People reports.  The Sun on Sunday's story adds that Metropolitan Police officers are searching for emails related to claims Andrew asked royal protection officers to find information on Virginia Giuffre. The prominent accuser of Epstein alleged Andrew had sex with her as a teenager - something the former prince denied. Sir Keir has \"heaped pressure\" on Andrew to testify in the US, is the Daily Mail's assessment. Sir Keir - who was asked about the former prince while attending the G20 summit - told reporters it was \"a decision for him\". But, he added, \"my general position is if you have relevant information you should be prepared to share it\". The prime minister's comments about Andrew also feature on the front page of the Sunday Times, but the paper leads with preparations by the chancellor to \"end the two-child benefit cap\" in her upcoming Budget. Writing in the paper, Rachel Reeves says \"fiscal restraint is a Labour value and necessary to curb inflation\". An exclusive interview with Reeves is the lead for the Sunday Mirror, in which she says \"helping families is her top priority\" at Wednesday's Budget. In the interview, Reeves promises to \"tackle the cost-of-living crisis\", \"cut NHS waiting lists\" and \"reduce the national debt\". Green Party leader Zack Polanski's \"hopes for Britain\" lead this week's Observer. Polanski tells the paper in his vision for a \"green land\", the UK would \"leave Nato\", \"tax the rich\" and \"welcome migrants\". The Sunday Telegraph reports on US President Donald Trump saying a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, after Ukrainian allies voiced concerns over proposals. A large image, alongside the article, shows Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife Olena outside a cathedral in the Ukrainian capital.In other news, defence chiefs are considering a greater use of \"fat jabs\" in the military, the Sunday Express reports. Fighter pilots face strict weight limits so they can safely eject from aircraft - and obesity is becoming \"common\", according to RAF medical professionals. The Daily Star's main story is about crime - specifically, the number of people sent to jail for shoplifting being \"at its highest level in years\". \"More must be done to end the epidemic\", according to experts cited in the paper, which notes that more than 12,000 thieves were jailed last year. Finally, the Independent reports that the prime minister backs the paper's campaign to raise money for the SafeCall service to help missing children. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "23 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesEvery winter, the search for the secret to staying well seems to intensify. Supermarket shelves fill with \"immune-boosting\" shots, cold water swimming groups grow and social media becomes crowded with tips on how to fend off seasonal bugs. But with so many remedies promising to keep colds and flu at bay, how much of it actually works and is it even possible to boost your immune system in the first place?Cold water swimming: A buzz, not a boostGetty ImagesCold water swimming has surged in popularity, with some enthusiasts convinced it keeps winter illnesses at bay.Immunologist professor Eleanor Riley tells BBC Radio 4's Inside Health podcast that the post-swim \"high\" is real, but it's driven by adrenaline and endorphins.\"If you take a blood sample before and after a cold swim, white blood cell levels do rise,\" she explains. \"But that's because the body thinks an infection might be coming, so cells move into the bloodstream. \"Within hours the levels go back to normal so your body hasn't created any more white blood cells.\" Professor Riley adds that part of the benefit of cold water swimming comes from building a social connection. Feeling \"brighter, more alert and more connected\" has real physiological effects.Professor John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist, says the benefits are mostly indirect and much of what makes people feel healthier in winter may come down to stress.\"It reduces stress because you're outdoors with nice people in nice places. But you could get the same from dancing, singing or going for a run.\"Being in nature can lower your blood pressure and stress hormones that can dampen immune responses. GP Dr Margaret McCartney explains that moderate exercise does show evidence of reducing viral infections, but that could be any form of exercise, not just cold water swimming. Kombucha: Interesting but little evidenceGetty ImagesMany people turn to fermented drinks like kombucha which promises to boost the microbiome and, by extension, the immune system.But Dr McCartney remains cautious. \"There are lots of theories about why a diverse microbiome is good, but we don't have strong enough real-world evidence to recommend kombucha to patients.\"Professor Tregoning adds that while it's true that the microbiome changes during infections, it usually returns to its previous state afterwards.Dr McCartney says while drinks like kombucha present \"interesting ideas about the role of the microbiome\", there isn't a clear link with how it can help boost your immune system. Supplements: Just expensive urineGetty ImagesVitamin C has long been sold as a winter essential, but according to Dr McCartney, the evidence simply isn't strong enough to recommend it when it comes to fighting off colds. She says the same goes for multi-vitamins which do very little beyond giving you \"expensive urine\". However, Vitamin D is slightly different as \"there's theoretical evidence of a small decrease in respiratory infections\". But, she explains that not everyone will see a benefit if they take it and it's only people \"with low vitamin D and pre-existing respiratory diseases\" who will likely benefit. Many people in the UK remain deficient in Vitamin D and Professor Tregoning suggests that winter sunlight and getting outdoors can help. Vaccinations: The only boost that worksGetty ImagesThe likes of turmeric shots, ginger drinks and fancy nasal sprays do nothing to boost your immune system, according to Dr McCartney.Professor Tregoning says that a nasal spray can help with a blocked nose but all you need is a simple saline spray which is just salt and water. \"The solution can dilute the blocked nose, stimulate turnover of mucus and relieve inflammation.\" All three experts agree that ultimately only one intervention can strengthen the immune system and that's vaccination.Professor Riley recommends the flu jab which takes from seven to 10 days after the jab to take effect.While you can't boost your immune system in the dramatic way winter wellness trends often promise, the experts advise supporting it by avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, finding a regular sleep routine and doing any activity that helps reduce stress. Dr McCartney says you can also reduce your risk of colds by being in well ventilated spaces and washing your hands regularly and properly.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKaty AustinTransport correspondent Rail fares in England next year are to be frozen for the first time in 30 years, the government has announced.The freeze until March 2027 will apply to regulated fares, which includes season tickets and off-peak returns.The most recent fare rise, in March 2025, was 4.6%.Rail fares traditionally have gone up in January, based on the July rate of the retail price index (RPI) + 1% -  although this formula has not always been followed.The announcement comes days before the chancellor sets out the government's financial plans in the Budget, amid a focus on the cost of living.  The government also said the move is intended to \"directly limit inflation\" by holding down \"a major component of everyday costs\".Since 2021, the annual increase has come in March instead of January.A government source acknowledged it was possible unregulated fares would still rise, but insisted they usually followed regulated fares.Unregulated fares increased by 5.5% in the year to March 2025, 1.1% above regulated fares - with a total increase in rail fares of 5.1% in that period. The Rail Delivery Group, a representative body made up of the UK's rail operators, said the freeze would be \"good news for customers\".\"We want our railways to thrive, that's why we're committed to working with government to ensure upcoming railway reforms deliver real benefits for customers,\" a spokesperson said. Since 1996, the government has regulated some train fares following the privatisation of British Rail. The freeze marks the first point since then that fares will have been frozen, although there have been periods where price increases were below RPI, and a dip in prices following the financial crash in 2010. About 45% of rail fares are regulated by the government in England, Wales and Scotland - but the freeze only relates to travel in England. The announcement also only applies to services run by England-based train operating companies.Regulated fares include season tickets covering most commuter routes, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and flexible tickets for travel in and around major cities.Train operators are free to set prices for unregulated fares, but they typically rise by similar amounts.The government estimates that the move will save commuters on more expensive routes more than £300.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the freeze was being put in place to help ease cost of living pressures, and make \"travelling to work, school or to visit friends and family that bit easier\".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said it was part of \"wider plans to rebuild Great British Railways\".Great British Railways is a public body which is in the process of being set up, and is part of the government's plans to bring parts of the railway system into public ownership. The government has said it will take over the running and management of the tracks and trains, \"ending years of fragmentation, driving up standards for passengers, and making journey easier and better value for money\".The government has said part of its plans for the new body is to \"gradually move away from annual blanket increases\".Labour said passengers had faced \"relentless\" fare increases every year under the previous Tory government. However, shadow transport secretary Richard Holden said: \"In government, the Conservatives kept fares on the right track with below-inflation rises and consistently called for no further hikes to protect hard-working commuters.\"",

    "body": "13 hours agoHolly Wallis and Patrick JacksonGetty ImagesThe publisher of the Daily Mail has agreed to buy the Daily and Sunday Telegraph for £500m.The Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) said it had entered a period of discussion with RedBird IMI, which is a joint venture between the United Arab Emirates and the US private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners. RedBird Capital's own bid for control of the Telegraph collapsed last week.The deal needs to be signed off by Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy.  A spokesperson said Nandy would \"review any new buyer acquiring the Telegraph in line with the public interest and foreign state influence media mergers regimes\".The Telegraph has been in limbo for over two years, when the RedBird IMI consortium paid off the debts of the Telegraph's previous owners, the Barclay family, hoping to take eventual ownership of the newspapers.Dame Caroline Dineage, chair of the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committe, said she was \"keen to see a resolution to the uncertainty that's hampered the Telegraph for years\", while \"not understating the need for media plurality\".\"This situation has been unsustainable for the business and unsettling for staff so I hope the government set out its position early next week,\" she added.\"The Committee have largely stayed out of the discussion to date, because takeovers are quasi judicial in terms of the Government's role.\"DMGT and RedBird IMI have said they expect the deal to be finalised quickly.DMGT chairman Lord Rothermere said he had \"long admired the Daily Telegraph\" and the deal would give \"much-needed certainty and confidence\" to its employees.He said: \"The Daily Telegraph is Britain's largest and best quality broadsheet newspaper and I have grown up respecting it. It has a remarkable history and has played a vital role in shaping Britain's national debate over many decades.\"He added: \"Chris Evans is an excellent editor and we intend to give him the resources to invest in the newsroom. Under our ownership, the Daily Telegraph will become a global brand, just as the Daily Mail has.\"The purchase would see the Telegraph become part of DMGT's portfolio of media organisations, which includes the i Paper, Metro and New Scientist, along with the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday papers.The group said the Telegraph would remain editorially independent from DMGT's other titles.It said its case for having the deal approved was \"compelling\" and would comply with UK regulations, as there would be no foreign state investment or capital in the funding structure.A spokesman for RedBird IMI said: \"DMGT and RedBird IMI have worked swiftly to reach the agreement announced today, which will shortly be submitted to the secretary of state.\"Elsewhere, Chris Fox, Liberal Democrat Lords' spokesperson for business, said: \"A move towards a potential deal to end the uncertainty that has plagued the Telegraph's future should certainly be considered. \"But, of course as Liberals, we are sceptical about concentrating so much agenda-setting power in the hands of so few.\"He urged the competitions' regulator to \"rigorously examine\" the terms of the agreement to \"ensure we don't get an even more unbalanced media market for consumers and competitors\".RedBird Capital pulled out of a deal to buy the Telegraph last week.It had a previous attempt to buy the group rebuffed by politicians as it was majority-funded by Abu Dhabi's IMI group - which is owned in turn by the Abu Dhabi royal family.A law change meant that foreign sovereign wealth funds could take a maximum stake of 15% in newspapers or periodicals.Its more recent bid complied with that rule, but it was understood that the government intended to submit the deal to regulatory review.Sources close to RedBird insisted that they were confident that the bid would have passed a government review process, but cited negative articles toward the bid from the current Telegraph newsroom as a factor in shelving their interest.RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale had planned to expand the Telegraph's reach and subscriber base in the US, believing there to be a gap in the market.Among other investments, RedBird owns the Italian football team AC Milan.",

    "body": "14 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and media editorShumeet Banerji is not a household name. In the three years, 10 months and 14 days that he spent on the BBC board, Banerji kept his thoughts on BBC matters firmly out of the public domain.Now he is making headlines. His resignation is the latest blow to the corporation, and it looks timed to add to the pressure.Banerji's role on the board was due to end on 31 December anyway but he has instead resigned early, three days before other board members are due to face a committee of MPs - and nearly two weeks after the BBC lost its director general and its CEO of news.The resignation, fairly or not, looks like a direct criticism of the BBC's chair Samir Shah.Banerji, according to an insider, was known to be angry that Shah was - in his view - weak in not challenging a number of other board members and their assertion about systemic bias at BBC News.In this characterisation, the four political appointees to the board - Shah is the fifth - have banded together around the view that the BBC too often suffers from liberal groupthink, and the chair has been unable, or unwilling, to steer his board to a place of real consensus.In the end, after all the drama of the past few weeks - the leaked memo, the resignations, the apology over the Panorama edit and the threat of a defamation suit by Donald Trump - it boils down to one simple question. Is BBC News institutionally biased?Deborah Turness and Tim Davie reject that. So does Shah. While acknowledging mistakes have been made, he told me \"the BBC News DNA and culture is to be impartial, to provide the best news we can and the most trustworthy news we can\".BBC News remains the most trusted source of news in the UK.But if some members of the board believe that the BBC does suffer from systemic bias, and others do not, where does this end?A senior TV executive told me Shah inherited \"a house divided but this board is melting down, it's very sad\". They added: \"It's a leadership issue.\"When I interviewed him after the resignations of Davie and Turness, Shah told me the board had \"a diversity of views, as there are in the public, as there are in the country itself… I want robust conversations, I want discussion\".But Banerji has now claimed he was not consulted over the events that led to those departures. If true, it will feed into the narrative advanced in some quarters that what has happened has been a coup by some members of the board. Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called on the government to remove Sir Robbie Gibb, an ex-BBC executive and former Downing Street director of communications to Theresa May, from the board.Shah told me the notion of a coup was \"fanciful\". He added that \"it's unfair and it's disrespectful to the members of the board to say that because they feel strongly about something, that somehow it's to do with their history\".But Sir Craig Oliver, former editor of the BBC's Six o'clock and Ten o'clock News, who was later director of communications at Number 10 under David Cameron, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"the stakes were already high for Samir Shah and they just got even higher\".He added that \"all eyes are going to be on Samir Shah on Monday\". \"The questions I think he's going to really have to answer are, is it true that months ago you chaired a BBC meeting where the Panorama issue was on the table and you decided to take no action? And if so why - particularly after what you've now said - did you not take action then?\"And I think that the next question that he's really going to have face is, when Michael Prescott's report was leaked to the Telegraph, why did you preside over such a long time of the BBC not coming out, particularly when the executive wanted to get out and cauterize the issue as cleanly as possible?\"In the last few days, prior to Banerji's resignation, I spoke to insiders at the BBC as well as people outside, who told me that Shah will remain as chair, whatever his perceived shortcomings. As one person put it to me, \"you can't have the DG, the CEO of News and the chair all resign\".Does Banerji's resignation shift the dial on his ability to continue in the role? It certainly makes Shah's appearance along with fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson in front of the Culture Media and Sport Committee on Monday even more critical.MPs on that committee voiced their reservations about whether he was qualified for the job when he was appointed as chair last year. He will need to demonstrate to those MPs, the industry, BBC audiences and staff at the corporation who will be watching, that he has the capabilities and support needed to steer the BBC through these turbulent times.",

    "body": "4 hours agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, Istanbul and Jon Donnison,correspondent, JerusalemAt least 22 Palestinians have been killed in a series of Israeli air strikes across northern and central Gaza, Hamas medical and civil defence officials have said.They said five sites had been hit, including residential homes. A senior Hamas commander was among the dead, according to local sources.The Israeli military said it had struck targets in Gaza in response to an incident earlier on Saturday, when it said an \"armed terrorist\" had fired at soldiers after crossing the Strip's so-called \"yellow line\" designating areas under full Israeli control. Hamas denied this.Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire deal agreed on six weeks ago.More than 310 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since the ceasefire came into force, according to Gaza's health ministry.The territory's civil defence said Saturday's strikes by Israel targeted Gaza City in the north, as well as Deir al-Balah and Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.The Hamas officials said five people had been killed at the Abbas junction in the densely populated Rimal area of Gaza City. Witnesses said an Israeli strike set a car on fire.In addition, three people were killed near a mosque in Deir al-Balah, the officials said.Two houses were targeted in Israeli strikes in Nuseirat, they added, with three killed after the home of the Abu Amouneh family was hit. Seven others were killed in another strike targeting the house of the Abu Shawish family.Three more people were killed later on Saturday when a house in western Gaza City was hit, officials reported.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a later statement: \"Today, Hamas violated the ceasefire again, sending a terrorist into Israel held territory to attack IDF soldiers. In response, Israel eliminated five senior Hamas terrorists.\"The statement also called on mediators to \"insist that Hamas fulfil its side of the ceasefire\".Following the strikes, Hamas said the army's westward push of the yellow line and continued bombardment of eastern Gaza amounted to a \"blatant breach\" of the agreement.The group called on mediators and the US to intervene urgently, warning that Israel was attempting to impose \"new facts on the ground\" and undermine the ceasefire.The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "14 hours agoAlex Smith, Chris Ewokor,BBC Africa, in Abuja, and Elettra NeysmithBBCSt Mary's School, in Niger state, was attacked in the early hours of Friday morningMore than 300 children and staff are now thought to have been kidnapped by gunmen from a Catholic school in central Nigeria, making it one of the worst mass abductions the country has seen.The Christian Association of Nigeria said 303 students and 12 teachers were taken from on St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state - substantially more than previously estimated.It said the figures have been revised upwards \"after a verification exercise\".The kidnapping comes amid a surge of attacks by armed groups. The revised number of people taken surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014.Local police said armed men stormed the school at around 02:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Friday morning, abducting students who were staying there.Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... it took everybody by surprise.\"One distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13, had been kidnapped, adding: \"I just want them to come home.\"Police said that security agencies were \"combing the forests with a view to rescue the abducted students\".It was initially reported that 215 pupils had been taken - but that figure has since been revised upwards. The new number is believed to be almost half of the school's student population, the news agency AFP reports.Authorities in Niger state said the school had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks.They said in a statement the move exposed pupils and staff to \"avoidable risk\". The school has not commented on that claim.The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs - but this has had little effect.Friday's mass abduction was the third such attack in the country in a week.On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in neighbouring Kebbi state.A church was also attacked further south, in Kwara state, with two people killed and 38 others abducted.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has postponed his foreign trips - including to this weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address the security concerns.The central government has ordered more than 40 federal colleges to close and public schools in some states have been shut.But the rising insecurity is fuelling anger as well as fear in Nigeria, with citizens demanding stronger action to protect children and communities.The mass abduction follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria - an allegation dismissed by the Nigerian government.For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians in Nigeria.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".In the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority Muslim north of the country.In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.The militant Islamist group Boko Haram took 276 girls from their school in the town of Chibok 2014.The incident courted international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.Many have since either escaped or been freed - but as many as 100 still remain missing.",

    "body": "3 days agoHannah KarpelBBC NewsBBC\"It feels like I am constantly setting myself up for failure or disappointment,\" says AswanPerfectionism has a great reputation. It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.For many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.But what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.Even in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".It's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on the BBC Sounds podcast Complex with Kimberley Wilson, she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".That fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.Perfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".Breaking the cycleWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.Still, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.It starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.Was the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.Over the years, Dayna says she has learned to quiet her harsh inner criticFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\", it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna. \"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"At times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.Looking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"Not all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.But it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.Working through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says.",

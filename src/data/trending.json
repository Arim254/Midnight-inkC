    "body": "11 hours agoTabby WilsonLuca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoAn Italian mayor has apologised to the family of opera star Luciano Pavarotti after the town of Pesaro encased a statue honouring the late singer within a Christmas ice rink. The singer's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani, told local media that she was \"angry and upset\" at what she called the decision to \"ridicule\" her late husband. The temporary ice rink was constructed in the centre of the town's piazza, leaving Pavrotti's statue knee-deep in ice and surrounded by perspex walls. In response, Mayor Andrea Biancani said that he didn't mean to offend anyone, and admitted that his council had \"made a mistake\".Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoBefore it was opened on 29 November, Biancani posted a doctored image of Pavarotti's statue playing ice hockey with the hashtag #DaiUnCinqueAPavarotti, which translates to \"Give a high-five to Pavarotti\".\"I didn't expect a town would allow this treatment of the memory and the image of a person who made Italy great around the world,\" Ms Mantovani told local outlet Il Resto del Carlino. She accused the council of making a \"poorly executed, absurd decision\". The life-size bronze statue was officially unveiled in Pesaro in April 2024, with Ms Mantovani and the couple's daughter, Alice, in attendance. The couple often holidayed in Pesaro, where Pavarotti had a villa and was an honorary citizen.Alamy/Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoOpera star Luciano Pavarotti's statue seen earlier in the year in the town of Pesaro (left), and in November, surrounded by an ice rink (right).Biancini told Il Resto del Carlino, which nicknamed the incident \"Pavarotti on Ice\", that when plans for the ice rink were initially presented to him, he was assured that the Pavarotti statue would not be touched and that it was only later that he found out designers had been forced to alter their construction. He said it would not be possible to dismantle the rink or move the statue at this late stage, but insisted that it would \"not happen again\".Pavarotti was an Italian tenor, and is widely known as one of the most successful opera stars of all time.His performances in the Three Tenors concerts were seen around the world, and his rendition of Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot, which he performed at the 1990 football World Cup in Italy.His final performance was at the opening of the Winter Olympics in Turin in February 2006.He died the following year at the age of 71, after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Pavarotti left behind four daughters from his two marriages. Ms Mantovani was his second wife. She remarried, to financial advisor Alberto Tinarelli, in 2020. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterJustice Secretary David Lammy told BBC Breakfast two of the 12 prisoners released are still at largeJustice Secretary David Lammy has said 12 prisoners have been accidentally released in the past three weeks, two of whom are still at large.It comes on top of the 91 prisoners who were freed by mistake between April and October in England and Wales.Speaking to the BBC, Lammy said there would always be a \"human error\" while prisons were using a paper-based system and that the situation would improve once a \"completely digital system\" was adopted.He said there had been \"a spike\" in accidental releases but added it was now on \"a downward trajectory\".Speaking to ITV later, Lammy said he had been \"reassured\" that the two prisoners at large were not violent or sex offenders.\"I'm not going to give details of those cases, because these are operational decisions made by the police, and you'll understand if they're about to arrest somebody they don't want me to blow the cover,\" he added.The subject of accidental releases gained attention after Hadush Kebatu, who was jailed after sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman while living in an asylum hotel in Epping, was mistakenly freed.Kebatu was re-arrested two days after his release and has now been deported to Ethiopia. Shortly after Kebatu's release, news emerged of two other prisoners who had been released in error - William Smith, who later handed himself in, and Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, who was rearrested. The cases led to the government implementing new security measures including a \"clear checklist\" for prison governors to follow when releasing prisoners.The latest releases happened since 11 November, when Lammy gave a statement to the House of Commons, outlining the steps the government was taking to resolve the issue.The number of prisoners who have been let out in error rose by 128% last year, increasing from 115 in 2023-2024 to 262 in the following year.There were just over 57,000 releases of prisoners who had finished the custodial part of their sentences in England and Wales in 2024-25 - a rise of about 13% on the year before. The figures on mistaken releases include cases where individuals were released either too early or too late.Lammy acknowledged there had been a rise in numbers adding: \"I want to bring it down but we have got a mountain to climb.\"He said the problem had been partly caused by the system losing 6,000 officers under the previous Conservative government. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick has previously blamed the increase on \"the confusion created by Labour's botched early release scheme\", a project introduced by the government to ease overcrowding in prisons.Responding to the news of the 12 new prisoner releases, he said \"The public are consistently being put at risk because of his shambolic management. When will this fiasco end?\"Liberal Democrat spokeswoman Jess Brown-Fuller said: \"It's utterly unacceptable that public safety has been put at risk yet again - both the government and the prison service must own up to their failures and guarantee that these mistakes will stop happening once and for all.\"Last month, Lammy set out the actions the government was taking to tackle the problem including investing up to £10m for new AI tools to reduce human error and upgrade the paper-based system used by the prison system.The government has also asked former deputy commissioner of the Met Police Dame Lynne Owens to conduct a review into the mistakes that led to Kebatu's release and what had led to errors across the prison estate. She is due to report back in February 2026. Charlie Taylor, chief inspector of prisons, has said the rising number of mistaken releases was evidence that \"something is going badly wrong\" with the prison system. Speaking to the BBC in October, he said mistakes partly occurred because \"inexperienced\" staff were having to deal with \"huge caseloads\".He added that prisons were having to adapt to different policies including various early release schemes introduced both by the previous Conservative government and the current Labour one.Taylor also said that many prisons are \"reliant\" on officers from West African countries and warned that new Home Office visa rules could mean they would have to leave the UK.

At the weekend it said everyone at the club was \"deeply concerned to hear that George Smyth has been reported missing while hiking the Bucegi Mountain range in Romania\".He represented its Colts last season and had \"often given his time wholeheartedly to help coach our younger age groups\". \"He has always been part of the Newport rugby family, and this news has touched all of us,\" the club added.\"As a club and a rugby family, we are holding onto hope that George is found safe and well, and hope that the ongoing search efforts in Romania bring positive news soon.\"The club said it asked everyone to keep him and the family \"in their hearts\".A University of Bristol spokesperson said: \"We've been informed that one of our students has been reported missing after independently travelling to Romania to go hiking.\"\"We are deeply concerned for his welfare and are in close contact with his family.\"Our thoughts are with them as they await any updates.\"The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office added: \"We are supporting the family of British man who is missing in Romania and are in contact with the local authorities.\"On Friday, the mountain rescue service said he had been missing since the previous Sunday evening in the mountains, but had not been found despite \"maintained efforts\".The service said family asked it to share the photo of him and asked anybody who had seen him or had \"any relevant information to urgently contact\" the service or go to the nearest police station.",

This approach was brought in following the Leveson Inquiry into the British media in 2012 which said that arrested suspects should not be named \"save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances\".

    "body": "6 hours agoNick EdserBusiness reporterGetty ImagesTax rises and constraints on government spending will weigh on growth in the UK's economy, according to an influential global policy group.UK inflation will also remain among the highest of the G7 advanced economies, although it is expected to ease, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said.The OECD forecast the UK economy would be \"steady\" with growth of 1.4% this year before slowing to 1.2% in 2026, although its prediction for next year is an improvement on its previous estimate.The forecast comes less than a week after the Budget, which announced tax increases of £26bn over the next five years, including a freeze on income tax thresholds.The UK will be the second-fastest growing economy in the G7 this year, behind the US, the OECD predicts, and the third fastest in 2026 when it is overtaken by Canada.While UK growth is expected to slow next year, partly due to global uncertainty, the rate is forecast to edge up to 1.3% in 2027.However, the OECD's forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the UK government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which expects 1.5% growth this year, 1.4% next year and 1.5% in 2027.\"Fiscal consolidation will be a headwind to the economy, with past tax and spending adjustments weighing on household disposable income and slowing consumption,\" the OECD said.\"Sluggish\" productivity and \"weak\" growth in the working-age population, which was partly due to slowing inward migration, would \"continue to act as a drag on the economy\", it added.However, it expects the economy to get a slight boost in late 2026 from lower interest rates and a \"gradual\" improvement in global trade. The OECD expects two more interest rate cuts from the Bank of England, taking the key rate to 3.5%.UK inflation is expected to be 3.5% this year - unchanged from the OECD's previous forecast, but the highest in the G7.The inflation rate is then predicted to drop to 2.5% next year, down from its previous estimate of 2.7%, and then fall to 2.1% in 2027. This decrease partly reflects \"recent measures that lower the cost of energy and fuel\", the OECD said.Unemployment is set to rise to 4.9% in 2026, the OECD predicts, and to 5% in 2027.Reacting to the OECD's report, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"Last week, my Budget cut waiting lists, cut borrowing and debt, and cut the cost of living. Less than a week later, the OECD has upgraded our growth and cut its forecast for inflation next year.\"The choices that I made at the Budget are expected to cut inflation by 0.4 percentage points, helping cut the cost of living for households and costs for our businesses.\"Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"Rachel Reeves promised growth but growth is expected to weaken next year, because of her choices. This is the cost of policies that punish work, businesses and investment.\"Reeves has come under pressure since delivering her Budget following accusations that she gave a misleading picture of the government's finances ahead of the announcement.The OECD said the government deficit should improve \"substantially\", but it added that care needed to be taken with changes to tax and spending \"given substantial downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation\".\"Tax and spending measures should also aim to further support growth potential, complementing ongoing structural reforms such as the overhaul of infrastructure planning and the simplification of financial services regulation.\"On a global basis, the OECD said the world's economy had been \"resilient\" this year, although growth is expected to slow in 2026.The body expects the global economy to grow by 3.2% this year, before slowing to 2.9% in 2026 - estimates that are unchanged from its previous forecast. It then expects a small rebound in growth to 3.1% in 2027.However, it warns that the outlook \"remains fragile\". Any further rises in trade barriers could \"inflict significant damage on supply chains and global output\", it says.It also warns of a risk from the AI bubble bursting, noting there is a risk \"of potentially abrupt price corrections\" given the high share prices for some companies. The Bank of England has issued a similar warning.The US economy is forecast to grow more strongly than previously expected. The OECD expects 2% growth this year, revised up from 1.8% in September, and 1.7% in 2026, up from 1.5%.",

    "body": "Image source, Reuters/Tony MelvilleByHelen WillettsLead Weather Presenter and Ben RichLead Weather PresenterDecember has arrived, ushering in the start of meteorological winter.However if you prefer to wait for the winter solstice before getting your scarf and gloves out you will have to wait for a few more weeks. The solstice marks the shortest day - and longest night - in the northern hemisphere and the start of astronomical winter.Technically speaking the solstice is a specific moment, not a whole day and in 2025 it happens at 15:03 on 21 December.What is the winter solstice and what happens during it?The word 'solstice' comes from the Latin sol, meaning 'sun', and sistere - to 'stand still'.The winter solstice is the moment the Sun appears to stand still, directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, the most southerly latitude it reaches annually.This gives the southern hemisphere its longest day of the year with the Sun reaching its highest angle in the sky.It leaves the northern hemisphere with less sunlight and consequently its maximum amount of darkness.We have solstices because the Earth is tilted on its axis by 23.5 degrees, which affects which part of the planet's surface the sun is directly overhead at any given time.Image caption, The part of the Earth tilted towards the sun varies throughout the yearAfter the winter solstice the Sun begins to move north again relative to the equator until eventually - six months later - it reaches it most northerly point, overhead the Tropic of Cancer, and gives us the summer solstice.Midway between the two solstices we have the equinoxes where the sun is directly over the equator.Media caption, Tomasz Schafernaker explains more about the winter solsticeWhy does the date of the solstice vary?The date of the winter solstice can vary slightly from year to year. This is because Earth takes around 365.24 days (give or take a few decimal places) to complete an orbit around the Sun - so not an exact year.It means the timing of the solstice slips by about six hours each year, which adds up to a full day over four years.At this point we observe a leap year, an extra day in the calendar, allowing the solstice to revert back to its earlier date.Other factors that influence the timing of the solstices include variations in the length of the Earth's orbit, and a wobble in its axis caused by its rotation.How much daylight will there be?Due to the tilt of the Earth the winter solstice will mean shorter days at higher latitudes.In the UK the day will be shorter the further north you are, and you can check the exact sunrise and sunset times for your location on the BBC Weather website and app.Within the Arctic Circle - down to a latitude of 23.5 degrees from the North Pole - the sun will not rise at all.Image caption, South-west England will have just over eight hours of daylight, northern Scotland will see six and a half - but in the north of Norway it will stay dark all dayIs the solstice the start of winter?This depends on how we define the seasons.Meteorological winter starts on 1 December - approximately three weeks before the solstice - and runs until the final day of February.This is because weather forecasters divide the year into four equal chunks of three months each, with spring running from March to May, summer from June to August and autumn from September until November.It means weather records are standardised, using the same dates every year, allowing for straightforward analysis of changes in the climate over time.However the astronomical seasons are defined by the Earth's position in its orbit, marked out by the solstices and equinoxes.And so by this criteria, the winter solstice is the first day of winter.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAdina CampbellUK correspondentMore than a quarter of police forces in England and Wales have not implemented basic policies for investigating sexual offences, a report has found, four years after the rape and murder of Sarah Everard.Urgent action is now needed to prevent further violent, sexual attacks against women and girls, including targeting predatory men, the latest stage of an inquiry has found.Its chairwoman Lady Elish Angiolini KC said there was a disparity between how forces dealt with violence against women compared to other high-priority crimes, where funding and prevention was the norm.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the government would carefully consider the recommendations.It comes after the first part of her report published in February 2024 found Ms Everard's killer should never have been a police officer and opportunities were missed to stop him.The remit of the second part of her report, published on Tuesday, examines broader issues about policing and safety of women raised by the case.Ms Everard was kidnapped, raped and murdered by serving police officer Wayne Couzens while walking home in south London in March 2021.Couzens, who is now serving a whole life term in jail, had been a police officer for almost 20 years  and had indecently exposed himself on two occasions in the months leading up to the attack.Two years ago the government outlined the need for police forces to coordinate their response and resources to tackle violence against women and girls in the same way they do for other crimes that are viewed as national threats. But the Angiolini Inquiry said until this is done tackling violence against women and girls would not credibly be called a national priority.In part one of her report, published in February last year,  Lady Elish had recommended that by September 2024, police forces should ensure they have a specialist policy on investigating all sexual offences, including \"non-contact\" offences like indecent exposure. The inquiry was told the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) had developed guidance to support forces  with this, but as of September this year 26% of police forces had not implemented the recommendation. The NPCC said the majority of those forces were still reviewing existing policies to determine if they are sufficient or consulting on new ones, according to the report.The report also pointed to concerns over gaps in national data, including how many women report being the victim of rape and other sexually motivated crimes in public spaces.Lady Elish warned without these figures being gathered and recorded consistently across all forces, patterns of offending cannot be spotted.New recommendations in part two of the Angiolini Inquiry include encouraging more people to take action when they see bad behaviour, with the introduction of a wider Good Samaritan law as well as significantly increasing the collection and use of data on sexually motivated crimes against women in public spaces. Other recommendations include improving information and programmes to create a culture of positive masculinity for men and boys and targeted consistent public messaging about how to report crimes, such as indecent exposure.There should also be increased use of police officers to help architects and planners in the design of safe public spaces, the report said. Ms Everard's family said in a statement that they hoped these latest inquiry findings had \"far-reaching consequences\".\"It shows how much work there is to do in preventing sexually motivated crimes against women in public spaces and all those at risk,\" the statement said.\"Sarah is always in our thoughts and we feel the inquiry continues to honour her memory. We stand in recognising the urgent need for positive change\".Farah Naz, the aunt of Zara Aleena who was sexually assaulted and murdered after a night out in east London by a prolific offender in 2022, says she hopes the Good Samaritan law she has championed is taken seriously and progresses with urgency.She said: \"My niece was walking home. That is all she was doing. This report not only examines specific failures surrounding Sarah and Zara but also addresses the wider structures, cultural patterns and operational weaknesses that place women and girls at risk in public space.\"The home secretary said that her thoughts were with Sarah Everard's family and all those who loved her.\"I will do everything I can to ensure women and girls can live free from fear and harm - something Sarah was so cruelly denied, \" she said.She said the government plans to halve violence against women and girls in the next decade and it will soon unveil its Violence Against Women and Girls strategy.",

    "body": "9 minutes agoDominic Casciani,Home and legal correspondentandTom McArthurJury trials in England and Wales for crimes that carry a likely sentence of less than three years will be scrapped, the justice secretary has announced.The reforms to the justice system include creating \"swift courts\" under the government's plan to tackle unprecedented delays in the court system.Serious offences including murder, robbery and rape will still go before a jury, and volunteer community magistrates, who deal with the majority of all criminal cases, will take on even more work.David Lammy said the reforms were \"bold\" but \"necessary\", but the Conservatives described the plans as the \"beginning of the end of jury trials\".Retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Brian Leveson was asked by the Lord Chancellor to come up with a series of proposals to reduce the backlog in the courts, in a process which began back in December 2024.These proposals included jury-free trials and more out-of-court settlements like cautions.In July, Sir Brian said \"fundamental\" reforms were needed to \"reduce the risk of total system collapse\".A previous version of the plan, leaked to the BBC and the Times last week and based on Sir Brian's proposals, was to end jury trial for most crimes attracting sentences of up to five years.But announcing the reforms in the Commons on Tuesday, David Lammy retreated from the most radical reforms.Lammy said the new system would get cases dealt with a fifth faster than jury trials.He added that it was necessary as current projections have Crown Court case loads reaching 100,000 by 2028, from the current backlog of almost 78,000.This means that currently a suspect being charged with an offence today may not reach trial until 2030. Six out of 10 victims of rape are said to be withdrawing from prosecutions because of delays.A defendant's right to a jury trial would be restricted to prevent them from \"gaming the system\", Lammy also said.The reforms to the jury process will remove the right for defendants to ask for a jury trial where a case can be dealt with by either magistrates or a new form of judge-only Crown Court.Defendants facing fraud and complex financial crime accusations will no longer get a jury trial - a recommendation made to the government earlier this year by a retired senior judge.There are around 1.3m prosecutions in England and Wales every year, and 10% of those cases go before a Crown Court. Of those, three out of 10 result in trials.The reforms appear to mean that more than two out of 10 will still go before a jury. Critics of restrictions to trial by jury - including almost all barristers - say it won't have any impact on the backlogs because the real problem has been cuts to the Ministry of Justice.Evidence also shows that ethnic minorities believe they get a fairer hearing with juries, than with magistrates alone.Lammy has previously said that cutting juries would be a mistake, but told the BBC ahead of the announcement that the \"facts had changed\" and the government needed to bring in reforms to clear the backlog.Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick accused Lammy of \"scrapping the institution he once lauded\".He told the Commons: \"Why on earth does this justice secretary think he has a mandate to rip up centuries of jury trials without even a mention of it in his party's manifesto?\"Lammy, in response, said the changes were needed because the previous government had cut court sitting days - and magistrates already deal with the vast majority of UK trials.Legislation would need to be introduced to bring in the changes.Abigail Ashford, a solicitor advocate with Stokoe Partnership, who represents clients in the Crown Court, said the reforms risked trust in justice.\"Judge-only trials risk deepening existing inequalities and eroding confidence among communities who already feel marginalised,\" she said.\"In complex or sensitive cases, removing the community from assessing credibility and fairness undermines trust in a way that cannot be compensated for by concentrating decisions in the hands of a single judge.\"The Criminal Bar Association, which represents specialist criminal barristers in England and Wales, criticised the changes and said they brought \"a wrecking ball to a system that is fundamentally sound and has been in place for generations\". \"Juries work – they do their job superbly, and without bias,\" it said in a statement. \"Juries have not caused the backlog.\"Chair Riel Karmy-Jones KC also expressed concern \"about the lack of detail provided in David Lammy's comments\".Tom Franklin, chief executive of the Magistrates' Association, said the increased powers for magistrates was a \"big vote of confidence\" but more resources were needed for courts including enough trained, well-paid legal advisers, and repairing crumbling buildings.He also pressed the case for the new swift courts to include two magistrates passing sentences with a judge, as originally proposed by Sir Brian, so that \"ordinary people\" are involved in both verdict and sentencing.",

    "body": "3 hours agoIan Youngs,Culture reporterandMark Savage,Music correspondentReutersSean Combs is currently serving a 50-month prison sentenceLawyers for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs have hit out at a new Netflix documentary produced by rapper 50 Cent, which they say is \"a shameful hit piece\" that \"relied on stolen footage\".The four-part documentary, titled Sean Combs: The Reckoning, was released on Tuesday and is billed as a \"staggering examination\" of the hip-hop mogul, who was convicted on prostitution-related charges earlier this year.It includes what Netflix described as \"explosive\" footage of Combs filmed in the days before his arrest, including a phone conversation with his lawyers.The director said she obtained the footage legally, but Combs' spokesman said it was \"fundamentally unfair, and illegal\" to use his private footage.'Personal vendetta'He also said it was \"staggering\" that Netflix had given creative control to 50 Cent, who he described as \"a longtime adversary with a personal vendetta\".\"Netflix is plainly desperate to sensationalise every minute of Mr Combs's life, without regard for truth, in order to capitalise on a never-ending media frenzy,\" the statement said.\"If Netflix cared about truth or about Mr Combs's legal rights, it would not be ripping private footage out of context - including conversations with his lawyers that were never intended for public viewing. No rights in that material were ever transferred to Netflix or any third party.\"The statement added: \"For Netflix to give his life story to someone who has publicly attacked him for decades feels like an unnecessary and deeply personal affront. At minimum, he expected fairness from people he respected.\"The documentary opens with footage of Combs in a hotel room six days before arrest in September 2024, talking on the phone to attorney Marc Agnifilo and telling him he wants to \"fight for my life\".Pushing Agnifilo to have a more upfront media strategy to protest his innocence, Combs told him: \"We have to find somebody that'll work with us. It has to be somebody that has dealt in the dirtiest of dirtiest of dirty business of [the] media and propaganda.\"At another point, viewers see Combs talking to his son Justin on the phone five days before his arrest. \"God told me to do nothing... [but] other people need to do something 'cause this is ridiculous,\" he said in the clip.Combs' spokesman said the documentary contained footage that was \"never authorised for release\".\"As Netflix and CEO Ted Sarandos know, Mr Combs has been amassing footage since he was 19 to tell his own story, in his own way. It is fundamentally unfair, and illegal, for Netflix to misappropriate that work.\"Netflix has not responded to a request for a response but pointed US media to comments it has published from the documentary's director Alexandria Stapleton.\"It came to us, we obtained the footage legally and have the necessary rights,\" she said. \"We moved heaven and earth to keep the film-maker's identity confidential.\"The documentary is executive produced by Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson, whose long-running feud with Combs stretches back two decades.Jackson told ABC News' Good Morning America on Monday: \"If I didn't say anything, you would interpret it as that hip-hop is fine with his behaviours. There's no-one else being vocal.\"The documentary covers Combs' career as one of the most powerful men in hip-hop, and includes allegations that he was involved in the murder of rapper Tupac Shakur in 1996.It features tapes of a police interview in which former gang member Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis claims that Combs offered him $1m (£769,000) for a hit on Shakur.Mr Davis is set to stand trial for Shakur's murder in 2026. He now says his proffer agreement with police, under which he agreed to tell them what he knew but it couldn't be used against him in court, was given under duress, according to Netflix.The programme also includes Kirk Burrowes, who co-founded Bad Boy Entertainment with Combs, claiming that he believes Combs \"had a lot to do with the death of Tupac\".Combs has always denied any involvement in Shakur's death.The documentary also features further claims of violence and threats, many of which have previously been made public in dozens of lawsuits, including alleged abuse against former girlfriend Cassie, which ended in a settlement.Combs has previously denied the complaints, calling them \"sickening\" and \"full of lies\".In a media statement earlier this year, his lawyers said \"anyone can file a lawsuit\", adding: \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone – man or woman, adult or minor.\"The documentary also includes interviews with two jurors from Combs' trial.In July, he was convicted on two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution but found not guilty of the most serious charges - racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking of two ex-girlfriends.He is now serving a 50-month prison sentence and has said he will appeal.",

    "body": "17 minutes agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is unlikely to receive any compensation upon leaving Royal Lodge in Windsor, according to information published by the Public Accounts Committee.As part of his leasing arrangement, Andrew could have been entitled to £488,000 for an early surrender of his 75-year lease.But a report from the Crown Estate for MPs on the public spending watchdog says that the property is so dilapidated and in need of repairs that in \"all likelihood\" Andrew \"will not be owed any compensation\".There will now be an MPs' inquiry launched into the Crown Estate and its royal leases, says committee chair, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown.Sir Geoffrey said the information from the Crown Estate \"clearly forms the beginnings of a basis for an inquiry\" which will begin next year and will consider the Crown Estate and property leases with the Royal Family.It is not known yet whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor will be called to give evidence.The information supplied by the Crown Estate also showed Andrew handed in his notice on the property on 30 October, the day it had been announced he had lost his titles.He gave a year's notice, so could stay for another 10 months, but it has been expected that he will move from Royal Lodge to Sandringham in Norfolk early next year.MPs on the cross-party committee had wanted to know the details of Andrew's financial arrangements for Royal Lodge and whether taxpayers' interests had been properly protected.Andrew had taken on a 75-year lease of Royal Lodge in 2003, paying over £8.5m up-front to cover renovation costs and paying in advance to remove any requirement for rent, based on a notional rent of £260,000 per year.There was also a token \"peppercorn\" payment, which the Crown Estate notes is standard practice for long leases, where there's an advance payment in lieu of rent.A clause allowed him to get some of his advance payments back if he left within 25 years, but that depended on the property being maintained.The report says the current condition of Royal Lodge is \"not out of keeping with a tenancy of this duration\", but the cost of repairing \"dilapidations\" meant any payback was unlikely.Overall, the terms of the Royal Lodge deal were \"fair, reasonable and in line with market practice\", says a letter from the Crown Estate commissioners to MPs.The spending watchdog also published information about Forest Lodge, the Prince and Princess of Wales's new home in Windsor, saying it had been taken on a 20-year lease from the Crown Estate.The couple, who moved in this autumn, are described as paying an \"open market rent\" using levels agreed by independent valuers.There had been pressure on Andrew, 65, to move from his Windsor home for over a year, in what had become known as the Siege of Royal Lodge.King Charles had stopped financial support for his brother, but Andrew had a private lease that he had previously shown no signs of relinquishing.But following a growing public outcry about his links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Andrew was stripped of titles such as the Duke of York and his status as prince, becoming Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.As part of that announcement in October, Andrew was also to leave Royal Lodge and to move into some other accommodation in Sandringham, the King's private estate in Norfolk.Andrew has also faced calls from Democrat members of the US Congress to give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein's activities.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had not replied to the request by the end of their deadline last month.",

    "body": "11 minutes agoReutersForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper has launched a review into what she calls \"serious information failures\" in the case of British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah. In a letter to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Cooper said she, Sir Keir Starmer and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy \"were all unaware\" of Mr Abd El Fattah's historical tweets, which they consider to be \"abhorrent\".It comes after the Conservatives and Reform UK called for the activist to be stripped of UK citizenship and deported after social media posts in which he called for Zionists and police to be killed resurfaced.Mr Abd El Fattah has apologised, saying he understood \"how shocking and hurtful\" the posts were.Sir Keir Starmer has been criticised for saying he was \"delighted\" by Mr Abd El Fattah's arrival in the UK on Friday, three months after the democracy activist was freed from prison in Egypt.On Monday, Sir Keir said the resurfaced tweets were \"absolutely abhorrent\" and said the government was \"taking steps to review the information failures in this case\".\"With the rise of antisemitism, and recent horrific attacks, I know this has added to the distress of many in the Jewish community in the UK,\" he added.Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick, who led the criticism of Sir Keir's welcome for Mr Abd El Fattah, swiftly responded by renewing his call for the activist to be removed from the UK. Earlier on Monday, Mr Abd El Fattah said he took allegations of antisemitism \"very seriously\" while arguing some of the posts had been \"completely twisted out of their meaning\".He added: \"I am shaken that, just as I am being reunited with my family for the first time in 12 years, several historic tweets of mine have been republished and used to question and attack my integrity and values, escalating to calls for the revocation of my citizenship.\"In her letter to the Foreign Affairs committee, Cooper said work she had started over the weekend revealed that previous foreign secretaries and prime ministers had made public statements on Mr Abd El Fattah's case \"without all relevant information\".She added that current and former ministers were \"never briefed on these tweets when they spoke publicly about the case\", and he civil servants in charge of the case \"were also unaware\" of them.Cooper said it was clear there had been an \"unacceptable failure\" and that longstanding due diligence procedures had been \"completely inadequate for this situation\".The foreign secretary added she was \"deeply concerned\" that the re-emergence of these tweets, alongside social media posts welcoming Mr Abd El Fattah's return posted by her and other members of the government, had \"added to the distress felt by Jewish communities in the UK and I very much regret that\".She told the committee she had asked the most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office to review the \"serious information failures in this case\" and the broader systems that were in place in the department for carrying out due diligence on high-profile consular and human rights cases to make sure they were working properly and that \"all necessary lessons are learned\".This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

    "body": "Passengers aboard a cruise ship that ran aground in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on Saturday will be flown back to Australia, after efforts to refloat the vessel failed.The Australian-flagged Coral Adventurer became stuck on a reef off the eastern coast of PNG at around 05:25 local time on Saturday. The 80 passengers and 44 crew members are safe and unharmed, and the passengers, who departed from Cairns in northern Australia on 18 December, will be flown back there.The same ship made headlines earlier this year when it left behind an elderly woman on a remote island on the Great Barrier Reef. Her body was found the following day, and an investigation is ongoing. In the latest incident, the Coral Adventurer was transiting through Morobe, Madang and Sepik provinces when it hit strong sea currents and sailed onto the reef, Morobe's Police Commander Chief Superintendent Samson Siguyaru told the ABC's Pacific Beat programme.The ship was on a six-degree list to the port side - meaning it was tilting to the left, the NMSA said. After inspections, authorities determined that the vessel was not damaged, and there was no environmental pollution or spillage.However a detention notice has been issued, Ch Supt Siguyaru said, which means the ship has been deemed unseaworthy - at least temporarily - and is not allowed to leave the location \"until all the processes are cleared\".Attempts on Sunday to free the ship by using its own engines and a tug boat were unsuccessful, PNG authorities told the ABC.The ship's operator, Coral Expeditions, said on Monday that it would end the tour a day early and fly passengers back to Australia, the public broadcaster reported.According to its website, Coral Expeditions has been running tours to PNG for about 20 years.

    "body": "The United States has pledged $2 billion (£1.5bn) to fund United Nations (UN) humanitarian programmes, but has warned the UN it must \"adapt or die\". The announcement was made in Geneva by Jeremy Lewin, President Trump's Under Secretary for Foreign Assistance, and the UN's emergency relief chief, Tom Fletcher.It comes amid huge cuts in US funding for humanitarian operations, and further cuts expected from other donors, such as the UK and Germany.Mr Fletcher welcomed the new funds, saying they would save \"millions of lives\". But $2 billion is just a fraction of what the US has traditionally spent on aid. In 2022 its contribution to the UN's humanitarian work was estimated at $17 billion (£12.6bn).And the funding comes with some strings attached. Although UN donors do sometimes earmark specific projects, the UN funding prioritises just 17 countries, among them Haiti, Syria, and Sudan.Afghanistan and Yemen will not, Mr Lewin said, receive any money, adding that Washington had evidence that in Afghanistan UN funds were being diverted to the Taliban and that \"President Trump will never tolerate a penny of taxpayers' money going to terrorist groups\".Such restrictions will be hard for aid agencies working in countries not on the list. The impact of funding cuts has already led to the closure of mother and baby clinics in Afghanistan, and reductions in food rations for displaced people in Sudan. Globally, child mortality, which has been declining, is set to rise this year.The conditions placed on the new US funding also rule out spending money on projects related to tackling climate change, which Mr Lewin said were not \"life saving\", and not in \"the US interest\".Mr Lewin, a Trump loyalist who reportedly masterminded the shutdown of USAID and the firing of its thousands of staff, warned the UN that it must \"adapt or die\", saying that the US \"piggy bank is not open to those organisations that just want to return to the old system\".The US says funding must be focused and efficient, with no duplication among aid projects. These are qualities Tom Fletcher, and the entire UN system, say they wholeheartedly support. It's in no one's interests, least of all those of the estimated 200 people caught up in crises, for money to be spent unwisely.But while the UN is gratefully welcoming the new US funding, there remain big questions about whether the conditions around it are too politicised. The fundamental principles of humanitarian aid are that it should be neutral, impartial, and directed at those most in need. Eliminating specific countries, or specific crises such as climate change, challenges those principles.But, as it struggles with a continued funding crises, and, in Washington, a very skeptical donor, many in the UN will be acknowledging that $2 billion is better than nothing.",

    "body": "9 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterPothole compensation claims made to councils in Britain rose by 90% between 2021 and 2024, according to analysis by the RAC motoring group.The study also found that only a quarter of claims made by motorists in 2024 resulted in payouts.However, the RAC noted that the number of claims fell in 2024 compared with the year before.The Local Government Association (LGA) said \"ever-increasing pressure\" on budgets was affecting councils' abilities to fix roads, while the Department for Transport said the government was spending £7.3bn over the next four years on improving road surfaces.Potholes have become a major bugbear for many drivers. Repair bills can be costly, and they can also cause injuries to passengers, cyclists or pedestrians.The RAC said data it had analysed indicated that 53,015 compensation claims claims were made to 177 local authorities in 2024.That was up from 27,731 in 2021, although it marked a fall from the 56,655 seen in 2023.In 2024, just 26% of claims led to a payout, with an average sum of £390 given to claimants.The RAC estimates that a typical repair bill for a family car with damage worse than a puncture from a pothole is £590.Potholes can cause damage to shock absorbers and suspension springs, and can also distort wheels.RAC head of policy Simon Williams told the BBC: \"It does seem that councils have a variety of different criteria for what they class as a pothole.\"Often they have to be four centimetres deep and so many centimetres wide.\"If you hit one, it can cause a real jolt to the car and serious damage... not just damage to vehicles, it's also a serious road safety danger, particularly on two wheels.\"RAC asked 207 councils about pothole compensation claims. Of the 177 that responded, Derbyshire County Council saw the biggest increase in claims over the three-year period, from 224 to 3,307.However, Derbyshire councillor Charlotte Hill, the council's cabinet member for potholes, highways and transport, said claims had fallen by 72% since May 2025.\"Going forward, Derbyshire highways can become more proactive rather than reactive, and work to make repairs before they become an issue for residents,\" she told the BBC.Glasgow City Council and Oxfordshire County Council saw the next biggest increases between 2021 and 2024.In a statement, Andrew Gant, Oxfordshire County Council's cabinet member for transport management, said the emphasis \"should be on maintenance work to prevent potholes forming in the first place, which is much more cost-effective than repairing them afterwards\".\"That is why we have invested nearly £14.5m since 2024 on the largest surface dressing programmes we have carried out for at least 20 years.\"Surface dressing is a preservation treatment aimed at avoiding potholes forming.The BBC has contacted Glasgow City Council for comment.A Department for Transport spokesperson said the government was investing £7.3bn over the next four years to help councils resurface roads.\"This will turn the tide on years of underinvestment in our road network, allowing local authorities to move away from expensive, short-term repairs and invest in proactive maintenance and prevent potholes from forming in the first place,\" they said.A Local Government Association spokesperson said that \"ever-increasing pressure on budgets has impacted their ability to do so as much as they'd like\" regarding road maintenance.\"New funding for roads will help turn the tide on the gradual decline of local roads, but this will take time to shift from simply filling potholes reactively – which pothole compensation laws require – towards a more proactive, sustainable approach.\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoYvette TanGetty ImagesThe Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian sideThailand's army has accused Cambodia of breaching a newly signed ceasefire deal reached after weeks of deadly clashes that forced nearly one million people from their homes. In a statement, the Thai army said more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian side on Sunday night.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Both sides agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible.It had been seen as a breakthrough, which came after days of talks between both countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US. In a statement on Monday, the Royal Thai Army said Cambodia's actions \"constitute provocation and a violation of measures aimed at reducing tensions\", adding that they were \"inconsistent\" with the terms of the ceasefire.It also said it \"may need to reconsider\" the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers held in Thailand since July. Thailand would be \"obliged to act in accordance... [if] violations of agreements and national sovereignty continue\", it added.Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn described the incident as \"a small issue related to flying drones seen by both sides along the border line,\" according to AFP news agency. It comes just hours after China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi praised the \"hard-won\" ceasefire, and US President Donald Trump praised the \"rapid and fair conclusion\".The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is not new, dating back more than a century.The latest tensions ramped up earlier this year, after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May. This plunged relations between the countries to their lowest point in more than a decade.There were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.A fragile ceasefire deal was agreed in July and signed in October. It then collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.",

As a result, it expected revenues of £114.5m for 2025 and underlying earnings of at least £16.8m, down from previous forecasts of £121.5m and £19.9m respectively.Chairman Philip Jacobson said Mr Scrimgeour had \"played a pivotal role in the team that successfully led the business through its recovery from Covid, more than doubling revenue\".Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said the outgoing boss had to \"deal with a succession of crises from day one\" including the cost-of-living, as well as the the pandemic.However, he added: \"The share price fell by 76% during his tenure and time had run out.\"While the cinema industry did manage to regain some of its sparkle post-pandemic, Everyman lost its edge in the market.\"Mr Coatsworth said the upmarket chain had once offered \"a unique proposition\", but had since been copied by rivals, including Vue and Odeon, which have installed reclining seats and \"also rolled out bars inside their cinemas\".He added that it would be interesting to see if Blue Coast Private Equity, which owns a 29% stake in Everyman, would buy the chain, \"opting to remove it from the public spotlight to enact a turnaround programme\".",

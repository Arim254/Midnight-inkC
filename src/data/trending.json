On the agenda was a full-throated defence of the administration’s record, hailing a \"turnaround for the ages,” whilst playing down the Supreme Court's ruling against his signature tariff policy (with the judges themselves in the crowd).\nDespite the speech lasting nearly two hours,  there was little to suggest a change of course from Trump’s favourite taking points. He focused on the economy, immigration, the Democrats…. And the US men’s olympic hockey team.\nBut with growing voter dissatisfaction souring the polls, will Trump’s sales pitch be enough to counter sliding approval ratings and convince voters to stick with him for November's midterm election?\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporter Watch: Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle says he passed information onto policeCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has confirmed he passed information onto police suggesting Lord Mandelson could be a flight risk, adding that he acted \"in good faith\".It comes after the peer's lawyers complained about the force's decision to arrest him on Monday as part of its probe into misconduct in public office allegations.Sir Lindsay told MPs he had passed on \"relevant\" information about the peer in \"good faith\". Lord Mandelson's lawyers say he had agreed to an interview next month, and the decision to take him into custody was prompted by a \"baseless\" suggestion he was planning to move abroad.Speaking in the Commons shortly after the Times first reported he had passed information to the Metropolitan Police, Sir Lindsay confirmed he had given the force \"relevant\" information, adding he considered it his \"duty and responsibility\".\"It is regrettable this rapidly ended in the media,\" he added.He did not provide any details, but the BBC understands he passed on information he received in the British Virgin Islands during a visit last week that Lord Mandelson was planning to travel there.The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's lawyers were twice told by the police that the referral came from Lord Forsyth, the Speaker of the House of Lords.Lord Forsyth has called suggestions he was involved \"entirely false and without foundation\". Lord Mandelson's lawyers Mishcon de Reya have written to the Met asking what information and evidence they based their decision to arrest their client on.The Met has declined to comment. The force is understood to have conducted its own assessment of the credibility of the information passed on by Sir Lindsay before deciding to arrest Lord Mandelson on Monday afternoon.The former Labour minister was taken to Wandsworth police station in London for interview, before later being released on bail pending further investigation. It is understood he surrendered his passport as one of his bail conditions.UK PoolLord Mandelson was arrested at his London home on MondayIt comes after the force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. Lawyers for the peer say he intends to co-operate with police to \"clear his name\". Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.

    "body": "7 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporterGetty ImagesEmperor Penguins are likely more at risk from climate change than any other air-breathing Antarctic animal Scientists have discovered that an annual event when Emperor penguins completely shed and regrow their feathers is putting the birds in peril as Antarctica is transformed by a warming world.Each year the birds must stay on platforms of floating ice for long enough to replace weather-beaten feathers with new, waterproof coats.But in 2022-24 Antarctic sea ice shrank significantly, largely down to climate change, depriving the birds of safe places to moult.Now scientists who track the animals using satellite pictures can no longer find most of the birds. They fear that thousands of penguins may have frozen in Antarctica's icy waters.\"This was really an \"oh my God\" moment,\" says the scientist behind the findings, Dr Peter Fretwell at British Antarctic Survey, who has worked on Emperor penguins for 20 years.\"You could see this was something game-changing for Emperor penguins. Suddenly you're thinking, well, have we got time to save them?\" he says. The research, published in the scientific journal Communications Earth & Environment, provides evidence about the impacts of the collapse in Antarctic summer sea ice in 2022-24 which the BBC reported on here.It is focussed on West Antarctica, home to 30-40% of the global population of Emperor penguins. The animals are amongst the most threatened in the world. They migrate thousands of kilometres to find stable sea ice during Antarctic summer to wait out what is called a \"catastrophic moult\" every year. VantorOn vast white sea ice, the blobs of brown are feathers left behind by penguins as they moultLittle else was known about the 30-40 day moult, until Fretwell spotted large brown smudges in satellite pictures from 2019-2025. They turned out to be mounds of feathers, left in an area called Marie Byrd Land.The penguins' feathers are \"the most complicated and best insulating of any animal\", he says. Over time they are damaged, so the penguins shed them annually.\"It's incredibly energy-intensive and the birds use up to 50% of their body mass,\" he says.VantorScientists identified extensive mounds of brown feathers in satellite picturesIt is \"probably the most dangerous time for adult Emperor penguins because they haven't got their waterproof suits on,\" he says. If they go into water, they are likely to die.In 2019, 2020 and 2021 the sea ice was relatively stable and significant feather mounds were visible. But in 2022 summer sea ice in much of Antarctica dramatically shrank, falling from an average of 2.8m sq km to a record low of 1.79m sq km in 2023.That trend continued until 2025, when there was a modest recovery in the sea ice in West Antarctica.Getty ImagesResearchers fear that most Emperor Penguins colonies could be wiped out by 2100But when Fretwell looked at the satellite pictures, he saw few signs of the birds. \"There should have been lots of penguins there, but actually we could only see 25 groups,\" he said. Groups vary in size from 10s to up to 1,000 birds.\"Again this year the sea ice hasn't been too bad, but I can only see a handful of penguins really,\" he says.He fears most have could died. Some may have travelled to another location in East Antarctica to moult, but this would have disrupted breeding, also leading to population losses.Longer term, the bird's best chance for survival is to adapt to moult on shallow ice shelves. Fretwell has seen some groups begin to do this, although it may come with a cost to the penguins' breeding and feeding patterns.Peter FretwellHe says the findings are a reminder that while the effects of global warming can be slow at times, there are moments of dramatic change.\"It wasn't just a few colonies that were lost and it wasn't a slow process,\" he says.\"It is the only piece of science I've ever done that's really emotionally got me,\" he says.Next he will compare his findings with an imminent population count of Emperor penguins in the Ross sea region where the birds migrate to and from. That will give more data about the possible numbers of deaths.He says the results could change predicted extinction dates for Emperor penguins.\"Now I'm asking, is that coming forwards towards us? Is it the end of the century?\" he asked.",

He denies all charges.If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.Prosecutor Tom Little KC told the jury the defendant carried out a \"tsunami\" of abuse against Baird.But Katy Thorne KC, defending, later told the jury Trybus was \"never abusive to his wife\".\"This without question is a tragic case, a young woman has died and she took her own life and nothing you decide in this courtroom can alter the grief and loss of those who loved her,\" she said.Family handout Baird was 34 years old when she took her own life\"The defence position is he didn't beat her, he didn't break her, he didn't coerce her, control her and he didn't cause her death.\"On the contrary, he loved her and cherished her deeply and his case is that without anyone's knowledge, Tarryn Baird was making demonstrably false allegations to health professionals,\" she continued.Thorne told the jury Trybus's actions did not cause Baird's death.\"The defence case is that on a number of occasions Tarryn Baird made allegations of violence which were demonstrably false, for example, by reporting injuries to health professionals when Christopher Trybus was not even in the country.\"Health professionals were being told a false story and her boredom and troubled mind was leading her to make allegations to seek care and attention,\" she said.The trial continues.More from Wiltshire",

    "body": "5 hours agoStuart HarrattandHolly Phillips,East Yorkshire and LincolnshireLina SavickeLilia Valutyte was a \"beautiful soul with a strong character\", say her parentsA man has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years after being found guilty of murdering a nine-year-old girl as she played with a hula hoop.Deividas Skebas, 26, stabbed Lilia Valutyte to death in a random attack outside the shop where her mother worked in Boston, Lincolnshire, on 28 July 2022.He admitted killing Lilia but denied her murder, claiming his responsibility was diminished by his mental state. However, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court convicted him following an eight-day trial earlier this month.Sentencing, Mr Justice Akhlaq Choudhury told Skebas, who showed little emotion, that it was a \"shocking and horrific act of violence\" and added: \"You did the unthinkable.\"Lincolnshire PoliceDeividas Skebas has been jailed for the murder of Boston schoolgirl Lilia ValutyteChoudhury added: \"You headed straight towards her, pulled out the knife and as soon as you approached the unsuspecting Lilia, you plunged the knife into her heart.\"He said the CCTV from before the incident showed Lilia as a \"carefree, happy girl\" who \"should have been safe\". He added: \"How could anyone imagine that within seconds she would be stabbed by a complete stranger and left to die?\"Yours was a shocking and horrific act of violence.\"Nothing I can do or say today can relieve the pain of losing Lilia.\"Skebas, who appeared via videolink from Rampton Hospital in Nottinghamshire, was told he would remain at the psychiatric facility.However, the judge said if at any point Skebas was deemed well enough to be discharged he would be sent to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence.During the trial, the jury heard Lilia had been playing in Fountain Lane.Skebas, formerly of Thorold Street, Boston, ran towards Lilia and stabbed her once in the chest.Her mother, Lina Savicke, told the court Lilia called her name and after she rushed outside the girl collapsed into her arms.Despite the efforts of an off-duty police officer, doctors and paramedics, Lilia died within an hour of being attacked.Lina SavickeLilia died from a single stab wound to her heartJurors heard Lithuania national Skebas had a history of mental health issues and told police after his arrest he was being controlled by a microchip.Three psychiatrists who assessed Skebas agreed he had schizophrenia and was showing symptoms of psychosis on the day he killed Lilia.Andrew Campbell-Tiech KC, representing Skebas, told the court on Wednesday that his client had been \"subject to a serious and dangerous condition for many years\".He invited the court to \"realise the defendant is likely to spend much of the rest of his life contained and confined\".Campbell-Tiech added there was \"no need further to stigmatise the appalling act that he [Skebas] performed in the midst of a mental health crisis\".Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan KC argued his mental illness did not stop him planning a deliberate murder, calling it a \"wicked act\".PA MediaDeividas Skebas stabbed Lilia Valutyte outside the shop where her mother workedAfter the sentencing hearing, Lilia's family issued a statement.It read: \"This decision will not change our lives.\"Nothing will bring our child back, the pain will not disappear, and the tears shed will not wash it away.\"From the bottom of our hearts, we thank those who were not afraid to stand by us and support our family during the hardest time.\"No matter how strong we may appear, there are moments when all we need is to know that we are needed and not alone.

    "body": "The warmer southerly wind is also helping draw up a plume of Saharan dust to the UK which could bring some dramatic, fiery sunsets and sunrises.The dust from the Sahara has been picked up high into the atmosphere and is carried thousands of miles before gradually filtering down toward the surface.As the fine particles scatter sunlight, they can enhance reds and oranges at dawn and dusk when conditions are right. If the dust also combines with spells of rain, it can lead to what is often referred to as \"blood rain\", leaving behind a thin, dirty residue on cars, windows and outdoor surfaces.While it can appear dramatic, this is a relatively common and entirely natural seasonal event in the UK. Episodes of Saharan dust transport occur several times a year, most often in late winter and spring, when southerly winds draw warm air northwards from north Africa towards the UK.Look out for some particularly intense colours at dusk later on Wednesday, possibly extending into Thursday and Friday.Dust concentrations are expected to be highest over southern England.",

    "body": "4 hours agoRichard MorrisTechnology reporterReutersBritish self-driving startup Wayve has said its confident its technology will allow autonomous vehicles to \"really drive anywhere\", including on the UK's sometimes pothole-blighted roads.The firm has raised an additional $1.5bn (£1.1bn) from investors, including Microsoft and chip giant Nvidia - one of the largest ever funding rounds for a British company.It comes as Wayve prepares to launch robotaxis in London later this year as part of a partnership Uber.Its boss said he was confident autonomous vehicles would soon be one the roads in many other locations too.\"We've taken it throughout Wales, Scotland, rural parts of England and the complexities of driving it through central London\", Alex Kendall told Today, on BBC Radio 4.Asked if cars equipped with its tech would have a problem with hazards such as potholes he replied \"not at all\".\"The AI has the intelligence to drive on roads, the same ones as you and I, just drive within the environment that we have today,\" he said.Wayve was founded in 2017, developing AI in vehicles which learns from the environment by processing data from sensors, rather than relying on pre-mapped routes.A rare example of a British tech company which is among the market leaders in its field, Wayve nonetheless faces strong competition from rivals including Waymo. Another US firm, Lyft, is also due to launch in the UK in partnership with Chinese firm Baidu.Kendall, the co-founder and chief executive of Wayve said training an AI to drive in London was a \"different driving experience than the grid-like streets and wide boulevards you get in the United States\", where they have been on the roads on a trial basis for some time.China has also been allowing autonomous vehicles in some cities for a number of years.  Kendall said eventually everywhere would follow suit, predicting \"all cars will be autonomous in the future\". The new investment values the London-based business at around $8.6 bn (£6.4bn).Rachel Harris, Supervising Associate at Simmons & Simmons said that showed \"investors believe autonomous driving technology is reaching commercial maturity\". She added there were still potential roadblocks ahead.\"The critical question is whether regulation can keep pace,\" she said.But she suggested if they could be overcome \"the UK is well positioned to be not just a centre of autonomous vehicle innovation, but a global leader in regulation\".

The objects, which were used to produce tools and weapons, were found on grazing land in Llangynfelyn, Ceredigion, by Nick Yallope and Peter Nicholas.\"Roman ingots are exceptionally rare and represent a tangible link to Wales' Roman industrial past,\" said landowner and farmer Geraint Jenkins, who granted the detectorists permission to search on the land.Yallope said he felt \"incredibly proud to have uncovered something so rare and important to our local heritage\". \"Unlocking a new chapter of our area's past is incredibly exciting,\" said Yallope, while Nicholas said he was trying to \"save history for the local community and future generations\". Carrie Canham from Ceredigion Museum in Aberystwyth said the artefacts were the first of their kind to be found in west Wales and \"highlight Ceredigion's significance in Emperor Domitian Caesar Augustus's empire building\".\"Ceredigion's rich mineral and ore deposits were a major reason the Romans sought to conquer this area,\" she added.Nick Yallope/Peter NicolasThe lead ingots were unearthed on grazing land in CeredigionShe said lead mined in the area travelled across the breadth of the Roman Empire, adding that the museum was excited at the prospect of acquiring these \"remarkable objects\". It is planning to share the story in a new archaeology gallery opening in 2027. Jenkins, the farmer and landowner where the find was made, said he was \"astonished\" at the discovery, adding it was \"remarkable to think that land we now farm organically once played a role in a much wider Roman landscape\".What should you do if you discover treasure?Those not reporting finding treasure can face a fine or be jailed, and there are different rules for Scotland and Northern Ireland.Those who find treasure will be contacted either by a Finds Liaison Officer or museum curator to discuss the find. They will also be issued with a receipt. The object or objects found will then be assessed by experts to determine if they meet the legal definition of \"treasure\" under the Treasure Act 1996.More top stories",

    "body": "2 hours agoJennifer McKiernan & Brian WheelerPolitical reportersBBC/ UK ParliamentSir Keir Starmer speaks in the Commons at Prime Minister's QuestionsSir Keir Starmer has told MPs he would \"look at ways\" to make the student loans system in England \"fairer\".The promise follows an attack by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who said the system was \"at breaking point\" and had become a \"debt trap\" for graduates.Campaigners have called for changes to the system, after Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced last year that the salary threshold at which some student loans must be paid back in England would be frozen.Student loans include money the government lends to cover the cost of university or college course tuition fees, capped at £9,535 in England and Wales for this academic year. It needs to be repaid with interest once the graduate earns over a set threshold.The chancellor announced plans to freeze that threshold in England from next year, meaning more graduates will need to start paying back their loans earlier than before.The Conservatives have said they would cap interest rates for some loans at the Retail Price Index (RPI) instead of higher commercial rates if elected.At Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch asked Sir Keir to cut interest rates on student loans now, saying: \"The system is now at breaking point for graduates. \"I believe student loans have become a debt trap,\" she added.Sir Keir replied: \"I'm glad to learn that the leader of the opposition has finally admitted that they scammed the country on this, and that applies to everything they did in government.\"We inherited their broken student loans system. We've already introduced maintenance grants to improve the situation, which they scrapped, and we will look at ways to make it fairer.\"The prime minister said other economic improvements would also support students, including the news the average energy bill would be £117 lower this year.\"We promised to cut the cost of living. We are cutting the cost of living,\" he said.Badenoch attacked Sir Keir again over his promise in the 2020 Labour leadership election that he would abolish tuition fees if he took over the reins from Jeremy Corbyn.\"For the record energy bills are still higher than when he came into office,\" she noted.Some graduates have told the BBC they have cut their hours at work in order to reduce their salaries to under the repayment threshold.Earlier on Wednesday, more than 20 Labour MPs spoke during a debate in Westminster Hall to call for changes to the student loan system in England, criticising \"rip-off\" interest rates and unfair changes to repayment terms.Several criticised the decision to freeze thresholds as \"moving the goal posts\" and changing the terms of loans retrospectively, and Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the Labour MP for Clapham and Brixton Hill, compared the terms of student loans \"to something that a loan shark would offer\".The Rethink Repayment campaign is calling for interest on the loans to be capped at the lower Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, a lower repayment rate of 5%, and a reversal of the threshold freezes.The Liberal Democrats have also called for an overhaul of the student finance system, including writing off some debt after 10 years of public service for nurses, police and teachers.However, freezing the repayment threshold was defended by Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, who told BBC Breakfast that the average graduate would only pay back £8 more a month.And, asked if the government was considering cutting interest on student loans or freezing thresholds, the prime minister's official spokesman said the government was keeping things under review.He said \"work continues\" on the matter but declined to give any more details or a timeframe, saying \"we'll update when we have one\".Referring back to Phillipson's comments, he said the government was looking at ways it might be able to make Plan 2 student loans \"fairer\", and when asked whether it could be brought up by the Chancellor next week, he added: \"I won't get ahead of the spring statement.\"Speaking after PMQs, Badenoch's spokesman said the Conservatives have fully-costed proposals to cut interest rates on some loans but are not ruling out also backing a threshold freeze.\"We are looking at more but we are not going to announce anything until it is fully costed,\" he said.\"What we want to see is the debt burden lifted and graduates given some hope because at the moment they are drowning in debt and a lack of job opportunities.\"Under devolved education systems, Northern Irish students pay about half the amount of tuition fees of those in England and Wales, and most Scottish students do not pay any tuition fees.",

    "body": "UK government denies Chagos Islands deal is paused, despite minister's comment20 minutes agoJoshua Nevett,Political reporterandDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos dealThe government has said there is \"no pause\" in its Chagos Islands deal despite a minister earlier telling MPs that the UK was \"pausing\" the process of passing the legislation to transfer control of the territory to Mauritius.A government source said \"there is no pause, we have never set a deadline and timings will be announced in the usual way\".Foreign Office Minister Hamish Falconer was answering questions from MPs when he said the UK was \"pausing\" the process while \"discussions\" happened with the United States.The move comes after US President Donald Trump urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to scrap the deal last week, despite earlier expressing support for the treaty.The Chagos Islands - officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory - are located in the Indian Ocean and Britain has controlled them since the early 19th century.The deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the territory to Mauritius, and pay an average cost of £101m a year to lease back a joint UK-US military base on the largest island.The UK is in the process of passing legislation to ratify the deal and on Wednesday, Falconer faced questions about that in the House of Commons.\"There was support from the US administration for this treaty, which has not changed,\" Falconer said.\"There clearly has been a statement from the president of the United States more recently, which is very significant. \"And as I told the house [of Commons] we are now discussing those concerns with the United States directly. We have a process going through Parliament in relation to the treaty.\"We will bring that back to Parliament at the appropriate time. We are pausing for discussions with our American counterparts.\"In earlier comments in the Commons, Falconer said the deal was going \"through Parliament in the normal way\".\"We are pausing in discussions with the United States,\" Falconer said. \"And those discussions continue.\"Earlier, the prime minister's spokesperson told reporters the UK's position had not changed and the focus was on \"discussions with the US on next steps\".Mauritius's Attorney General Gavin Glover said he was not surprised by the minister's comments.\"There has been no discussion on the legislative process for the last three weeks,\" Glover.\"I note that it says a pause from the legislative process and not a backing off. \"I am in close contact with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\"The deal has been thrown into doubt by President Trump, who last week posted on his Truth Social platform to urge Sir Keir to not \"give away Diego Garcia\", home to the UK-US military base.Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and called the deal \"a blight on our great ally\".The comments came despite the US Department of State giving its official backing to the UK government's plan a day earlier.The US State Department said it had nothing to add, following Falconer's comments in the Commons.Legislation delayedThe Diego Garcia Military Base and British Indian Ocean Territory Bill is designed to enshrine the Chagos Islands agreement into UK law.It is in the final stages of its passage through Parliament and is currently in the House of Lords.A debate on the bill was pulled in January after the Conservatives - who have long opposed the deal - tabled an amendment calling for a pause \"in light of the changing geopolitical circumstances\".The bill has not been on the order paper in the Lords since then and no date has been set for the next stage.Last week, Politico reported that the legislation would be delayed but Justice Minister Alex Davies-Jones said it would return to the Lords \"as soon as parliamentary time allows\".Opposition pressureBritain has controlled the Chagos Islands since 1814 and evicted its inhabitants in the 1960s to make way for the military base on Diego Garcia.The islands became formally established as an overseas territory in 1965, after the British government paid Mauritius a £3m grant to retain the archipelago.Last year, the UK government agreed to hand over control of the islands to Mauritius, arguing the future of the military base had been threatened by recent international court decisions.Under the deal, the UK has agreed to pay £101m annually for 99 years to keep control of the UK-US military base.Many Chagossians see the deal as a betrayal and want to see the UK retain sovereignty over the islands so they can one day return to their homeland.The Conservatives and Reform UK are staunchly opposed to the deal as well.MPs from those parties have been travelling to Washington to lobby American politicians, in a campaign aimed building opposition to the agreement in the US.Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Reform UK MP Nigel Farage said there was \"no basis, historically, culturally, in any way, for Mauritius to have a claim on those islands\".He said the region could \"finish up with a turf war going on between India and China in the region\".Farage claimed the Maldives were about to issue a counter-claim to the International Court of Justice over the Chagos Islands in \"just a few days\".\"If anybody has the right to the sovereignty of those islands, it is the Maldives and not Mauritius,\" Farage said. \"And I would urge you to pause all of this.\"Shadow foreign minister Wendy Morton said the Chagos deal would leave Britain \"weaker, poorer and less safe\". \"This is not a legal necessity,\" Morton said. \"It's a political choice made by a floundering prime minister and it's British taxpayers who are left to pay the price.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoBen HattonBBC NewsReutersBill Gates \"took responsibility for his actions\" and addressed his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a meeting with staff from his charitable foundation, the organisation said.\"Bill spoke candidly, addressing several questions in detail,\" the Gates Foundation said in a statement.The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that Gates apologised to staff, said he had two affairs with Russian women which Epstein later found out about, and in relation to the late financier said: \"I did nothing illicit. I saw nothing illicit.\"Gates has come under renewed scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein following the release of files by the US Department of Justice in January. The Microsoft co-founder, 70, has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims.The WSJ reported that Gates said it was a \"huge mistake to spend time with Epstein\", but insisted he \"never spent any time with victims, the women around him\".\"I apologise to other people who are drawn into this because of the mistake that I made,\" he told staff, according to the US newspaper, which said it had reviewed a recording of Gates's remarks. It reported that Gates said images of him with women, whose faces are redacted, included in the so-called Epstein files were pictures that the late financier asked him to take with his assistants after their meetings.US House Oversight CommitteeAn image released by the US House Oversight Committee from the Epstein files in December last yearGates told the foundation's staff he met Epstein in 2011 - years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution - adding that he said he was aware of some \"18-month thing\" that had limited Epstein's travel, but that he didn't properly check his background, according to the report.He continued to meet Epstein through 2014, and spent time with him abroad, he reportedly said, adding that he \"never stayed overnight\" or visited Epstein's island.The relationship continued even after his ex-wife expressed doubts, he is reported to have said, adding: \"To give her credit, she was always kind of sceptical about the Epstein thing.\"Epstein told him he had links with other billionaires and suggested he could help raise money for charitable causes Gates was engaged with, the paper reported.A spokesperson for the Gates Foundation said in a statement: \"This was a scheduled town hall with employees, which Bill does twice a year. \"In the conversation, Bill answered questions submitted by foundation staff on a range of issues, including the release of the Epstein files, the foundation's work in AI, and the future of global health.  \"In the town hall, Bill spoke candidly, addressing several questions in detail, and took responsibility for his actions.\"Gates established his philanthropic organisation alongside his then wife, Melinda French Gates. They divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.In an interview with an NPR podcast earlier this month she said the latest release of files dredged up \"painful times in my marriage\".Watch: Melinda Gates reacts to ex-husband in Epstein files\"I am so happy to be away from all the muck,\" she said, adding elsewhere in the interview: \"Whatever questions remain there of what - I can't even begin to know all of it - those questions are for those people and for even my ex-husband. \"They need to answer to those things, not me.\"US media have reported that before their separation Melinda had been upset about her husband's association with Epstein. After their split was announced, Bill Gates acknowledged having had an affair with a Microsoft employee in 2019.In his reported remarks to staff on Tuesday, Gates said he met the two women with whom he said he had affairs with through his own social and business activities.

At no time were financial payments made by the foundation to Epstein, nor was he employed by the foundation at any time,\" it said.",

    "body": "Gianluca Prestianni will miss the second leg of Benfica's Champions League tie against Real Madrid after Uefa rejected the club's appeal against his suspension.The Argentine winger was handed a provisional one-match ban after Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr reported alleged racist abuse during last week's 1-0 defeat in a knockout round play-off first leg.Benfica said they would appeal the decision, but accepted it was unlikely to \"have any practical effect\" before Wednesday's return at the Bernabeu.Uefa has imposed the ban on a provisional basis, pending the result of a full investigation by an ethics and disciplinary inspector, and further punishment could still be handed out to the 20-year-old.Prestianni trained alongside his Benfica team-mates at Real Madrid's stadium on Tuesday in the hope his ban could be overturned in time to feature.But the Portuguese club's request was dismissed by Uefa's Appeals Body and the player remains provisionally suspended for their next match in European club competition, which is Wednesday's game.Prestianni, who has denied racially abusing Vinicius, would otherwise have been eligible to face the Spanish hosts while the investigation took place.However, European football's governing body said there was enough evidence to adequately support a \"prima facie\" case against him in relation to the use of discriminatory language.",

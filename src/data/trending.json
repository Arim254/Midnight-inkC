    "body": "Bills' bad day gives Pats path to top spot - best of NFL week 10Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Josh Allen and Drake Maye will meet in week 15 for what could be an AFC East title deciderByPaul HighamBBC Sport JournalistWeek 10 again delivered, with a huge upset for the Buffalo Bills proving the 'any given Sunday' mantra that draws so many people into the NFL.That result may have opened things up for the New England Patriots to creep back into a leading position they used to occupy, with a schedule that gives them an edge over their 8-2 rivals.Over in the NFC the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams had perfect results to set up a monster clash next week, while our player of the week is chasing records as well as the MVP.Here's the pick of week 10.The breakdown - just a bad day for Buffalo?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Did Josh Allen try too much or was it just a bad day for Buffalo?Was it just an emotional comedown from beating the Chiefs last week or something more? That's the question for the Bills to answer.The Bills had won seven in a row against Miami but were second best from the start as the Dolphins ran out 30-13 winners in an eye-opening result - and performance.MVP Josh Allen only got the team's opening first down in the third quarter and first points in the fourth - yes Miami had 10 days to prepare but it was still a massive egg laid by one of the league's top offences.Tua Tagovailoa threw two touchdowns but running back De'Von Achane was the devastating difference, with 225 total yards and two scores.Bottling up the league's best rushing attack was also key, with James Cook and company registering just 86 yards, their fewest of the season and just over half their 161.5-yard average.Then there were the three crucial turnovers, and the two from Allen in particular. An interception in the end zone meaning a nine-minute drive produced nothing, and his fourth-quarter fumble that Miami turned into seven points just two plays later.It was classic 'old Buffalo' as they shot themselves in the foot, getting into a hole on defence and Allen trying to do too much to dig his team out of it - not the calm, controlled, well-balanced Bills we've seen this season. Miami have served up a bit of everything this season so the jury's out on whether this is the start of something, but for Buffalo they'll need an instant response in a tough game against Tampa Bay next week as the Patriots are sneaking into a nice lead at the top of the AFC East.In focus - Patriots see path to surprise top seedImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, TreVeyon Henderson clocked the fifth fastest speed in the NFL this seasonSpeaking of the Patriots, they're one of three 8-2 teams in the NFL, all AFC sides, but are they the best?You can pick holes in New England, Denver and Indianapolis really for feasting on the lesser sides, with only five of their combined 24 victories coming against teams with a winning record - and one of those was the Colts beating the Broncos.Denver beat the champion Eagles in Philadelphia and are kings of the fourth-quarter while Indy can ride Jonathan Taylor, but the Patriots adding Sunday's win in Tampa Bay to their primtime success in Buffalo seems like a statement.Their two defeats came in new head coach Mike Vrabel's first three games, with seven straight wins, just like Denver, since then - but taking down Baker Mayfield after the Bucs had a bye to prepare was huge.Drake Maye's MVP claims won't go away, and he certainly deserves point for bravery after taking some savage hits in Tampa Bay but hanging in there to steer his side to victory.The defence is solid and rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson exploded on Sunday with 147 yards and two exhilerating touchdowns of 55 and 69 yards - becoming just the fourth ball carrier to break 22mph this season on his first score.While you can argue who 'the best' is technically, the Pats should be favourites to finish with the best record thanks to their schedule - which includes just one game against a winning team, albeit a huge one against Buffalo.Visiting Baltimore is also tough, but Denver have it even tougher in the AFC West with the Chiefs to play twice, the Chargers (who could also challenge for top seed but face the same problem) and also the Packers on the schedule.The Colts also face the Chiefs, and have the Seahawks, 49ers and two games with the 5-4 Jaguars to contend with. There's a long way to go but the door is open for a shock top seed in the AFC.Image caption, Who has the best run-in between the Patriots, Colts and Broncos?Coming up - Rams & Seahawks set for week 11 showdownTwo teams with solid claims to be better than all of the three 8-2 sides are NFC West rivals the Seahawks and Rams, who both put up 40 burgers to go to 7-2 ahead of next week's Hollywood blockbuster meeting between the two in LA.They've both won four in a row, have quarterbacks in Matthew Stafford and Sam Darnold playing at an elite level (although Darnold had turnover issues on Sunday) with top receivers, and defences allowing under 20 points a game.Both could easily be undefeated as well - especially the Rams as their two defeats came in overtime against th 49ers and then that agonising loss in Philadelphia when they had a game-winning field goal with the last kick blocked and returned by the Eagles for a touchdown.Seattle also lost to San Francisco, with a late touchdown in week one, before losing to the last kick of the game against the Buccaneers - so they're genuinely two of the best sides in the NFL.The upcoming game on Sunday could be the best of the season so far. Player of the week - Jonathan TaylorImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jonathan Taylor is chasing down multiple rushing and touchdown recordsJonathan Taylor could be on for a record season after his incredible display in Berlin - running for 244 yards, scoring three touchdowns and adding another 42 receiving yards.He's currently on pace for 1,936 rushing yards, so Eric Dickerson's long-held record of 2,105 is still within his grasp with more big games like this one.Taylor could also have Chris Johnson's scrimmage yards record of 2,509 in his sights as he's on target for 2,378 - and he's shown he can break off for big runs and touchdowns at any moment.A fourth hat-trick of the season on Sunday is the most any player has managed through 10 weeks, and with 15 rushing touchdowns and 17 overall he can also chase LaDainian Tomlinson's records of 28 rushing and 31 overall scores.His 83-yard touchdown on Sunday is the longest of the season, he's also clocked the fastest speed of the season at 22.38mph, but has strength to accompany that speed, with 228 yards after contact against the Falcons, which the NFL's NextGen Stats says is the most in eight years.MVP voters love records, and Taylor could grab a few of them if he continues in this form.Week 10 game notes, stats & recordsThe Baltimore Ravens looked dead and buried earlier this season, but a win over the Vikings plus Pittsburgh's defeat at the Chargers means the AFC North is up for grabs now - with the two fierce rivals still to face each other twice, including in the final game of the season.Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell took over offensive play calling duties from coordinator John Morton after three below-par games, admittedly against good defences. The result in Washington was 44 points scored, 546 yards, 30 first downs and Jared Goff going largely untouched. Campbell may have the clipboard and glasses on for a few more games going forward.Matthew Stafford became just the ninth player to eclipse 400 regular season touchdown passes as the Rams beat the 49ers - while also becoming the first player ever with four touchdowns and no interceptions in three straight games.It's not often the New York Jets and 'amazing' have gone together this season, but in their win over Cleveland they scored on a 99-yard kick return and then a 74-yard punt return in the space of 36 seconds.Jaxson Dart became the only rookie quarterback in NFL history with a rushing touchdown in five straight games, but the Giants lost him to concussion before losing a 10-point lead to the Bears.Giants head coach Brian Daboll will feel the heat turning up on him if he fails to find a way to protect a quarterback that looks every inch the face of the franchise in the future.Caleb Williams is growing into the face of the Chicago Bears by leading another late comeback after last week's epic in Cincinnati.Watch - Whole 10 Yards trade deadline specialMedia caption, NFL Trade Deadline",

Orban wants to keep buying it, but Trump wants countries to wean themselves off Russian energy and help put the brakes on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Will Trump choose to keep an old friend close, or put pressure on Putin? We speak to Nick Thorpe, the BBC’s correspondent in Budapest, who has covered Orban since the 1980s. \nProducer: Viv Jones \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nMix: Travis Evans  \nPhoto: U.S. President Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Soon after, he was seen arriving at his home in western Paris.On 21 October, the former centre-right president, 70, was sentenced to five years for conspiring to fund his 2007 election campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. His legal team immediately filed a request seeking his release.Christophe Ingrain, one of Sarkozy's lawyers, hailed his client's release as \"a step forward\" and said they would now be preparing for the appeal trial due to be held in March.One of the conditions of Sarkozy's release is that he does not contact any justice ministry employees. During his incarceration, he was visited by Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin. The visit prompted 30 French lawyers to file a complaint against Darmanin, highlighting what they said was a conflict of interest as Darmanin was a former colleague and friend of Sarkozy's.Speaking to a court in Paris via video link, Sarkozy described his time in solitary confinement as \"gruelling\" and \"a nightmare\".Public prosecutor Damien Brunet recommended that Sarkozy's request for release be granted, but that the former president be banned from contacting other witnesses in the so-called \"Libyan dossier\".Sarkozy, who has always denied any wrongdoing, told the court via video link that he had never had the \"mad idea\" of asking Gaddafi for money and stated he would \"never admit to something I haven't done\".Sarkozy also paid tribute to prison staff who had made his time in prison \"bearable\". \"They have shown exceptional humanity,\" he said.Sarkozy's wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and two of the former president's sons were present in the courtroom to support him. ReutersTwo of Sarkozy's sons, Jean and Pierre, were in court on MondaySarkozy is the first French ex-leader placed behind bars since World War Two Nazi collaborationist leader Philippe Pétain was jailed for treason in 1945.Since entering prison, Sarkozy has been held in a cell in the isolation wing. He had a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV – for which he paid a monthly €14 (£12) fee – and the right to a small fridge.He also had the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits as well as written and phone contact – but was is in effect in solitary confinement. He was allowed just one hour a day for exercise, by himself in the wing's segregated courtyard.Two bodyguards were stationed in nearby cells, which the interior minister Laurent Nuñez was due to Sarkozy's status. There was \"obviously a threat against him\", Nuñez said.Sarkozy was president from 2007-2012. Ever since he left office, he has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.",

    "body": "54 minutes agoJude SheerinGetty ImagesTrump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has been pardoned at federal levelUS President Donald Trump has pardoned his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and dozens of other allies who stood accused of trying to overturn the result of the 2020 election.He also pardoned his former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in a proclamation that vowed to \"end a grave national injustice\".Others who benefited from the clemency were a number of so-called false electors, who were accused of trying to hijack the process to certify Joe Biden, a Democrat, as the winner of the election five years ago.Trump's move is largely symbolic, however, since pardons only apply to federal crimes and all of the recipients were charged by state-level prosecutors only.Ed Martin, a justice department attorney, posted the \"full, complete and unconditional\" pardons on X.The pardons, said the text of the proclamation, would continue \"the process of national reconciliation\".White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to the BBC: \"Getting prosecuted for challenging results is something that happens in communist Venezuela, not the United States of America, and President Trump is putting an end to the Biden Regime's communist tactics once and for all.\"This round of clemency does not apply to Trump himself - who denies any wrongdoing - though the president has long maintained he has the power to pardon himself. But any such proclamation by him would face legal challenges.Giuliani declared bankruptcy two years ago after being found liable for $148m (£112m) for spreading falsehoods about Georgia election workers. He was disbarred as a lawyer in Washington DC and New York.Getty ImagesSidney Powell (centre) and Jenna Ellis (background left) were also pardonedAlso pardoned are former Trump lawyers Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro, who had filed unsuccessful lawsuits challenging the 2020 vote outcome.Powell had said after that election that electronic voting systems switched millions of votes to Biden and that the Democrat won thanks to \"communist money\" – claims that led Mr Trump's team to distance itself from her.On the day he returned to office this year, the Republican president pardoned hundreds of his supporters who were charged with involvement in the US Capitol riot of 2021.Trump himself was prosecuted on charges of plotting to overturn his loss in 2020, but that case brought by Biden's justice department was thrown out after Trump was re-elected.Some of the other election-related cases against Trump allies in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin have stalled or collapsed.Last September, a Michigan judge dismissed forgery and conspiracy charges against 15 Republicans accused of a plot to support Trump's claims he had won the 2020 vote.Electors are part of the 538-member Electoral College that officially elects presidents, based on the state-by-state results of the general election.",

    "body": "2 hours agoEmma SimpsonBusiness correspondentThe Post Office has agreed to extend its deal to use the controversial Horizon IT system for another year.It is paying a further £41m to the Japanese-owned company Fujitsu to use Horizon until March 2027.The accounting system has been at the centre of the Post Office scandal in which more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after faulty Horizon software made it look like money was missing from their branch accounts.A Post Office spokesperson said it was \"committed to moving away from Fujitsu and off the Horizon system as soon as possible\".\"We are bringing in a different supplier to take over Horizon whilst a new system is developed, and this process is well under way,\" they added. \"We expect to award a contract for a new supplier to manage Horizon by July 2026, according to current timelines.\"Sources have told the BBC the contract could be extended until 2028 while the new supplier takes over the running of Horizon, which is used by sub-postmasters at branches across the UK.But the replacement of Horizon is still a long way off.The Post Office had been working on a project called NBIT to build a new in-house alternative, but there were growing concerns about its soaring costs and complexity.NBIT was ditched shortly after new Post Office chair Nigel Railton launched his turnaround plan for the business in November 2024.Post Office bosses have shifted to buying software from external suppliers and a procurement process for this has begun.A government spokesperson said: \"We are working as quickly as possible to ensure the Post Office has the technology it needs, including replacing Horizon, as a vital part of the company's wider transformation.\"The fact they still use the Horizon system indicates past under-investment, which can't be rectified overnight, so we need to ensure postmasters have the tools they need to continue serving their customers in the interim.\"Fujitsu executives have apologised for the company's role in the scandal, admitting that Horizon had bugs errors and defects from the start.The boss of its European arm, Paul Patterson, has acknowledged that Fujitsu had a \"moral obligation\" to contribute financially but no timeline or figure has so far been set.",

    "body": "Just nowJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterEPA/ShutterstockA second migrant who had been sent from the UK to France under the government's \"one in, one out\" deal has returned to the UK, the Home Office has confirmed.The man was detained immediately, having been detected by biometrics, and will be sent back to France \"as quickly as possible\", the Home Office has said.The \"one in, one out\" pilot scheme with France is aimed at deterring migrants from coming to the UK in small boats across the English Channel.Last month, an Iranian man re-entered the UK by small boat one month after being removed to France. He was deported again last Wednesday.A Home Office spokesperson said officials would continue to catch and return anyone trying to re-enter the UK.\"Anyone looking to return to the UK after being removed under the UK-France agreement is wasting their time and money,\" the spokesperson said.\"This individual was detected by biometrics and detained immediately. His case will be expedited, and he will be returned to France as quickly as possible.\"The message is clear: if you try to return to the UK you will be sent back. We will do whatever it takes to scale up removals of illegal migrants and secure our borders.\"The first flight carrying a cross-Channel small boat migrant, an Indian national, landed in Paris on 18 September.The UK-France deal for a pilot scheme was struck in September and aims to deter small boat crossings by returning migrants.About 100 men were detained after arriving in the UK on a small boat, sent to  immigration removal centres near Heathrow, and told they may be returned to France. Last week, the Home Office confirmed 94 migrants have been returned to France and 57 people have arrived in the UK under the scheme so far.More than 500 migrants crossed the Channel by small boat on Saturday, 349 on Sunday, and 39,075 have made the journey so far this year.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is now considering a major restructure of the UK's immigration rules modelled on Denmark's system. At Labour conference in September, Mahmood promised to \"do whatever it takes\" to regain control of Britain's borders and is said to be impressed that Denmark has driven down its number of successful asylum claims to a 40-year low.Mahmood wants to reduce incentives for people seeking to enter the UK by tightening rules on family reunions, and make it easier to remove those found to have no right to stay.Downing Street insisted that the detection of a second \"one in, one out\" migrant returning to the UK showed the system was working.The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"You've got a person who's arrived at the front door, who's been detected immediately, their journey has been wasted completely.\"They are in line to return to France, just as the previous case was - out of pocket and out of chances - they are destined to go back straight to France and their money spent on this dangerous crossing will have been spent in vain.\"Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson accused the Home Office of \"staggering levels of incompetence\" and called for asylum seekers to be moved out of hotels as well as \"large-scale returns agreements\" with all safe countries. \"Failures like this show just how broken our system is,\" he said. \"Now is the time for Labour to back up their big promises with actions.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp nearly 18,000 migrants had arrived in the UK since the deal was struck, with \"only a handful removed...which is why they continue to flood in\". Philp said only the Conservatives had a clear plan to tackle illegal migration, saying the party would leave the ECHR and remove all illegal immigrants within a week of arrival.He added: \"But Keir Starmer doesn't have the backbone to do this, and Reform are a one-man band with no detailed plans.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "14 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC News Nell FrizzellBetween deadlines, school runs and the constant \"what's for dinner?\" chat, even the best relationships can start running on autopilot.It doesn't mean the spark has gone or that you've stopped loving your partner, but rather that life has got in the way.Writer Nell Frizzell knows this all too well - after 10 years with her partner and two young children, she admits she doesn't have as much time or energy for her husband as she once did.\"I know we're told to focus on quality time, physical touch and gaze into each other's eyes lovingly but actually I am shouting at my husband to turn the eggs off.\" Frizzell says she's at a \"crunch point\" in her life. Her time, body and attention are being pulled in every direction - she's raising children, caring for elderly parents, running the home and working all at the same time.\"And within all of that, where do you have the time to look into someone's eyes and say you're wonderful?\" she asks.Bring other people inBut Frizzell has discovered something that helps keep her relationship connection alive - something she calls a \"third energy\".Not in the bedroom, she laughs, but at the dinner table.\"If we go away, we go with another family and if we go out to dinner, I love having friends there,\" she explains.It's a surprisingly simple idea - but Frizzell says having dinner with another couple, friends or family really does work as the presence of other people naturally changes the dynamic.She says sometimes a so-called date night \"where you're sat across the table with the person you live with and trying to come up with something new to say\" can be intense, so another person can help provide a new conversation starter or a fresh perspective.Frizzell says: \"I find him incredibly attractive when we're with people we don't see all the time as they ask him questions I wouldn't think to ask or tell him things I wouldn't tell him.\"Nell FrizellNell and her husband say a \"third energy\" has really improved their relationship Psychotherapist Susanna Abse says a little space and variety can be vital to a successful relationship.\"Couples can end up moving around each other but avoiding real contact,\" she says.Truly noticing your partner can make a big difference.  \"Instead of coming downstairs in the morning and getting on with millions of chores, see what state your partner is in.\" Abse recommends asking them questions like how they are feeling or what their day looks like as \"curiosity is key\". Clinical psychologist Dr Amani Milligan says spending quality time together is also important.That doesn't mean a grand gesture and Dr Milligan says it can be as simple as taking a random Thursday off work together or setting rules like no phones before bed so you can catch up on each other's days.Relationships can come with endless distractions from emails and notifications on your phone to endless piles of laundry or dishes that need sorting.Abse says electronic devices can make couples more distant.\"Protest if your partner is on their phone all the time and set some rules you can both agree to.\"Schedule sexIt's near impossible to talk about keeping love alive without mentioning physical intimacy and Frizzell swears by scheduling it.\"It might feel administrative to say 'this is when we'll have sex' but with small children, it's absolutely key and it's something to look forward to.\"Abse agrees with that practical approach and says if you're not having sex \"you have to recognise the risk in that\" if you're both not happy with the arrangement as \"affairs often arise from unsatisfied needs\".When we're time poor or have a lot on, sex can be one of the first things to go but Abse says you should try to \"allow yourself to be persuadable\".\"You don't get into bed feeling very sexual but maybe with your partner's attention that might change.\"Focusing more on each other and seeing her partner anew has improved Frizzell's relationship.The final lesson she has learnt is that it's important to keep a little mystery from each other. \"Close the toilet door and have a bit of separation - by all means have a joint project but that shouldn't be going to the loo,\" she laughs.",

    "body": "Image source, BBC / Kris MillerByElizabeth RizziniLead Weather Presenter Monday marks ten years since Storm Abigail became the first officially named UK storm. Abigail lashed north-west Scotland from 12 to 13 November 2015 bringing gusts of up to 84mph (135km/h).Since November 2015, the UK Met Office, in conjunction with Met Éireann, the Irish weather service, and KNMI, the Dutch weather service, have named a total of 70 storms. Every September a new list of potential storm names is published by the three weather agencies to mark the start of the season which runs from autumn to summer. More recently names have been suggested by members of the public too.Why are storms named?Before the storm naming system came into effect, the most notorious storms were usually known by the day on which they fell - such as the Burns Day storm in 1990 or the St Jude's Day storm of October 2013.However, giving a storm a name before it hits has become an important tool for the media, weather agencies and the public to engage people when warning of the potential dangers to life and property. Will Lang, Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \"Storm naming is more than a label, it's a public safety tool that makes severe weather easier to remember, talk about and follow.\" According to the Met Office the strategy works. In August 2025 when Storm Floris hit, 93% of people living in the amber alert area were aware of the warning.Image source, Reuters/ James MayImage caption, Storm Eunice ripped part of the roof from the O2 Arena in east London in February 2022 When are storms named?Storms in the UK are named based on the expected impact, according to the Met Office's National Severe Weather Warnings service. This is calculated by considering both the potential damage and disruption the weather may cause, and the likelihood of those impacts occurring.Usually these impacts will result in an amber or occasionally a rare red weather warning being issued.Image source, Met OfficeImage caption, The severity of Met Office weather warnings - red, amber and yellow is judged by using this matrix based on how high the impacts of a weather event could be and the likelihood of the event happening. Storms are usually named due to the strength of the winds but other impacts such as rain or snow can also be taken into account. Storms Bert and Darragh in 2024 and Storm Babet in October 2023 for example,  were notable for the amount of rainfall and flooding caused. Storm Desmond in 2015 saw the highest daily rainfall of any named UK storm (267mm).Two rare red weather warnings were issued for Storm Eunice in 2022. It was one of three named storms to impact the UK in just one week in February. The others were Dudley and Franklin. Eunice was the most severe storm to affect England and Wales since February 2014.Storm Éowyn in January 2025 was the strongest windstorm for over a decade. Red warnings for were issued for Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland.It was named three days before impact and the media was credited with raising public engagement in and awareness of the severe weather warnings.Image source, BBC/ Emma OrrImage caption, Storm Éowyn in January 2025 was the strongest windstorm for over a decadeStorms which affect the UK usually also have impacts in other areas of north-west Europe. So sometimes Met Éireann will name a storm first because it will have a severe impact in Ireland, but will produce more benign effects in the UK and the Netherlands. Storm Jocelyn in January 2024 is a good example as it caused more damage in the Republic of Ireland.How are storm names chosen?Lists of names from A to W are issued in September which is the start of every storm season. Met Office releases new storm names for 2025-26In line with the US National Hurricane Centre naming convention none start with Q, U, X, Y and Z.Since storm names are suggested in collaboration with the Irish and Dutch weather services they reflect the diversity of all three countries and can result in some unusual choices. Some names are some suggested by members of the public and some can be inspired by real-life people, public figures and even pets.In the most recent storm list, \"Bram\" is for Bram Stoker, the Dracula author, while \"Dave\" was suggested by a member of the public to celebrate \"my husband who snores three times louder than any storm\".\"Ruby\" named after a beloved grandmother, was the most popular name beginning with R nominated for the current season.However, since all lists begin with A and end with W, it is generally unlikely that names further down the list will actually be reached. For example, there have never been more than 12 named UK storm names in a season.  Names from the list the list starting with M , N. O etc have never been used. The busiest storm season was in 2023/24, which ended with Storm Lilian.The quietest season in the last ten years was 2022/23 with Antoni and Betty both named in August just before the end of the season.Ex-hurricanes keep their namesStorm Ophelia hit the UK in October 2017 bringing wind gusts of up to 90mph on the 30th anniversary of the Great Storm of 1987. Ophelia was in fact an ex-hurricane named by the US National Hurricane Center. When storms are named by other weather agencies they are retained.Similarly Storm Herminia in January 2025 kept its Spanish name as it swept across the UK. Storm Amy was first on the UK list this current season. It was named in early October. Storm Benjamin which affected the UK later the same month, was in fact named by the French Met Service, meaning that the next storm name on the UK list is Storm Bram, not Chandra. How does climate change impact the likelihood of named storms?Detecting long-term trends is challenging as windstorm activity naturally fluctuates from year to year and across decades.Currently there is no clear evidence of an increase or decrease in either their number or intensity.Scientists are more confident that the coastal impacts of windstorms, from storm surges and high waves, will worsen as sea-levels rise.Climate change is making our weather more extreme and a warmer world means that when it does rain, that rain will tend to be heavier with more flooding risks.",

    "description": "The International Olympic Committee has moved a step closer to introducing a blanket ban on transgender women from female categories across all sports",
    "body": "The International Olympic Committee has moved a step closer to introducing a blanket ban on transgender women from female categories across all sports.IOC president Kirsty Coventry vowed to bring in the policy as part of her election campaign.On Monday the Times reported, external that the ban was set to be announced early next year after a presentation to IOC members by its medical chief.In response, the IOC said that \"the working group is continuing its discussions on this topic and no decisions have been taken yet\".However, sources have told BBC Sport told that a ban is likely to be introduced in 2026.Last week, the IOC's medical and scientific director Dr Jane Thornton gave an update to its members as the organisation works through the details of the potential move. Initial findings of her review are thought to have highlighted the physiological advantages that athletes born male retain, even after reducing testosterone levels. A full IOC Session must vote on any such change, although a blanket ban could be introduced before the 2028 Olympics. Back in March, former swimmer Coventry - a seven-time Olympic medallist - told BBC Sport that the IOC must \"play a leading role\" in discussions in this area, hinting at a major shift in approach.The IOC has previously left sex eligibility regulations to the governing bodies of individual sports, rather than applying a universal approach, with many allowing transgender women athletes to compete in female competition if they lowered their testosterone levels. In June, after being elected, Coventry said a working group on the issue made up of experts and international federations would \"ensure that we find consensus\".She added that IOC members had shown \"overwhelming support\" to protecting the female category in sport. However, the president of the International Paralympic Committee has previously said he is opposed to \"blanket solutions\" for transgender participation policies.In recent years a growing number of sports federations have barred athletes who have undergone male puberty from competing in elite female competition amid concerns over fairness and safety, including World Aquatics and World Athletics. In 2022 British Triathlon become the first British sporting body to establish a new 'open' category in which transgender athletes could compete, while the Rugby Football League and Rugby Football Union banned transgender women from competing in female-only forms of their games.Pressure was also applied by US President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order this year that prevents transgender women from competing in female categories.He said it would include the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles and that he will deny visas for transgender athletes trying to visit the US to compete at the Games.New Zealand's Laurel Hubbard became the first openly transgender women to compete at an Olympics after being selected for the women's weightlifting team at Tokyo 2020.Hubbard, who failed to record a successful lift in the women's +87kg category, had competed in men's events before coming out as transgender in 2013.The IOC's new policy is also set to cover athletes with DSD (differences of sex development). Both World Athletics and World Boxing have introduced genetic sex screening this year to protect the integrity of women's competition.The Paris 2024 Olympics were engulfed in controversy after Algeria's Imane Khelif won the women's welterweight boxing gold medal, a year after being disqualified from the World Championships for reportedly failing a gender eligibility test.The IOC cleared the 25-year-old to compete - along with Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, who was also banned by the suspended International Boxing Association (IBA).The IOC said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female.Both fighters said they were women, had always competed in the women's division, and there was no suggestion they were transgender.Some reports took the IBA saying Khelif has XY chromosomes to speculate that the fighter might have DSD, like runner Caster Semenya. However, the BBC was not able to confirm whether this is or is not the case.",

    "body": "Teenager detained for boy's New Year's Eve murder3 hours agoFamily handout / PA MediaHarry Pitman was stabbed once in the neck on 31 December 2023A teenager has been detained for at least 16 years for murdering 16-year-old Harry Pitman, who was stabbed in the neck at a New Year's Eve fireworks event in north London. Areece Lloyd-Hall, now 18, was convicted at the Old Bailey in October following a retrial after jurors in the first trial were unable to reach a verdict.The fatal stabbing took place at Primrose Hill on 31 December 2023 after Harry accidentally bumped into another boy while \"play-fighting\" and practising high kicks, the jury previously heard.Lloyd-Hall, from Westminster, was found guilty by a majority of 11 to one after almost eight hours of deliberation. He had already been convicted of possessing an offensive weapon.Metropolitan PoliceAreece Lloyd-Hall was convicted of murder following a retrial at the Old Bailey In a televised sentencing on Monday, Mr Justice Cavanagh said Lloyd-Hall had carried a knife to feel \"powerful\" and out of \"bravado\" - and not for protection, as he had claimed in his trial.He said Harry had been a normal \"boisterous and exuberant\" 16-year-old who was \"full of charm\".The judge said: \"You stabbed Harry because you lost your temper with him and you acted like a big man in front of your friends.\"In that \"split second\", he must have realised Harry might be killed or injured, but Mr Justice Cavanagh said: \"In the moment, you did not care if he lived or died.\"The case clearly demonstrated the dangers of young people carrying knives in public and should serve as a warning and deterrent, the judge added.Lloyd-Hall, who was 16 at the time, attacked Harry after he accidentally bumped into another boy while playfighting.The pair, who were there separately, were part of a crowd gathered on Primrose Hill to watch fireworks over the River Thames.Lloyd-Hall lunged at Harry with a pointed dagger, metres from where uniformed police officers were stationed.He collapsed and died minutes later, shortly before midnight.Lloyd-Hall claimed he thought he had only hit Harry with the sheath in an attempt to get Harry away from him.PA MediaPolice officers were seen on Primrose Hill in the days following Harry's deathMembers of Harry's family tearfully embraced after Lloyd-Hall was sent down from the dock.Harry's older sister Tayla Lohan told the court the family struggled to come to terms with the \"senseless and brutal\" killing.On hearing that he had been hurt, his parents had rushed to the park to be with their son, she said.Reading a victim impact statement, she said: \"As a family we all feel guilty that year, 2023, was the first year we had not all celebrated together. \"Harry went out to celebrate with his friends and he did not come home.\"Ms Lohan said the sound of fireworks at any time of the year triggered their grief, and that it would \"never be a happy New Year for our family again\".She described her brother as bright, full of energy and a natural entrepreneur who had studied law at college and aspired to follow his great grandfather into a career in the Army.He was also a keen Tottenham Hotspur supporter and boxing fan and was popular among his peers, she said.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesByMatthew HenryBBC Sport JournalistJoe Root. Century. Australia. You know the rest by now. England's greatest batter has done almost everything except score a Test hundred down under. Some say he needs one during this winter's Ashes series to secure his status as an all-time great. Others would dismiss that as nonsense.But why has Australia remained the anomaly - and is there anything Root can do differently to conquer his final frontier?Root's Australian 'weakness'Root has played 14 Tests in Australia and scored 892 runs, a respectable return.But while he has made nine fifties down under - only Sir Alastair Cook and Ian Bell have made more for England in Australia this century - Root's average of 35.68 in Australia is the lowest of any country he has batted in more than twice.The blot may not be huge but it remains on Root's copybook.Root's first and most obvious weakness is one of his biggest strengths elsewhere.He scores an unusually high amount of runs behind square on the off side - 20% of what analysts CricViz call his 'controlled runs' - but with Australian pitches the quickest and bounciest in the world, that becomes dangerous.\"Clearly, the late glide through third man that he plays on a regular basis in the UK, it does just bounce a little bit more [in Australia],\" says former England captain Michael Vaughan - one of England's best two performing batters in Australia this century.The other, Root's former team-mate Cook, agrees.\"When the pitches are a bit quicker, that is more of a high-risk shot,\" Cook says.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Root's Ashes trips have been journeys of frustration. He has never won a Test in AustraliaThe 'surfboard' mythLooking deeper, Root's problems in Australia have come almost exclusively against pace bowling. He averages 74.33 against spinners down under, even with his Ashes career coinciding with a modern great in Australia off-spinner Nathan Lyon.More specifically, Root's issues have come while facing full or good-length deliveries from pacers, against which his average drops to 26.9 and 26.2 respectively. When the ball is short, even with the pacey surfaces, that average climbs to 63. The difference is stark.The Ashes phony war began in the summer when David Warner described Root's front pad as a \"surfboard\", suggesting he is an lbw candidate.While it is true Australia targeted Root's pads at the start of the 2017-18 series and dismissed him in that manner twice, eight of Root's 10 dismissals in the last series down under were from deliveries that would have missed the stumps. Even in England in 2023, five of Root's six dismissals to Australian pacemen would not have threatened the timbers.Australian plans have changed - or, at the least, Australia are using that inswinger to the pads more sparingly.Of those 10 dismissals in 2021-22, seven were from balls pitching 6-8m from the stumps - what is regarded as a 'good' length - and nine seamed away.It resulted in eight catches between wicketkeeper and gully - four of which were Root attempting to steer to third man off either the front or back foot.\"They say in Australia horizontal bat shots are the way to go because if it bounces it will fly over the top,\" Vaughan says.\"Those straight-batted shots in Australia, back-foot punches, are OK after 30 or 40 overs when the Kookaburra is a bit softer and it is not zipping off the surface, but in the first 10 or 15 overs when you start playing these straight-batted shots there is a chance it bounces more than you expect.\"Image gallerySkip image galleryImage source, CricVizImage caption, Though Root's dismissals were varied in the 2017-18 Ashes, then captain Steve Smith said openly in news conferences their plan was to dismiss him lbwSlide 1 of 3, Beehive of Joe Root's dismissals in 2017-18 Ashes with three deliveries that would have hit the stumps , Though Root's dismissals were varied in the 2017-18 Ashes, then captain Steve Smith said openly in news conferences their plan was to dismiss him lbwOvercome by Cummins & Boland, confident against StarcBowling balls on a good length that move slightly away is hardly cricketing astrophysics. It is the oldest plan in the sport's book. You can argue Root's struggles in Australia are also a result of bad timing. He made his first appearance on Australian shores in the 2013-14 series when arms, legs and a moustache came together for Mitchell Johnson, allowing him to produce a performance for the ages. On two tours since, Root has faced world-class trio Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc and when Hazlewood missed the Boxing Day Test of 2021, Australia summoned a 32-year-old who appeared factory-made for such dismissals.Scott Boland bowled 74 deliveries to Root in the remaining three Tests of that series, conceded 39 runs and dismissed Root four times by consistently probing at that fuller length and finding nicks.One bowler has rarely caused Root such problems.That run left the right-hander's average against Boland at an alarming 9.8 but when the Victorian came to England in 2023, Root scored 63 runs from his 75 balls without being dismissed.With Cummins out of the series opener and Root holding strong records against Starc and Lyon, the Boland head-to-head could be crucial in determining whether Root can break his Australian century duck.Has Root overcome his Boland problem or was the improvement purely down to conditions?Did captaincy wear Root down?Root has been asked repeatedly about his lack of an Australian century in recent months and has given typically sensible answers. \"I go there in a completely different capacity to last time, different circumstances, a lot more experience now and I feel like I have a really good understanding of my game and how I want to manage it in these conditions,\" Root said in September.Previously he has said he wanted the ton \"too much\".It is undeniable Root has travelled in superb red-ball form - an average of 63.44 in 2025 and 14 Test centuries since Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes took over in 2022.He is a far more aggressive batter now and focuses less on technique, but while he went into the 2021-22 Ashes series on an even better run - that tour came at the end of the calendar year in which he scored an England-record 1,708 Test runs - there is one major difference from his previous two tours: he is no longer captain.Root scored eight of his nine Australian fifties during his two tours as captain and six of those failures to convert came after more than 100 draining overs in the field.Was that a result of a beleaguered, at one stage hospitalised, captain's tired mind?\"I would like to think not,\" Root says.\"You pride yourself on being able to manage those moments in the game, whether that is from a fitness element. \"I am a different player now to what I was four years ago or eight years ago and beyond. \"You look at elements of when I played there previously but the landscape is completely different now. \"Being able to draw on things more recently and experiences that have served me well in the last couple of years is what is going to bring the best out of me in the next couple of months.\"Joe Root. Century. Australia. There's only one way those words are going away.England Men's Cricket TeamCricket",

    "body": "12 hours agoEmma SimpsonBusiness correspondentBBCRain drifts across the car park of Crawley's sprawling Asda, but the gloom does little to slow the steady stream of shoppers this midweek afternoon. Parents hurry past with school bags and groceries; car boots slam shut as people load up their weekly shops.For Carol Stimpson, who grew up in the area, the Asda is only a ten‑minute walk from her home, and she pops in most days. \"It's my corner shop,\" she says.Joanne Dench, another local, is also shopping in Crawley, and says she visits the town's Asda for its variety. \"They've got a good range of stuff — clothes, all sorts of things... And they have lots of international food, which is lovely because I like trying new things.\"But despite the bustle in this West Sussex Asda, the chain has been losing ground to rivals at an alarming rate.Joanne Dench, shopping in the centre of Crawley, says she enjoys Asda's rangeThe UK's third biggest supermarket had a dreadful Christmas. Two sets of industry data show Asda suffered a big slump in sales while all its main rivals reported an increase.Asda's sales decreased by 4.2%, during the 12 weeks to 28 December 2025, according to Worldpanel — and that's off the back of a terrible Christmas the year before.\"A mess\" is how William Woods, a food retail analyst from Bernstein Research, describes Asda's situation.The industry data suggests that despite Asda embarking on a turnaround and cutting prices, shoppers are still turning away. Asda's hope is that with time the plan will work out, but the question others are asking is whether this 60-year-old retailer is really able to turn things around?A controversial dealFor decades, Asda had the reputation as Britain's cheapest grocer, a slightly cheeky northern-based business loved by families for its \"everyday low prices.\"A generation grew up with its \"That's Asda Price\" TV commercial, first featured in an advert for the supermarket in 1977, showing shoppers tapping their back pockets signalling they'd saved money at the tills.The business was sold to the US retail giant Walmart in 1999, in what was then the largest foreign takeover in the UK retail sector.But from about 2010, Asda struggled to fend off the growing threat from Aldi and Lidl as Walmart's global priorities focused on its businesses in the US and elsewhere.In 2021 it sold the chain. In the four years leading up to the transaction, Asda paid just over £4bn to Walmart through a series of dividend payments.Asda was bought by two billionaire brothers from Blackburn and the private equity firm TDR Capital for £6.8bn.Mohsin and Zuber Issa made their fortune by building a petrol forecourt empire, EG Group. They were hailed as self-made entrepreneurs who would inject fresh thinking.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAsda's sales decreased by 4.2%, during the 12 weeks to 28 December 2025, according to WorldpanelBut the sale was financed by adding billions of pounds worth of debt onto Asda's business — one of the UK's biggest debt-funded takeovers in recent history.It was a controversial deal inked at the end of a Covid boom in groceries, when people were spending much more time at home and less money eating out. But the market soon changed. The war in Ukraine triggered a huge rise in inflation and a new era of rising interest rates, pushing up the cost of Asda's borrowings.Asda's market shareFollowing the takeover, Asda's CEO left, and Mohsin Issa took over the reins.\"His instincts were good, but it needed an experienced figure to guide the business through the very choppy waters,\" says one former Asda executive.The problems grew, compounded by high management turnover and shifting priorities.Store standards fell after cuts in staff hours and shoppers complained about empty shelves, slow restocking, and poor online availability.Lynette from Swindon first started shopping at Asda more than 20 years ago, but says it began to go \"downhill\" really quickly — \"you could see it in the supermarket, half the tills were closed, shelves were empty.\"Once a loyal Asda shopper, she has within the last few years begun using the discounters, Aldi and Lidl for her main shopping.EG GroupFollowing the takeover, Mohsin Issa took over the reinsBehind-the-scenes, Asda was also working through a huge tech overhaul as it moved away from the systems it used under Walmart.This included installing close to 16,500 new checkouts and launching a new groceries app and website — costing hundreds of millions of pounds.By autumn 2024, Mohsin Issa had stood down from his role. TDR also took majority ownership of the business, putting them in the driving seat.Asda's market share stood at 14.3% just before the takeover, according to Worldpanel, at the end of December 2025, it had fallen to 11.4%.Comparing this to the value of the grocery market overall, you end up with a business that is £4.5bn smaller in terms of annual revenue, at today's prices, than it would have been if Asda had maintained this share, according to Worldpanel sales analysis.Grocers have high fixed costs and slim profit margins. If you can grow the amount of stuff you sell, your profits can increase quickly, but the reverse can happen if your volumes decline (you sell fewer products in total) — leading to \"a negative spiral which is really, really difficult to get out of,\" says Bernstein's William Woods.The revival of AsdaAsda is now in the midst of a turnaround plan.But, judging by the industry data, there's been little sign of traction. The question is, does it simply need more time, or will it be unable to win customers back?The company has brought in the man who helped rescue Asda from the brink of collapse some thirty years earlier, to revive its fortunes.Allan Leighton was appointed executive chair in November 2024, then aged 71. His big plan? The revival of Asda Rollback, the price campaign which he deployed, successfully, in the '90s.Getty ImagesAllan Leighton was appointed executive chair in November 2024\"Rollbacks\" are temporary price reductions. This time round, after the Rollback ends, the products are then moved to a new \"Asda Price\" which are \"guaranteed\" to be lower than the original pre-Rollback price.Leighton said his aim was to make Asda 5-10% cheaper than other traditional supermarkets by the end of 2026, and he was prepared to take a big hit on profits, in the short term, to achieve it.One year on from its launch, Asda's pricing has improved. Data provided to the BBC by retail research firm Assosia shows that Asda's prices on more than 30 branded items were mostly cheaper than Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons based on promotional deals over the festive quarter.The retailer has also regularly come top of a closely watched weekly price survey run by The Grocer magazine. It doesn't include Aldi and Lidl.\"At times in the last year, Asda has certainly been 5% cheaper than all its established rivals,\" says Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of The Grocer.The trouble is, the price cuts don't appear to have made any difference.\"For shoppers, it's not just about price,\" says Leyland. Customer service, in-store experience and range is also important as well as perception about \"value\" and brand appeal.That sentiment is echoed by Madeline in Crawley. She says she avoids doing her weekly shop at the town's Asda.\"A lot of the shelves are quite empty, and there are always trolleys in the aisles when they're filling up shelves. Sometimes you can't get to where you want to be — it puts you off.\"One key supplier I spoke to said Asda needed to strike a better balance by investing more in stores and availability, and getting a grip on \"the basic fundamentals of retailing\".Asda has put more staff in stores and insists it is making progress.But once you've lost shoppers, it's very hard to win them back, especially when many of your rivals are firing on all cylinders, helped by price matching and loyalty schemes, in an intensely competitive market.William Woods believes Asda should have stuck to its year-long Aldi and Lidl price match campaign, which ended in January 2025. He says price matching has been a \"great psychological mechanism\" for Tesco and Sainsbury's to change customer perception and fight the discounters.Their respective loyalty price schemes, Clubcard and Nectar, also create a \"wow\" factor at the till, Woods says.Asda points out that rebuilding the business is a three to five year journey.\"We are in the early stages of our transformation,\" a spokesperson said. \"This is anchored in offering an unmatched value proposition, making sure products are always available and ensuring customers have the best possible experience when visiting our stores or shopping online.\"This approach is beginning to be reflected in stronger volumes over recent periods.\"One person familiar with the situation said there had been signs of a recovery last summer, but that coincided with the final stage of Asda's separation from Walmart's systems. This caused disruption, leading to empty shelves in the all important run up to Christmas trading, a \"nightmare\" putting the turnaround six months behind schedule, they said.\"It's annoying, disappointing, but we had to get out of the Walmart system.\"Does Asda have the firepower?In December, Asda registered its 22nd consecutive month of decline, according to Worldpanel sales data.Many in the industry are wondering if it has the necessary firepower to regain all the lost ground. Even if it can fix the basics, will Asda's high levels of debt prevent a full recovery?It sold off a raft of stores and a distribution centre – and then rented them back – to help reduce its borrowings. At the end of December 2024, its net debt stood at £3.8bn, whilst the annual financing costs, including debt interest payments, increased 38% to £611m.\"It's an amazing brand….  but sadly, I believe the business is totally broken,\" the former Asda executive believes.\"Whoever the owner is, I just don't think the business can stomach, or the balance sheet can't stomach, the level of investment that is required. The lack of investment goes back 10-15 years,\" they claimed.Getty ImagesIn December, Asda registered its 22nd consecutive month of decline, according to Worldpanel sales dataAn Asda spokesperson said its \"strong balance sheet and underlying free cash flow generation\" means it can comfortably cover current and future debt obligations.Like Asda, Morrisons has also been struggling under new private equity owners and has been selling assets to reduce its debt pile. It has lost all important market share and the number four spot to Aldi but its performance has recently stabilised.According to the major supplier, both businesses are in a race to get out of the debt burden, which is holding them back.\"I would love for them [Asda] to get back to where they were. Whether it's feasible is another question...\" the supplier says.Ged Futter spent fifteen years working as a buyer for Asda. He now runs a business training suppliers on how to negotiate with supermarkets and fears his former employer is in \"real trouble\".\"I was with a client today who said Asda was asking for this investment for promotions. The client said I'm walking away. What they asked for is too much. I'm backing another horse.\"2026: Make or breakThis year there's also been a further fall in the price of Asda's traded debt — a sign that investors are getting more nervous about the viability of the turnaround.The person familiar with the workings of Asda says they believe it has a compelling offer with its in store pharmacies and opticians, as well as the George clothing brand and a general merchandise business that is healthy.The view among many observers I've spoken to is that some form of consolidation in the sector seems, at some point,  inevitable — whether that means supermarkets breaking up, being sold, or merging.Allan Leighton has compared his task to climbing Mount Everest. Certainly, winning back customers will be no mean feat.Swindon local Lynette says: \"I don't think I will ever go back to shopping at Asda again, I might pick up the odd thing there, but they've lost me as a loyal customer.\"Asda badly needs some momentum, and 2026 feels make or break for the turnaround.Top image credit: Getty ImagesMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "4 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesCynthia Erivo, Sabrina Carpenter and Lady Gaga all have multiple Grammy nominations this yearAt the ripe old age of 67, the Grammy Awards are still considered \"music's biggest night\". This year's ceremony takes place in LA on Sunday, with everyone from Harry Styles to Chaka Khan due to attend.Kendrick Lamar tops the nominations with nine nods, most of them for his sixth album, GNX. He was the main winner at last year's ceremony, too, winning both record and song of the year for his scorching diss track, Not Like Us.Other contenders include Lady Gaga, with seven nominations, along with Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter and Leon Thomas, who have six each.In total, there are 95 awards, distributed over a mind-boggling eight hours. Alongside banner categories like album of the year, we'll find out who had the best album artwork, and who's made the best \"ambient, new age or chant\" album.Here's everything you need to know ahead of the ceremony.1) Who's going to win album of the year?Getty ImagesBad Bunny could be the first person to win the night's main prize with an album sung entirely in SpanishMost insiders agree that there's a three-way race for the night's biggest prize - with Bad Bunny, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga the presumed favourites.None of them have ever won before, despite multiple nominations, and there are good reasons to think they're the front-runners.Gaga is a Grammy darling, with 14 wins from 45 nominations. Her seventh album, Mayhem, is a triumphant return to the maximalist pop that made her famous, delivered with the hard-won grace of someone who's endured 18 years in the pop machine. Like Beyoncé last year, voters might feel she's put in the work to earn the top title.Lamar is in a similar position. He's the only artist with album of the year nominations for five consecutive releases, and GNX is a snappy, crowd-pleasing tour de force.Giving him the prize would also go some way to correcting the Grammys' rap problem. The last time a hip-hop album won album of the year was in 2004.But Bad Bunny is the presumptive front-runner. The Puerto Rican star's musically ambitious Debí Tirar Más Fotos, fuses live instrumentation with the hip-swaying pulse of reggaeton, plena, salsa and a multitude of other Latin styles.A win for Bad Bunny would mark the first win for a Spanish language album.That said, the Grammys have a habit of making spectacularly weird decisions, so don't discount the chances of Justin Bieber or Sabrina Carpenter lifting the trophy.Notably, no matter who wins album of the year, it will be their first victory in the category.2) Will there be justice for Milli Vanilli?!Getty ImagesRob Pilatus (left) and Fab Morvan won best new artist in 1990 - but they didn't get to keep the trophies for longPop duo Milli Vanilli were stripped of their Grammy Award for best new artist in 1990, when it was discovered that the members, Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus, had been miming to someone else's vocals.Thirty-six years later, Morvan is nominated for best audiobook for his memoir You Know It's True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli.It's an eye-opening and harrowing story that lays bare what fame demands of you, and how Morvan struggled to rebuild his life after becoming one of music's biggest punchlines.If he wins, it could be an emotional moment of redemption.3) Can Olivia Dean win best new artist?Olivia Dean was one of the biggest break-out stars of last yearThe British star is certainly a front-runner. Her joyful, old-school pop songs were deservedly massive last year, pairing classic songcraft with an unabashedly romantic outlook.Her album, The Art Of Loving, had a golden streak in December, just as voters were filling in their ballots, boosting her odds of victory.It came out too late to be shortlisted for album of the year, though. She'll have to wait 12 months for that one.Dean faces strong competition from fellow Brit Lola Young, whose cathartically confrontational single Messy was a breakout hit last year.R&B artist Leon Thomas could also sneak off with the trophy. A former writer for Ariana Grande, SZA and Post Malone, he's the only best new artist nominee to pick up an album of the year nod, which suggests he's popular with voters.The rest of the pack includes influencer-turned-pop star Addison Rae, influencer-turned-pop star Alex Warren, frenetic girl group Katseye, chiselled rock star Sombr and LA indie outfit The Marías.For the second year in a row, all eight new artist nominees will perform during a special segment on Sunday night.4) What about the other big prizes?Getty ImagesAfter performing at last year's Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar and SZA are hot favourites to win record of the year for their loved-up duet, LutherOne of the year's most fiercely-contested categories is record of the year - better understood as \"best single\".That's where you'll find Sabrina Carpenter's Manchild butting heads with Lady Gaga's Abracadabra and Chappell Roan's The Subway.But none of them really captured the public imagination in the same way as Rosé and Bruno Mars's APT. A honking great crossover hit, it has exactly the sort of cross-generational appeal the Grammys loves.The only serious competition is Kendrick and SZA's Luther, a sumptuous rap ballad that spent 13 weeks at number one in America last year.If APT wins, it'll be a record-breaker twice over. Rosé will become the first K-pop artist to win a Grammy; and Mars will become the only artist to win record of the year four times. (Right now, he's tied with Paul Simon on three.)The song of the year award - which recognises the songwriters - has almost exactly the same shortlist, with the addition of Golden, from the movie K-Pop Demon Hunters.The prominent use of samples and interpolations in Luther and APT could put them at a disadvantage here; which is good news for Carpenter's Manchild - whose country-pop hybrid appeals to a broad cross-section of voters.Bad Bunny could also win here for DTMF (I should have taken more photos), a gorgeous rumination on the passage of time that segues into a lively celebration of life.5) Is there a list of Grammy performers?Getty ImagesJustin Bieber will take to the stage ahead of his headline slot at this year's Coachella Music FestivalHeck, yeah. And what a list...Justin BieberSabrina CarpenterClipse & Pharrell WilliamsOlivia DeanKatseyeLady GagaLauryn Hill (Tribute to D'Angelo & Roberta Flack)Reba McIntyre with Brandy Clark and Luka NelsonThe MaríasBruno MarsPost Malone, Slash, Chad Smith (Tribute to Ozzy Osbourne)Addison RaeRoséSombrTyler, The CreatorLeon ThomasAlex WarrenLola Young6) Will Taylor Swift be performing?ReutersTaylor Swift's Life Of A Showgirl album was released after the eligibility period for this year's Grammy AwardsNot on your nelly.Rumours that Taylor Swift would turn up and tinkle the ivories were shot down by Grammy producer Ben Winston.Asked about the speculation by the showbiz website Hits Daily Double, he pointed out that the source of the story was... er, the showbiz website Hits Daily Double.\"The only reason people think Taylor might be performing or coming is because Hits decided to print it this week and it was picked up globally,\" he said.\"But Hits just totally made that up. And now I am getting asked about it by you, as if it's a real thing, when it was made up in your office!\"Also not performing: Bad Bunny. His gig headlining the Super Bowl half time show next month means he's unable to take the stage at the Grammys.7) Is it finally time for a K-pop Grammy?Getty ImagesRosé could be the first K-Pop star to win a Grammy on SundayRight now, no K-pop artist has ever won a Grammy - although BTS have received multiple nominations and even performed at the ceremony.That could change on Sunday. Rosé, one quarter of the South Korean girl group Blackpink, is nominated for three awards for APT, her irresistible, cheerleader chanting duet with Bruno Mars. In the song of the year, she goes head-to-head with the fictional girl group Huntr/x, who appear in the hit animation K-Pop Demon Hunters.And Katseye, a global girl group trained under the arduous K-pop system, are also up for best group and best pop group performance, for their single Gabriela.They might not win, but there's a growing recognition that K-pop has become a cultural and commercial force. For Audrey Nuna, one of the singers behind Huntr/x, getting to perform at the show represents a huge step forward.\"You're going to see three Korean faces,\" she told E! News. \"To think about the kids who are going to see that, and hopefully for that to shape their understanding of what they can do in this world, is the stuff that is giving me chills up my spine.\"In an interview earlier this week, the Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, confirmed there was a \"groundswell\" amongst voters for a separate K-pop category. Could it be created just in time for BTS's comeback? Watch this space.8) Any other notable nominees and surprises?EPAThe Dalai Lama is up for his first ever GrammyBarbra Streisand could correct a historic wrong on Sunday night. Her duets album, The Secret of Life, is nominated for best traditional pop album - a category she has lost 13 times since it was introduced in 1992.Her chances look slim, though, with stronger albums by Lady Gaga, Elton John & Brandi Carlile, and Icelandic jazz singer Laufey all in the running.Festival headliners and generally excellent people Haim could become the first ever all-female band to win best rock album.\"We really set out to make a rock album this time, so it's a huge milestone,\" Alana Haim told the BBC after their nomination. \"But we're just grateful for the women that came before us.\"Elsewhere, the Dalai Lama is nominated for best audio book, for Meditations: The Reflections Of His Holiness The Dalai Lama. It's the first time a Dalai Lama has received a Grammy nomination.And we could end the night with the youngest-ever Grammy winner. Eight year old Aura V is nominated for best children's album for Harmony, a bubbly, life-affirming record she made with her dad, Harold Simmons II. 9) Will artists address the political situation in the US?ReutersBillie Eilish has been a vocal critic of the actions of Immigration enforcement officers in the USIn the week that Bruce Springsteen released a song denouncing \"King Trump\" and \"federal thugs\" in Minneapolis, it seems impossible that politics won't feature on the Grammys stage.Billie Eilish, nominated for record and song of the year, has called on her fellow musicians to \"speak up\" about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, whose actions have resulted in the death of two protestors. Bad Bunny didn't need prompting. He previously called ICE agents \"sons of bitches\" who won't leave \"people alone and working\". President Trump has defended the immigration operation in Minnesota, saying it took \"thousands of hardened criminals\" out of the state. On Wednesday, however, he said his administration would \"de-escalate a little bit\", amid rising tensions.Grammys boss Harvey Mason Jr said it was inevitable that emotions would spill onto the stage this Sunday.\"You're going to hear and feel what's going on in the world through the music,\" he  told CNN. \"Maybe some people will choose to speak out about it, but you're definitely going to feel it in the music, in the performance, in the passion that goes into the art.\"10) Who votes for the Grammys?Getty ImagesWinners all receive a golden gramophone trophyThis year, about 15,000 people were eligible to vote for the Grammys - including musicians, producers, lyricists, and even the people who write album liner notes.To qualify, they must be currently working in the music industry, and pay an annual subscription of $150 (£120) to the Recording Academy. All former winners are also eligible to vote.Every member is allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields, such as rock, classical and R&B. They are encouraged only to vote in genres where their expertise lies.Additionally, every member, regardless of their background, gets to vote for the six biggest awards of the night. Those are: Album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, best new artist, songwriter of the year and producer of the year.The 2026 awards recognise music released between 31 August, 2024 and 30 August, 2025. More than 20,000 records were submitted for consideration this year. The winners will not be revealed until the ceremony.11) How can I watch in the UK?Getty ImagesComedian Trevor Noah is hosting the ceremony for the sixth and final timeThe ceremony is split into two parts, with the first 80 awards distributed during what's called the \"premiere ceremony\" at 12:30 in Los Angeles / 20:30 in London on Sunday.It's often worth tuning in. The winners in the more obscure categories are less polished and more excited about winning, and the performances are looser and, dare I say it, more musical than the grandiose set pieces you'll see later.It's also the place to see British stars like Wet Leg, Yungblud, FKA Twigs and Sleep Token find out whether they've won in the rock and dance categories.That's also where you want to go to watch red carpet coverage, which kicks off at 15:00 in Los Angeles / 23:00 in the UK.Finally, the main show kicks off at 17:00 Los Angeles / 01:00 Monday in the UK. It's broadcast live in the US on CBS and streaming platform Paramount Plus. At present, there is no way to watch in the UK without circumventing geographical streaming restrictions, but clips from the ceremony appear on social media with incredible speed.Full speeches and select performances are usually uploaded to YouTube the following day.",

It’s the biggest political event of the year, and this week Donald Trump kicked off the Republican’s campaign in Iowa, telling voters the odds are against him, but Republicans “need to win”.  The president’s chief of staff says this is just the start, and Trump will be campaigning for the midterms as if it were a presidential race because he’s good at driving voter turnout.  \nIn this episode, Sarah and Anthony discuss why the midterm elections matter, what the stakes are, and Republican chances of winning.  They’re joined by a former campaign adviser to Donald Trump, Bryan Lanza, who sets out why ICE immigration protests and worries over the economy shouldn’t stop a Republican victory.\nWe also hear from Mary in Kentucky as we build our own “United States of Americast”, finding Americasters in every US state.

    "body": "44 minutes agoJeff Overs/BBCThere needs to be a \"system change\" on drugs policy, Green Party leader Zack Polanksi has said as he reiterated his backing for the legalisation of drugs.Speaking on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, he called for a \"public health approach\" which would ensure that someone who had a \"problematic relationship with drugs\" could get help from a medical professional.Earlier in the week, Sir Keir Starmer accused Polanski of being \"soft on drugs\", a comment Polanski said was \"disgraceful\" and \"a cheap joke\".A No 10 source said the prime minister had been making \"an important point about the recklessness and irresponsibility of the Green Party\". Polanski said he had personally never taken drugs or drunk alcohol, adding that it \"wasn't for me\".  Asked why he had never drunk alcohol, he said: \"I grew up in school where a lot of my friends were drinking and in fact taking drugs and it felt like  somebody needed to be sober.\"I've always liked dancing without taking drink or drugs.\"If anyone wants to do it and doing it safely fine, I'm glad people are having a good time.\"But we know lots of people aren't doing it safely so let's make sure they get the support they need.\"Asked whether he believed legalisation could send a message to young people that using drugs would be okay, Polanski replied: \"I think the danger is happening right now which is where we're pushing it into street corners and a black market.\"He pointed to the organisation Anyone's Child, set up by families of those who had died due to drug use.\"They're saying very clearly with one voice we need a national conversation about how the war on drugs is not working,\" said Polanski.\"In fact it's making drugs more dangerous and actually what we need is a grown-up conversation based in evidence, taking a public health approach that looks at prevention, intervention and make sure that afterwards people can get the support they need.\"He describes himself as an \"eco-populist\" and has sought to position his party firmly on the left of politics.Asked if there was a risk he could alienate some of his party's traditional \"tree-hugging middle class\" voters, Polanski insisted that his was \"the party of the 99% versus the 1%\". He said there was \"always a risk in politics\" but added that since he became leader 130,000 new members had joined his party. At the next general election, the Green Party could face the option of going into coalition with one of the other parties. He has previously said that the prime minister is \"not a man I would be willing to work with\". Asked on Sunday if he would potentially be prepared to work with other politicians on the left such as Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, he said it would depend on \"what kind of policy platform they were putting forward\". He added that his \"biggest focus\" was trying to win more seats for the Green Party.\"If I was working with another politician, I would have some obvious demands - a wealth tax on multi-millionaires and billionaires, proper action on the climate crisis and indeed proportional representation so people's votes actually counted,\" he said.

    "body": "3 hours agoBarbara Plett Usher,in Doha, Qatar,andJack BurgessEPAIran is due to hold live fire naval drills in the Strait of HormuzIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that any attack would spark a regional conflict, as the US continues to build up its forces nearby.\"The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.Donald Trump earlier said Iran was in \"serious discussions\" and he hoped they would lead to something \"acceptable\", while Iran's top security official Ali Larijani also said a framework for negotiations was progressing.As part of its build up of forces, the US has sent its aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln to the region and late last week US Central Command said it was operating in the Arabian Sea.\"[Trump] regularly says that he brought ships... The Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things,\" added Khamenei.Around a fifth of the world's traded oil passes through the waterway, which is about 33km (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point between Iran and Oman. Iran has in the past threatened to close the strait if it were attacked. The US has warned Iran against any \"unsafe and unprofessional behaviour\" near its forces in the area.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi responded by saying: \"The US military is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf.\"On Saturday, two explosions in Iran heightened anxiety in the country. Local authorities said a blast that killed one and hurt 14 at a building in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas was caused by a gas leak. Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.In the south-western city of Ahvaz, at least four people were killed in another explosion, with local authorities again blaming a gas leak, according to Iran's Tehran Times.On Thursday, Trump said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid US military action: \"Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.In his remarks on Sunday, Khamenei accused protesters of attacking police, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and other facilities including banks and mosques.\"The coup was suppressed,\" Tasnim quoted him as saying.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJaroslav LukivEPAAttackers struck cities across Balochistan including the provincial capital QuettaA series of gun and bomb attacks across Pakistan's south-western Balochistan province have killed 31 civilians and 17 security service personnel, the region's Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti says.Security forces responding to the violence killed at least 145 attackers, according to Bugti. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group had earlier said it was behind the attacks, claiming dozens of soldiers were killed.The escalation is one of the deadliest days of violence in the impoverished province, where Pakistan's government has been battling an ethnic insurgency for decades.Pakistan accused India of supporting the BLA. Delhi has repeatedly denied such accusations.The military said multiple attacks had targeted civilians around the provincial capital Quetta and other locations.Grenade and gun attacks in 12 cities and towns across the province targeted police and paramilitary installations, as well as prisons and government buildings. Some key administrative buildings in Quetta and nearby roads were reported to have been sealed off during the day. Mobile phone services were jammed, and regional train services were suspended.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later praised the military, pledging to \"continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication\".The BLA accuses Pakistan's federal government of exploiting the rich mineral resources of its largest province without the local population benefiting. Local activists also blame Pakistani security forces for enforced disappearances, which Islamabad denies.Balochistan covers nearly 44% of the country's total land, sharing a volatile border with Iran and Afghanistan and covering part of the Arabian Sea coastline. It is home to about 5% of the country's more than 240 million people. The province is also the richest in terms of natural resources, including gas and minerals. The region derives its name from the Baloch tribe, which is the largest ethnic group there. Resistance against the Pakistani government and an insurgency advocating for an independent state for the Baloch people began in 1948, after Pakistan gained independence from the British Empire.",

    "body": "Just nowJohanna ChisholmBBC NewsBBCJeffrey Epstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released by the US Department of Justice suggest.Between 2003 and 2004, Epstein appears to have sent three separate $25,000 payments referencing Lord Mandelson.Lord Mandelson said he had no record or recollection of receiving the sums and did not know whether the documents were authentic.He reiterated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\" and for continuing his association following the disgraced financier's conviction, apologising \"unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered\".Images of the former UK ambassador to the US in his underwear have also been uncovered in the latest tranche of Epstein files. In a redacted pictures, he is seen standing next to a female, whose face is not visible.He has said he \"cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were\".It is not known when or where the images of Lord Mandelson and the female were taken. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.US Department of JusticeLord Mandelson is seen here in a picture from the Epstein files.The recently released bank statements, first reported by the Financial Times, appear to show three separate payments referencing Lord Mandelson, who was Labour MP for Hartlepool at the time, being sent from Epstein's JP Morgan bank accounts.The first, dated 14 May 2003, shows a payment was sent to a Barclays bank account where Reinaldo Avila da Silva - Lord Mandelson's partner at the time - is named as \"A/C\", typically an abbreviation for account. In that payment, a \"Peter Mandelson\" is named on the account as \"BEN\", which is often an abbreviation for beneficiary. The second and third payments of $25,000 were made to HSBC accounts only days apart in June 2004. In both, \"Peter Mandelson\" is the only person named, again as \"BEN\".  It is unclear if the three payments ever made it into any of the named accounts. Asked for a response to da Silva's loan, Lord Mandelson said he had been \"very clear\" about his relationship with Epstein in interviews with the BBC.\"I have nothing more to add,\" he said.Lord Mandelson was later sent to Washington by Sir Keir Starmer in December 2024 as the UK's ambassador to the US, but was sacked the following September after further revelations emerged about his friendship with Epstein. Emails revealed he had been in contact with Epstein after the US financier's 2008 conviction, sending a string of supportive messages.Asked by Laura Kuenssberg if the government was aware of Mandelson's alleged financial links to Epstein, Housing Secretary Steve Reed confirmed they were not. \"You're talking about things that happened more than 20 years ago,\" he said, stressing \"there was no knowledge\" about what was going on at that time.Reed added that the reason Mandelson was removed as US ambassador was because \"there were things he had not disclosed\" to government.\"I think he should answer questions about his own life, not me.\"On 11 January, he told Laura Kuenssberg that his relationship with Epstein was a \"terrible mistake\". Days later, he offered a more direct apology to the victims of the disgraced financier, telling Newsnight he was \"wrong\" to continue associating with Epstein. Epstein's 2008 conviction was part of a plea bargain he reached in Florida. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to two charges, including soliciting girls as young as 14 for prostitution.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJack BurgessAFP via Getty ImagesCasey Wasserman is the chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 OlympicsThe chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games has said he \"deeply regrets\" decades-old flirty emails with Ghislaine Maxwell - the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Casey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, were among millions of files published by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday.In one exchange, Wasserman wrote to Maxwell: \"I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\" Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein prior to his death in custody in 2019.\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said in a statement obtained by news agency AFP.He also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Epstein\".\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" Wasserman said.\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"While the files do not show any wrongdoing on the part of those featured, including Wasserman, they have raised renewed questions for those who associated with the influential financier.The BBC has approached Wasserman for comment.Wasserman founded a sports and entertainment agency in 2002, and is a trustee of the non-profit Clinton Foundation, according to the Olympics website.Ghislaine Maxwell agreed last month to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files.The committee also summoned both former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to testify.The former president appeared in photographs with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s.Bill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.Epstein, who was convicted of sexual offences in 2008, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "14 hours agoMadeline HalpertColumbia Heights Public SchoolsA US judge has ordered the release of a five-year-old boy and his father from an immigration detention centre in Texas, condemning it as driven by a \"perfidious lust for unbridled power\".The detention of Liam Conejo Ramos, photographed wearing a blue bunny-shaped hat and a Spider-Man backpack, sparked national outcry after he was taken into custody on the driveway of his home in Minneapolis.The child's father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, was also detained.Following the outrage over the pre-schooler's detention, immigration officials said they did not \"target a child\" but were conducting an operation against his father, an \"illegal alien\" who \"abandoned\" his son when approached.On Saturday, US District Judge Fred Biery granted an emergency request from the family's lawyer, ordering government officials to release the father and son by 3 February. The judge also included a photo of Ramos in his fluffy blue hat in his ruling.\"The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children,\" Biery wrote in his ruling. Biery, an appointee of former US President Bill Clinton, said deportations through the US immigration system should occur in a more orderly and humane policy than currently in place. \"Observing human behaviour confirms that for some among us, the perfidious lust for unbridled power and the imposition of cruelty in its quest know no bounds and are bereft of human decency,\" he wrote of the detention of Ramos. The BBC has contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment. Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, said the boy and his father were being held at a detention centre in San Antonio, Texas. Prokosch said Ramos and his father had come to the US in 2024 from Ecuador to seek asylum and had been following the proper immigration protocols. In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement efforts in Minneapolis in an initiative dubbed \"Operation Metro Surge\".On Thursday, Trump officials suggested they may start pulling back federal forces in the state after a national outcry over the fatal shootings of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents.In a separate ruling on Saturday, a federal judge denied a state government's request to block the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of immigration agents in Minneapolis, saying the state had not proven the activity was unlawful.

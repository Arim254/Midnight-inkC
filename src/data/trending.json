    "body": "Is batting getting harder in Australia?ByChief Cricket Reporter in PerthUpdated 3 hours agoIn the blink of an eye, it was over.England's crushing first-Test defeat by Australia was done in two days, the first two-day Ashes Test in 104 years.With four more stops before the urn is lifted in Sydney in January, have events in Perth set the tone for the rest of the series?Are the Ashes about to become the Flashes?What's going on?As quite a sweeping generalisation, Test matches across the world are getting shorter. England's home series against India in the summer, when all five matches went into a fifth day, was something of an outlier.Australian Test cricket has hit the fast forward button harder than most. There have been two two-day Tests in this country in the past three years. Prior to that, there had been none since 1931.Whether lasting two days or more, Tests in Australia are getting shorter.In the two decades between the year 2000 and 2020, matches in Australia had an average length of 335.4 overs - almost four days if we work on the schedule of 90 overs per day (yes, over-rates are slower in reality, but we'll park that issue for now).Since the start of 2020-21 season, the average length of a Test in Australia has fallen to 278.1 overs, barely more than three days.Wickets are falling more swiftly and more cheaply. In the 20 years to 2020, the overall batting average was 35.1 and the bowling strike-rate 64. In the past five years, those numbers have fallen to 28.1 and 51.2 respectively.Have the balls made a difference?Media caption, Head century hands Australia emphatic first Test win over EnglandHow often has the Kookaburra ball been highlighted as a point of difference between cricket played in the UK and the cricket played down under?The Kookaburra was even introduced to the County Championship to prepare English players for overseas assignments. It resulted in some dull cricket.The accepted wisdom is the Kookaburra traditionally offers less assistance to bowlers. A machine-made ball, it can feel bigger in the hand and has a smaller seam.However, five years ago a new version of the Kookaburra ball was introduced to Australian cricket, with consequences to batting averages and the length of Test matches.This new model, with a bigger seam, has offered pace bowlers more movement off the pitch. Swing - the ball moving in the air - has not usually been a fast bowler's weapon in Australia. Seam movement has been the key, and it is increasing.If that were not hard enough for batters, the new Kookaburra offers movement for longer.Whereas a batter can usually expect to be rewarded with easier conditions the longer they stay at the crease, the new Kookaburra ball still offers seam movement when it is 50, 60 or 70 overs old.Since the new Kookaburra was introduced, wickets have fallen at a cheaper rate, hundreds have been scored less frequently, and Test matches have ended more swiftly.What about the pitches?Media caption, 'Top class' Head century has Australia cruising towards win over EnglandThere was a time in the middle of the previous decade when Australian pitches offered next to no encouragement for bowlers.On England's Ashes tour of 2017-18, the fourth Test in Melbourne yielded more than 1,000 runs for only 24 wickets. The Melbourne Cricket Ground was given a warning by the International Cricket Council for what the governing body deemed a 'poor' surface.Since England last visited Australia in 2021-22, pitches have given much more to the bowlers.For the past four years, pitches in this country have been rated as faster, bouncier and more inconsistent than anywhere else in the world. Pace, bounce and inconsistency is the perfect recipe for tough batting.At this point, it is worth stating there is a subjectivity to what constitutes a 'good' pitch.Quite often, a pitch can be described as 'good' when it is friendly for batting, yet that does not always produce the most thrilling spectacle.Perhaps it is better to describe a 'good' pitch as one that produces an even contest between bat and ball.Pitches also change over the course of a Test, offering different challenges to batters and bowlers as a match progresses.Take the first Ashes Test as an example. In the first three innings, the highest total was 172 and batting looked devilishly difficult.In the final innings, Australia's run chase, Travis Head made a target of 205 look minuscule. The run chase could have been much more difficult on the fifth day of a Test, when a pitch would be at its oldest and most worn.Because of the rapid nature of the first Test, Head was batting on the second evening, when the pitch may have been at its best for run-scoring.\"The pitch was brilliant,\" said former Australia opener Simon Katich on BBC Radio 5 Live.\"For Australia to chase 200 for the loss of two wickets summed it up. In Australia if you can wear the new ball down you will score quickly from 40 to 50 overs. England weren't able to do that and paid the price.\"Is it not down to the bowling and batting?Ah, yes, the age-old debate between batters and bowlers.Blame for low scoring is often attributed to conditions or poor batting, often doing a disservice to the quality of bowling.Mitchell Starc, who took 10 wickets in the match at Perth, made this point and was keen to talk up the quality of the bowling from both teams.In terms of wickets falling more regularly and cheaply in Australia in recent years, some credit must be given to the home attack, one of the finest of all time: Starc, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon.The art of batting has also changed because of the influence of shorter formats of the game.A modern player is more likely to tackle difficult conditions with aggression than try to survive with solid defence, patience and determination.Writing on X before the first Ashes Test, former England batter Kevin Pietersen said: \"Batters grow up now to hit sixes and play switch-hits. They don't grow up to build an innings and learn the art of survival.\"The player is not to blame at all as it is exactly where the modern day game is. The game of cricket is now about bright lights, loud music and a financial return for cricket boards, private equity and private ownership.\"I wish more power to the players to make as much $$$$ as they can, whilst they can. Keep hitting sixes and switch-hits and growing your bank accounts, dudes!\"On the latest Tailenders podcast, Sir James Anderson explained how batting coaching Graham Gooch guided the 2010-11 England group and how the current squad may need to adapt. \"I remember in the 2010 series we lost in Perth, it was the Waca, but a similar pitch and Graham Gooch was the batting coach and he'd said the cover drive is a really hard shot to play from length because of the bounce,\" said Anderson.\"I'm sure England will be thinking this as well - I don't have an issue with them trying to attack, that is the way they play. \"The players will be given licence to play the way you want to play, it is up to you as a player to work out that these conditions are different to what we're used to.\"What happens next?In the short-term, probably some more rapid Test cricket.Next week's second Test in Brisbane is a day-nighter. The last pink-ball Test in Australia – India's visit to Adelaide last year – was over in the first session of the third day.Earlier this week, Queensland won a day-night Sheffield Shield match against Victoria at the Gabba inside three days.Since Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum took over the England team in 2022, the Bazballers have thrived in batter-friendly conditions. England have pulled off some of their best wins on flat pitches.When the ball has been on top, England have often struggled and matches have accelerated quickly. On nine occasions in the Bazball era, England have been bowled out in fewer than 40 overs.Anderson added: \"I would be surprised if there isn't some adjustment - I don't think they'll go away and say 'right, we're going to block it'. If anything they'll try and be more aggressive.\"It is taking lessons from Head and how he scored and thinking about how you can adapt your game to those conditions. I don't see them at all taking a step back and being more cautious.\"Australia are vulnerable, too. In the first innings in Perth the home side tried to blunt England's attack and were bowled out in 32.5 overs.If the antidote is keeping the explosive Head at the top of the order and bringing an aggressor like Josh Inglis into the team, it creates the possibility of runs and wickets happening quickly.Perhaps the series will eventually return to 'normal' Test cricket as the series develops, but the smart money is on the Ashes zipping by in a flash.This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.Get in touchSend us your questionsWhat is Ask Me Anything?Ask Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.We want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.The team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.We will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.Our coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.More questions answered...",

    "body": "4 hours agoAngie BrownEdinburgh and East reporterCCTV captured the 8ft Nutcracker being stolen from outside the bar on George StreetA thief on an electric bike has been recorded on CCTV stealing a giant Christmas Nutcracker soldier statue from outside an Edinburgh cocktail bar.The person, who appears to be male and wearing a hood and a mask, puts the 8ft soldier, which cost £900, horizontally across his lap and rides off.The incident, which happened at Copper Blossom at the corner of George Street and North Castle Street at 22:10 on Monday, has been reported to police.Manager Paul Paxton told BBC Scotland he was \"shocked\" at the brazen theft, which took place while people were walking past.Copper BlossomManager Paul Paxton has been left with one Nutcracker soldierNutcracker Soldier dolls are a traditional German Christmas decoration dating back to the 17th Century.The 28Ib (13kg) figure was part of a Christmas display costing thousands of pounds outside the basement bar.The video shows the man pushing over furniture and breaking a £350 table.He then rips the statue from the railings and drags it onto his bike before riding off while balancing the soldier across the vehicle.The thief is then seen riding east on George Street in the direction of St Andrew Square.Mr Paxton said when he watched the CCTV footage back he could not believe how the thief removed the decoration in front of three passers-by.\"People were walking past as he was loading up his bike, it's so shocking,\" he said.Copper BlossomThe £900 doll weighs about 28Ibs (13kg)\"We were still open and had just stacked up all the outdoor furniture in front of the statue five minutes beforehand. He cycles up on his e-bike and it all happens in the space of a minute, it's so fast.\"He pushed everything aside and pulls the tables over and one falls and breaks and then he yanks the Nutcracker away.\"He falls off his bike once while trying to put it on and struggles to lay it horizontally across him.\"It's an 8ft statue horizontally across a little e-bike. The people on the street didn't really bat an eyelid.\"He said it was \"frustrating\" to have lost one of the front door centrepieces of the display when it wasn't even December yet.\"We're a city centre venue but we are small, so we rely on our front door to get some traffic because we are a basement venue.\"The statue was part of a pair and the other one is now being kept indoors overnight.Police Scotland said inquiries were at an early stage.",

In response to questions from the Conservative leader, the prime minister said that it's \"literally 25 minutes\" until the measures will be unveiled.Not so.The Budget is already out there, thanks to the Office for Budget Responsibility, which has published the details in error.Its economic forecast appeared on its website unexpectedly early.It caused a buzz in the Commons chamber.Multiple Conservative MPs were going through the OBR documents and graphs on their phones.Reeves had been looking at her own phone, and notes were being passed down the row of cabinet ministers.Now the Office for Budget Responsibility has apologised and launched an investigation.It describes the blunder as a \"technical error\".It said it has now been removed, adding: \"We apologise for this technical error and have initiated an investigation into how this happened.\"We will be reporting to our oversight board, the Treasury, and the Commons Treasury Committee on how this happened, and we will make sure this does not happen again.\"Our economic and fiscal outlook and supporting documents will be released when the Chancellor has finished her speech.\"The report appears to confirm a number of measures which were expected to be included in the Budget, including the end of the two child benefit cap, the extension of income tax threshold freezes for another three years and a new mileage based charge on electric vehicles.But it is truly extraordinary. An hour ago, it would have been unimaginable.It's hard to find the right adjectives to do it justice.There will be total fury at the top of government right now and, presumably, a reckoning of some sort for the OBR.",

    "body": "Image source, Ben Whitley / PA WireByStav DanaosLead Weather PresenterUpdated 25 November 2025With a cold spell gripping the UK over the last week and bringing snow for many, you may be wondering whether winter has arrived.The answer is almost, but not quite. According to the meteorological calendar, the last week of November is the last week of autumn, notable this year for its vibrant autumn colours and changeable, whiplash-like weather patterns. The UK has recorded both the warmest November overnight minimums and the coldest November nights for 15 years.So when will we see the official start of winter and what kind of temperatures could that bring?Defining the start of winterImage source, Danny Lawson / PA WireImage caption, The recent cold snap created this snowy scene in the North York MoorsThere are two common ways to define the start of our seasons in the UK -  meteorological and astronomical.BBC Weather follows the meteorological calendar, where winter always begins on 1 December and ends on the last day of February. Meteorologists use fixed three month periods for each season, which makes year-on-year comparisons between them easier. Astronomical winter starts on the 21 December, known as the winter solstice and is the shortest day of the year. The season then runs until the vernal or spring equinox which in 2026 is Friday 20 March. What makes winter winter?We define winter as the three coldest months - December, January and February - and when we look at a list of record low temperatures from across the UK we can see why. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK is –27.2C (–17.0F), reached on three separate occasions in Scotland:Braemar, Aberdeenshire, on 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982Altnaharra, Sutherland, on 30 December 1995Other national record lows include:England: –26.1C (–15.0F) in Newport, Shropshire, on 10 January 1982Wales: –23.3C (–9.9F) in Rhayader, Powys, on 21 January 1940Northern Ireland: –18.7C (–1.7F) in Castlederg, County Tyrone, on 24 December 2010But the UK does not often experience prolonged very cold weather, and some winters are so mild that it feels as if we skipped the season all together.In February 2019 England and Wales saw an exceptional spell of warmth, with temperatures rising above 20C on more than one occasion. What impact is climate change having on winter?Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / NikonmanImage caption, Flooding in Martock, Somerset, December 2023UK winters are becoming warmer and wetter due to human-driven climate change. Long term data shows rising average temperatures and fewer cold weather extremes.With global temperatures continuing to rise UK winters are now about 1C warmer than a century ago. The decade 2015–2024 has been 1.24C warmer than the 1961–1990 average. Indeed, six of the ten warmest UK winters on record have occurred since 2000.Globally 2023 was the warmest year on record where most days in December broke temperature records.Air and ground frosts have fallen by around 25% since the 1980s, and snow days are becoming increasingly rare across the UK.A warming world means we are more likely to see winter precipitation fall as rain rather than snow, external.However, even in a warming climate the UK can still experience spells of extreme cold. In 2018 the infamous Beast from the East brought severe wintry conditions to many parts of Europe leading to significant disruption, and its impact lingered well into meteorological spring.",

    "body": "France's highest court has upheld a sentence against former French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the illegal financing of his 2012 re-election campaign.He was found guilty of overspending on his campaign, then hiring a PR firm named Bygmalion to cover it up.Sarkozy, 70, was handed the one-year sentence in 2024 of which six months were suspended, meaning they could be served by wearing an electronic tag instead of going to jail.He has always denied all allegations. Prosecutors in the case said Sarkozy's UMP party spent nearly double the €22.5m (£19.4m) cap on his campaign, splurging on lavish campaign rallies and events.To hide the costs, UMP then asked Bygmalion to invoice the party, rather than the campaign.Today's is the second definitive conviction for the former president, who was in power from 2007 to 2012.Last December the High Court of Appeal upheld a corruption conviction and Sarkozy had to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet for six months.Then, in September, he was sentenced to five years in jail after being found guilty of criminal conspiracy.He spent 20 days in jail before he was released earlier in November. An appeal trial will be held next year. Until then Sarkozy will be subject to strict judicial supervision and barred from leaving France.Days after his release, Sarkozy's team announced the former president was writing a book about his three weeks in jail, titled \"A prisoner's diary\". An excerpt from the book was published on social media: \"In prison there is nothing to see, and nothing to do. I forget the silence that does not exist at La Santé [prison], where there is much to listen to. Here, the noise is, unfortunately, constant. But - like in the desert - inner life strengthens in jail.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterForeign tourists visiting popular US national parks like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite will need to pay an extra fee, the Trump administration says.The Department of the Interior, which runs the country's national parks, said each international visitor will need to pay $100 (£76) per person on top of existing fees to access 11 of the most popular sites.From 2026, non-residents will also need to pay more than $250 for an annual pass to the parks, while US citizens and permanent residents will continue to pay $80.The fee hike aims to \"put American families first\" and reflects President Donald Trump's goal to make the parks more accessible and affordable for US citizens, said the department.\"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.The increase will take effect at the start of 2026, alongside the launch of an upgraded online booking system and better access for motorcyclists across the parks.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, \"patriotic fee-free\" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.The fee hike follows an executive order, signed by Trump in July, to raise entrance fees at national parks for overseas visitors. The extra revenue would raise funds for conservation and maintenance at the sites, the White House said at the time - even as the Trump administration planned deep cuts to the Park Service budget.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before.The country's most visited parks include the Everglades in Florida, Yosemite in California and Colorado's Rocky Mountains.",

    "body": "Salary sacrifice tax break cut on workplace pensions21 minutes agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterGetty ImagesSome pension savers will face a hit to the amount of money they can put into their pension without paying national insurance (NI), under measures announced in the Budget. From 2029, there will be a cap of £2,000 per year that can be shielded from employer and employee NI contributions by using a method called salary sacrifice.There is currently a much higher limit to the amount a worker can agree their employer to pay in, with the scheme seen as a way to encourage workers to pay into their pensions.The measure will raise £4.7bn in extra NI contributions in 2029, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has estimated.Salary sacrifice lets workers and employers agree an amount to be taken out of pay and shifted into a pension before the salary is hit by National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and income tax. Workers \"sacrifice\" a higher salary, but receive a tax-free sum into their pot, with each pay cheque.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the current system favoured high-income earners and those who work in financial services, \"who can put their bonuses into pensions tax-free\".The £2,000 cap on salary sacrifice was a \"pragmatic step\", Reeves said, and would mean low and middle-income earners could continue to use the scheme \"without paying any more in tax\".The salary sacrifice policy also reduces the overall amount of employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) that companies pay, so any cap will mean a higher NICs bill for companies or a rethink on whether they offer the perk.The cap will mean salary sacrifice contributions above £2,000 will incur NICS for both staff and companies. Workers paying income tax at the basic rate will pay NICS at a rate of 8%, while higher rate taxpayers will pay 2%. Employers pay NICs at a rate of 15%.About a third of private sector employees and a tenth of public sector workers use a salary sacrifice scheme for their pension savings. Analysis by HM Revenues & Customs suggested about 7.7 million employees used it in 2024.Former pensions minister Steve Webb, now partner at LCP, said that the time until National Insurance payments are due on salary sacrifice, more than three years away, means it is unlikely the chancellor will raise the £4.7bn the OBR estimates.\"The decision not to implement this change until 2029 creates a huge opportunity for firms to restructure the way that they offer pay and pensions in order to mitigate or eliminate this new charge,\" Mr Webb said.\"There is a high probability that this policy will only raise a fraction of the amount expected by the chancellor.\"",

    "body": "Health officials in Glasgow are planning to make the case for a smoking space to be added to the city's drug consumption room.The Thistle, which opened on Hunter Street in January, is a facility in which people can inject heroin or cocaine while under medical supervision without being prosecuted.Officials involved in the three-year pilot project say a smoking space for taking cocaine is \"critical in order to realise the full benefit\" of the facility.Members of the city's integration joint board (IJB) — which oversees health and social care services — will be asked to approve the development of a business case for an inhalation space later.Since the Thistle opened, cocaine has been reported as 67% of substances injected, but officials said there is anecdotal evidence of a shift to smoking or inhalation of drugs, particularly cocaine.The IJB report states recent overdose clusters in Glasgow have been \"linked to increased smoking/inhalation of crack cocaine which has been contaminated with other substances.\"In September Glasgow's health board warned drug users against inhaling crack cocaine following a series of suspected drug incidents.It is currently not legal for Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership to operate a smoking room, but it is planning talks with the Scottish government over amending regulations to define the Thistle as an \"exempt service\".The Thistle is able to operate after the Lord Advocate announced users would not be prosecuted for possessing illegal drugs while on the site.A report to the IJB states if a smoking/inhalation room is added then the statement of prosecution policy may need to be amended, requiring further discussions with the Crown Office and the Lord Advocate.Legal issues, as well as costs and staffing and the best location for the space, would be explored during the development of the full business case.A room for smoking drugs was included in the original plans, but was dropped due to potential delays while legal issues were explored, as well as extra costs and ventilation requirements.Cocaine was implicated in 52% of drug-related deaths in Glasgow in 2024.Officials added feedback highlighted the lack of inhalation spaces as \"the main barrier to using the service\".The report said creating a smoking/inhalation space would let staff encourage clients to transition from injection to smoking, as well as reach out to users who do not use the Thistle.Inhalation rooms consist of individual enclosed booths that have a ventilation system designed to remove smoke and vapour. Community engagement on the proposed service is planned.By 31 October, 494 individuals had registered to use the Thistle, with 8,236 visits and 5,552 recorded injecting episodes. Staff had managed 69 medical emergencies and over 360 referrals to other services had been made.Most often these referrals were to housing services but also to alcohol and drug recovery services and other clinical services.Last week the UK government said it would not make changes to drug laws to allow the creation of more legal drug consumption rooms.Reporting by local democracy reporter Drew Sandelands.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterThe UK economy is expected to grow at a slower rate than previously expected from next year, the government's official forecaster has said.The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which maps out how the economy is set to perform based on the government's tax and spending policies, increased its growth expectations for this year, but downgraded its forecast for the following four.It said lower productivity growth - a measure of output of the economy per hour worked - was behind the weaker growth forecast.The OBR's forecast was published in error ahead of the Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivering her Budget on Wednesday.The OBR apologised for what it called a \"technical error\" and said an investigation was under way into how the error occurred. Reeves said the mistake was \"deeply disappointing\".In its forecast, the OBR predicted the economy would grow by 1.5% this year, higher than its previous estimate of 1%.However, it said growth would be lower at 1.4% in 2026 and 1.5% in the following four years - all of which are downgrades from its forecast made in March.\"We expect quarterly growth to pick up only gradually in the near term as geopolitical uncertainty persists and domestic business and consumer confidence remains subdued, including in anticipation of further tax rises,\" the OBR said.Previously growth had been expected to hit 1.9% next year, 1.8% in 2027, 1.7% in 2028 and 1.8% in 2029.In her Budget speech, the chancellor said the government had \"beat\" the growth forecast this year and \"we will beat them again\".The government has made growing the economy its number one pledge an effort to boost living standards across the UK.When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to created more jobs or give pay rises. Workers then tend to spend more of their disposable income and pay more in tax to the government. while firms making more profits will also pay more in tax.The downgrade in growth was a result of the OBR lowering its expectations for the UK's productivity by 0.3 percentage points. It said expected economic rebounds following recent shocks, such as the Covid pandemic and energy price crisis, had \"not materialised\".\"This decision is not a reflection of any particular government polices,\" it added. \"It is based on our latest assessment of the UK's productivity performance in historical and international context.\"The OBR said, in isolation, the reduction in productivity growth could have lowered government revenues by about £16bn in 2029-30.However, the government has announced a number of revenue raising measures, including freezing income tax thresholds for a further three years from 2028.The freeze in thresholds is forecast to result in 780,000 more income tax basic-rate taxpayers, 920,000 more people paying the higher-rate, and 4,000 more paying the additional-rate in 2029-30.As well as tax rises, the OBR said the chancellor's Budget policies would increase spending in every year and by £11bn in 2029-30, primarily to pay for \"reversals to welfare cuts and lift the two-child limit in universal credit\".As a result of the measures announced on Wednesday, the OBR said the chancellor had doubled the buffer against her fiscal rules to some £22bn.Reeves's has two main fiscal rules:Not borrowing to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliamentGetting government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliamentSuch rules are self-imposed by most governments in wealthy nations and are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets.Reeves has been keen to stress her rules are \"iron clad\" in an effort to assure such markets.Following the leak of the OBR's report, there was brief spell of volatility in the UK bond market before gilt yields - which give an indication of government borrowing costs - fell back to below the level they had been at before the detaisl leaked.The OBR said it expects the rate of inflation to be 3.5% this year - which is slightly higher than the forecaster's previous estimate in March of 3.2%. It also lifted next year's inflation forecast from 2.1% to 2.5%, but the rate is then expected to fall to 2% in 2027 and the following two years.Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, is expected to have reached a recent peak of 3.6% in the year to October.The UK's employment rate is currently at 5% and the OBR said it expects it to remain around the same level until 2027.The OBR expects earnings to grow on average by 3% between 2025 and 2029, up from 2.7% from its previous forecast.",

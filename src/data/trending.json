    "body": "Image source, SNSByMartin Dowden & Richard WintonBBC Sport ScotlandRangers captain James Tavernier insists his side can still reach the knockout stages of the Europa League despite taking just one point from their opening five fixtures.Ten-man Sporting Braga capitalised on Nasser Djiga's defensive error to earn a 1-1 draw at Ibrox after Rodrigo Zalazar was sent off for headbutting Nicolas Raskin.Tavernier had put Rangers ahead in first-half injury-time after Gabri Martinez handled, with the prolific full back's finish equaling former striker Ally McCoist's record of 21 European goals for the club.The draw ends Rangers' seven-game European losing streak, but with trips to Ferencvaros and Porto, either side of the visit of Ludogorets, to come and nine points needed to advance last season, progression would seem a long-shot.\"It feels almost like a loss,\" Tavernier conceded. \"Being a Rangers player, you have to win every single game. That's what we have to do from now to the end of this competition. \"It's definitely not over, but we have to build from this.\"Djiga contrived to head the ball into Martinez's path under no pressure to gift Braga a point, the defender appearing to lose the flight of the ball in swirling conditions.With John Souttar and Derek Cornelius injured, Djigi was paired with Emmanuel Fernandez, with the former ultimately costing Rangers a vital win.\"I've got no complaint with Nasser, everyone makes a mistake, but we ultimately should have that game tied up before that even happens,\" Tavernier added.\"We have to be more patient, probing around their final third instead of trying to shoot maybe when it's not on. I've spoken about it before, about being clinical in both boxes, and we've got to do that.\"If we keep it clean sheet, we win. That's our aim as a team, to keep clean sheets. We should have had that in our pocket with the 10 men that we were playing against.\"'No question we're going in right direction' - what Rohl saidMedia caption, 'First time I felt Rangers competitive in Europe' - RohlRangers boss Danny Rohl: \"I think it's disappointing but I look at the first 60 minutes. It was the first time I felt my team has been competitive in Europe. I think it's a step forward. But in the end we have to win and close the gaps.\"In the second half, I felt we controlled the game. And then it's one moment, we made one mistake and conceded a goal. This goal looks very cheap. I'm not looking for excuses in this case. I know in the second half the wind gave a lot of problems.\"We have to improve to play 90 minutes at our highest level.\"You can see the table. We didn't lose the opportunity just today. It's about the past four games. I've been here for four weeks and for 60 minutes I see a big difference.\"Today I really see the progress in our team performance. There is no question mark that it goes in the right direction. In European competition you cannot make many mistakes and this is something we have to work on.\"For me it's not about the character of the group when I see how hard they work since I'm here, how much effort they put in. There is of course pressure, there is expectation, you have to deliver.\"'I'm not sure they're capable of better' - what the pundits saidFormer Rangers striker & manager Ally McCoist: \"My concern, and it's a big concern, is I'm not sure the team is capable of a lot better than that. I really hope I'm wrong. \"You can't make mistakes like the goal they conceded. I'm not sure these players can take Rangers to the next level. There's an awful lot of work to be done.\"Former Rangers midfielder Andy Halliday: \"I think one of the biggest criticisms you've got is that mental side. It just seems as if there's these lapses of concentration.\"It's just a nothing ball into the box. There's no striker or no Braga opponent anywhere near Djiga. He completely misjudges the flight of the ball.\"What the fans saidGary: Rohl has seriously lost the plot if he thinks that is 100% progress. What's he on, because  the supporters need it after that.Jonny: Djiga and Fernandez aren't good enough. Danilo and Aarons are better but still not good enough. Chermiti isn't good enough. This team needs gutted. I'm sick of watching Tav lose it and start shouting and bawling at them all. Gary: That Rangers team is terrible. One of the worst to ever don't the famous blue jersey. Not one of them deserves to be playing for the club. That's how badly we've plummeted.Denis: Rangers, what a load of rubbish. Team has no backbone, there are a lot of players that are just not good enough. January can't come quick enough. Hopefully the manager will get the support he needs to bring in better players.David: Another dismal pedestrian performance from Rangers, how fans can pay to watch that team every week is beyond me.Steven: Let's accept Rangers are not reaching the next round. Even if we'd achieved a result tonight, we can't beat Porto - not with this defence.Get in touchSend us your views on Rangers",

    "body": "The Trump administration has said it will re-examine green cards issued to individuals who immigrated to the US from 19 countries. The head of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said the president had directed him to conduct \"a full scale, rigorous re-examination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern\".When asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the agency pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.The announcement comes in the wake of an Afghan national allegedly shooting two National Guard troops in Washington DC on Wednesday, gravely injuring them both.The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, came to the US in 2021 under a programme that offered special immigration protections to Afghans in the wake of America's withdrawal from Afghanistan.President Donald Trump said the shooting underlined a major national security threat.Edlow's social media post on Thursday about the sweeping green card review did not explictly mention that attack.\"The protection of this country and of the American people remains paramount, and the American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration's reckless resettlement policies,\" said Edlow.There were no further details about what the re-examination would look like. The June proclamation his agency highlighted to the BBC set out an aim to restrict foreign nationals from entering the US to protect from \"foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats\".The administration said security concerns and the overstay rate of business, student and tourists visas were among the reasons for a country to make the list. \"The Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, controls Afghanistan,\" the proclamation said. \"Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.\"Other countries whose green card holders will undergo this examination include Burma, Chad, Republic of Congo and Libya.The Wednesday attack on members of the US military prompted a forceful response from Trump. \"This attack underscores the greatest national security threat facing our nation,\" the president said. \"The last administration let in 20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world, from places that you don't even want to know about. No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival.\"Last week, the same agency behind the green card review, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced a review of all refugees admitted under former President Joe Biden.On Wednesday, the US suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, with Citizenship and Immigration Services saying the decision was made pending a review of \"security and vetting protocols\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal correspondentIrish author Sally Rooney has told the High Court it is \"almost certain\" she cannot publish new novels in the UK and may have to withdraw her current books because of the banning of Palestine Action under terrorism laws.Rooney says UK legislation may mean she cannot be paid royalties by her British publisher or the BBC because it could leave both at risk of being accused of funding terrorism.In August she said she intended to use royalties \"to go on supporting Palestine Action.\"The group was banned in July after the home secretary accused it of causing serious damage to property. Its co-founder is challenging that ban in the High Court, arguing it interferes with the right to protest.The author of Normal People, which was adapted into one of the most watched BBC dramas of recent years, has supported the campaign to reverse the ban.In two witness statements provided to the High Court, Rooney said she believed that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza - and Palestine Action's activity in the UK was from a \"long and proud tradition of civil disobedience - the deliberate breaking of laws as an act of protest.\"She goes on: \"I myself have publicly advocated the use of direct action, including property sabotage, in the cause of climate justice. It stands to reason that I should support the same range of tactics in the effort to prevent genocide.\"Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence.Rooney said the ban on Palestine Action under terrorism laws also had far reaching consequences for her as an author and her right to free expression.She explained she periodically receives royalties from the BBC's adaptions.In August she declared in an Irish Times article that she intended to use those royalties \"to go on supporting Palestine Action.\"Following that statement, she said she had been advised that any such payment to her for those televised dramatisations could be a breach of terrorism laws.That warning had come from the independent producer of the two BBC dramatisations of her novels. It told her agent that it had received \"unambiguous legal advice\" that if it knew or suspected that Rooney was using royalties from the TV dramas to fund Palestine Action, then sending her the money would be a terrorism offence.\"It is therefore unclear whether any UK company can continue to make payments to me, even when it had agreed to do so,\" said Rooney.Rooney told the court that this legal uncertainty affected her rights as an artist - and her publisher's too.\"If ... Faber & Faber Limited are legally prohibited from paying me the royalties I am owed, my existing works may have to be withdrawn from sale,\" she said.\"My novels have been influential and popular in Britain, where I am among the best-selling literary authors of the last decade.\"The disappearance of my work from bookshops would mark a truly extreme incursion by the state into the realm of artistic expression.\"It is also almost certain that I can no longer publish or produce any new work within the UK while this proscription remains in effect.\"Rooney publicly revealed in September that she did not believe she could travel to the UK anymore because of her stance.\"I am and will continue to be a committed supporter of Palestine Action. If that support is criminalised, I will effectively be prevented from speaking at any future public events in the UK.\"Is it likely that I could ever again collaborate with British public institutions like the BBC as I have done in the past?\"The hearing continues through Thursday with a final day of submissions next week.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNadine YousifWatch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah BeckstromOne of the two members of the National Guard who were shot in Washington DC on Wednesday has died, US President Donald Trump said. Sarah Beckstrom, 20,  succumbed to her injuries, President Trump said on Thursday evening. The second National Guard member, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, \"is fighting for his life\", he said. Both were shot at close range near Farragut Square in downtown just after 14:00 EST (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Police have arrested one suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old from Afghanistan.President Trump confirmed Ms Beckstrom's death while on a Thanksgiving call with US service members. \"Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we're talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person ... She's just passed away. She's no longer with us,\" he said. Trump later spoke with her parents, a White House official told BBC's US partner CBS News.Ms Beckstrom had enlisted on 26 June 2023 and was assigned to the 863rd Military Police Company, 111th Engineer Brigade of the West Virginia Army National Guard. She had volunteered to work in the nation's capital over the American Thanksgiving holiday, Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News after the shooting.Jim Justice, a Republican senator from West Virginia, said he was \"absolutely devastated\" to learn of Ms Beckstrom's passing. \"Our prayers are with her family, friends, and fellow guardsmen during an incredibly difficult Thanksgiving Day,\" he said in a statement.\"We are also lifting up Andrew Wolfe in prayer as he continues his journey to recovery.\"Both soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets, an area where many office workers mill around at lunchtime.More than 2,000 troops have been guarding the nation's capital since August, when the president began deploying troops to cities to tackle what he called \"out of control\" crime.Ms Beckstrom and Mr Wolfe were among those who were deployed in August, the West Virginia National Guard confirmed to BBC News.National Guard troops are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.The location of the shooting, just blocks from the White House, meant a number of law enforcement officials were quickly on the scene to treat the two victims and apprehend the gunman.The suspect was shot four times while he was apprehended, law enforcement sources told CBS News.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanSuspect once worked alongside CIA in AfghanistanOfficials said Mr Lakanwal came to the US from Afghanistan in 2021.He will be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed as well as possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said on Thursday morning at a news conference, before news of Ms Beckstrom's death. \"We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree,\" Pirro added. \"But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge: murder in the first degree.\"Attorney General Bondi told Fox News on Thursday that her office will seek the death penalty against the suspect, calling him a \"monster who should not have been in our country\".Mr Lakanwal reportedly came to the US under a programme named Operation Allies Welcome, which offered special immigration protections to Afghans in the wake of America's withdrawal from Afghanistan.He had helped guard US forces at Kabul airport in 2021 as thousands scrambled to escape Afghanistan before the Taliban took power, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC's Afghan Service.The suspect had been recruited to Unit 03 of the Kandahar Strike Force. His unit was known locally as Scorpion Forces, operating initially under the CIA but eventually for the Afghan intelligence department known as the National Directorate of Security.Mr Lakanwal was a GPS tracker specialist, the former commander told the BBC, describing him as a \"sporty and jolly character\".His whole unit was moved from Kandahar to Kabul five days before the Taliban entered the capital. They continued to protect the airport for another six days, before they too were airlifted out to the US.At a press conference on Thursday morning, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed Mr Lakanwal's connection to US forces, saying the suspect \"had a relationship in Afghanistan with partner forces\", before moving to the US.Mr Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024, and his application had been granted earlier this year, an official told CBS.On Thursday, Joseph Edlow US Citizenship and Immigration Services chief said the president had directed him to conduct \"a full scale, rigorous re-examination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern\".When asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the agency pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.Hafizullah Maroof and Sayed Abdullah Nizami of BBC Afghan Service contributed to this report",

    "body": "4 hours agoThe government's plans to drop unfair dismissal safeguards for new employees on the first day of a new job leads many of Friday's papers. \"Day-one dismissal protection axed\" is the lead in the Financial Times, as Labour \"caved to pressure from businesses to soften its workers' rights legislation\". The Daily Telegraph also leads with Labour \"abandoning plans to allow employees to sue for unfair dismissal on day one of their employment\". The paper says it is the \"second manifesto breach in as many days\", following the Budget's \"threshold freeze on income tax\". \"Labour U-turn on worker rights\" is the i paper's take on the government's plan to wind back proposals for day-one dismissal protections. The move is \"criticised by Labour MPs but welcomed by business\", according to the paper. The unfair dismissal threshold will extend to six months, the Guardian reports, under a compromise deal accepted by the TUC. It writes the TUC accepts the arrangement, with general secretary Paul Nowak saying other parts of the workers' rights bill, such as \"day-one sick pay\", are an \"absolute priority\". The Times reports that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faces a \"revolt from Labour MPs\" after scrapping day-one protections, saying the policy was \"championed\" by former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner.New ONS migration figures showing a drop in UK arrivals is the Metro lead story. \"Only 204,000 more people are living in the UK\" reads the headline, noting \"asylum arrivals rising\" while \"fewer coming here to study and work\". The paper quotes Sir Keir who \"hails migration fall\" as he faces \"pressure from Reform UK on migrant arrivals.Britain faces a \"brain drain\", the Daily Mail says, citing migration data revealing \"an exodus of young Britons while asylum seekers now make up nearly half of net migration\".Sir Keir's defence of the Budget leads the Independent. \"Keir Starmer forced to deny he misled public over record £26bn tax rises,\" is the paper's top line, as he denies Labour broke its manifesto pledge \"not to hike tax on working people\", citing criticism from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Terry Smith, Rachel Reeves's uncle, tells the Sun: \"Britain's being fleeced by my niece\", compounding other critics who describe the Budget \"as a bonanza for benefit claimants\". Reeves's 73-year-old uncle joins a \"long line of detractors\", the paper writes.Meanwhile, the Daily Express leads with calls from terminally-ill campaigners pushing for the Lords to end delays to passing an assisted dying law. They say peers' amendments opposing the original bill are \"stealing precious time and choice\", the paper writes. A potential fresh lead in the Jill Dando murder is reported on by the Daily Mirror. The Crimewatch host was shot dead on her doorstop in 1999 and the paper says investigators are probing \"a newly unearthed picture\" of what the paper claims is \"a Serbian assassin\".\"Jack (Osbourne) plots huge comeback\", reads the headline on the Daily Star's front page, saying the I'm a Celebrity... Get me out of here! contestant has been \"secretly filming a paranormal series in a bid to be a huge TV host\". Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoJon Donnison,JerusalemandDoug FaulknerWatch: BBC correspondent examines footage showing moments leading up to shooting in the occupied West BankVideo has emerged showing Israeli security forces shooting dead two Palestinians who appeared to have surrendered in the occupied West Bank.The incident happened during an ongoing Israeli military operation in the city of Jenin. The Palestinian Authority (PA) accused Israeli forces of committing a \"war crime\" and described the killings as \"brutal\" field executions.The Israeli military and police say the men were wanted men \"affiliated with a terror network\" and the incident is under review. Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has given his full backing to the officers involved, adding that \"terrorists must die\".The video shows two Palestinian men come out of a building with their hands up. They are surrounded by a number of Israeli border guards. They then kneel on the ground. One of them lifts his t-shirt, apparently to show that he is not armed.After a short period, they move back into the building. Border police then open fire, killing them.A joint statement from the IDF and police said forces had been trying to apprehend wanted individuals who had carried out \"terror activities\", including throwing explosives and firing at security forces.\"The forces entered the area, enclosed the structure in which the suspects were located, and initiated a surrender procedure that lasted several hours,\" the statement said.\"Following the use of engineering tools on the structure, the two suspects exited. Following their exit, fire was directed toward the suspects.\"Writing on X, Ben-Gvir said \"the fighters acted exactly as expected of them\".The raid in Jenin is the latest in a months-long Israeli campaign in cities in the northern West Bank, which Israel says is necessary to tackle Palestinian armed groups it says were responsible for attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers. On Wednesday the Israeli military launched an operation in the nearby city of Tubas.Violence in the West Bank has spiked since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023, which led to a devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza.Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, including members of armed groups and civilians, in the West Bank since then, the UN says. At least 44 Israelis, including soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during Israeli military operations, Israel says. ",

    "body": "42 minutes agoHenry Zeffman,Chief political correspondentandPaul Seddon,Political reporterGetty ImagesThe government has U-turned on its manifesto commitment to offer all workers the right to claim unfair dismissal from their first day in a job.Ministers now plan to introduce the right after six months instead, after business groups voiced concerns it would discourage firms from hiring.The government argued it was making the climbdown to stop its employment legislation being delayed in the House of Lords, where it has run into opposition. Other new day-one rights to sick pay and paternity leave will still go ahead, coming into effect in April 2026. A source said most unions backed the changes, though Unite said the U-turn would \"damage workers' confidence\".Business groups welcomed the announcement, which followed talks between major industry groups and unions.In a statement, the six business groups involved in the discussions said companies would be \"relieved\" - but added firms still had \"concerns about many of the powers\" contained in the government's employment package.Currently, employers face additional legal hurdles if they want to sack employees who have been in their role continuously for two years.They must identify a fair reason for dismissal - such as conduct or capability - and show that they acted reasonably and followed a fair process.Labour had planned to abolish this qualifying period completely, alongside a new legal probation period, likely to have been nine months. The promise was a central pledge in Labour's manifesto ahead of last year's general election, and a key plank of its Employment Rights Bill.Labour pledged to create \"basic rights from day one to parental leave, sick pay, and protection from unfair dismissal\".But asked if it was a breach of the Labour manifesto, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said: \"No.\"Instead, he argued the manifesto had pledged to \"bring people together\" and \"that this would not be legislation that pits one side against another\".Speaking to broadcasters, Kyle said the compromise had been found by \"unions and the employers\" and it was \"not my job to stand in the way of that compromise\". The government now plans to implement unfair dismissal protection after six months instead of day one, and ditch the new legal probation period.In recent weeks, the House of Lords has twice voted in favour of a six-month period, slowing the legislation's passage through Parliament. The Fair Work Agency - a new body tasked with overseeing the new rights - will also be set up in 2026, the government announced.'Humiliating'There had been fears day one rights could overwhelm an employment tribunals system already facing huge backlogs.One union source has told the BBC that the \"vast majority of unions\" present at discussions were comfortable with introducing unfair dismissal only after six months.The Trades Union Congress (TUC) welcomed the news, adding the \"absolute priority now is to get these rights – like day one sick pay - on the statute book so that working people can start benefitting from them from next April.\"TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak called on the Lords to \"respect Labour's manifesto mandate\" and ensure the legislation was passed as soon as possible.Kate Nicholls, chair of UK Hospitality, said: \"This is a pragmatic change that addresses one of hospitality businesses' key concerns.\"The six-month waiting period would \"give businesses much-needed breathing room and avoid further damage to employment opportunities,\" she added.Labour MP Andy McDonald branded the move a \"complete betrayal\" and vowed to push for its reversal.\"When Keir Starmer asked me to work with our trade unions to develop a programme for the biggest uplift in workers' rights and protections in a generation, I did exactly as I was asked and we produced the New Deal for Working People,\" he said.But Unite the Union - a major Labour donor through the affiliation fees its members pay to the party - hit out at the U-turn, adding the employment bill was now a \"shell of its former self\".Unite general secretary Sharon Graham added: \"These constant row backs will only damage workers' confidence that the protections promised will be worth the wait. Labour needs to keep its promises.\"The Conservatives called the U-turn \"humiliating\" but added that the legislation was \"still not fit-for-purpose\".\"Keir Starmer must grow a backbone, stand up to his union paymasters and ditch every single job-destroying anti-growth measure in the employment rights bill now,\" added shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith.",

    "body": "12 hours agoPritti Mistry,Business reporterandArchie MitchellGetty ImagesHouseholds are facing a \"truly dismal\" increase in living standards after the Budget, the head of an influential think tank has warned as it accused Labour of breaching its manifesto promise.Average disposable income - a measure of people's earnings after tax - will rise by just 0.5% over each of the next five years, according to the government''s official forecaster.IFS boss Helen Miller said she considered the rise in National Insurance, due to the cap on salary sacrifice pension payments and the freezing of tax thresholds, a breach of its pledge not to raise taxes on working peopleThe prime minister told the BBC Labour made \"a number of commitments in our manifesto, which we have kept\".According to the IFS, average disposable income per person is expected to rise by nearly £104 a year for the next four years, under current inflation forecasts.\"Before this Budget, the UK was faced with lacklustre economic growth, stagnating living standards, and a dizzying array of fiscal pressures,\" Ms Miller said.\"The same is still true after this Budget.\"Ms Miller said the growth in disposable income - which measures the amount of money people have left to spend after taxes have been paid - was disappointing \"especially when compared to the more than 2% per year we achieved across every parliament from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s\".Her comments were backed up by the Resolution Foundation think tank, which predicted that the growth in living standards in this parliament would be the second worst on record.Ahead of last year's general election, Labour promised not to increase taxes on \"working people\", including National Insurance, Income Tax and VAT.The prime minister accepted he was asking \"everybody to make a contribution\", which he said was \"fair and necessary\".\"I absolutely wanted to bear down and reduce the cost of living because for most... that will be the single most important thing.\"Reeves also denied the Budget broke manifesto pledges but admitted her policies would have \"an impact on working people\".She told the BBC this contribution had been kept \"to a minimum\" because of other changes such as increasing taxes on online gambling, properties worth more than £2m and income from dividends or renting out property.In her Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves chose to extend the freeze on income tax thresholds for a further three years beyond 2028. She also imposed a £2,000-a-year cap on the amount put into pensions from 2029 through a salary sacrifice arrangement before National Insurance payments are due.Budget 2025The chancellor also highlighted other measures aimed at cutting the cost of living, including freezing NHS prescription charges and regulated rail fares in England, as well as scrapping green levies added to energy bills.Asked if she would apologise for breaking her promise not to increase taxes on working people, Reeves said she had made \"fair and necessary choices\" to cut NHS waiting lists, lift children out of poverty and reduce the cost of living.In the run-up to the Budget, there was much speculation about the UK's finances and the outlook for the economy, and how the chancellor faced big gaps in meeting her fiscal rules on borrowing, leading to uncertainty in financial markets.Giving her analysis of the Budget, Ms Miller noted how the OBR's \"overall forecast downgrade was minimal\" and there was \"no big fiscal repair job\" to do.In an interview with the BBC, she also said the government appeared to have ignored its stated number one mission to boost economic growth.\"We shouldn't expect every Budget to solve all of our problems, but I think it's reasonable to expect that for a government that makes such a big deal of having growth as its number one mission, they would be doing more to drive up growth,\" she said.Ms Miller said Reeves could have reformed the tax system to boost the economy and that the government also has \"hard yards\" to do in areas such as competition policy, regulation and education.",

According to new scientific evidence, the shift from wild hunter to pampered pet happened much more recently than previously thought - and in a different place.A study of bones found at archaeological sites suggests cats began their close relationship with humans only a few thousand years ago, and in northern Africa not the Levant. \"They are ubiquitous, we make TV programmes about them, and they dominate the internet,\" said Prof Greger Larson of the University of Oxford.\"That relationship we have with cats now only gets started about 3.5 or 4,000 years ago, rather than 10,000 years ago.\" Getty ImagesCats were domesticated long after dogsAll modern cats are descended from the same species - the African wildcat.How, where and when they lost their wildness and developed close bonds with humans has long puzzled scientists.To solve the mystery, researchers analysed DNA from cat bones found at archaeological sites across Europe, North Africa and Anatolia. They dated the bones, analysed the DNA and compared this with the gene pool of modern cats.The new evidence shows cat domestication didn't start at the dawn of agriculture - in the Levant. Instead, it happened a few millennia later, somewhere in northern Africa.\"Instead of happening in that area where people are first settling down with agriculture, it looks like it is much more of an Egyptian phenomenon,\" said Prof Larson.  Ziyi Li and Wenquan FanThe skull of a leopard cat found in a Han-dynasty tomb in Xinzheng City, Henan Province, ChinaThis fits with our knowledge of the land of the pharaohs as a society that revered cats, immortalising them in art and preserving them as mummies.Once cats became associated with people, they were moved around the world, prized as ship cats and pest controllers. Cats only reached Europe around 2,000 years ago, much later than previously thought.They travelled around Europe and into the UK with the Romans and then started moving east along the Silk Road into China.Today, they are found in all parts of the world, except Antarctica.GettyThe leopard cat is the most widespread wild cat in AsiaAnd in a new twist, the scientists discovered that a wild cat hung out for a while with people in China long before domestic cats came on the scene.These rival kitties were leopard cats, small wild cats with leopard-like spots, that lived in human settlements in China for around 3,500 years.The early human-leopard cat relationship was essentially \"commensal\" where two species live alongside each other harmlessly, said Prof Shu-Jin Luo of Peking University in Beijing. \"Leopard cats benefited from living near people, while humans were largely unaffected or even welcomed them as natural rodent controllers,\" she said.GettyThe Bengal cat is a breed of hybrid cat created from crossing an Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) with domestic catsLeopard cats did not become domesticated and continue to live wild across Asia.Curiously, leopard cats have recently been crossed with domestic cats to produce Bengal cats, which were recognised as a new breed in the 1980s.The research is published in the journal, Science and in Cell Genomics.",

    "body": "10 hours agoBen ChuPolicy and analysis correspondent, BBC VerifyGetty ImagesRachel Reeves has raised taxes again in her latest Budget. Though she conceded that \"ordinary people\" will contribute more in tax in the coming years, the chancellor has also argued it will require those with the \"broadest shoulders\" to pay more.Ms Reeves has also stressed that other measures in the Budget - such as freezing rail fares in England and fuel duty across the UK and removing some costs from domestic electricity bills - will ease the cost of living squeeze for many families.And the government estimates that the decision to scrap the two child limit on benefits will reduce relative child poverty by 450,000 by the end of the Parliament and raise average incomes in affected families by £5,310 a year.So do these claims add up?BBC Verify has examined what we know about how the Budget is likely to financially affect different groups.What does it mean for you?The impact of the Budget will depend on the individual characteristics of each household.For instance, someone on a low income who does not have more than two children will not benefit from the scrapping of the two child benefit cap. And someone on a modest income who drives an electric vehicle would be hit by the new mileage charge for EVs.Similarly, someone on a higher income who gets a lot of mileage out of their petrol car or uses a lot of energy at home could benefit more from the measures intended to help people with the high cost of living instead of people on lower incomes.The Resolution Foundation think tank has produced some representative households to demonstrate these different effects:It finds that, as a result of all the tax and benefit changes since the Autumn Budget in 2024, lower income households are more likely to benefit than to lose out financially, while for higher income households it's the reverse.It also finds that pensioner households are more likely to benefit from Reeves' budget measures than working-age households, with 56% benefiting versus only 33% of families with children.Do the wealthy bear more of the new tax burden?Measures in the Budget such as the new high value council tax surcharge in England (set to raise £400m a year in 2029-30) and the increased income tax rates on property, savings and dividend income (set to raise £2.1bn a year) will predominantly fall on people with higher incomes since richer people tend to have more property wealth and more income from those sources.The same is true of the plan to charge National Insurance on pension contributions made through workplace salary sacrifice schemes (set to raise £4.7bn).The Treasury's analysis suggests that by 2028-29 the tax measures in the Budget will reduce the incomes of the top 10% of earners in the UK population by around £2,000.By contrast, the incomes of middle earners will be lower by around £300 and the incomes of the bottom 20% of earners will be some £200 lower.Most earners will lose out because of the decision to extend the freeze in income tax thresholds by an additional three years from 2027-28. It drags more people - including those on relatively modest incomes - into paying more tax as their incomes rise with inflation.Those currently earning below the personal allowance of £12,571 will find, as wages rise but thresholds don't, they will pay tax for the first time. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates it could be as many as 780,000 more people paying tax by 2029-30.Do the less well off benefit from other Budget measures?The Treasury's analysis also suggests that people on lower incomes will benefit much more than richer people from measures such as taking costs off electricity bills, freezing fuel duty and the scrapping of the two child limit, with the top 30% of earners seeing little cash gain.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has put some of the main measures in the Budget together in its own analysis.Those measures are:The freeze in personal tax thresholdsThe fuel duty freezeScrapping the two child benefit limitThe high value council tax surcharge in EnglandThe think tank finds that by 2030-31 the net impact of these measures will be that the incomes of the lowest 20% of earners will be higher by between £220 and £290, whereas the incomes of the top 10% will be lower by around £700.It's worth bearing in mind, however, that these calculations only show the impact of the Budget measures.Determining what actually happens to people's incomes overall, wherever they are in the UK's income distribution, will be how the wider economy performs.And the downgrade in the OBR's latest overall UK growth forecast means it also now projects average UK real household disposable incomes (RHDI) per person - the Government's chosen target measure of living standards - to grow by just 0.5 per cent a year on average by the end of the Parliament.According to the Resolution Foundation, that would mean average income growth of just £740 (in 2025-26 money) over the Parliament, which would make this the second worst Parliament for income growth on record.Additional reporting by Phil Leake",

    "body": "13 hours agoJonny HumphriesandLynette Horsburgh,North WestPAA total of seven people have now been arrested, although five have been released without chargeA man has been arrested at Manchester Airport on suspicion of terror offences over the synagogue attack in the city earlier this year, police have said. Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz died at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on 2 October in the attack by Jihad Al-Shamie, who was shot dead by police, while three other men were treated in hospital for serious injuries.A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism after arriving on an inbound flight earlier, Greater Manchester Police said.The arrest brings the total number of people arrested in connection with the attack to seven.Melvin Cravitz (left) and Adrian Daulby (right) died after Jihad Al-Shamie launched a car and knife attackFive of those have been released without charge, but a 30-year-old man arrested on 9 October on suspicion of failing to disclose information under the Terrorism Act remains on bail.The opening of inquest proceedings last month heard Al-Shamie drove his car into a security guard outside the synagogue as people were gathering for Yom Kippur, before getting out and attacking Mr Cravitz with a knife. Congregants inside the building, including Mr Daulby, managed to shut the doors and held them closed as Al-Shamie tried to batter his way inside.Manchester Coroner's Court heard armed officers opened fire on Al-Shamie, but a stray bullet penetrated the door of the synagogue and fatally struck Mr Daulby in the chest. Jihad Al-Shamie called 999 from the scene of the attack and pledged his allegiance to the so-called Islamic State groupAssistant Chief Constable Rob Potts of Counter Terrorism Policing North West said the families of Mr Cravitz and Mr Daulby, as well as victims who survived serious injuries, had been informed of the latest arrest. He added: \"Our investigation is continuing, and I would once again appeal for anyone with information that they think could assist our enquiries to please come forward. \"We are also still seeking to identify and speak to anyone who was present at the time of the incident or the immediate aftermath so that we can ensure they have access to all the welfare support options that are available to witnesses.\"Last month Rabbi Daniel Walker, who alongside his congregants held the doors of the synagogue shut, said the empty seats where Mr Daulby and Mr Cravitz used to sit were one of the \"first things I see\" whenever he entered the building.\"They were both very, very special men,\" he told the BBC.\"Adrian was a very quiet man - a man of great dignity, always with a smile, always kind, very much loved by his family and his neighbours.\"Melvin was also a wonderful man - a family man.\"More on this story",

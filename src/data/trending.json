    "body": "What growing up in war does to a child's brain - and how it really affects them years later9 hours agoFergal KeaneSpecial correspondent BBCContent warning: this article includes details about the impact of conflict on children in war zones and descriptions of injuries that some readers may find distressing.The first thing was that Abdelrahman's dad was killed. The family home was struck by an Israeli air strike. The boy's mum, Asma al-Nashash, 29, remembers that \"they brought him out in pieces\".Then on 16 July 2024 an air strike hit the school in Nuseirat, central Gaza. Eleven-year-old Abdelrahman was seriously wounded. Doctors had to amputate his leg.His mental state began to deteriorate. \"He started pulling his hair and hitting himself hard,\" Asma recalls. \"He became like someone who has depression, seeing his friends playing and running around… and he's sitting alone.\"When I meet Abdelrahman at a hospital in Jordan in May 2025, he is withdrawn and wary. Dozens of children have been evacuated to the Kingdom from Gaza for medical treatment.\"We will return to Gaza,\" he tells me. \"We will die there.\"Abdelrahman is one of thousands of traumatised children I've met in my nearly four decades of reporting on conflicts. Certain faces are embedded in my memory. Some as though I had only met them yesterday. They reflect the depth of terror inflicted on children in our time.AFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesHundreds of thousands of children have lived through more than two years of war in GazaThe first was on a hilltop in Eritrea in the mid-1980s. Adonai Mikael was a child victim of an Ethiopian napalm strike, crying in agony as the wind blew dust on to his wounds. The cries, the expression of pure agony in his eyes sent me fleeing from the tent where he was being treated. In Belfast a few years later, I remember a boy following the coffin of his father, blown up by the IRA. Never before had I seen such a distance in anyone's eyes.In Sierra Leone during the civil war, there was the girl whose hands were hacked off by a drunken militiaman; from Soweto there is the image of a child helping her mother mop the blood of a murder victim on their doorstep; and in Rwanda the boy who broke down when I asked him why the other children called him \"Grenade\" – a moment of insensitivity I will always regret.He had been wounded by an explosion that killed his parents.Figures underscore the sheer scale of the crisis. In 2024, 520 million children were living in conflict zones - one in every five children worldwide - according to an analysis by the Peace Research Institute Oslo, which pieced together conflict records with population data to arrive at the estimate.Prof Theresa Betancourt, author of Shadows into Light, a book about former child soldiers, calls this \"the largest humanitarian disaster since World War Two\".She warns trauma has an impact that lasts long into the future. \"[It can affect] the developing architecture of the brain in young children, with lifelong consequences for learning, behaviour, and both physical and mental health.\"But given how much time has been spent researching the impact of war on children's minds, what can help?This is a question that has never been more relevant following this period of multiple global conflicts that have affected millions of children: from those Sudanese children who, in October, saw their mothers and sisters raped by militiamen in el-Fasher, Darfur; the youngsters abducted from Israel by Hamas on 7 October, 2023, many having witnessed the slaughter of family and neighbours; the children of Bucha in Ukraine whose parents were among the people massacred by Russian troops in February 2022; and the hundreds of thousands of children like Abdelrahman who have endured more than two years of war in Gaza.AFP via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesSudanese refugees in 2025I should declare a personal interest. I suffered from post traumatic stress disorder – PTSD both as a child in a broken home, and later as an adult, witnessing war and genocide. Though different from experiencing war as a child, I know the symptoms all too well: the extreme anxiety, hypervigilance – being constantly on guard against threats - flashbacks, nightmares, and depression. The symptoms were severe enough to require several hospitalisations.Personal experience has made me intensely curious about how children respond and are treated.\"The evidence is quite solid across different studies that the exposure to war and displacement is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems,\" says Michael Pluess, a professor of psychology at the University of Surrey.He has carried out long-term research into the children of Syrian war refugees, and cautions against making assumptions. \"It's important to recognise that children differ in how they respond.\"A variety of factors can influence the outcome. How long was the child exposed to the traumatic events? Were they physically wounded? Did they lose an important person in their life, or see them killed or injured? Did they have physical security and emotional support in the aftermath?In a sample of 2,976 children from Bosnia-Herzegovina - all of whom had been exposed to war and were aged between nine and 14 - high levels of post-traumatic symptoms and grief symptoms were reported.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGetty ImagesBosnia-Herzegovina: Children in SarajevoBut there is the potential for long-term health damage – heart disease, autoimmune problems - linked to \"toxic stress\", where the body is flooded with hormones like cortisol and catecholamines, which produce adrenaline.There is also a developing field of research into epigenetics, which asks whether the experience of trauma by one generation can show up in later generations through changes in the way our genes behave.Are we more susceptible to, say, poor mental health, addictions or other health problems if our families have a history of trauma - and how much has this to do with genetics versus our family setups and everyday lives?The family drip-feed effectEpigenetics is a tentative and debated area of scientific research with much still to be learned.\"I think there is some evidence that there is a sort of intergenerational transmission of trauma,\" says Prof Pluess. \"Some of that or much of that will happen through social practice rather than biological practice, but there's some evidence to suggest that there are some epigenetic factors as well.\"Prof Metin Başoğlu, director of the Istanbul Centre for Behavioural Sciences, is sceptical. However, he says it is possible that certain temperament traits (for example, predispositions that are transmitted genetically across generations) might make some people more vulnerable to traumatic events.During research for a book on my own PTSD, I remember a conversation with one of Britain's most eminent experts in the field, Prof Simon Wessely, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. I wondered whether my own family history – great-grandparents born during the Irish famine, a grandmother who was traumatised by her war experiences in the 1920s – could have made me more genetically predisposed to PTSD?\"There is simply no way of knowing, without studying a representative sample group from the same area, with ancestors born in the same place and subjected to the same conditions,\" he told me. \"I can't do it on one person…\"What I think is much easier to understand - and, I think, is also the most powerful - is the influence of our background. And it's absolutely impossible for you to have grown up in the household that you did, with the interests that you have, for that not to have the same effect on you.\"AFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesProf Pluess has carried out long-term research into the children of Syrian war refugees, and cautions against making assumptionsThere is broader consensus that trauma is a family crisis. It isn't only a question of what a child witnesses or survives – there is also the impact on adults.\"Not only do children in war zones face the death of caregivers and traumatic separations,\" says Prof Betancourt, \"but caregivers experiencing their own trauma and distress may not be fully available to help protect and guide their children through the horrors of war.\"Prof Pluess's research among Syrian refugees supports this. Among the 80% of children found to be vulnerable to more than one psychological disorder, family circumstances were critical.Around 1,600 families took part in a study, published in 2022, of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Prof Pluess says that children's living conditions (such as access to safe housing, food, and schooling) were found to be \"about 10 times more predictive of their mental health\".Children who adapted more healthily may have \"had a social environment that was very protective, maybe the parents were able to shield them, maybe they had close friendships, relationships, maybe they have access to school, all those external things that sort of buffer the negative impact of war exposure.\"The roots of this knowledge in Britain go back to WW2 and the experience of children who lived through the Blitz – the eight months of German air attacks between September 1940 and May 1941.Getty ImagesHulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis via Getty ImagesFox Photos/Getty Images\"The evidence is quite solid [...] exposure to war and displacement is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems,\" says Prof PluessProf Edgar Jones, of King's College London, points to a study of 212 children treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children during the war. When researchers went back to the children in 1949 – four years after the conflict ended – they found only 21% had recovered. The role of parents – both positive and negative – emerged as an important finding.\"The severity of a child's reaction to bombing was judged to be influenced by their parents' response to the trauma either to accentuate or calm their anxiety,\" says Prof Jones.Overcoming fear and establishing controlIn my own experience, therapy and medication helped, but also the ongoing support of family and friends. Without the power of caring relationships I don't believe I could have emerged from the darkness.I was also encouraged to confront my avoidance of anything that might remind me of the trauma. For example, I went through a long period of avoiding travel to the continent of Africa, fearing that simply being there would trigger reminders of the Rwandan genocide. But my therapist gradually encouraged me to face the fear. It took several years but I did return, and continue to visit places there that are dear to my heart.Prof Başoğlu pioneered the use of what is called CFBT – Control Focused Behavioural Treatment - among survivors of the 1999 Turkish earthquake, which killed about 18,000 people.The idea is to encourage the individual to take control of their fear of the event recurring. In the case of children who were constantly clinging to their parents, this was attempted by encouraging them to get used to sleeping alone.\"Once they overcome their fear, all the traumatic stress reactions that are associated with fear also improve,\" Prof Başoğlu says.Israeli psychologists working with children released from Hamas captivity after the 7 October attacks also stress the importance of re-establishing a sense of control.Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGlobal conflicts have affected millions of children, including the young people abducted from Israel by Hamas on 7 October, 2023, those who witnessed the slaughter of family and neighbours that day, and those dealing with the aftermathIn a paper for the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health journal, a team of Israeli specialists wrote that this was achieved \"by providing survivors with information and space to express their concerns while ensuring that their needs and voices are heard\".But successful interventions depend greatly on creating a stable environment where the fear of being killed or maimed is not an ever-present reality.\"What they also need is that their parents are well, that they live in a safe place, that they have access to education, that they have a routine, that they have some predictability,\" says Prof Pluess.This is rarely certain in areas ravaged by war. Ceasefires break down. Front lines become frozen. The displaced are stuck in camps.'We were dehumanised'Still, those words about a safe place bring to mind my friend Beata and the difference stability made to her life.She was 15 years old when the Rwandan genocide – the worst mass slaughter since the Nazi Holocaust – erupted in 1994. Up to 800,000 people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority, were massacred over a period of 100 days.As a reporter I travelled on the convoy that evacuated dozens of orphaned children - Beata Umubyeyi Mairesse among them - through roadblocks manned by the murderous Interahamwe militia. It was a terrifying experience, but especially for the children whose families had been killed.From roadblock to roadblock, we did not know if the machete-wielding gangs would attack.Years later when she was researching her experiences (later published in a book, The Convoy), Beata got in touch. I remember being struck by her composure and openness. She is married with two children, lives in France and is now a successful writer.\"The first thing that helped me was exile to France, leaving the scene of the genocide. I found myself safe, in a peaceful place, with shelter, a foster family who took care of all my material needs, and the opportunity to see a psychologist. I went back to school in September, and that helped me too.\"VCG via Getty ImagesMirrorpix/Getty ImagesLiaison/ Getty ImagesGlobal conflicts that have affected millions of children - in 1994, up to 800,000 people were massacred in Rwanda over a period of 100 days Beata was joined by her mother who also survived. Her father had died before the slaughter.Composed as she was, there were lingering terrors. She panicked one night when classical music was played on the radio – similar to music played on Rwandan radio the night the genocide began. Fireworks or the sound of hunters shooting sent her hiding under a desk in class \"because I thought war had broken out in France\".I wondered if she makes a conscious effort to protect her children from the traumatic inheritance of genocide. \"There are things that are difficult to tell your children, how we were dehumanised, how I was almost raped. The term 'unspeakable' makes sense when passing on stories to children. We are afraid of contaminating them with our trauma.\"But for Beata, nuance is vital. \"Their only image of Rwanda should not be the genocide. I told them stories from my childhood and every time I went there I brought them back fruit so that they could also discover a country full of flavour.\"Although she lives a full and happy life, Beata still suffers from anxiety and takes anti-depressants to deal with insomnia. I also use medication, and like Beata I do not see it as a burden or a stigma. Rather I count myself fortunate to be able to access care and medicine.Fergal Keane (second from right) in Rwanda after the genocideCreating a safe community is also seen as critical by many experts.\"They're not just victims of mental health,\" says Prof Pluess. \"They're little people with interests and that's why they need to go to school, they need to have opportunities to play together - and that might be as important as dealing with the mental health problems that they're facing.\"Psychologists working in Gaza are well aware of these needs. Davide Musardo, who volunteered with Medecins Sans Frontieres, has written of trying to provide therapy against the background of drones and explosions.\"In Gaza, one survives but the exposure to trauma is constant. Everything is missing, even the idea of a future. For people, the greatest anguish is not of today — the bombs, the fighting, and the mourning — but of the aftermath. There is little confidence about peace and reconstruction, and the children I saw in the hospital showed clear signs of regression.\"It is possible, in devastated Gaza, that the current ceasefire will become a permanent peace, allowing rebuilding, and the restoration of family life and schooling. Possible but by no means certain. In Sudan there are attempts to re-start talks about peace but little optimism for their outcome. The war in Ukraine, and many other wars grind on every day.Trauma is as old as war itself. Politicians, journalists, and experts looking to the aftermath of a conflict often ask, \"What will happen when the killing stops?\" But somewhere else the killing will continue. That is the relentless tragedy of children caught in wars they did not start, over which they have no control. For all the knowledge gained about treating trauma, humanity is far from dealing with its root cause – war itself.Additional reporting by Harriet WhiteheadTop picture credit: EPA/ShutterstockMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "1 hour agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesOctopus Energy is set to spin off its Kraken Technologies arm as a standalone company after a deal to sell a stake in the platform valued it at $8.65bn (£6.4bn).The energy giant, Britain's biggest gas and electricity supplier, has sold a $1bn stake in the AI-based division to a group of investors led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners.The move paves the way for Kraken to be demerged from Octopus, and for a potential stock market flotation for the business in the future.Octopus founder and chief executive Greg Jackson told the BBC there was \"every chance\" Kraken would list its shares \"in the medium term\",  with the location of the flotation \"between London and the US\". Kraken uses AI to automate customer service and billing for energy companies and can manage when customers use energy, rewarding them for reducing consumption at peak times.It was initially built for use by Octopus but has since picked up a raft of other utilities clients, including EDF, E.On Next, TalkTalk and National Grid US. It now serves 70 million household and business accounts around the world.The majority of the $1bn investment will go to Octopus to fund its expansion, with Kraken receiving the rest. Mr Jackson said Kraken will be operating completely independently of Octopus \"within a few months\".Other investors in the business included Fidelity International and a unit of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, with Octopus maintaining a 13.7% stake in Kraken.Kraken chief executive Amir Orad said the spinoff would give it the \"focus and freedom\" to grow, with the company having previously struggled to do business with Octopus's rivals.Mr Jackson said that for a large tech firm such as Kraken, the location for its share  listing would be either London or the US.\"One thing about Kraken is we've got this global investor base... and so really the stock exchanges have got to kind of show why they are the right one for business.\"A London listing for Kraken's shares would reverse a trend of firms snubbing the UK in favour of floating in the US.Mr Jackson said Octopus had created 12,000 jobs in the UK, with 1,500 of these attributed to Kraken.He said the company would keep its headquarters in the UK, and that \"if London can be the right place to list, I would love that\".\"But it's down to be where you're going to get the most investor support and the most support from the stock exchange.\"The demerger comes amid the continued growth of Octopus Energy, which overtook British Gas to become the UK's largest energy supplier earlier this year, serving 7.7 million households.But it confirmed this year it was one of three retail energy firms that had not yet met regulator Ofgem's financial resilience targets.Octopus said the cash injection would \"almost double Octopus Energy Group's already strong balance sheet\".The deal was announced as Octopus published its results for the year to April, revealing it made a £260m loss before tax, compared with a £78m pre-tax profit a year earlier.That came despite overall sales rising by a tenth to £13.7bn. Octopus took a hit from lower energy demand due to warmer weather and the ending of energy crisis allowance payments in 2024.It said warmer weather hit profits by around £103m, blaming the UK's hottest spring on record since 1885, which saw gas usage slump by 11% in March and 25% in April.",

    "body": "11 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesScroll through social media and you'd be forgiven for thinking saunas and cold plunges are close to a miracle cure, boosting immunity, burning fat and fixing everything from sore joints to low mood.But the reality, experts say, is more nuanced.\"There are a lot of people who swear by hot and cold exposure, but we don't yet have sufficient evidence to say it's categorically good for you,\" says Dr Heather Massey, associate professor of extreme environments and physiology at the University of Portsmouth.She explains our bodies are \"incredible\" at keeping core temperature stable, usually between about 36.5C and 37C.In everyday life, many of us rarely challenge that system, spending long periods in heated or air-conditioned spaces.Heating or cooling the body creates a small stress, she says, which may trigger adaptive or protective responses.The science behind the saunaThat idea underpins the appeal of saunas, which nowadays at gyms and spas are rarely empty.  For some people it's a reward after exercise while for others, it's the main attraction and many regulars swear by it, convinced that 15 minutes of intense heat does wonders for their body and mind. And there's no doubt it can feel good.\"When you sit in a sauna and work up a sweat, you may feel looser, freer, a bit more mobile and your aches and pains may resolve themselves a bit,\" Dr Massey tells BBC's What's Up Docs podcast.\"So there's definitely some benefit to using the sauna but the question is whether that's a long-term health benefit or more of a psychological one.\"Getty ImagesDr Massey explains that a recent study put people repeatedly in hot tubs and the results showed changes in insulin and blood pressure.\"We're starting to explore whether heating the body could help people living with lifelong conditions.\"Still, she urges caution when it comes to bold health claims as robust scientific evidence is still limited.\"We've never really done a proper sauna trial,\" she says. \"I suspect we'll find benefits in the future, but we're not there yet.\"For now, she says, it's reasonable to enjoy the ritual for how it makes you feel, without assuming it's a guaranteed shortcut to better health.And if you do try saunas or hot tubs, Dr Massey advises caution, \"ease yourself in gradually\" and check with your GP first if you have any underlying health conditions or are pregnant.What about cold water swimming?Some people like to push things in the opposite direction. Cold-water swimming groups are growing in popularity, with early-morning dips now a familiar sight at beaches, lakes and rivers.Dr Massey, who has swum the channel and competed in the world ice-swimming championships, goes cold-water swimming once a week but only spends a couple of minutes in the water. She finds it \"painful\" at first, but that initial shock is exactly what people are chasing.\"When you first immerse, you get an involuntary gasp and rapid breathing,\" she explains. Heart rate and blood pressure jump and stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline surge. \"That response peaks at about 30 seconds and then drops away very quickly,\" she adds.Repeated exposure reduces the shock response and after several short swims, it can be cut by around 50%.Getty ImagesAs with saunas, the big question is whether the benefits come from the temperature itself, or everything wrapped around it.Cold-water swimming is usually done outdoors and with others. \"It's an activity with multiple mechanisms - nature, movement and social connection and they are all interlinked,\" Dr Massey says.Podcast host Dr Chris van Tulleken agrees it's difficult to separate those factors: \"We don't know if the benefit is the cold water itself or being with a group of fun people and doing something challenging together.\"Find something you enjoyFor Dr Massey, though, the starting point isn't temperature at all, but enjoyment.\"I speak to people who do Parkrun every week, and describe exactly the same kind of buzz as other people get from cold water swimming,\" she says.\"What matters is finding something you enjoy, can do regularly, and ideally can share with others, as building a friendship group around an activity can reduce psychological stress.\"That could be anything from gardening, birdwatching, joining a choir or simply walking with friends. So even if saunas and cold swims are not essential for good health, says Dr Massey, they may still offer something positive.Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "4 hours agoHelen Catt,Political correspondentandIan AikmanSayed Hassan/Getty ImagesForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper has launched a review into what she calls \"serious information failures\" in the case of British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah. In a letter to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Cooper said she, Sir Keir Starmer and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy \"were all unaware\" of Mr Abd El Fattah's historical tweets, which they consider to be \"abhorrent\".It comes after the Conservatives and Reform UK called for the activist to be stripped of UK citizenship and deported after social media posts emerged in which he called for Zionists to be killed.Mr Abd El Fattah has apologised, saying he understood \"how shocking and hurtful\" the posts were.Sir Keir Starmer has been criticised for saying he was \"delighted\" by Mr Abd El Fattah's arrival in the UK on Friday, three months after the democracy activist was freed from prison in Egypt.On Monday, Sir Keir said the resurfaced tweets were \"absolutely abhorrent\" and said the government was \"taking steps to review the information failures in this case\".\"With the rise of antisemitism, and recent horrific attacks, I know this has added to the distress of many in the Jewish community in the UK,\" he added.Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick, who led the criticism of Sir Keir's welcome for Mr Abd El Fattah, swiftly responded by renewing his call for the activist to be removed from the UK. On Monday evening, Reform UK said that it would change the law to ensure Mr Abd El Fattah could be stripped of his British citizenship and deported.The party's leader, Nigel Farage, said previous Conservative and Labour governments had \"opened our doors to evil people\".In her letter to the Foreign Affairs committee, Cooper said work started over the weekend revealed that previous foreign secretaries and prime ministers had made public statements on Mr Abd El Fattah's case \"without all relevant information\".She added that current and former ministers were \"never briefed on these tweets when they spoke publicly about the case\", and the civil servants in charge of the case \"were also unaware\" of them.Cooper said it was clear there had been an \"unacceptable failure\" and that longstanding due diligence procedures had been \"completely inadequate for this situation\".The foreign secretary added she was \"deeply concerned\" that the re-emergence of these tweets, alongside social media posts welcoming Mr Abd El Fattah's return posted by her and other members of the government, had \"added to the distress felt by Jewish communities in the UK and I very much regret that\".She told the committee she had asked the most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office to review the \"serious information failures in this case\" and the broader systems that were in place in the department for carrying out due diligence on high-profile consular and human rights cases to make sure they were working properly and that \"all necessary lessons are learned\".Former head of the UK Foreign Office, Lord Ricketts, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think where the inquiry need to look at, is in these cases where ministers are going to get involved, where officials are going to ask ministers to lobby on behalf of dual nationals then probably there should be background checks, there should be due diligence to try and avoid some of the problems that have cropped up in the last few days.\"In one resurfaced tweet, from 2012, Mr Abd El Fattah appears to say: \"I am a racist, I don't like white people\". In another, he appears to say he considers \"killing any colonialists and specially Zionists heroic, we need to kill more of them\".He is also accused of saying police do not have rights and \"we should kill them all\".Earlier on Monday, Mr Abd El Fattah \"unequivocally\" apologised for the tweets.He said he took allegations of antisemitism \"very seriously\" while arguing some of the posts had been \"completely twisted out of their meaning\".He added: \"I am shaken that, just as I am being reunited with my family for the first time in 12 years, several historic tweets of mine have been republished and used to question and attack my integrity and values, escalating to calls for the revocation of my citizenship.\"Mr Abd El Fattah 's sister Mona Seif described the situation as a \"never ending nightmare\".\"There is something incredibly heartbreaking and infuriating to be witnessing this vile campaign against him - and our family - with people portraying him as something completely opposite to who he really is, and while he paid a steep price for his convictions,\" she wrote on X.The Foreign Office said it had been \"a long-standing priority under successive governments\" to work for Mr Abd El Fattah's release.The 44-year-old was convicted in 2021 of \"spreading fake news\" in Egypt for sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.He was granted British citizenship in December 2021 through his London-born mother, when the Conservatives were in power.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp, who was an immigration minister until September 2021, said he was not aware of Mr Abd El Fattah's tweets at that time, but he now believed the activist \"should have his citizenship revoked\".\"There is no excuse for what he wrote,\" Philp told the Today programme on Monday.On the same programme, Labour's Dame Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Foreign Affairs committee, accused Philp of \"throwing ideas around that were just not based in law\".\"The bottom and top of it is that he [Mr Abd El Fattah] is a British citizen,\" she said.\"He was entitled to British citizenship, he claimed it, so he is a British citizen. The British government has been doing their utmost to get him back into the country and out of jail.\"A government source said Mr Abd El Fatteh arrived in the country as a British citizen and there were no legal avenues available to block his entry, even if officials had been aware of his previous social media posts.It is understood that Downing Street believes there is a high bar to someone having their citizenship revoked because they must have either obtained citizenship by fraud or be deemed to pose a significant national security threat - a test unlikely to be met in this case.On Monday, the PM's official spokesman said: \"We welcome the return of a British citizen unfairly detained abroad, as we would in all cases and as we have done in the past.\"\"That said, it doesn't change the fact that we have condemned the nature of these historic tweets, and we consider them to be abhorrent, and we've been very clear about that.\"A writer and software developer, Mr Abd El Fattah rose to prominence during a 2011 uprising that forced the former Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to resign.He has spent more than a decade of his life behind bars and his release in September after a presidential pardon followed a long campaign by his family and lobbying by the British government.In October, he said he was \"learning how to get back into life\" in an interview with the BBC from Cairo.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosX/Ali YerlikayaA video shared on social media by Turkey's interior minister appears to show several people being detainedMore than 350 suspected Islamic State group (IS) members have been detained as part of nationwide police operations in Turkey.Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 357 suspects were apprehended across 21 provinces in coordinated raids on Tuesday morning.It comes just a day after three police officers and six alleged militants were killed during an eight hour siege in the northwestern town of Yalova. Another eight police officers and a security force member were injured.Less than a week ago, authorities arrested another 115 suspects who prosecutors said had been planning attacks targeting non-Muslims during Christmas and New Year's.In a post on X, Yerlikaya said Tuesday's operations took place across the country, including in Ankara, Istanbul and Yalova.\"Just as we have never given an opportunity to those who try to bring this country to its knees with terrorism, we will never give them an opportunity in the future either,\" he added.The interior minister also shared a video appearing to show dozens of counter-terrorism officers taking part in the operations and detaining several people.Raids on addresses in Istanbul and two other provinces - where 110 people were detained, according to the prosecutor's office - saw officers seize documents and digital materials, while pictures on local media also showed a number of weapons, including knifes and bullets.A statement from the Istanbul chief prosecutor's office said intelligence had suggested the suspects might attempt an attack on New Year's Day.It also noted 41 of those detained had suspected links to the clash in Yalova on Monday.Interior minister Yerlikaya said another 16 individuals had been detained in Yalova for making \"provocative posts\" on social media.The funerals of the three offices killed in Yalova - named as  İlker Pehlivan, Turgut Külünk, and Yasin Koçyiğit - were held on Tuesday.President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan offered his condolences to their families, and said Turkey would continue its fight against \"bloodthirsty criminals who threaten the peace of our nation and the security of our state\".Earlier this month, authorities carried out mass raids and arrested 115 people. Officials said IS supporters had been actively planning attacks across Turkey, particularly against non-Muslims on Christmas and New Year's Day.ReutersThe siege on a house in Yalova lasted around eight hours, according to local mediaTurkey's security services regularly target people with suspected links to IS.The country shares a 900km (560 mile) border with Syria, where the group continues to operate in parts of the country.Syria's president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has close ties to the Turkish government, has vowed to work with the US and Europe to root out surviving elements of IS.The US launched a wave of air strikes against the group's positions across Syria on Friday in response to the killing of three Americans.Two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed by IS gunmen during an ambush earlier this month.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorCharly Hel/Prestige/Getty ImagesBrigitte Bardot died on Sunday aged 91 and had long shunned the limelight, preferring the company of animalsFrench right-wing figure Éric Ciotti has called for a national tribute to honour film legend Brigitte Bardot, prompting objections from political opponents on the left.\"France has a duty to honour its Marianne,\" said Ciotti, referring to the emblem of French liberty whose face Bardot was chosen to represent in the 1960s.Bardot died on Sunday aged 91. A petition launched by Ciotti since has attracted more than 23,000 signatures, and has the backing of some allies on the far right.But Socialist leader Olivier Faure has pointed out that national homages are for \"exceptional services to the nation\". Bardot was an iconic actress but she also \"turned her back on republican values\", Faure argued.Bardot has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as a \"legend of the century\" who embodied a life of freedom, and Ciotti, who leads the right-wing UDR party, has appealed to him to organise a national send-off.  Ciotti said France should recognise a woman who brought her country an extraordinary level of international recognition and actively helped in the fight for  women's liberty and abortion rights.Meanwhile, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, has announced that his city will name an \"iconic site\" in Bardot's honour. But Bardot is destined to remain controversial in death as she was during her life. Faure pointed out that she had been convicted five times for inciting racial hatred.Bardot starred in some 50 films, after bursting on to the scene in And God Created Woman in 1956. She then left the world of cinema in 1973 for a life devoted to animal welfare, and lived for decades in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, at her home called La Madrague.But she became as well known for her far-right sympathies as she was for her love of animals. Some of her remarks targeted Muslims, and others insulted the people of the French Indian Ocean island of Réunion.\"To be moved by the plight of dolphins and yet be indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean - what degree of cynicism is that?\" asked Green MP Sandrine Rousseau on social media.There are differing types of national tribute in France. Robert Badinter, who abolished the death penalty in France, was honoured with a national homage in the form of a solemn ceremony in 2024, as was singer Charles Aznavour in 2018. A more likely option for Bardot would be along the lines of the public farewell given to rock star Johnny Hallyday, when large crowds lined the streets of Paris in 2017.Not everyone on the left is opposed to the idea of a national homage to Bardot.\"Why not? We've done it for other figures, particularly Johnny Hallyday,\" Socialist MP Philippe Brun told French radio. \"If the president of the republic decides on it, I don't see why we should oppose it.\"MIGUEL MEDINA/AFPBardot will be buried near her family's graves in the marine cemetery in Saint-TropezBardot herself had shunned the limelight for decades and close friend Wendy Bouchard said she was not remotely interested in medals and ceremonies.\"It probably comes from a good place, but I'm not sure that she, who lived a life of simplicity and deprivation, would have wanted this national homage,\" she told French TV.Journalist Steven Bellery, who interviewed Bardot earlier this year, agreed she wanted something far more simple and intimate.Bardot had asked to be buried at her Riviera home at La Madrague, rather than in a public cemetery, where she feared \"a crowd of idiots might damage the graves of my parents and grandparents\".However, the town hall in Saint-Tropez has said she will have a private burial in the public cemetery that overlooks the Mediterranean as well as her home.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which is dedicated to animal welfare, says her funeral will take place on 7 January at the Notre-Dame de l'Assomption church and will be broadcast on screens across the town.",

    "body": "The Cabinet Office has blamed an \"administrative error\" for mistakenly sharing official papers referring to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.A No 10 file from 2004 and 2005 relating to royal visits - released as part of the government's annual transfer of records to the National Archives under the 20-year rule - was briefly made available to journalists before being withdrawn.The version originally released under embargo included minutes of a meeting about the overseas travel of various royals, including the then-Duke of York, who was serving as a UK trade envoy.That information was later redacted from the file before it was made public on Tuesday at the National Archives in Kew, west London.The Cabinet Office, which is responsible for transferring the files to the National Archives, said the documents were never intended for public disclosure.A spokesman said: \"All records are managed in line with the requirements of the Public Records Act. Any release is subject to an extensive review process, including engaging expert stakeholders.\"Anti-monarchy campaigners said there was no justification for withholding the papers, particularly given Andrew has since been stripped of royal titles over his links to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always denied any claims of wrongdoing. Graham Smith, chief executive of campaign group Republic, said: \"The royals are one of the most secretive institutions in the UK. These documents should be released without fear or favour, to allow the public to make informed judgements about the royals.\"The minutes themselves, seen by journalists before being pulled, appeared largely routine. They discussed Andrew's travel plans as a trade envoy - a role that earned him the nickname \"Airmiles Andy\" - including visits to China, Russia, southeast Asia and Spain.Other papers released to the National Archives reveal the Foreign Office ruled out military action to overthrow Zimbabwe's long-time leader Robert Mugabe, despite mounting frustration in Tony Blair's government over his refusal to relinquish power. An options paper drawn up in 2004 warned that any UK-led intervention would be politically isolated, costly and lack a viable exit strategy, concluding it was not a \"serious option\". The Foreign Office had to admit there were few good options for ratcheting up the pressure on Mugabe who, at the age of 80, remained \"depressingly healthy\" and determined to stay on until he had secured a succession to his liking.The papers also reveal Downing Street was forced to apologise after then-Prime Minister John Major's birthday telegram to the Queen Mother in 1994 was addressed in an \"improper manner\". The Queen Mother's private secretary contacted No 10 to complain, although the files do not explain what caused the offence. Officials said the message had left Downing Street correctly but blamed an error in transmission and suggested telegrams should be abandoned altogether.There is also evidence of the limits placed on transparency under the Freedom of Information Act. Newly declassified papers show officials refused to release details of a conversation between Blair and French president Jacques Chirac following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in Paris in 1997.While papers relating to Diana's death and funeral arrangements were released, a memo summarising the Blair-Chirac discussion was ruled out of scope. Officials argued it was \"fundamentally not in the public interest\" to disclose private conversations between world leaders, warning doing so would inhibit frank exchanges in future.Also revealed in the files were the ambitious and ultimately abandoned plans for a wholesale redevelopment of Downing Street under Blair. Briefing papers dated March 2005, just two months before the general election, describe a multi-million-pound project, codenamed Project George, to overhaul the ageing estate, parts of which date back to the 17th century and had not undergone a major refurbishment since the 1960s.The proposals included a two-storey \"subterranean suite\" beneath the No 10 garden, featuring a 200-seat conference room that could double as a \"safe haven\" in the event of a terror attack. There were also plans for an underground service road to separate VIP visitors from refuse collections, a new staff entrance, a cafe and \"recreation facilities\" in the basement.Officials warned that failing sewers, power supplies and IT systems were causing an \"unacceptable failure of critical services\".The plans, to be funded through the private finance initiative over 30 years, extended to Nos 11 and 12 Downing Street and 70 Whitehall - the home of the Cabinet Office - which would have been given a new glass-fronted extension and blast-resistant glazing. The files do not explain why the plans were dropped.",

    "body": "14 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterThe oldest surviving victim of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has been appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to justice after campaigning against wrongful prosecutions.Betty Brown, 92, ran the Annfield Plain Post Office in County Durham with her late husband Oswall from 1985. But they were forced out in 2003 after spending more than £50,000 of their savings to cover non-existent shortfalls.She recently received her long-awaited settlement from one of the government's compensation schemes.Mrs Brown told BBC Breakfast she accepted the recognition in the New Year Honours list on behalf of all the victims of the scandal.\"Every one of them should have an OBE,\" she said. \"Every one of them for what they've [Post Office] put us through and what we have stood solid and faithful for. I did it for justice.\"The Horizon IT system was responsible for more than 900 sub-postmasters being wrongfully prosecuted because of it providing incorrect information. Thousands more, like Mrs Brown, were forced to make up for the alleged losses at their branches across the UK.The scandal has been described as one of the widest miscarriages of justice in the UK.Mrs Brown said she was \"honoured and humbled\" to be made an OBE, adding she had finally \"been heard by the system\".Mrs Brown is not the first Post Office campaigner to be recognised in the New Year Honours list. A year ago four former sub-postmasters turned campaigners were honoured for their services to justice, and Sir Alan Bates - who was featured in the ITV drama \"Mr Bates vs The Post Office\" - was knighted in 2024.The 92-year-old was one of the original 555 victims who took part in the landmark group legal action led by Sir Alan against the Post Office.Her branch had been one of the most successful in the region but eventually she had to sell it at a loss.Talking about what happened, she previously said it \"absolutely destroyed my whole life\".Both Mrs Brown and Sir Alan were part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, and those claimants were offered the option of taking a fixed sum of £75,000 or pursuing their own settlement.After receiving her payout in November 2025, she told the BBC: \"At last, after 26 years, they've recognised justice,\" and added: \"pity they took so long.\"A government spokesperson said: \"We must never lose sight of the Horizon scandal's human impact on postmasters and their families, which the Horizon inquiry has highlighted so well.\"Betty Brown has been a fierce advocate for postmasters and this government has now paid out over £1.3bn to more than 10,000 victims.When the first report of the official inquiry into the scandal was published in July, the Post Office said it apologised \"unreservedly\" for the suffering \"caused to postmasters and their loved ones\".",

    "body": "Donald Trump said he hoped to reach phase two of the Gaza peace plan \"very quickly\", as he warned Hamas would have \"hell to pay\" if it did not disarm soon.The US president, whose 20-point peace plan requires the militant group to disarm, made the comments as he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida for talks on Monday. During a press conference with Netanyahu after their meeting, Trump said Israel had \"lived up to the plan 100%\", despite continuing attacks by its military in Gaza.The US president also said his country could support another major strike on Iran were it to resume rebuilding its ballistic missile or nuclear weapons programmes.In response to Trump's threat, Iran's supreme leader's top political adviser, Ali Shamkhani, said on X that any aggression towards Iran would be met with an \"immediate harsh response\".Asked how quickly Hamas and Israel should move to phase two of the peace plan,  Trump said: \"As quickly as we can. But there has to be disarmament.\"Speaking about Hamas, he said: \"If they don't disarm as, as they agreed to do, they agreed to it, and then there will be hell to pay for them.\"They have to disarm in a fairly short period of time\".Trump also said reconstruction in Gaza could \"begin pretty soon\".The Gaza peace plan came into effect in October. Under the second phase, a technocratic government would be established in the devastated territory, Hamas would disarm and Israeli troops would withdraw. The reconstruction of Gaza would then begin.But critics have suggested Netanyahu could seek to delay the process of the plan and instead push for Hamas to disarm before Israeli troops withdraw. The Israeli prime minister has been accused of not wanting to engage seriously with the issue of a political future for Palestinians. Hamas officials have said a full disarmament should take place alongside progress towards an independent Palestinian state.Asked if he was concerned Israel was not moving fast enough to phase two of the plan, Trump said it had \"lived up to the plan\".\"I'm not concerned about anything that Israel's doing, I'm concerned about what other people are doing or maybe aren't doing,\" he added.Since the ceasefire came into effect, at least 414 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military, which controls more than half of Gaza, has said it has only opened fire in response to ceasefire violations. It has blamed Hamas for the killings of three Israeli soldiers over the same period.During the press briefing, Trump also warned that the US would launch further attacks on Iran if it was found to be using different sites to develop nuclear weapons.In June, Trump claimed US air and missile strikes \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran has denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons. \"I hope they're not trying to build up again, because if they are we're going to have no choice but to eradicate that build up,\" he said. Trump said he \"had been reading\" that the country was using \"possibly different sites\" to those targeted in summer.Iran, which fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, on Monday denounced the reports as a \"psychological operation\" against Tehran. It said it was fully prepared to defend itself, and warned renewed aggression would \"result in harsher consequences\" for Israel.Trump and Netanyahu's talks also focused on other regional tension points, including Syria and the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon.Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel was keen to ensure a peaceful border with Syria, and Trump said he hoped Israel would get along with President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who took power after longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad was deposed last year.Israel has been suspicious of the new leader, who was once a member of al-Qaeda, and bombed government buildings in Damascus in July.\"Well, I hope he's [Netanyahu] going to get along with Syria because the new president of Syria is working very hard to do a good job,\" Trump said. \"He really is. I know he's a tough cookie. And, you know, you're not going to get a choir boy to lead Syria.\" Trump signed an executive order in June to end US sanctions against Syria.",

    "body": "38 minutes agoAmy WalkerEPAPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has denied allegations by Russia that Ukraine launched a drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences, and accused Moscow of trying to derail peace talks. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Kyiv had launched an attack over Sunday night using 91 long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on Putin's state residence in Russia's northwestern Novgorod region.Russia said it would now review its position in peace negotiations. It is not yet clear where Putin was at the time of the alleged attack.Zelensky dismissed the claim as \"typical Russian lies\", intended to give the Kremlin an excuse to continue attacks on Ukraine. He said that Russia had previously targeted government buildings in Kyiv, and warned that its latest claim could signal further strikes on Ukraine.\"Everyone must be vigilant now. Absolutely everyone. A strike may be launched on the capital,\" Zelensky told journalists on Monday, adding that Russia's comments were a \"threat\".He said Russia was \"looking for reasons\" to continue its attacks on Ukraine and that it saw progress towards a ceasefire as a \"failure\".Zelensky added on X: \"It is critical that the world doesn't stay silent now. We cannot allow Russia to undermine the work on achieving a lasting peace.\"In a statement shared on Telegram on Monday, Lavrov said all of the 91 drones he claimed were launched at Putin's residence were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defence systems.He added that there were no reports of casualties or damage as a result of the attack.\"Given the final degeneration of the criminal Kyiv regime, which has switched to a policy of state terrorism, Russia's negotiating position will be revised,\" he said.But he added that Russia did not intend to exit the negotiating process with the US, Russian news agency Tass reported.On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it would not provide evidence for the alleged strike, with a spokesman telling journalists that Russia would now \"toughen\" its negotiating stance.Ukraine's foreign minister called on other countries to refrain from responding to Russia's \"false claims\".\"Almost a day passed, and Russia still hasn't provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine's alleged 'attack on Putin's residence'. And they won't. Because there's none. No such attack happened,\" Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X.Moscow's claim comes after talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida on Sunday, where Presidents Trump and Zelensky discussed a revised peace plan to end the war.Following the meeting, Zelensky told Fox News on Monday that there was a \"possibility to finish this war\" in 2026.But he said Ukraine could not win the war without US support.\"My feelings of President Trump's sanctions and economical steps, shows that he's ready for very strong steps,\" Zelensky said. \"In this situation, the United States can move the situation to peace quicker.\"The Ukrainian president told Fox News there was no indication that Putin wanted peace and that he did not trust Putin.\"I don't trust Putin and he doesn't want success for Ukraine,\" Zelensky added.Zelensky said the US had offered Ukraine security guarantees for 15 years, and Trump said an agreement on this point was \"close to 95%\" done.Ukraine's leader described territorial issues and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as the last unresolved matters, and there was little sign of progress on the future of Ukraine's contested Donbas region - which Russia wants to seize in full.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Russia has previously rejected key parts of the plan under discussion.The White House said on Monday that President Trump had \"concluded a positive call\" with Putin, following the US-Ukraine talks. Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy aide, told reporters on Monday that during the call, Putin had pointed out the alleged attack on his residence happened \"almost straight after what the US had considered to be a successful round of talks\".Ushakov said: \"The US president was shocked by this information, he was angry and said he couldn't believe such mad actions. It was stated that this will no doubt affect the US approach to working with Zelensky\".During a later press conference, Trump initially appeared to say he did not know about the alleged incident, but later told reporters that he was told about it by Putin and was \"very angry\" about it. Asked if the US had seen any evidence supporting Russia's claim, he responded: \"Well we'll find out. You're saying maybe the attack didn't take place - that's possible too, I guess. But President Putin told me this morning it did\". More on this story",

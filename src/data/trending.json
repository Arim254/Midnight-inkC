    "body": "12 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentBBCAs ambulances queued in front of Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading last week, corridors full of patients were waiting for a bed on a ward. Emergency department consultant Omar Nafousi was at his wit's end.\"We've no space,\" he told the BBC last week. \"This is not what I signed up for when I became a doctor.\"It is a scene that is being repeated in hospitals up and down the country as winter viruses and cold weather add to the pressures on the health service. Currently nearly 4,000 beds in England alone are taken up by patients with flu, Covid and the vomiting bug norovirus, according to NHS England, and the situation is on a similar scale in the rest of the UK.But that is dwarfed by another pressure – the patients who should not be in hospital.In Pictures via Getty ImagesOmar Nafousi, an emergency department consultant told the BBC last week, 'We've no space... This is not what I signed up for when I became a doctor'Every day there are more than 13,000 people whose treatment has been completed who are still in hospitals in England, the latest figures from NHS England suggest. Plus there are a further 4,000 around the rest of the UK - which means around one in eight beds are occupied by people who don't necessarily need to be there.Many of these \"delayed discharge\" patients are older and may be frail and living with multiple health conditions who need support in the community.But it comes at a huge cost. The average hospital bed takes £562 a day to staff and maintain, according to NHS England, meaning the health service in England is losing more than £225m a month supporting patients who could be elsewhere.Then there is the cost to other patients. \"We are seeing surgery cancelled and long waits in A&E because there are no beds available on the wards,\" says Clifford Kilgore, a senior nurse working with older people, who serves on the Nurses and Allied Health Professionals' Council of the British Geriatrics Society.As for the staff there is a toll on morale, too - among doctors, nurses and ambulance workers. \"It's terrible when you see patients go downhill in hospital when you know they would be better off somewhere else,\" says Laura Hichens, a nurse who leads the \"discharge liaison\" team at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead.The issue of delayed discharges is far from new. For years, it has been talked about, if not agonised over, and the NHS started tracking the delays in the early 2010s. Last summer, the government launched an urgent and emergency care plan, which pledged to reduce the delays, with the promise there would be improvements.If it could be solved, the impact on the NHS would be transformative, experts have told me. Yet the problem throws up many deeper questions about the care system, coordination and planning in hospitals - with some doctors even asking whether the NHS is over-treating patients, particularly those at the end of life.'The system's running faster just to stand still'On paper, it all sounds straightforward: simply send all those patients who are well home. But it's not that easy.\"It takes a lot of time and effort to discharge a patient,\" says Emma Dodsworth, a researcher who has studied the issue for Nuffield Trust think tank. \"Some may need adaptations to their home, some short-term help with washing and dressing or home visits from nurses. Some a combination of all three, while others may need a care home place to be found.\"And because the population is getting older and frailer, there are more complex cases ending up in hospital. The system is having to run faster just to stand still.\"Arranging the discharge of these patients relies on a close relationship between council-run social care services and the NHS.Getty ImagesAt Queen Elizabeth Hospital, social workers arrange help such as washing or dressing in people's own home, and physiotherapists and occupational therapists can help older people stay mobile and live independentlyThere are plenty of examples of this happening. At Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital social workers and nurses are working side-by-side in the discharge liaison hub, which has been fully up and running for two years. The hub also has a housing officer, employed by the council, to arrange home adaptations or temporary housing.Planning for discharge begins as soon as a patient is admitted to hospital. \"That means when they are ready to be discharged it can be done pretty much straight away for many,\" says Hichens.Figures show the hub consistently discharges patients more quickly than average.It's a template that some might suggest should be rolled out en masse across the country - but so far that hasn't happened.'Strained relations' with social careA recent report by the NHS Confederation and Association of Directors of Social Services (ADASS) warns that cooperation between the NHS and social care sectors is \"inconsistent\" across the country with relationships sometimes becoming \"frictional\".Kerrie Allward, who acts as a policy lead for ADASS and is executive director for adult social care and health at Walsall Council, is not surprised by these findings.Her area has adopted a similar approach to Gateshead and she says that led to a five-fold drop in delayed discharges in the year after it was introduced.But she argues that across the social care sector money remains a \"critical issue\" – with local government funding squeezed so much over the past decade or so that spending on social care has not been able to keep up.Local authorities are spending around £32bn a year on adult social care – that is £4.6bn higher in real terms than 2010-11 – but councils argue that increase has been swallowed up by higher costs, increasing demand and greater complexity of need.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesLocal authorities are spending around £32bn a year on adult social careAllward says some councils have tried to compensate by spending ever more on social care - which now accounts for more than half of their budgets across the board. But, she says, \"Councils often lack the funds to invest in integrated services that would support more timely discharge.\"And while she enjoys working with the NHS, in her experience not all social care directors feel the same - she says that some NHS leaders blame social care for delayed discharges.\"This blame can strain relationships, especially as data reveals that social care is usually responsible for only a minority of delays.\"The government said it was increasing investment further in the coming years, while seeking wider reform of the way services are funded.Examining the Danish approach Some other European countries have a different approach.Denmark, for example, has created a national network of \"intermediate care beds\" in community hospitals and care homes, staffed by nurses and carers, that patients can be discharged into.Denmark has also invested in community nursing services to support patients in the community and in their homes rather than in hospital. \"We could learn from places like Denmark where there is much greater integration between health and social care,\" says Dodsworth.Getty ImagesAllward says some other European countries, such as Denmark, have a much more coordinated approach to health and social careSome NHS trusts have bought places in care homes to allow them to discharge patients. University Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust has taken this one step further: it has spent £10m buying and renovating a former care home in the city called Preston Lodge, which opened in July and has more than 50 beds.Staffed by nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and with its own GP, it allows patients who are medically fit to leave hospital continue to receive support. Preston Lodge says these patients would have spent an extra 10 days in hospital on average.Inside Preston Lodge, patients eat meals together and some of them socialise, too - doing jigsaw puzzles and watching TV together.\"Hospitals are great places when you are acutely ill, but they are not when you no longer need that medical care,\" says the trust's head of nursing Emma Roberts. Dodsworth says these \"step-down\" facilities can help patients get back on to their feet while not taking up a hospital bed.However, she says the lack of integration between social care and the NHS remains an obstacle to this approach being used more widely.The question of family responsibilityImproving coordination between the NHS and councils is only part of the solution, however. NHS England monthly data shows that around only a third of delays are down to lack of community care or a care home place.Another challenge is the attitude of some families who prefer - and feel safer, perhaps - if their loved one is under the care of a hospital.Hichens says she spends much of her time persuading the family members of patients that they would be happier elsewhere - and healthier too.\"They think hospital is the best place for their relative,\" she says. \"But we know the longer you spend in hospital the more patients are at risk of getting frailer, losing strength and needing more care.\"\"Hospitals are great places when you are acutely ill, but they are not when you no longer need that medical care,\" says Emma Roberts, a head of nursing at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS TrustSome families are not prepared to take on caring responsibilities either, says Dr Vicky Price, an acute medical consultant who diagnoses and treats patients brought in as emergency admissions.\"In some countries, the culture is different – they don't need care homes because families step in.\"But she concedes it can be difficult for some families, including financial pressures that make caring for a relative a challenge. \"There are justifiable reasons why they can't take on that responsibility.\"Time to rethink end-of-life care?In Price's view, her own profession bears some responsibility, too. She says about a third of people who are admitted for medical reasons are in their last year of life.\"We admit them and end up over-treating them with interventions, scans and pills,\" argues Price, who is president of the Society for Acute Medicine.One patient she saw recently was in his late 80s and had 14 appointments booked for the next two months for health problems including cardiac and renal issues, and liver and eye problems.\"I talked to him – the only one he really wanted to keep was the eye one,\" she says. \"We cancelled the rest.\"The problem when you start trying to treat everything is that you prescribe more pills, those pills have side-effects and you can actually end up making a person's health worse.\" Heritage Images via Getty ImagesThis ward at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, pictured in the early Twentieth Century, had rugs, pictured on the walls and other home comfortsDoctors often lack the confidence as well as the time to have these difficult discussions with families, Price says.But changing that approach would also raise numerous ethical questions.She says for many of these patients, palliative care and managing their symptoms, mainly pain, would be preferable: \"Their quality of life would be much better and we would avoid a hospital admission.\"But in practice there are obstacles to this.And the Association of Palliative Medicine has long argued there is insufficient investment in end-of-life care, which means people struggle to get support. Marie Curie suggest nearly a quarter of people who need palliative care do not get it.More from InDepthClifford Kilgore agrees reducing admissions is a key part of the solution. \"Hospitals are good for treating an acute illness, but the problem is that if you admit an older person with pneumonia they can spend a week in a hospital bed not moving and they become immobile and unable to look after themselves,\" he says.\"It is a vicious cycle. For some patients, being in hospital actually causes harm.\"He helps to run a \"hospital-at-home\" service, which provides specialist hospital-level care to patients with frailty and conditions such as heart failure and respiratory illness.Services of this kind care for around 12,000 people around the country, but again they are not available everywhere. Providing more expert care like this outside of hospital is a priority for the NHS under the government's 10-year plan.Kilgore says it cannot come soon enough: \"Get this right and it would have an immediate impact.\" But not soon enough for those patients in Reading queuing for a bed.Top picture credit: LightRocket via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Former Tory Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi defects to Reform UKJust nowJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterandHenry Zeffman,Chief political correspondentPA MediaFormer Conservative Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has defected to Reform UK.The former MP said he felt the UK had reached a \"dark and dangerous\" moment, and the country needed \"a glorious revolution\", as he outlined why he was joining Nigel Farage's party.Zahawi was chancellor for two months under Boris Johnson and served as a government minister from 2018 to 2023.Farage unveiled Zahawi's defection at a press conference on Monday morning, making him one of around 20 former Tory MPs to join the party.Speaking at the press conference, Zahawi said problems with free speech \"on X or even just down the pub\" was one of the reasons he was joining Reform.He cited an \"over-powerful\" civil service and quangos that he said had been started under Labour PM Tony Blair and continued under his own Conservative government, adding that he shared some of the blame for \"constitutional vandalism\" and \"our failure to take back control over the entrenched, unelected bureaucracy\".He added there had been major failures with mass migration and \"bad, virtue-signalling legislation that has made us less competitive and less prosperous\".Farage insisted that this latest Tory defection did not mean Reform was becoming the Conservatives 2.0, and said he had fought the party \"tooth and nail\" over Brexit.A Conservative spokesman said Reform was \"fast becoming the party of has-been politicians looking for their next gravy train\". \"Their latest recruit used to say he'd be 'frightened to live in a country' run by Nigel Farage, which shows the level of loyalty for sale,\" he said.\"Reform want higher welfare spending and higher taxes. They are a one-man band with no plan for our country. \"Under Kemi Badenoch the Conservatives are demonstrating we have the plan, the competence and the team to get Britain working again.\"When the criticism was put to Zahawi, he replied Badenoch had the \"baggage of a defunct brand\".Farage went on to say that, in the upcoming May elections for Holyrood, the Welsh Senedd, and local elections across England, the Conservatives \"will cease to be a national political party\".He added there were \"plenty\" of current Conservative MPs asking about joining Reform and some were not being accepted, but he said Zahawi believed \"in what we're doing\" and also has the necessary \"conviction\".As well as his two months as chancellor at the end of Boris Johnson's time as prime minister, Zahawi was education secretary, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and chairman of the Conservative Party.He was sacked from that last position by Rishi Sunak in January 2023 after the prime minister's independent ethics adviser found that he had broken ministerial rules by failing to disclose that his tax affairs were under investigation by HMRC.Asked by the BBC about being sacked over his tax affairs, Zahawi said: \"The mistake I made was not to be specific about my declarations to the Cabinet Office.\"I absolutely think that politicians should be held to a higher level of accountability but I shouldn't be precluded from doing the right thing by my country.\"The former MP was a candidate to succeed Johnson as prime minister in 2022 but only attracted the support of 25 of his colleagues and was eliminated in the first round of the leadership contest which Liz Truss won.Zahawi was education secretary from September 2021 to July 2022, and his short stint as chancellor of the exchequer came between July and September 2022.In November 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, he was appointed vaccines minister and oversaw the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme for nearly a year.Born in Iraq in 1967, he could have been sent to fight in the 1980s Iran-Iraq War but instead he and his parents fled Iraq and he grew up in the UK.Questioned on whether he had concerns about allegations of racism made against his new party leader by more than 30 school peers, claims denied by Farage, Zahawi responded: \"If I thought the man sitting next to me had in any way a problem with people of my colour… I wouldn't be sitting next to him.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoJack FenwickPolitical correspondentReutersThe government has identified a legal basis which it believes can be used to allow UK military to board and detain vessels in so-called shadow fleets, BBC News understands.Russia, Iran and Venezuela have all been accused of operating ships without a valid national flag to avoid sanctions on oil.Last week British armed forces assisted US troops in seizing the Marinera oil tanker, which American officials accused of carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions.To date, no UK military personnel have boarded any vessels, but officials have spent the last few weeks exploring what measures could be used.The Sanctions and Money Laundering Act from 2018 can be used to approve the use of military force, ministers believe.It is understood there are plans for the armed forces to use these powers, in what is being described inside government as a ramping up of action against the ships. It is not known exactly when the first UK military action might occur.Two oil tankers subject to US sanctions were reportedly spotted sailing east through the English Channel towards Russia on Thursday.The UK has already imposed sanctions on more than 500 alleged shadow vessels, which it believes are helping to fund hostile activity, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Ministers say that action taken by the UK and its allies has forced around 200 ships off the seas, most of which will have been operating without a legitimate flag.Ship flagging is the process used to register a vessel to a specific country, which then allows it to travel in international waters and offers it certain protections under law.The government believes the new legal mechanism they have identified could be applied to any sanctioned vessels not legitimately flagged.Officials say this would have included the Marinera tanker, which was seized last week.The Marinera, a Venezuelan-linked ship previously known as the Bella 1, was stopped by the US Coast Guard as it travelled through the North Atlantic ocean between Iceland and Scotland.The Ministry of Defence said the US asked the UK for assistance, and that RAF surveillance aircraft and a Royal Navy support ship RFA Tideforce took part in the operation.Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was \"in full compliance with international law\", adding the UK \"will not stand by as malign activity increases on the high seas\".Healey told MPs on Wednesday that the government was \"stepping up action on the shadow fleet, developing further military options and strengthening co-ordination with allies\".It is understood that identifying this legal mechanism was one of the further military options that Healey was referring to.The US has increased action against shadow fleet vessels, with five tankers seized in recent weeks.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"The defence secretary set out in parliament this week that deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a priority for this government\".They added: \"We will not comment on specific operational planning\".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said on Sunday that the number of insurance checks were being increased, with more than 600 ships stopped while sailing close to the British Isles.Vessels not legitimately flagged generally have no insurance, which experts have warned could lead to a crisis if they were involved in an incident like an expensive oil spill.But Alexander said it would not be appropriate to say how many alleged shadow vessels were known to have sailed in UK waters.She told Sky News: \"Providing you with that information only helps one person and that is President Putin.\"",

    "body": "A British man has died in an avalanche in the French Alps.The man, believed to be in his 50s, was skiing with a group off-piste at La Plagne, a statement from the resort said. Rescuers were alerted to the avalanche at 13:57 (12:57 GMT) on Sunday and went immediately to the area, it added.The man was discovered under 2.5 metres (8ft) of snow after a 50-minute search. He had been skiing without an avalanche transceiver or a professional instructor, the resort said.La Plagne said its thoughts were with the man's family.A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said it is supporting the family of a British man who has died in France and is in contact with relevant authorities. The rescue team was made up of more than 50 people including medics, ski instructors and a helicopter-deployed dog.La Plagne's official website prompts visitors wanting to ski off-piste, also known as backcountry skiing, to make sure they have read the Avalanche Risk Bulletin and to use an avalanche victim detector. December through to February is peak season for avalanches in the northern hemisphere. Only last month, five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, died in an avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoLaura CressTechnology reporterOfcom has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's X over concerns its AI tool Grok is being used to create sexualised images.In a statement, the UK watchdog said there had been \"deeply concerning reports\" of the chatbot being used to create and share undressed images of people, as well as \"sexualised images of children\".If found to have broken the law, Ofcom can potentially issue X with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18 million, whichever is greater.The BBC has approached X for comment. Elon Musk previously said the UK government wanted \"any excuse for censorship\" in response to a post questioning why other AI platforms were not being looked at.The BBC has seen several examples of digitally altered images on X, in which women were undressed and put in sexual positions without their consent. One woman said more than 100 sexualised images have been created of her.If X does not comply, Ofcom can seek a court order to force internet service providers to block access to the site in the UK altogether.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC she welcomed the body's investigation and urged it to complete it as soon as possible.\"It is vital that Ofcom complete this investigation swiftly because the public - and most importantly the victims - will not accept any delay,\" she said.Kendall's predecessor Peter Kyle told BBC Breakfast it was \"appalling\" that Grok had \"not been tested appropriately\".\"The fact that I met just yesterday a Jewish woman who has found her image of herself in a bikini outside of Auschwitz being generated by AI and put online made me feel sick to my stomach,\" he said.Ofcom will now examine whether X has failed to take down illegal content quickly when it became aware of it, and taken \"appropriate steps\" to prevent people in the UK from seeing it.It said such illegal content included \"non-consensual intimate images\" and child sexual imagery.The decision follows global backlash over Grok's image creation feature, with both Malaysia and Indonesia temporarily blocking access to the tool over the weekend.An Ofcom spokesperson did not give an indication on how long the investigation would take but said it would be a \"matter of the highest priority\".\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from content that's illegal in the UK,\" they said.\"We won't hesitate to investigate where we suspect companies are failing in their duties, especially where there's a risk of harm to children.\"",

    "body": "Ai, a female chimpanzee famous for her cognitive skills has died at 49, according to the Japanese institute where she lived. The Kyoto University's Center for the Evolutionary Origins of Human Behavior said Ai died on 9 January of old age and organ failure and that she was surrounded by staff when she died. Ai was born in western Africa and arrived at the Japanese institute in 1977. There, she became the namesake of the Ai Project, a research programme into the \"chimpanzee mind\".Among the institute's noteable findings were the fact that Ai was able to use numbers and identify colours. Researchers gave Ai a special keyboard linked to a computer when she was 18 months, a set-up that they used to study her memory and learning. At five years old, Ai \"mastered numerical naming from one to six and was able to name the number, colour and object of 300 types of samples\", according to a 1985 scientific paper by Tetsuro Matsuzawa, the primatologist behind the Ai Project.When she was not participating in cognitive tests, Ai was known to enjoy drawing and painting. Like other chimpanzees at the centre, Ai would scrawl marker pens over blank paper without having to be motivated by food rewards.Japanese media outlet Kyodo news reported that she once escaped with another primate - using a key to unlock her cage. In 2000 she gave birth to a son, Ayumu, who is also known for his remarkable memory.  In 2017 - the 40th anniversary of the Ai Project - a scarf made from one of Ai's paintings was gifted to renowned primatologist Dame Jane Goodall.",

    "body": "3 hours agoStephen McDonellChina correspondentGetty ImagesThere may be up to 200 million one-person households in China by 2030, according to a reportA new bleak-sounding app has taken China by storm.Named Are You Dead? the concept is simple. You need to check in with it every two days – clicking a large button – to confirm that you are alive. If not, it will get in touch with your appointed emergency contact and inform them that you may be in trouble.It was launched in May last year to not much fanfare but attention around it has exploded in recent weeks with many young people, who live alone in Chinese cities, downloading it in droves. This has propelled it to become the most downloaded paid app in the country.According to research institutions, there may be up to 200 million one-person households in China by 2030, Chinese state media outlet Global Times reports. And it's those people that the app - which describes itself as a \"safety company companion... whether you're a solo office worker, a student living away from home, or anyone choosing a solitary lifestyle\" - is trying to target. \"People who live alone at any stage of their life need something like this, as do introverts, those with depression, the unemployed and others in vulnerable situations,\" said one user on Chinese social media.\"There is a fear that people living alone might die unnoticed, with no one to call for help. I sometimes wonder, if I died alone, who would collect my body?\" said another.Screenshot/Moonshot TechnologiesThe app requires you to click a large button daily to confirm that you are aliveWilson Hou, 38,  who lives around 100km (62 miles) from his family, says that is exactly why he downloaded the app. He works in the capital Beijing. He returns home to his wife and child twice a week, but says he has to be away from them at the moment to work on a project and he mostly sleeps on site.\"I worry that if something happened to me, I could die alone in the place I rent and no-one would know,\" he said. \"That's why I downloaded the app and I set my mum as my emergency contact.\"He also added that he downloaded the app quickly after its release, fearing it would be banned because of the negative connotations around it.Some have been quick to bash the app's less than cheery name - saying that signing up for it might bring ill fortune. Others have called for it to be changed to something with a more positive spin, like \"Are you ok?\" or \"How are you?\".And though the success of this app must be, in part, because of its catchy-sounding name, the company behind the app, Moonscape Technologies, has said it is taking on board the criticism of the current title and weighing up a potential name change.Screenshot/Moonshot TechnologiesThe app sends alerts like these to an appointed emergency contact The app, which is listed internationally under the name Demumu, ranks in the top two in the US, Singapore and Hong Kong, and top four in Australia and Spain for paid utility apps - possibly driven by Chinese users living overseas.The current name is a word play on a successful food delivery app called \"Are you Hungry?\". In Chinese, \"Si-le-ma\" sounds like the name of the food app \"E-le-ma\". First launched as a free app, the app has now made its way into the paid category - albeit at the low price of 8 yuan ($1.15; £0.85). Little is known about the founders of Are You Dead?, but they say they are three people who were born after 1995 who built the app from Zhengzhou in Henan with a small team.It has certainly grown in value now. One of these men, who goes by the name Mr Guo, told Chinese media that they intended to raise money by selling 10% of the company for a million yuan. That is a lot more than the 1,000 yuan ($140) they say it cost to build the app.And they're also looking to grow their target audience - saying they are exploring the idea of a new product specifically designed for the elderly in a country where over one-fifth of its population is over the age of 60. In an indication that it was seriously looking at this option, it posted over the weekend, \"we would like to call on more people to pay attention to the elderly who are living at home, to give them more care and understanding. They have dreams, strive to live, and deserve to be seen, respected and protected.\"The company has not responded to questions from the BBC.",

    "body": "11 minutes agoGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC News PersianandJessica RawnsleyA referee and a student are among hundreds of people reportedly killed during massive anti-government protests in Iran.Coach Amir Mohammad Koohkan, 26, was hit by live ammunition on 3 January during protests in the town of Neyriz, his friend told BBC Persian.\"Everyone knew him for his kindness\", they said, adding his family is grieving and \"angry because he was killed by the regime\".Five days later, student Rubina Aminian, 23, was shot from behind during a protest in Tehran, according to human rights groups. \"She fought for things she knew were right\", her uncle told CNN.Nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of protests, a US-based rights group says.Sources in Iran have told the BBC the death toll is likely higher than reported.Demonstrations began on 28 December over the economy in the capital Tehran and have spread to 186 cities and all 31 provinces, according to the Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA).The protests have grown into the largest in years, with calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The protests led to a government crackdown, with at least 10,600 people reportedly arrested and 496 protesters killed, according to HRANA.Medical staff in Iran have described hospitals overwhelmed with dead and injured patients. BBC Persian verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on 9 January, and the BBC counted 180 body bags in footage from one morgue near Tehran thought to have been filmed on the same night.The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.Among the protest victims was Koohkan, who was killed in Neyriz in south-west Fars Province, his friend told BBC Persian. The friend did not witness the incident firsthand, but heard from eyewitnesses at the scene.\"It was far too soon for him, really far too soon. He was so young,\" the friend said.The friend said they had known Koohkan, an indoor futsal (a form of football) coach and referee, for 10 years: \"From childhood he was my coach, then he became like my brother.\"They described Koohkan, who had one brother, as \"someone who didn't like to see people in this state... in this misery\".\"Everyone knew him for his kindness and good nature. The whole town loved him,\" his friend said. \"The family are both grieving and angry. Grieving because they lost their son, angry because he was killed by the regime.\"Also killed was Aminian, who was shot from behind while taking part in a protest on Thursday, according to three rights groups.Two groups - Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) and Kurdish organisation Hengaw - said she was shot in the head, while the Kurdistan Human Rights Network said she was shot in the back. Both Kurdish groups said she was shot by government forces.The BBC has been unable to independently verify the circumstances of her death.The 23-year-old, whose first name has also been spelled Robina or Roubina, was studying textile and fashion at Shariati Technical and Vocational College in Tehran, IHRNGO said.\"She was a strong girl, a courageous girl, and she was not someone you could control and make decisions for,\" her uncle told CNN. \"She fought for things she knew were right and fought hard.\"He added that she was \"thirsty for freedom, thirsty for women's rights\". \"Overall, she was a girl who was alive, who lived.\"Members of Aminian's family travelled from their hometown in Kermanshah, western Iran, to Tehran to identify her body after learning of her death, a source close to the family told INRNGO.The family had to search through hundreds of bodies of young people killed in the protests at a location close to her college, the source said.\"It wasn't just my daughter; I saw hundreds of bodies with my own eyes,\" Aminian's mother said, in a statement from the source.Iranian authorities allegedly initially refused to hand over Aminian's body to her family, then prevented her burial or mourning ceremonies in their hometown, the source said.The family was reportedly forced to bury her along the road between Kermanshah and Kamyaran.Iranian leader Khamenei has called anti-government protesters \"troublemakers,\" while US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene and said the US military is considering \"very strong options\".The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.Then, more than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups.",

    "body": "England Under-20s wing Sophie Hopkins, who is combining a year abroad during her biochemistry degree with a season at French top-flight side Lyon, is among 11 uncapped players included in a 47-strong Red Roses training squad.Four Trailfinders Women forwards - Jasmine Adonri, Haidee Head, Hayley Jones and Annabel Meta - are included as they seek to seek to win their first caps.Loughborough Lightning's 19-year-old number eight Haineala Lutui, who leads the PWR in carries so far this season, is promoted from the age-grade set-up, with Harlequins' Nicole Wythe, part of the English top-flight's team of the year last campaign, another back row call-up.Whyte's team-mate Sarah Parry is also rewarded for her good form, with the centre a key part of Quins' rise to third in the table.All 32 of the squad that won the Rugby World Cup in September are included, bar the retired Emily Scarratt and Abby Dow. Hooker Lark Atkin-Davies, who is pregnant and expecting a child in June, will join up with the squad and follow a personalised training programme.While Parry may have benefited from Scarratt's decision to hang up her boots, Bristol's 20-year-old Millie David, who finished as joint top try-scorer in the PWR last season and is in the same position this campaign, bolsters back-three options in the wake of Dow's departure.With Gloucester-Hartpury's Mia Venner also included, Bo Westcombe-Evans, who has scored five tries in eight games since making her comeback from a serious knee injury, is overlooked.\"As we enter a new cycle, this camp will focus on aligning our communication and resetting our culture to win,\" said head coach John Mitchell of his team's first get-together since their Rugby World Cup triumph.\"It is natural for a rugby cycle to go through regeneration which presents exciting opportunities for young players over the next four years. The quicker they can adapt and contribute to the environment will enhance their opportunities.\"England could be on course to break the attendance record for a Womens' Six Nations match when they meet Ireland at Allianz Stadium Twickenham in their tournament opener on 11 April.While a record 81,885 fans - the most ever for a women's rugby match - watched England beat Canada to win the 2025 World Cup, the 58,498 who watched the Red Roses' 38-33 win over France in the 2023 Women's Six Nations finale remains the tournament's record.England have already sold more than 50,000 tickets for the match against Ireland with three months to go to kick-off.ForwardsLark Atkin-Davies (Bristol Bears), Maisy Allen (Exeter Chiefs), Jasmine Adonri (Trailfinders Women), Sarah Bern (Bristol Bears), Hannah Botterman (Bristol Bears), Abi Burton (Trailfinders Women), May Campbell (Saracens), Mackenzie Carson (Gloucester-Hartpury), Kelsey Clifford (Saracens), Amy Cokayne (Sale Sharks), Steph Else (Gloucester-Hartpury), Maddie Feaunati (Exeter Chiefs), Keevy Fitzpatrick (Loughborough Lightning), Rosie Galligan (Saracens), Lizzie Hanlon (Harlequins), Haidee Head (Trailfinders Women), Lilli Ives Campion (Loughborough Lightning), Hayley Jones (Trailfinders Women), Sadia Kabeya (Loughborough Lightning), Haineala Lutui (Loughborough Lightning), Alex Matthews (Gloucester-Hartpury), Annabel Meta (Trailfinders Women), Maud Muir (Gloucester-Hartpury), Marlie Packer (Saracens), Connie Powell (Harlequins), Zoe Stratford (Gloucester-Hartpury), Morwenna Talling (Sale Sharks),  Abbie Ward (Bristol Bears), Nicole Wythe (Harlequins)BacksHolly Aitchison (Sale Sharks), Jess Breach (Saracens),Millie David (Bristol Bears), Zoe Harrison (Saracens0, Tatyana Heard (Gloucester-Hartpury), Sophie Hopkins (LOU Rugby)*, Natasha Hunt (Gloucester-Hartpury), Megan Jones (Trailfinders Women), Ellie Kildunne (Harlequins), Claudia Moloney-MacDonald (Exeter Chiefs), Lucy Packer (Harlequins), Sarah Parry (Harlequins), Flo Robinson (Exeter Chiefs), Helena Rowland (Loughborough Lightning), Jade Shekells (Gloucester-Hartpury), Emma Sing (Gloucester-Hartpury), Mia Venner (Gloucester-Hartpury), Ella Wyrwas (Saracens).*Playing for LOU Rugby while studying abroad",

    "body": "2 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesParents of under-fives in England are to be offered official advice on how long their children should spend watching TV or looking at computer screens.The government says it will publish its first guidance on screen time for the age group in April.It comes as government research was published showing that about 98% of children under two were watching screens on a daily basis - with parents, teachers and nursery staff saying youngsters were finding it harder to hold conversations or concentrate on learning.Children with the highest screen time - around five hours a day - reportedly could say significantly fewer words than those at the other end of the scale who watched for around 44 minutes.How to manage your child's online world without clashingA national working group led by Children's Commissioner for England Dame Rachel de Souza and Department for Education scientific adviser Professor Russell Viner will formulate the guidance after speaking to parents, children and early years practitioners.The terms of reference for their work will be published on Monday. The guidance will also help parents come up with alternatives to screen time for their children.The government research showed that at age two, 77% of children in the highest-income families are read to daily, compared with 32% in the lowest-income families.In a statement, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: \"Screens are part of family life now. The question parents are asking isn't whether to use them, but how to use them well.\"Writing earlier in the Sunday Times, Phillipson said: \"Like so many parents, I've had evenings where you give in when your little one wants 'just one more' episode of their favourite show. But we're beginning to see the risks when 'just one more' starts to add up.\"She suggested parents could share a story on a tablet computer or use it for educational games.Felicity Gillespie, director of charitable foundation Kindred Squared, said \"evidence-based\" screentime guidance for parents was \"overdue and very welcome\".Kindred polling suggests that 40% of parents think reducing screen time would help ensure their child is ready for Reception. It says this underlines the demand for practical, trusted guidance in the early years.\"We must increase public understanding of how screens and devices can interfere with the way babies and toddlers learn best, which is by looking at facial expressions, chatting, singing and play,\" Gillespie said.Neil Leitch, from the Early Years Alliance, said he broadly welcomed plans to develop guidance on screen time for under-fives, but added: \"It's important that any such support on this topic sits within a much wider framework of guidance for families and educators on digital literacy and online safety.\"The announcement comes after the Conservatives said they would ban under-16s from accessing social media platforms if they win power, promising to follow the example of Australia, which became the first country to introduce the policy last month.Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott told the Today programme that \"we need to shift the social norm to say children are not safe on social media sites, it is really bad for them\".She called for MPs to back an amendment to the schools bill, which is currently progressing through Parliament, banning smartphones in the classroom.Former prime minister Rishi Sunak, who appeared on BBC Breakfast on Monday to promote his new numeracy charity with his wife Akshata Murty, said the issue was a \"complex\" one, where \"there probably isn't one thing that will make everything better\".\"We need to make sure when kids are at school they are focused on learning and being at school, and not having the distractions of phones and social media in the classroom,\" he added.",

    "body": "Jailed Venezuelan politician's son says Trump shouldn't be 'fooled' by pledge of prisoner releases2 hours agoNorberto ParedesBBC Mundo, CaracasBBCRamón Guanipa says he has only been allowed to visit his father once since his arrestThe son of a jailed Venezuelan opposition leader has warned Donald Trump to \"not be fooled\" by the country's government, amid accusations it has not kept its promise to release a significant number of political prisoners.Ramón Guanipa, the son of Juan Pablo Guanipa, said he believed the US president was unaware that only about 40 of the total of more than 800 political prisoners had reportedly been released so far.On Saturday, Trump thanked the Venezuelan authorities, saying they had \"started the process, in a BIG WAY\".The Venezuelan government announced on Thursday it would release detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups as a \"goodwill gesture\".The move came after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on 3 January, and took him to New York, where he has been charged with drug trafficking.Jorge Rodríguez, Venezuela's National Assembly leader and the brother of Interim President Delcy Rodríguez, announced that an \"important number of Venezuelan and foreign detainees\" would be released \"immediately\".Among those confirmed as released are several high-profile opposition figures - with Spain's foreign ministry confirming that five Spanish citizens had been freed, including human rights lawyer Rocío San Miguel.Trump claimed credit for the releases, writing on social media on Saturday: \"I hope these prisoners will remember how lucky they got that the USA came along and did what had to be done.\"But relatives of those still behind bars have been expressing their frustration that only a small number of prisoners have been freed.Ramón Guanipa, whose father is a close ally of opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado, told BBC Mundo: \"I want to tell President Trump that he must not be fooled and [should] keep pressure on these guys.\"He added: \"I want to thank President Trump for the pressure that he's been enforcing. He's been our greatest ally in this situation.\"However, pointing to the small number of people released so far, Guanipa warned Trump that \"if he thinks this is going alright, it is not\".Outside El Helicoide prisoners' relatives are keeping vigilRamón Guanipa says he has only been allowed to visit his father once since the older man was arrested.Juan Pablo Guanipa went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the result of the 2024 presidential election. That vote was lacked \"basic transparency and integrity\", according to the UN, and was denounced as rigged by the US which did not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader.For his comments, Juan Pablo Guanipa was tracked down by Venezuelan security forces and detained in May 2025.After hearing about the planned prisoner release, Ramón Guanipa took the first available flight from Maracaibo, in the east of the country, to Caracas.\"When they tell you they're going to release your family, everything else becomes small,\" he explained.But when his father was not among those freed, he felt \"defeated\".\"But at the same time, you find another reason to fight. I'm fighting for them [the interim government] to actually do what they say they're going to do.\"The Venezuelan government has not commented on the pace of the releases, and the attorney general has declined a BBC interview request.The developments are being viewed as the first test of Trump's influence in Venezuela following the removal of Maduro.Interim President Delcy Rodríguez has appeared to welcome co-operation with the Trump administration, but her public statements have condemned any form of US intervention.The government's announcement about prisoner releases came a day after Trump said that the Venezuelan authorities would shut down El Helicoide, the country's most notorious prison.El Helicoide was originally designed to be a shopping centre and a symbol of Venezuela's oil-fuelled prosperity, but became a fortress of political repression under Maduro.El Helicoide prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponentsOutside El Helicoide in western Caracas, the atmosphere is tense, with relatives keeping vigil.Carmen Farfán's son, José Gregorio Reyes, was detained along with his wife and a friend, while he was in hospital in western Venezuela. Their families have heard nothing since.Farfán does not know where her son is being held but has come to El Helicoide to join others in pleading for their relatives' release - wherever they may be.Beside her, Reyes' sister-in-law, cries as she describes how the three were arrested in November 2025.\"We hope they tell us where they are keeping them. We are desperate. We've been waiting for many days without any answers,\" Farfán says.Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have long accused the government of using detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics, but officials repeatedly denied Venezuela held any political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for criminal activity.Opposition activists have described the release of political prisoners as an \"urgent\" step towards any transition of power.However, the small number freed so far has raised doubts about the interim government's intentions and questions over the extent of its willingness to cooperate with the US.Additional reporting by Daniel Wittenberg.",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England head coach Thomas Tuchel caused a stir by leaving Jude Bellingham out of his last squadByChief football writer in RigaEngland confirmed qualification for next summer's World Cup with victory over Latvia in Riga on Tuesday, enabling head coach Thomas Tuchel to start finalising his plans as the countdown to the tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States continues.Competition for places will be intense, with disappointment inevitable for some of those who have played a part in England's smooth qualifying campaign.The jockeying for positions will continue over the next months - so who are those players with something to prove to Tuchel as he considers England's squad to take to the World Cup?Jude BellinghamIt is inconceivable that Jude Bellingham will not be part of England's squad at the World Cup but does the Real Madrid star, who is arguably the biggest global name available to Thomas Tuchel, still have something to prove to the head coach?The recent evidence on and off the pitch suggests he does.It all stems from Bellingham being left out of England's latest squad despite telling Tuchel he wanted to be included, to the constant narrative of team spirit and the excellence of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers in the number 10 role.England's next squad for what are effectively dead rubbers against Serbia and Albania will now have one main point of interest, namely whether Bellingham is included.If he is, Bellingham will return to duty having been made acutely aware by Tuchel that there is no star system, no special cases, no automatic route back into England's team.And it will also come after it has been made crystal clear that Tuchel's England world does not revolved around Bellingham and how best to utilise his undoubted talent.Bellingham is not exactly starting again with England - the odds will still be on him being in the line-up their first game in next summer's World Cup - but he has to prove to Tuchel that he can be part of the team spirit the German cherishes, and that he deserves his place back in the side.The England star famously mouthed \"who else?\" when scoring a spectacular stoppage-time overhead kick when England beat Slovakia in the last 16 at Euro 2024, but he now knows there are others Tuchel is willing to consider.Cole PalmerCole Palmer's England career has, so far, been a mixed bag ranging from the moment of brilliance that gave England hope with the equaliser against Spain in what was eventually a losing cause in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin, to other occasions when he has left even supporters of his superb talent wanting more.Palmer's current problem is a lingering groin injury. Further down the line it will be the Chelsea star performing in consistently eye-catching fashion that might persuade Tuchel to find a place for the 23-year-old in what is already a crowded area.Tuchel is unlikely to start fitting square pegs in round holes so close to a major tournament - therefore Palmer, who has only played 64 minutes under the German, has work to do.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cole Palmer celebrates scoring for England in the Euro 2024 final against Spain in BerlinHe is unlikely to get in as the 10, with Rogers currently in possession and Bellingham waiting in the wings.It is hard to see a place on the flanks, where he is less effective, with Anthony Gordon and Marcus Rashford contenders on the left and Arsenal pair Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke fighting for a place on the right.This effectively means Palmer will have to produce a spectacular run of form to force his way back into Tuchel's thinking.Phil FodenManchester City's brilliant 25-year-old was, along with Bellingham, a stand-out exclusion from Tuchel's squad for the friendly against Wales and the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga.Foden, who has won two caps under Tuchel, has been rebuilding form and confidence with an excellent start to the season after a poor campaign last term.And he will do all this with his sights set on the World Cup.He was a permanent fixture in Sir Gareth Southgate's plans up to Euro 2024, but getting Foden and Bellingham in the same team was often a struggle and never felt like a neat fit at the time, with the former often out on the left rather than his preferred central role.No-one, least of all Tuchel, can ignore Foden's talent but he must continue to impress to reclaim what was once an automatic place in England's squad.Like Palmer, Foden operates in what is now a congested place under Tuchel, whether it is in the centre or pushed out wide.Never rule a player of Foden's quality out, but he has a fight on his hands to make England's World Cup squad.Trent Alexander-ArnoldThis ship may have already sailed.Trent Alexander-Arnold's World Cup hopes were already in deep trouble even before he sustained the hamstring injury that has interrupted the start to his Real Madrid career.If Alexander-Arnold has been looking for signs of a bright England future under Tuchel, then not many of them are promising.He played former Liverpool team-mate Curtis Jones, a midfield player, ahead of him at right-back in the 1-0 win away to Andorra then dropped Alexander-Arnold completely for the return World Cup qualifiers with Andorra and visit to Serbia.This came after Tuchel appeared to publicly cast doubt on Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities when he spoke about his influence at Liverpool, saying: \"If he wants to have this impact in the English national team, then he has to take the defensive part very, very seriously.\"Tuchel is also a big admirer of another right-back, Reece James, who played under him at Chelsea, although he has had injury problems of his own.Alexander-Arnold may have to make other plans for the summer unless his form for Real can force a change of heart from Tuchel.Jack GrealishJack Grealish has been a player and personality reborn since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City, but Tuchel saw fit to ignore the clamour for an England recall when he selected his latest squad.Tuchel is a confirmed Grealish fan but, at present, it is hard to see where the midfielder would fit into England's plans, and who would make way to accommodate him.Grealish can join names like Palmer and Foden, who both face a fight to win places either as the 10 or on the flank.This is not to denigrate Grealish's form, which has already made him a hero with Everton's fans, but a brutal reality.Tuchel may also want to see Grealish produce consistently over 20 Premier League games rather than the seven so far. This is the task facing the popular 30-year-old if he is to put himself back in World Cup contention.Adam WhartonAdam Wharton has been outstanding for Crystal Palace for a long time now, running games against elite opponents, especially Manchester City when the Eagles won the FA Cup at Wembley last season, and in the win against Premier League champions Liverpool recently.Wharton's loping, languid style may sometimes disguise a classy, fiercely competitive midfielder, but his England breakthrough has not arrived, despite going to Germany as part of Southgate's Euro 2024 squad.He is yet to get his first minutes under Tuchel and was another surprise omission.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Adam Wharton during his only England appearance - 28 minutes as a substitute against Bosnia & Herzegovina in June 2024 under Sir Gareth SouthgateWharton's only England cap came under Southgate against Bosnia & Herzegovina in June 2024, when he made a 28-minute appearance as a substitute.Like others, he is still waiting for his chance to make his mark as Nottingham Forest's Elliott Anderson has taken the opportunity handed to him by Tuchel with excellent performances, looking right at home on the international stage.Tuchel has made all the right noises, even down to contacting Wharton to re-assure him he is in his thoughts.Wharton, however, has still not made Tuchel's squad so he is another who must continue to press his case to finally get some action under England's head coach.Marcus RashfordBarcelona is the latest stop on Marcus Rashford's road to redemption after being exiled by Manchester United - but he still has a way to travel to re-establish himself as a permanent fixture in England's squad.If the 27-year-old needed any reminding that he still has to prove himself to be fixed firmly in Tuchel's World Cup plans, he only needed to listen to the head coach's words before the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga.Tuchel said: \"It's not a question of talent. It's a question of whether he can prove the point at club and international level.\"It never has been a question of Rashford's talent, it is the times when he has lost his way after producing stunning performances in spells that raise doubts.He has to produce consistency at Barcelona then, as Tuchel suggests, \"prove the point\" with England as well.Rashford knows Tuchel has faith in his ability - he is selecting him for starters - but the warning is clear. He cannot afford to slip, or fail to prove his point, otherwise others are ready and waiting to take his place.Myles Lewis-SkellyWhen Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly scored the first goal of the Tuchel era against Albania in March, becoming the youngest player to score on his senior England debut, aged 18 years and 176 days, he not only looked like a superstar in the making but the answer to the problem left-back position.He may well still be, starting England's victory in Latvia, but has a potentially major problem ahead that Tuchel has already made reference to.And it is a problem that comes in the imposing shape of Riccardo Calafiori.England apart, Lewis-Skelly has been ousted from Arsenal's left-back slot by the Italian this season, starting only two games for the Gunners and playing only 263 minutes.This is not a question of Lewis-Skelly's quality - that is there for all to see. This is a question of how much football he will play.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly scored the first goal of the Thomas Tuchel era when he made his debut against Albania in March.It is a subject that has already been exercising Tuchel's mind, even though he played Lewis-Skelly in Riga.It is clear that unless he can find his way back into Arsenal's starting line-up, Tuchel may face a difficult choice with the gifted youngster, saying: \"Maybe it becomes a problem for him, yeah.\"Being a good team-mate in camp may not be good enough to stay the whole year with us. You have to perform at club level on a regular basis.\"Lewis-Skelly's task is clear. He may yet claim the left-back berth if Tuchel is unable to find a better alternative but he cannot rely on past credit. He has to find a way into Arsenal's starting line-up.Jordan HendersonJordan Henderson has a huge admirer in Tuchel. He was an instant inclusion for his first squad in March, winning a recall after being absent from England duty since November 2023.It was a pick that raised eyebrows but Tuchel was unmoved, continuing to keep faith with Brentford's veteran midfielder, even to the exclusion of Palace's Wharton, saying: \"He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"No-one could ever question the desire and attitude of one of the game's most consummate professionals, but Henderson will be 36 during next summer's World Cup, which will be played in gruelling conditions in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Tuchel has praised Henderson's influence around camp, and his impact can already be seen at Brentford, but he will need to be seen as someone who will figure on the pitch as well. There is no room for non-playing figureheads at a major tournament.Plenty question Tuchel's wisdom on this decision. It remains to be seen how much longer he will include Henderson, so the former Liverpool captain must produce high-class performances with Brentford consistently to stop eyebrows being raised further.Morgan Gibbs-WhiteMorgan Gibbs-White is a real talent and the Nottingham Forest player has won four caps under Tuchel, who is clearly an admirer of his quality.The problem for Gibbs-White may come with competition for places in the areas he likes, especially with Bellingham, Palmer and Foden not currently in England's squad and Aston Villa's Rogers producing excellence.This is no slight on Gibbs-White, who has been outstanding at Forest. Tottenham Hotspur thought they had signed him in a £60m deal during the transfer window but were left desperately disappointed when Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis persuaded him to stay by offering an improved contract.It is simply that, when the final numbers take shape, Gibbs-White could be in an area where there are just too many names to fit into a limited pot.Gibbs-White has the ability to be in that shake-up, although he may hope for some stability at the City Ground, where new manager Ange Postecoglou is already under pressure after the sacking of Nuno Espirito Santo, who got Forest into Europe and also got the best out of the 25-year-old.Who else must make a good impression?The understudy to England captain Harry Kane is always a thorny issue with options seemingly limited beyond Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.Spurs striker Dominic Solanke and Chelsea's Liam Delap will want to be in Thomas Tuchel's thoughts but both are currently troubled by injuries.Arsenal's Eberechi Eze operates in an area of the pitch where England competition is red-hot, but he offers variety and versatility, so that may well bolster his claims when the time comes for Tuchel to name his squad.The same may just apply to Newcastle United's Dan Burn with limited choices in central defence and left-back, but he will need to maintain good form and there are still questions about his quality at international level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, James Trafford hoped to be Manchester City's first choice keeper when he moved from Burnley - but was then replaced by Gianluigi DonnarummaEverton's Jordan Pickford is unchallenged as goalkeeper with Crystal Palace's Dean Henderson as his understudy - but what does the England future hold for James Trafford?He is currently third choice but had hoped to challenge Pickford for top spot after he moved from Burnley to Manchester City.This plan unravelled somewhat when City bought world-class Italian Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris St-Germain, Trafford losing his place immediately.City manager Pep Guardiola has insisted Trafford will get game time - but will it be enough to make Tuchel feel comfortable about his match sharpness?Arsenal's Declan Rice believes England have the all-round quality to cope with any squad issues, saying: \"I think every time you play for England you want to grab the shirt, you want to grab your chance. We do miss Jude for sure, we miss Phil, we miss Cole, we miss loads of players that have not been turning up for reasons the manager has said. \"We are an unreal team when they are in the team as well. What they have done for England in an England shirt is nothing short of incredible. We are looking forward to having them next camp hopefully, as a team we want to keep integrating as many people as possible before the World Cup.\"",

    "body": "32 minutes agoLana LamSydneyGetty Images'Big John' Fisher is known for his viral food reviews'Big John' Fisher, a British social media star known for his viral fast food reviews, has been detained in Australia over a visa issue.Fisher - who is famous for his love of Chinese takeaway and his signature catchphrase \"bosh\" - arrived in Western Australia on Tuesday ahead of a tour of the country.However, in social media posts, he said he would have to cancel his scheduled appearances in Perth and Sydney as he would be deported to London.Fisher said he was questioned by border officials for four hours, and though his visa was \"legit\", Australian authorities \"weren't happy\" that he was going to be working during his visit.\"Will explain more when I get home but absolutely gutted,\" he said.\"Sorry, Perth, sorry, Sydney.\"A spokesperson for the Australian Border Force said it could not comment on individual cases, due to privacy issues.In a post on Wednesday morning, local time, Fisher complained about his treatment by authorities and said he was spending his 52nd birthday in a detention hotel waiting to be deported.\"I'm still smiling and I still love Australia,\" he wrote before signing off with his famed slogan \"bosh\" - a British slang word often used as an enthusiastic exclamation.In a post to Instagram, Fisher's son - British heavyweight boxer Johnny Fisher - confirmed the personality would be flown home.\"Rumour has it they are frightened of his express pace bowling ahead of the Ashes,\" he said.It is understood that Fisher entered Australia on an incorrect visa.Fisher, who has previously visited Australia to meet fans, was due to appear at four events in the country this week. His schedule included hosting a \"Bucking Bull\" challenge at a greyhound race in Sydney and doing a DJ set at a horse racing meet in Perth.With almost 700,000 followers on Instagram and another half-million on TikTok, Fisher often films himself eating meals and gives a short review that almost always finish with him saying \"bosh\".Fisher was recently interviewed on BBC's Newsnight programme about a Chinese takeaway in York which was vandalised. He later visited the takeaway to show his support and posted a review of its food. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBC BanglaDhaka andKelly NgAt least 16 people have died after a huge fire broke out at a garment factory in Bangladesh, with officials warning that the toll could rise.Sixteen bodies have been recovered but were burned beyond recognition, the fire service said. Distraught relatives gathered outside the four-storey factory in Dhaka's Mirpur area on Tuesday in search of their loved ones still missing.The blaze, which broke out at the factory around midday, was extinguished after three hours. But an adjacent chemical warehouse continued to burn, authorities said.Large fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, often due to lax safety standards and poor infrastructure. Hundreds of people have been killed in fires in recent years.Up until 21:00 local time (15:00 GMT) yesterday, the fire at the chemical warehouse in Mirpur had not been completely doused, media reports said.Fire service officials have not ascertained which of the two buildings caught fire first. According to eyewitnesses, the chemical warehouse stored bleaching powder, plastic and hydrogen peroxide, all of which can intensify fires. Plastic also releases toxic fumes when burned.Fire service director Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury told local media the victims probably died \"instantly\" after inhaling \"highly toxic gas\". Police and military officers are still trying to locate the owners of the factory and the warehouse, Mr Chowdhury told reporters.An investigation on whether the warehouse was operating legally is also ongoing, he added.Tearful family members stood outside the charred buildings, many of them clutching photographs of their missing relatives. Among them is a man searching desperately for his daughter, Farzana Akhter. \"When I heard about the fire, I came running. But I still haven't found her....I just want my daughter back,\" he told Reuters news agency.In 2021, a fire at a food and drink factory left at least 52 people dead and another 20 injured. The factory was built illegally and had no emergency exit, an investigation later found.In 2019, a fast-moving fire swept through a historic district in Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, including members of a bridal party.The country's most deadly industrial accident to date took place in 2013, when an eight-storey commercial building collapsed owing to a structural failure, killing more than 1,100 people.",

    "body": "7 hours agoIone WellsSouth America Correspondent andNadine YousifThe US has struck another vessel off the coast of Venezuela on Tuesday, killing six people, President Donald Trump has said. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the vessel belonged to \"narcoterrorists\" and that it was \"trafficking narcotics\". This is the fifth strike of its kind by the Trump administration on a boat accused of trafficking drugs on international waters since September. In total, 27 people have been reported killed, but the US has not provided evidence or details about identities of the vessels or those on board them.Some lawyers have accused the US of breaching international law, and neighbouring nations like Colombia and Venezuela have condemned the strikes.In his Truth Social post, Trump said \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known\" route for smuggling. He also posted an aerial surveillance video showing a small boat on water that is struck by a missile and explodes.US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': What do we know, and was it legal?What is Trump's goal as US bombs 'Venezuela drugs boat'?Trump did not specify the nationality of those on board, or what drug smuggling organisation they are suspected of belonging to. He added that no US military personnel were injured. The strike comes after a recent leaked memo sent to Congress, and reported on by US media, that said the administration determined the US was in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. It has also deployed multiple warships to the Caribbean. The US has positioned its strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels as self-defence. Many lawyers questioning the legality of such military action.Framing this as an active armed conflict is likely a way for Trump to justify using more extreme wartime powers – for example killing \"enemy fighters\" even if they have not posed a violent threat, or detaining people indefinitely.While it is true that some drug trafficking occurs in Venezuela, and some cartels operate in the region that some of these vessels allegedly have originated from, it is not considered a hotspot for drug trafficking compared to some other locations in the region.As a result, many believe this is part of a wider political campaign to put military pressure on Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro.The strikes come after the US announced a $50m (£37m) reward for any information leading to the arrest of Maduro - whose election to lead the country has been widely rejected by the international community - on drug-trafficking charges.Venezuela's government has reacted to previous recent strikes with anger. Maduro denies American accusations that he is involved with drugs trafficking, while another official has questioned the veracity of footage posted by Trump.",

    "body": "2 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondent andChris MasonPolitical editorAFP/Getty ImagesChristopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of spying for ChinaThe Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are demanding the Labour government publish the evidence it submitted in the now-collapsed case against two people accused of spying for China.It follows another public intervention from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which has made clear it would not stand in the way if ministers chose to put their evidence in the public domain.On Tuesday, senior government figures had suggested that the CPS had told them to do so would be \"inappropriate\".Prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry last month, prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. Both men deny the allegations.The director of public prosecutions said the case collapsed because evidence could not obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat. This row within a row relates to the three witness statements submitted by Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Collins, on whether China had been regarded as a threat at the time of the alleged offences under the previous Conservative government.The CPS has now said: \"The statements were provided to us for the purpose of criminal proceedings which are now over.  \"The material contained in them is not ours, and it is a matter for the government, independently of the CPS, to consider whether or not to make that material public.\"Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Mr Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp told the BBC: \"The government should now urgently release Matt Collins's witness statements and the correspondence around them in the interests of full transparency.\"Since this evidence would have been cross-examined in court, it cannot be secret.  \"Otherwise, there will be legitimate questions about what exactly the government is hiding.\"Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Calum Miller also called on Labour to release the full witness statements.\"If ministers have nothing to hide they have nothing to fear,\" Miller said. \"Failure to come clean will just confirm people's suspicions of a cover-up and that ministers are more worried about cosying up to China than protecting our national security.\"The controversy over the collapsed China spy case explainedBBC In-Depth: Why Labour is strengthening ties with ChinaOn Sunday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch wrote to the prime minister asking him to address \"unanswered\" questions about the collapsed case.In her letter, Badenoch accused Sir Keir Starmer, or his ministers, of being \"too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security\", claiming the government had sought to \"appease China\".Jonathan Powell, one of Sir Keir's most senior advisers and political allies, visited China earlier this yearThere is every possibility Sir Keir will for the first time face sustained public scrutiny on the case on Wednesday, when he appears at the first Prime Minister's Question time for several weeks, after the parliamentary recess for party conferences.The Labour leader previously said ministers could only draw on the last government's assessment of China, in which the country was called an \"epoch-defining challenge\", and his government has maintained it is \"frustrated\" the trial collapsed.The Tories have asked the CPS if it would be able to restart prosecutions against the two men, if new evidence is brought forward by the government declaring China a threat to national security.But there is an exceptionally high bar to prosecuting someone for a second time after an acquittal in court - and it is not possible to do so for people charged under the Official Secrets Act.That protection against what is known as \"double jeopardy\" is a basic legal principle that has existed for 800 years.",

    "body": "Some migrants coming to the UK will need to speak English to an A-level standard under tougher new rules set to be introduced by the government.The changes, which will come into force from 8 January 2026, will affect some graduates and those applying for skilled worker or scale-up visas, which are for people employed by fast-growing businesses.The new rules  form part of wider plans to cut levels of immigration to the UK outlined in a white paper in May.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"If you come to this country, you must learn our language and play your part.\"\"This country has always welcomed those who come to this country and contribute,\" Mahmood said. \"But it is unacceptable for migrants to come here without learning our language, unable to contribute to our national life.\"Applicants will be tested in person on their speaking, listening, reading and writing at Home Office-approved providers, with their results checked as part of the visa process.Those applying for skilled worker, scale-up and high potential individual (HPI) visas will be required to reach B2 level - a step up from the current B1 standard which is equivalent to GCSE.To come to the UK on the skilled worker visa, migrants have to work for a government-approved employer and earn at least £41,700 a year, or the \"going rate\" for their type of work, whichever is highest.The scale-up visa is open to migrants coming to work for a fast-growing UK business. Migrants can apply for a high potential individual visa if they have been awarded a qualification from a top global university within the last five years.According to the British Council, which offers English language courses, learners who achieve B2 level can \"understand the main ideas of complex texts on concrete or abstract topics.\"They can express themselves \"fluently and spontaneously\" and communicate comfortably with other English speakers. They can also produce \"clear, detailed text on many subjects and explain a complex viewpoint\".Further English language requirements for other visa routes and family dependants are expected to be introduced in due course, Home Office Minister Mike Tapp told Parliament on Tuesday.The prime minister previously said the changes outlined in the white paper would make the UK's immigration system \"controlled, selective and fair\".Home Office estimates suggest the measures could reduce the number of people coming to the UK by up to 100,000 per year.Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - fell to 431,000 in 2024, down almost 50% on the total in 2023, when it reached a record high of 906,000. Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the government faced a \"trade-off\" between \"ensuring migrants speak good English and enabling employers to recruit workers who are expected to bring economic benefits.\"Many graduate jobs already require language skills above A-level standard, she said.The new language requirements will have \"more impact in middle-skilled jobs involving technical and manual skills, where employers sometimes do not require high language proficiency\".Immigration lawyer Afsana Akhtar told BBC News she thought it was \"unfair\" that migrants had to reach such a high standard of English \"because even many people in the UK probably wouldn't be able to pass English A-level\". \"This would rule out even skilled workers who want to come and contribute to our British economy,\" she said. \"The GCSE standard is sufficient - and then when they come live here, [and] integrate into England and the English way of life, their English will improve inevitably.\"Other measures in the white paper include cutting the time period international students can stay in the UK to find a graduate job after their course ends from two years to 18 months, which will take effect from January 2027.Students will also have to meet higher financial requirements, raised to £1,171 per month outside London (from £1,136) for up to nine months.The Global Talent visa, for high achievers in technology, arts and academia fields has also been expanded to include winners of more prestigious prizes. Further plans in the White Paper include, the immigration skills charge for UK employers to pay when sponsoring foreign workers on specific visas has also been  increased to £480 per person per year for small organisations or charities, and to £1,320 for medium and large organisations.This is raised from £364 and £1,000 respectively.As part of the government's efforts to attract highly skilled people to the country, the HPI route will be expanded. The number of migrants on the visa is expected to double from 2,000 to 4,000, but there will be a cap of 8,000 applications each year.",

In a statement, they wrote that the star, whose real name was Michael Eugene Archer, left behind a \"legacy of extraordinarily moving music\" and asked fans to celebrate “the gift of song that he has left for the world”.The influential singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz. His three albums won D'Angelo four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D'Angelo appeared to be performing naked.\"The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,\" his family said in a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC’s US media partner. Tributes have flooded in, with rappers Doja Cat and Missy Elliot, as well as singers Jill Scott and Jennifer Hudson paying their respects.\"A true voice of soul and inspiration to many brilliant artists of our generation and generations to come,\" Doja Cat wrote on X. Jennifer Hudson said \"we lost a true original today\".\"D'Angelo, your voice will live on forever. Rest well, King!!!\"Tyler the Creator said his \"musical DNA\" was shaped by D'Angelo - \"We are so lucky to have been alive to enjoy his art,\" he wrote.ReutersThe award-winning singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazzD’Angelo began his career as a songwriter, and worked alongside big names in music like Lauryn Hill and The Roots. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar. His song, Lady, from that album reached the number 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 1996. That song earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot on the music scene.The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano when he was just three years old.Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.).When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI.He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo.However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died in a car crash in 2005. He returned to music in 2014 with Black Messiah - an album in the works for years - which he finished after watching the national unrest prompted by protests over the failure to convict police officers in the deaths of the unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner.Getty ImagesD'Angelo's song Lady earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot in the music sceneIt went on to win the Grammy for best R&B album in February 2016.Among those paying tribute was hip-hop legend DJ Premier, who produced D'Angelo's song Devil's Pie.\"Such a sad loss,\" he wrote on social media. \"We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING.\"The Voodoo album which was released in 2000 topped the US charts and in its most recent list of the greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at 28 – one place above The Beatles' White Album.D'Angelo had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq.",

    "body": "23 minutes agoLauren Turner andOsmond ChiaReutersThe US government has seized more than $14bn (£10.5bn) in bitcoin and charged the founder of a Cambodian business empire, Prince Group, with allegedly masterminding a massive cryptocurrency scam.UK and Cambodian national Chen Zhi was charged on Tuesday in New York for allegedly engaging in a wire-fraud conspiracy and running a money laundering scheme.Mr Chen's businesses were also sanctioned by the US and the UK as part of a joint operation. The UK government says it has frozen assets owned by his network, including 19 properties in London - one of which is worth nearly £100m ($133m).The BBC has contacted the Prince Group for comment.US prosecutors say it is one the biggest financial takedowns in history and the largest ever seizure of bitcoin, with approximately 127,271 bitcoin being held by US government.Mr Chen, who remains at large, is accused of being the mastermind behind a \"sprawling cyber-fraud empire\" operating under his multi-national company, the Prince Group, said the US Department of Justice (DOJ).The Cambodia-based group's website says its businesses include property development, and financial and consumer services. But the DOJ alleges that it runs one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organisations.Unwitting victims were contacted online and convinced to transfer cryptocurrency based on false promises that the funds would be invested and generate profits, the DOJ said.Prosecutors alleged that the company, under Mr Chen's direction, built and operated at least ten scam compounds throughout Cambodia, according to court documents seen by the BBC.Mr Chen was accused of managing the compounds that were specially designed to reach as many victims as possible, said prosecutors.His accomplices allegedly procured millions of mobile phone numbers and set up \"phone farms\" to conduct call centre scams, according to the court documents, dated 8 October.Two of these facilities had 1,250 mobile phones that controlled around 76,000 social media accounts for scams, the documents said.Prosecutors said Prince Group documents included tips on building rapport with victims, advising workers not to use profile photos of women who were \"too beautiful\" so that the accounts would look more genuine.US District Court EDNYCourt documents contained images of \"phone farms\" allegedly used to conduct  scamsAssistant Attorney General for National Security John A Eisenberg described the Prince Group as a \"criminal enterprise built on human suffering\".It also trafficked workers, who were confined in prison-like compounds and forced to carry out scams online, targeting thousands of victims worldwide, he said.Mr Chen and his accomplices allegedly used the criminal proceeds for luxury travel and entertainment, said the DOJ. They also made \"extravagant\" purchases like watches, private jets and rare artwork, including a Picasso painting purchases from a New York City auction house, the department said.If convicted, Mr Chen faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in jail.In Britain, Mr Chen and his accomplices allegedly incorporated businesses in the British Virgin Islands and invested in UK property. His network's assets include a £100m office building on central London, a £12m mansion in North London and seventeen flats in the city, said the UK foreign office on Tuesday.Being sanctioned, as part of a joint operation with US authorities, means he is now locked out of the UK's financial system.The Prince Group has also been sanctioned in the US and labelled as a criminal organisation.They were \"ruining the lives of vulnerable people and buying up London homes to store their money\", UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.Cooper said: \"Together with our US allies, we are taking decisive action to combat the growing transnational threat posed by this network - upholding human rights, protecting British nationals and keeping dirty money off our streets.\"The foreign office said Mr Chen and the Prince Group built casinos and compounds used as scam centres and laundered the proceeds.Four businesses linked to the alleged scams - The Prince Group, Jin Bei Group, Golden Fortune Resorts World and Byex Exchange -  have also been sanctioned, said the foreign office.Two scam centres allegedly run by Jin Bei Group and Golden Fortune Resorts were named earlier this year in an Amnesty International report on the use of forced labour and torture in Cambodian scam centres.People working in scam centres are often foreign nationals lured by the promise of a legitimate job, and then forced to carry out scams under threat of torture, the foreign office said.These scammers operate on an \"industrial scale\", including in the UK, using tricks like fake romantic relationships to lure victims into being scammed, said the foreign office.Fraud Minister Lord Hanson said: \"Fraudsters prey on the most vulnerable by stealing life savings, ruining trust, and devastating lives. We will not tolerate this.\"",

    "body": "58 minutes agoThe \"shattered remains\" of Khan Younis have been pictured on the front page of the Guardian, which writes that the \"fragile ceasefire\" in Gaza has already been tested. The paper reports four dead hostages have been returned to Israel, but says Hamas has previously claimed it may take longer to return the rest of the bodies as \"not all burial sites have been identified\". Israel has said aid into Gaza will be cut by half and a key border crossing will remain closed, the paper adds.The UK state pension is set to climb 4.8%, the i Paper reports, with pensioners now set to receive £12,547.60 annually. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that UK inflation will remain \"higher than any other large rich country\", the paper notes. But it adds the IMF's \"modest\" growth rate forecast will offer a \"slight boost\" to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her Budget next month.The Express offers a different interpretation on the IMF's forecasting, declaring it a \"bleak verdict\" on the UK economy and \"fresh humiliation\" for the chancellor.The Daily Mail zeros in on official figures which it says show unemployment in the UK is at a four-year high, and wage growth has slowed.  It also refers to the IMF predictions, and says the \"darkening outlook\" has prompted a Bank of England official to warn of a \"growing risk of recession\".The Telegraph leads with the Home Secretary's upcoming speech at a summit with Balkan interior ministers, where she is expected to warn that a failure to control UK migration is \"eroding trust\" in politicians. According to the paper, Shabana Mahmood will tell leaders that \"international co-operation\" is the only way to secure borders. \"Hamas kills its enemies on ceasefire Gaza streets\" reads the headline of the Times, detailing the alleged executions in Gaza of \"suspected collaborators\" following the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The front page also features a photograph of the Princess of Wales beaming as she bakes at Long Meadow Farm, captioned \"On a roll\".The Financial Times leads with comments from US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, after he told the paper that China is \"trying to hurt the world's economy\" following the introduction of export controls on rare earths and critical minerals. A member of Madagascar's military is also pictured, amid reports that the army has seized power in the African nation and President Andry Rajoelina has fled.\"Illegal migrant madness\" says the Sun, alleging that art classes and puzzle rooms in immigrant removal centres are funded by the taxpayer. The Home Office has said they are reviewing the provision of activities in immigration centres to \"ensure they deliver value for taxpayers\".The Mirror leads with comments from former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who told the Covid inquiry that the 2021 phased return to school was \"destined to fail\" and \"damaging for children and parents\".\"Gavin and numpty\" reads the headline of the Star, reporting that Williamson also told the inquiry that the decision to shut schools during the pandemic was made in just 24 hours.Daily Mail's assessment of the latest figures on the economy, which showed the number of jobless hitting a four-year high, as the International Monetary Fund predicted the UK would have the highest inflation in the G7. The Daily Express says the figures are fresh humiliation for the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The i Paper says the triple lock will help to buffer older people from inflation, with the state pension set to climb by 4.8%.The Daily Telegraph says Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will tell a summit of Balkan interior ministers in London that the UK has lost control of its borders - and that this failure is eroding trust in political leaders and the credibility of the state. The Times reports on a different concern of the Home Secretary. It says she took a \"dim view\" of a warning from the Council of Europe that the government's policies on trans rights and banning Palestine Action could breach the European Convention on Human Rights. A source tells the paper that the intervention plays into the hands of Reform UK and the Conservatives, which both want to leave the Convention.The Guardian says the fragile ceasefire in Gaza has faced its first test - with Israel halving the aid allowed into the territory, accusing Hamas of withholding the bodies of its hostages. The Times says Hamas has been killing its enemies on the streets of Gaza, as it attempts to regain control. The Telegraph says for Hamas, \"peace\" has started with mass executions.The Daily Mirror considers evidence from the former Education Secretary Sir Gavin Williamson to the Covid Inquiry. \"At last they admit it,\" it says - \"Boris DID harm our kids.\" The Daily Star says Sir Gavin admitted that the plan to shut schools was decided in just 24 hours.The Times says a new book claims that Lady Margaret Thatcher had two extramarital affairs. It says the book - The Incidental Feminist - says the former prime minister had a relationship with the PR executive Tim Bell - and the Conservative MP Sir Humphrey Atkins. The Express quotes an unnamed politician as saying: \"The joke about Atkins was that for someone who was not very good, he kept getting promoted. Now why was that?\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "5 hours agoGeeta PandeyBBC News, DelhiMuskan SharmaMuskan Sharma has dedicated her crown to her motherMuskan Sharma stood up to men who tried to bully her over her clothes - and went on to win hearts and a beauty pageant.The 23-year-old, who was crowned Miss Rishikesh 2025 last week in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, told the BBC that even though it was a small local pageant, \"it made me feel like Miss Universe\".Sharma's win has made headlines in India as it came after a viral video that showed her spiritedly arguing with a man who barged into their rehearsals just a day before the 4 October contest.Sharma, who \"wanted to be a model and participate in a pageant since I was in school\", said the intruders came in just as they broke for lunch. \"We were sitting around, chilling, having a laugh when they walked in,\" she said.The footage showed Raghavendra Bhatnagar, district head of a Hindu group called Rashtriya Hindu Shakti Sangathan, objecting to skirts and western dresses Sharma and other contestants were wearing.\"Modelling is over, go back home,\" Bhatnagar is heard telling them. \"This is against Uttarakhand's culture.\" Sharma refuses to back down. \"Why don't you shut the shops which sell them [Western clothes]?\"She then tells him that he should expend his energies on things that are worse than women's clothing - social evils such as drinking and smoking.\"There's a shop right outside that sells cigarettes and alcohol. Why don't you shut that down? First stop those things and I will stop wearing these clothes,\" she says.The man snaps at her saying \"don't tell me what to do\". Likewise, she retorts. \"If you have the right to choose, then so do we. Our opinion matters as much as yours,\" she says.As the argument continues, Sharma is joined by some of the other contestants and organisers and Bhatnagar and his group, who threatened to stop the show, are finally escorted out by the hotel manager.Muskan SharmaThe Miss Rishikesh contestants were heckled by men for their clothes during rehearsalsSharma says her reaction to Bhatnagar was \"spontaneous\". \"I could see my dreams shattering in front of me. The only question in my mind at the time was will the pageant go on? Will I be able to walk the ramp? Or will all my hard work go waste?\" she says. The next day, the event went on as planned and Sharma won the crown.\"For three seconds after I heard my name announced, I was shocked,\" she said.\"But then I was happy that I stood up for myself and that I won. It felt like a double victory. It was a small pageant in a small place but it made me feel like Miss Universe,\" she said.Sharma says heckling of women for their clothing is unheard of in Rishikesh, a city in the Himalayan foothills on the banks of Ganges river. It's known for its ashrams and meditation and yoga retreats and is considered a holy Hindu site that draws in large numbers of tourists and pilgrims.The city is also sought out by fans of Beatles because the Fab Four had spent weeks at an ashram there in 1968.\"You see tourists dressed in western clothing here all the time and no-one bats an eyelid,\" she adds.Globally, beauty pageants have been criticised for objectifying women and reinforcing gender stereotypes. But these contests have been hugely popular in India since 1994 - the year when Sushmita Sen won the Miss Universe crown and Aishwarya Rai brought home the Miss World trophy. Both went on to become top Bollywood actresses and have inspired generations of young women since then to follow in their path. Similar successes in later years of Priyanka Chopra, Diana Hayden and Lara Dutta have only reinforced the belief that beauty pageants can be a ticket to success, especially for young women in small-town India.Sharma says her parents have always been very supportive of her decision to participate in the pageant. In the viral video, she's even heard asking Bhatnagar: \"Who are you to comment on my clothing if my parents allow me to to wear them?\"Muskan SharmaThe pageant took place as plannedBut the backlash to Western clothing in India is not new where what women wear routinely becomes a subject of debates. In a deeply patriarchal society, many link western clothing, especially jeans, to the \"moral degradation\" of young people. Schools and colleges set dress codes for female students and sometimes village elders bar an entire community of girls from wearing jeans.The BBC has reported a number of cases where girls and women have been singled out and humiliated for their clothes.A few years ago, we wrote about a 19-year-old student in Assam who turned up in shorts to take an exam and was forced to wrap a curtain around her legs after the teacher objected. In one extreme case, a teenager was allegedly murdered by her relatives for wearing jeans. Namita Bhandare in her column in The Hindustan Times newspaper points out that there is no objection to the Mr Rishikesh contest where participants are barely dressed.The objection to Sharma and other contestants' clothing, she writes, is \"barely a fig-leaf\". \"The issue is not clothes. The issue is freedom and aspiration. How dare these young women be on a stage that could springboard them to a larger global platform? How dare they cross lines of honour and shame that a patriarchal society has imposed on them?\"Bhandare writes that in India where there are not enough women MPs or judges, the pushback by young women from a small town is remarkable.Sharma says it's her mother who taught her to stand up for what's right. \"The crown is as much my mother's as it's mine. Without her I wouldn't be the person I am today.\"Her story, she believes, will now encourage other women to stand up for themselves, for what is right. \"I'm saying that in the moment, I was scared and nervous too. But I also want to say that if you believe that you're right, then you can also fight.\"\"For me,\" she says, \"the crown was always secondary. The more important thing was to encourage women to stand up against injustice, to speak up for what's right,\"I ask her what's the next step for her.\"I will go for Miss Uttarakhand next year and then Miss India. After that, I'll see where life takes me.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoRed TractorThe Red Tractor advert was last shown in 2023 but will now be banned for future use unless it is updatedA TV advert by Red Tractor, the UK's biggest certifier of farm products on supermarket shelves, has been banned for exaggerating the scheme's environmental benefits and misleading the public.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled the organisation had provided \"insufficient evidence\" that its farms complied with basic environmental laws to substantiate the claims in its ad.Environmental group River Action, which brought the complaint in 2023, said the ruling showed the scheme was \"greenwashing\" and urged supermarkets to stop using it.But Red Tractor called the watchdog's decision \"fundamentally flawed\" and argued that the scheme's focus was animal welfare not environmental standards.In 2021, Red Tractor aired an advert in which it said: \"From field to store all our standards are met. When the Red Tractor's there, your food's farmed with care.\"You can watch it below.Watch: the ad banned by the Advertising Standards AuthorityThe environmental charity River Action took issue with the ad, which ran for a further two years, and complained to the watchdog that it suggested to consumers that Red Tractor farms will \"ensure a high degree of environmental protection\".The charity pointed to a report by the Environment Agency, released in 2020, which looked at how many breaches of environmental law there were on Red Tractor farms in the previous five years. The report concluded that these farms were \"not currently an indicator of good environmental performance\".After more than two years of investigation - one of the longest running - the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the complaint.It said that Red Tractor had failed to provide \"sufficient evidence\" that its farms met \"basic\" environmental laws and had a good environmental outcome to substantiate the claims in the ad.It also ruled that as a result the advert was \"misleading\" and \"exaggerated\" the benefits of the scheme.River Action welcomed the decision by the ASA and called on supermarkets to act.\"What this shows is that for their environmental credentials Red Tractor has been misleading the public and their supplies,\" said Amy Fairman, head of campaigns at River Action. \"So, we're looking for suppliers like supermarkets to really examine and take stock of what is on their shelves.\"She added that challenging such adverts was important because of the pollution risk to the environment from agricultural pollution.In 2022, the Environment Audit Committee concluded that agriculture was one of the most common factors preventing rivers from being in good health - affecting 40% of them. The risks to the environment include from slurry and pesticide runoff.BBC News/Tony JolliffeAmy Fairman represents environmental charity River Action which campaigns for clean and healthy riversBut Red Tractor, which assures 45,000 farms in the UK, have pushed back strongly, calling the finding by the ASA \"fundamentally flawed\".Jim Mosley, CEO of Red Tractor, told the BBC: \"They believe that we have implied an environmental claim. Nowhere in the voiceover or the imagery is any environmental claim actually made.\"He argued that the ASA only found a minority of people would think the advert meant Red Tractor farms had good environmental standards, and in fact the scheme is focused on other issues.\"Red Tractor's core purpose is food safety, animal welfare, and traceability. Whilst we have some environmental standards, they are a small part. And as a consequence, we leave that entirely to the Environment Agency to enforce environmental legislation,\" said Mr Moseley.When asked if that meant Red Tractor does not know if its farms are complying with environmental law, he said: \"Correct\".But many supermarkets do refer to the environmental benefits of Red Tractor farms.Natalie Smith, Tesco's head of agriculture said last month, on the 25-year anniversary of Red Tractor: \"Certification schemes play a key role in providing reassurance for customers, and over the past 25 years, Red Tractor has established itself as a mark of quality, standing for… environmental protection.\"On Morrisons' website it states: \"100% of the fresh pork, beef, lamb, poultry, milk and cheddar cheese we sell in our stores comes from farms certified by Red Tractor, or an approved equivalent scheme, giving customers assurance… environmental protection.\"Both supermarkets were asked if they stood by the Red Tractor logo.Morrisons did not respond to comment and Tesco referred the BBC to their industry body the British Retail Consortium.The consortium said that \"retailers remain committed to working with Red Tractor\", but that the organisation themselves are owners of the scheme.",

    "body": "12 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporter, in Tel AvivBBCRotem Cooper says his father's body not being returned was a \"disappointment\"The son of an Israeli hostage whose body remains in Gaza has told the BBC he is dealing with the realisation that \"it's not over and it's going to be a longer battle\".Rotem Cooper, whose father Amiram is among 24 hostages whose bodies were not returned to Israel on Monday, said the families were trying \"to find the strength somehow to pick ourselves up... and continue the fight\".He called on US President Donald Trump, Qatar, Egypt and other countries involved in peace deal negotiations \"to show Hamas that this is not acceptable\".A ceasefire and hostage release agreement signed by Israel and Hamas stated that the remaining hostages in Gaza would be returned by noon on Monday, with nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel released in exchange.While the 20 hostages still alive were released, a copy of the agreement published by Israeli media appeared to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not be able to locate all of the bodies of the deceased hostages by the deadline.Follow updates on this storyTheir families had pinned their hopes on their loved one returning on Monday, after two years in captivity.\"We hoped and expected that maybe 15 to 20 out of the 28 deceased hostages would be released, but that didn't happen. Only four were announced,\" Mr Cooper said.Family handoutAmiram Cooper was kidnapped from his home alongside his wife on 7 October 2023He described the news as a \"very big disappointment\" for the families.\"It's clear to us that they could have and should have released more and [that] they're playing games.\"Mr Cooper's parents were both kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His mother was released later that month while his father was killed in captivity.Who are the released hostages?Israel identifies bodies of four deceased hostagesWhat happens next in Gaza ceasefire plan after hostage release?The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had been operating in the area at the time but did not confirm how he was killed, referring the BBC this week to a previous statement saying the circumstances were \"under examination\". Hamas has claimed he was killed by an Israeli military strike.AFP via Getty ImagesDozens of people were at Re'im military base to see the return of the hostages on MondayThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of many of the hostages, has called for \"a very serious response\" from the Israeli government and mediators, for what is described as Hamas's \"violation of the agreement\". It said further stages of the peace plan should not progress until all the remaining bodies had been returned.Mr Cooper headed to the Re'im military base in southern Israel on Monday to see the return of the 20 living hostages.In recorded voice messages sent throughout the day, he described feeling \"tremendous anticipation\" and a \"big relief\" as he saw them return. But he added that the thought of the bodies coming back to Israel was \"heartbreaking\".Family handoutRuby Chen (R) with his son Itay (L), whose body still remains in GazaSpeaking again the following day, after the news that the four bodies returned did not include Amiram's, he described the experience as a \"big rollercoaster\".Mr Cooper said the return of his father's body would allow him to have \"some closure\" and to \"sleep better at night\".\"Everything has been on hold,\" he said.Ruby Chen, whose son Itay's body remains in Gaza, said he had experienced a similar mix of emotions.\"We were overjoyed [on Monday] to see 20 hostages coming out and being reunited with their families, but we were very disappointed not to see more deceased hostages coming out,\" he said in a video message shared with the BBC by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\"We request the Israeli government, the US and the mediators to continue the fight and put pressure on Hamas to adhere [to] and follow the agreement that was signed and bring back all the remaining 24 hostages in captivity,\" Mr Chen added.The Israeli military said on Tuesday that, following forensic tests, it had identified the four hostages whose bodies had been returned and had informed their families that their loved ones had been reburied.They were 26-year-old Israeli Guy Illouz, Bipin Joshi, a Nepalese citizen who was 23, Yossi Sharabi, a 53-year-old Israeli, and 22-year-old Daniel Peretz, an Israeli-South African dual national.",

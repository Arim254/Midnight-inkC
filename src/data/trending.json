    "body": "Nasa considers whether to bring sick crew member back to Earth7 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentNASAFront row, from left: Pilot Mike Fincke and Commander Zena Cardman. Back from left: Mission Specialists Oleg Platonov and Kimiya Yui of the Japanese space agency JAXANasa is considering an early return of some crew aboard the International Space Station (ISS) because of a medical issue involving one member of a four-strong team.The unnamed crew member is described as stable, but the incident has already led to the last-minute cancellation of a spacewalk.Mission managers are now weighing whether the safest option is to bring the entire Crew 11 team back to Earth a month ahead of schedule. Three members of another crew would remain on board.\"Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew 11's mission,\" said a Nasa spokeswoman.On Wednesday Nasa abruptly cancelled a spacewalk due for Thursday when two astronauts were set to step outside the ISS and announced that it was because one of the crew was unwell.\"The agency is monitoring a medical concern with a crew member that arose Wednesday afternoon aboard the orbital complex.\"Due to medical privacy, it is not appropriate for Nasa to share more details about the crew member,\" the space agency said.Nasa is likely to be determining whether the astronaut can safely remain in orbit or should come home early with their crewmates.\"Our top priority is the safe execution of our missions, and we are thoroughly assessing all possibilities, including the option of concluding Crew 11's mission ahead of schedule,\" the spokeswoman added.The four person Crew-11 team consists of Nasa astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan's Kimiya Yui from the JAXA space agency, and a Russian cosmonaut, Oleg Platonov. They launched to the ISS in August 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon and were expected to remain in orbit for about six months and return around late February 2026, after being replaced by another four person crew a few days earlier. If Crew 11 leave together, the other crew on board would remain: Nasa astronaut Chris Williams and two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Kud Sverchkov and Sergei Mikayev.NASAThe ISS orbits Earth at an average height of about 400 km (250 miles) above the surface. The trip back to Earth typically takes around 12–20 hours from undocking to splashdownIf the mission were to end early all four astronauts on Crew-11 would be brought home, according to Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University.\"They would all come back together as a team, because, you don't want to leave one or more team member behind.\"The ISS has basic medical equipment, supplies and communication systems that let doctors on Earth talk privately with astronauts in space, assess their condition and advise treatment, much like a secure video or phone consultation with a GP.Returning the four-person crew early would delay some experiments and maintenance tasks until the new crew arrive, according to Barber.\"The space station is a big, complex feat of engineering, it's designed to be operated by a certain minimum level of crew,\" he said.\"If Crew-11 were to return early, what the remaining crew would have to do is dial back on some of the more experimental work and focus more just on the housekeeping and keeping the station healthy, waiting for the full complement of crew to be restored.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterThe boss of Greggs said there was \"no doubt\" hugely popular appetite suppressing drugs have led to people looking for \"smaller portions\", affecting the company's bottom line.People are also looking for \"protein and fibre\", and generally healthier options, Roisin Currie said, adding the bakery has been introducing products to tap into that market.Greggs has previously said peoples' dietary changes led it to move away from its usual fare of hearty and high-fat pasties, cakes and pastries.Currie's comments come as the firm reported lacklustre profits and a muted forecast for the coming year.Currie said there was a \"broader health trend\" emerging with people demanding more protein.The bakery chain said in July it would target customers on weight loss drugs by rolling out smaller portions and protein-rich products, after which it launched its egg-pot alongside its popular \"eggs at Greggs\" ad campaign.Currie said the firm had \"to make sure that we've got some of the snack products that customers are looking for if they are on any of the GLP-1 drugs\".Several firms have said customers appetites are changing as a result of weight loss drugs.Tesco said on Thursday a trend towards healthier eating had contributed to growth in its fresh produce sales.Chief executive Ken Murphy said the group was watching customer habits \"very closely\" alongside the rise in weight loss medication and said the supermarket had a range of \"GLP-1 friendly\" products.\"Clearly our strongest source of growth this year has been in fresh food, and that is, by far and away, the best thing people can eat,\" he said. \"We also have a ... range of high protein products across a number of different categories that also work very well in that context. So I think we're well set to respond to any trends in healthier eating.\"Consumer analyst Clive Black, from Shore Capital, said the slight dip in the volume of groceries sold over Christmas compared with the year before was \"perhaps the clearest indication of the impact of glucagon-peptide (GLP) drugs upon the nation's eating habits?\"The effects of \"shrinkflation\" are also to blame for smaller portions, as firms reduce the size of a product but keep the price the same in order to manage the rising cost of ingredients.Recently, a ban came in to force across the UK banning adverts for junk foods before 9pm, which the government said was to help stem rising rates of obesity.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSimon Jack,BBC Business EditorandLucy Hooker,Business reporterGetty ImagesA climbdown on forthcoming increases to the business rates bills faced by pubs in England is set to be announced by the government in the next few days.The government is expected to say it will make changes to how pubs' business rates are calculated, resulting in smaller rises to bills.Treasury officials say they have recognised the financial difficulties facing many pubs after sharp rises in the rateable value of their premises.The move follows pressure from landlords and industry groups that included more than 1,000 pubs banning Labour MPs from their premises.The BBC understands it will apply only to pubs and not the whole hospitality sector.The Treasury is also thought to be ready to relax licensing rules to allow longer opening and more pavement areas for drinking.In her November Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves scaled back business rate discounts that have been in force since the pandemic from 75% to 40% - and announced that there would be no discount at all from April.That, combined with big upward adjustments to rateable values of pub premises, left landlords with the prospect of much higher rates bills.A campaign to dilute the impact of these rises has been gaining traction in recent weeks, with pub owners and industry groups lobbying for more support.Conversations between the government and the hospitality sector were \"ongoing\", DWP minister Dame Diana Johnson said.Speaking to Radio 4's PM programme, she said: \"We as a government want to make business rates fairer but you'll also know we're coming to the end of the transitional relief that was available because of Covid.\"On Wednesday Labour MPs called on the government to rethink its support for the industry.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"What has happened is that over Christmas Labour MPs were banned from every single pub they tried to get into... so now they are pushing for a U-turn.\"She said the Conservatives had a \"much better plan\" which was to \"slash business rates for all of the High Street, not just pubs\". She said business rates bills of less than £110,000 would be scrapped completely.Reform also welcomed the climbdown, saying \"pubs have already been lumbered with astronomical energy costs\".The party's deputy leader Richard Tice said: \"Pubs are the backbone of our communities and a huge part of British heritage. Their closures would be a cultural catastrophe as much as an economic one.\"To calculate a pub's business rate bill the rateable value of its premises is multiplied by a set figure: \"the multiplier\".The government had already offered some relief by reducing the multiplier for pubs, and may be about to reduce it further.Alternatively they could boost the £4.3bn \"transitional relief\" fund brought in to ease the impact of withdrawing support following the pandemic.Geoff RobbinsGeoff Robbins, who owns the Wheatsheaf Pub in Faringdon, Oxfordshire with his wife Jo, said it was \"a great relief\" that more help was on the way.His rates are due to rise by around 80% over the next three years. He needs a discount on most of that, he reckons, after factoring in higher gas, electricity and staffing costs.\"Rates are a tax against your business whether you make a profit or loss...  you've got to pay, there's no way round it,\" said Geoff, who got in touch with BBC Your Voice.Industry groups also welcomed news there would be additional help.Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said it was \"potentially a huge win\" for the sector.\"This could save locals, jobs, and means publicans can breathe a huge sigh of relief,\" she said.Kate Nicholls, chair of UK Hospitality, representing the industry, said the support should apply not just to pubs, but to all hospitality businesses affected by rising rates, including cafés and restaurants.\"We need a hospitality-wide solution, which is why the government should implement the maximum possible 20p discount to the multiplier for all hospitality properties,\" she said.Other sectors are calling for the support to be even broader, to include live music venues, theatres, galleries, gyms and retailers.Unpicking the recent Budget would be seen by many as another U-turn following climbdowns on winter fuel payments, disability benefits and inheritance tax on farms and family businesses.Shadow business and trade secretary Andrew Griffith said the change showed Rachel Reeves' Budget was \"falling apart\".\"Labour were wrong to attack pubs and now have been forced into another screeching U-turn,\" he said.Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: \"This is literally the last chance saloon for our treasured pubs and high streets - so the government must U-turn, today.\"These businesses are worried sick, making decisions now, and can't wait a minute longer.\"The calculation of business rates is an issue that is devolved in all four UK nations.The discount on rates during the pandemic only applied to hospitality businesses in England.Scottish businesses are waiting for the Budget there next week to hear how the  Edinburgh government will approach the issue.Pubs there will hope the Scottish government follows the UK government in offering some relief.Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell",

The spokesperson said the hotel was \"taking steps internally to strengthen our training\".The incident, which was filmed by a charity volunteer and shared on social media, happened on Monday evening.The men were later able to check-in to a Travelodge hotel in Moss Side.In the footage, the men can be heard telling the receptionist that \"it is -6 degrees outside\" adding \"they just want to get their heads down\".The staff member told the men it was \"company policy\" and not \"his personal views\". \"I'm not going to lie to you, I won't be able to check you in.

    "body": "2 hours agoAleem MaqboolReligion editorThe Church of England will take no further action in relation to a complaint about the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury's handling of an abuse case.It emerged in December that Dame Sarah Mullally had been accused in 2020 of improperly handling a complaint against a priest in London, but the allegation against her had not been properly looked into.She acknowledged last month that the complaint against her had not been dealt with correctly but said the original abuse claim had been fully handled by the Diocese of London.The complainant will be able to appeal against the Archbishop of York's decision not to further pursue the case against Dame Sarah, who is due to become the first woman to lead the Church at the end of January.Officials said in December that she had not been told about the complaint against her when it was made, and that it had not been handled properly due to \"administrative errors and an incorrect assumption about the individual's wishes\".A spokesperson from the office of the Archbishop of York said on Thursday that the Most Reverend Stephen Cottrell had \"issued his determination not to take any further action in relation to a CDM (clergy discipline measure) complaint originally filed against Bishop Sarah Mullally in 2020\".There are renewed questions about the process by which the decision was made.Andrew Graystone, an advocate for church abuse survivors and victims, said: \"No one will be surprised that the Archbishop of York has dismissed the complaint against his friend and colleague the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, given that in three weeks' time it will be her job to pass judgment on disciplinary complaints against him.\"\"The Church needs to rebuild the trust of survivors - and of the public - from a very low base.\"The idea the bishops can only be judged by other bishops does nothing to help this.\"Dame Sarah is due to be officially confirmed as the most senior member of clergy in the Church of England at the end of January.She was named as the next archbishop in October and will replace Justin Welby, who stepped down in 2025 after a damning report accused him of significant failures in relation to a prolific child abuser.Cottrell has taken on most of Welby's responsibilities in the interim, but has himself faced calls to step down over his handling of another abuse case.Graystone said of Thursday's decision: \"Survivors of abuse in the Church of England aren't likely to have any confidence that they will be treated justly, given the incestuous complaints processes of the Church of England.\"The Church has long insisted that processes in relation to safeguarding have become better in recent years and will improve further as it looks to bring in independent safeguarding officers.  But late last year the Charity Commission said the Church was taking too long to implement the measures it had promised to help better deal with abuse.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterGetty ImagesCouncils across England are to be given more extensive powers to fine motorists who cause disruption by parking on the pavement.The new powers are due to take effect later this year, alongside guidance on how the rules can be enforced in a \"proportionate\" way.Pavement parking is currently banned outright in London and Scotland, with councils elsewhere in England able to introduce restrictions for specific streets.The government says wider enforcement powers will make it easier for local authorities to tackle the worst examples of disruptive parking. Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood said \"problem\" pavement parking was causing issues for blind people, parents with pushchairs and those in wheelchairs, adding clear pavements were \"essential for people to move around safely\".Currently, police officers can fine those who cause obstruction or leave their vehicle in a dangerous position.But council enforcement officers can only fine pavement parkers who breach an on-road rule, such as parking restrictions or double yellow lines. There are separate rules for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs).The government argues councils' ability to restrict pavement parking on specific streets is not a \"practical tool for widespread enforcement\" due to the requirement to consult local residents beforehand and put up special signs.In a policy document published on Thursday, the transport department said that it plans to give councils new powers to issue fines to those who cause \"unnecessary obstruction\" when parking on the pavement.It said the new legal powers would be delivered \"in due course\" and would not require \"additional traffic signage\".Meanwhile, work towards wider legislation for a new set of national, locally-applied rules is being carried out by officials.'Years of inaction'The document did not specify how \"unnecessary obstruction\" would be defined - instead saying it would be at the discretion of council enforcement officers.It added that there may be roads where some parking on the pavement is necessary to allow emergency vehicles to pass through.Labour ministers argued this approach would mean local councils could shape policies in their areas, including on possible exemptions.A government consultation found respondents were split on a proposed 20-minute exemption for vehicles making deliveries to businesses.Some respondents felt councils would be unable to properly enforce the rules but \"many would see it as a licence for councils to print money\", the document noted. The previous Conservative government consulted on pavement parking in 2020, but no new powers were announced before Labour took office in 2024.Living Streets, a charity that promotes everyday walking, said the new powers would allow \"some quick progress after years of inaction\" on the issue, but it was disappointed the announcement fell short of a national ban.It added that enforcement at the council level would create \"inconsistency for communities and drivers, which increases risks for everyone using our streets\".

    "body": "Tournament chiefs admit errors over viral wildcard Image source, ITFImage caption, Hajar Abdelkader's biography on the ITF website says she started playing tennis at the age of 14ByStewart MacleanBBC News, in NairobiUpdated 3 hours agoThe organisers of a professional women's tournament which has gone viral on social media because of a wildcard player's dire performance have acknowledged she should not have been allowed to play.Egyptian Hajar Abdelkader, 21, lost 6-0 6-0 and served 20 double faults during the first-round match in Nairobi on Wednesday, with the footage leaving many viewers wondering if she had ever played tennis before.The amateur player won only three points during her 37-minute debut - two double faults by opponent Lorena Schaedel and an unforced error from the bemused German, ranked 1,026th in the world.The match was part of an International Tennis Federation (ITF) W35 tournament, hosted by Tennis Kenya, the governing body for the sport in Kenya.Tennis Kenya said it had reached out to both Abdelkader and Schaedel to offer its support \"given the extent and nature of coverage of this match\". Tennis Kenya said Abdelkader had applied to enter the tournament as a wildcard and had been given a space at the last minute following the withdrawal of another player.The organisation said she was permitted to enter to maintain a balance of players and nations represented in the tournament, but said that in hindsight she should not have been allowed to play.\"The federation has taken note of this experience and will ensure that such an extremely rare occurrence never happens again,\" the organisation added. \"Tennis Kenya remains committed to fairness, transparency and the integrity of competition, as well as to the continued development of tennis in Kenya, East Africa, and across Africa.\" The Egyptian Tennis Federation confirmed to the BBC Abdelkader has never been registered as an Egyptian player and had not been entered into the tournament on Egypt's behalf.Egyptian Tennis Federation technical director Dia Nabil Loutfy said: \"We would like to clarify that she is not registered with the Egyptian Tennis Federation, nor is she included in any of our official player lists.\"Based on the information available to us, the player was previously residing in Kenya and participated in the ITF tournament in Nairobi through a wildcard granted by the Kenyan Tennis Federation.\"The Egyptian Tennis Federation had no role whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly, in the nomination, approval, or issuance of this wildcard, and we were not involved in the player's entry into the tournament in any capacity.\"The organisation said it had no records relating to Abdelkader, and said she had never been affiliated with the Egyptian Tennis Federation.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSanchia BergBBC NewsPA MediaHarry (left) and Roman (right) were abandoned as newborns years before ElsaA girl who was found abandoned as a newborn in a carrier bag in east London is to be adopted and will have regular contact with her two siblings as she grows up, a family court has heard.\"Elsa\" was left near a footpath in Newham on 18 January 2024, before being discovered by a dog walker. Subsequent DNA tests established she was the sibling of two other babies - a boy and a girl - each found nearby in similar circumstances in 2017 and 2019.Police say all enquiries to find the parents of the abandoned babies have now been \"exhausted\".On Thursday, East London Family Court heard Elsa was thriving, that she was already living with her new family, and has a loving relationship with them.All their adoptive parents have agreed that Elsa who is now nearly two, brother Harry, 8 and sister Roman, 6 should have regular meetings as they grow up. The children will see photos of each other, and have playdates twice a year.Judge Carol Atkinson said Elsa's story was \"extraordinary\" and it was \"fundamental to her existence that she shares that story with two full siblings\". She said she had seen photos of Elsa, who was a \"beautiful little girl\" - \"a raucous bundle of excitement and laughter\".The judge said had been told Elsa \"lights up the space around her\", adding that the three children's shared story was exceptional. Over ten years, between 2008–2018, only eight children were recorded as \"foundlings\" - those abandoned at birth - in England and Wales.She said the siblings shared something \"extraordinary\", adding: \"No-one they will meet in life is likely to understand what it is like to be a foundling. But they each know and understand.\"The three babies were all found near the Greenway in east LondonThe BBC has been following the hearings about baby Elsa for nearly two years.Elsa was left in a Boots shopping bag in January 2024, when she was less than an hour old.She was found on the coldest night of the year, so hospital staff named her after the character in the Disney film Frozen. In June 2024, the BBC revealed she was the third child abandoned by the same mother and father. Her name and those of her siblings have now been changed.After widespread media coverage, police stepped up their enquiries to find her parents.Working with the National Crime Agency, officers identified several hundred houses where they believed babies' parents might have been living. They knocked on more than 100 doors, spoke to local residents and took DNA samples.They also used the babies' DNA to try to identify relatives right across the UK, who they traced and spoke to.But despite these efforts, police have said the parents have still not been found.Det Supt Lewis Basford said enquiries were \"exhausted\" but officers would \"continue to review all information and intelligence made available to us\".He urged anyone who \"may be sitting on information\" to contact the police.PABaby Elsa was found inside a Boots bag on the Greenway, in Newham, east LondonProf Lorraine Sherr, a psychologist who has studied abandoned children, said Thursday's hearing was a \"turning point\" for Elsa. She said she now had a stable and permanent home, and the \"rare\" possibility of early and regular contact with her siblings.Sherr said the case marked a \"true precedent\" - that the courts, families, police and social services came together to support the child's best interests. She added that the \"intense public and media coverage ensured that processes worked smoothly\".",

I'll just be walking with them and cracking jokes with them, not even knowing God kept me in the presence of great men.\"100% it's tough for me, but I know it's even tougher for their parents. I have a strong mind, and I believe God knows their hearts. May God have mercy on my brothers.''Ghami was Joshua's full-time sport and exercise rehabilitation coach and worked with him for more than 10 years.Hours before the crash, Joshua posted a video on Instagram of him playing table tennis with his long-time friend Ayodele, a personal trainer.On Sunday, Joshua posted two pictures on Instagram, one showing him sitting alongside his mother and family members of the victims including the mothers of Ghami and Ayodele, and one with him holding a photograph of Ghami.Driver Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, 46, was charged at Sagamu Magistrates' Court on Friday. Police sources told the BBC the charges included causing death by dangerous driving.The defendant was granted bail of 5m naira (£2,578) and remanded pending his bail conditions being met. The case has been adjourned until 20 January.Joshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town in Ogun state, near the crash site.The 2012 Olympic champion was on his way to visit relatives for new year celebrations in the town at the time of the collision, a family member told the BBC.The boxer had been spending time in Nigeria after his recent victory over American YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul on 19 December.On Thursday, UFC fighter Kamaru Usman apologised after footage of his private video call with Joshua in hospital circulated online, saying he \"takes full responsibility\" for posting the clip on YouTube without properly checking the full video.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterPASinger and recent Celebrity Traitors finalist Cat Burns has celebrated the start of her \"new life\" following breast reduction surgery.Burns, 25, posted online to say she had undergone surgery after years of discomfort.She wrote that \"the amount of relief and happiness\" she was now feeling was \"overwhelming\", having struggled with her body since she was 12 years old.Sharing the news via her Instagram story - alongside a picture of her in a hospital bed - the performer revealed she \"had a big fat cry\" once she saw her mum, sister and girlfriend.'Pain when exercising'\"I've always struggled with my boobies since they arrived on my chest at like 12, they caused me so much pain when exercising and I deeply hated the oversexualisation it brought,\" she explained.\"I tried so many different ways to work with my body and wear different bras etc but I thought while I'm young and healthy and by the universe's grace [I] am able to go through with this surgery, I want to love my body going into the next part of my life!\"The Londoner released her second album, How To Be Human, in October, peaking at number five in the charts.It dropped less than a week before she was banished in the final of the celebrity edition of the popular BBC reality gameshow Traitors, which was ultimately won by her fellow Traitor, comedian Alan Carr.She confirmed she was feeling \"OK\" after her operation, which she noted had gone \"really well\".\"Today marks the start of my new life!\"Breast reduction surgeryBreast reduction surgery might be available to those suffering health problems, if other options such as wearing professionally fitted bras have not worked.According to the NHS website, problems caused by having very large breasts include:Back, shoulder or neck painSkin irritation under the breastsGrooves on the shoulders from bra strapsLow self-esteem or depressionNot being able to take part in sport or exerciseBut some women have been unable to get the operation, for reasons including their body mass index (BMI) being too high.Last month, Gill Baird, owner of Cosmedicare and founder of St Ellens' Hospitals, told BBC Scotland: \"There are thousands of people waiting for surgery from before Covid and the NHS are only seeing the most extreme cases just now.\"Figures from the the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) have stated that for 2023 to 2024, breast reduction was the second-most common surgical procedure, after breast augmentation. Getty ImagesEngland rugby union player Rosie Galligan is another star to have spoken openly about her \"boob journey\"Burns is not the first famous person to speak publicly about the benefits of the procedure.In 2024, England rugby union player Rosie Galligan told BBC Sport: \"If I didn't have my reduction, I don't think I'd be where I am today. Both on a confidence and physical level.\"She added: \"Having the reduction is definitely one of the best things that's happened for my sporting career and it's definitely helped me get to where I am today,\" she said.\"I've embraced my boob journey, it's something that's now part of my sporting journey.\"'Over sexualised'US chat show host and actress Drew Barrymore last year mentioned on her own show that she was glad to have had a breast reduction as a teenager.\"I really love my body and the way it is right now,\" she said. \"There's something very awkward about women and their breasts because men look at them so much.\"When they're huge, you become very self-conscious. Your back hurts. You find that whatever you wear, you look heavy in. It's uncomfortable.\"In an interview with Glamour in 2015, Modern Family actress Ariel Winter said that before her operation: \"It started to hurt so bad that I couldn't take the pain.\"It wasn't only physical pain that she was referring to, but objectification too.\"It made me feel really uncomfortable because as women in the industry, we are totally over sexualised and treated like objects,\" she continued.\"Every article that has to do with me on a red carpet always had to do with, 'Ariel Winter's crazy cleavage!', or, 'Ariel Winter shows huge boobs at an event!'. That's all people would recognise me by, not, 'oh, she does great work on Modern Family'.\"Additional reporting by Kate Moore.",

    "body": "18 hours agoEmily HoltBBCKristina and Laura have written a book titled 'All the Cool Girls Get Fired' about their experiences. The new year is a natural time to reflect, and for many of us, that involves thinking about our careers. Kristina O'Neill and Laura Brown are both editors who lost their jobs after restructures, and they initially thought it was the end of the world.\"I poured my heart into the role... I believed in the values we promoted. Yet, when it came to me, those values weren't there,\" says Laura. They both chose to use the word fired after they lost their roles and say being open about it can help you deal with what's happened.\"There are so many euphemisms that we all use for losing our jobs. But the faster you own it, the faster you're honest about it, the faster you can move on.\"That's the fast track to whatever you want to do next,\" adds Laura.Now, they are thriving in new jobs, with Laura owning her own media company and Kristina editor in chief for Sotheby's magazine. If you've lost your job or are simply looking for a new career, here are four ways to help.1. Reflect on the past year Getty ImagesIt's natural to feel a bit low about work if  you've had a break over the festive period.Sarah Ellis, co-founder of careers website, Squiggly Careers and Amazing If, says it is important to reflect on the past year before diving into a new job search. She encourages people to think about what they want to do more or less of, and what inspires or drains their energy. Looking back through your successes to find common themes can help too. \"Try not to just look at the last month, because we all have a bit of recency bias that can get in the way,\" she adds.Laura says it is also important to decide where your work sits in your life.  This involves being honest about how much time you're working and its impact on your social and family life.After losing her role, she advises not letting your life be defined by your work.2. Take small steps Getty ImagesSarah says people can make small steps towards a career change without diving in head first. She took seven years to make the jump from her corporate career to running her own company full time, working on her project alongside her job, which meant she could pay herself from the start. \"It took a bit longer, but that was how I did it in a sustainable way\", she says. Sarah recommends a \"try before you buy\" approach.This could be volunteer work, getting involved in a work project that interests you, or saying yes to something different within your existing team.\"Worst case scenario, you don't like that area, but it's better to know now than to know when you've made the move,\" she says. Sarah also encourages looking into small \"bridging roles\". These may not be ideal, but serve as a step in the right direction, such as a role which has similarities to the career you want, but not in the exact industry.\"It's giving yourself space to say this is good for now, but that isn't the same as forever.\"That can be a really smart strategy for getting much closer to that career change.\"3. Remember your achievementsGetty ImagesIf you've recently lost your job, you aren't alone - redundancies have surged to their highest rate since 2021, official figures indicate.Laura was editor in chief of a style magazine, but in 2022 she and her team were laid off after her firm closed the print version of the magazine.  Understanding this did not mean she wasn't good at her job helped her process the change. \"What you've learned doesn't go away because you lost your job.\"Don't give your power up, it's important for everybody to remember their own value.\"Kristina was fired after a 10-year spell at a financial magazine after a regime change at the top and the arrival of a new editor. She stresses that so much of the shame of being fired is \"in your head\". \"In the US, especially hundreds of thousands of people being laid off, it's not personal. It's likely very much not you, so don't take that ball of shame and carry it around.\"4. Create a career check-list Getty ImagesIf you're desperately looking for work or utterly miserable in your current role, it can be tempting to dive straight into applying for any job - ignoring personal happiness. But Sarah says this is a big mistake.Instead, she suggests an exercise called \"scanning\" - narrowing your search down to job descriptions that sound interesting to you.She recommends going through websites like LinkedIn, and gathering around 10 to 15 that you like the look of.  \"What are the words that keep coming up?\" she says. \"Because [these] will give you some clues as to the things that matter most to you.Through this, you can create your own career check list, and avoid wasting time on ill-fitting applications.Laura stresses it's also important to think about what has made you happy and unhappy over the course of your career. \"It may not be what you can do all the time, but it could be something that's lit up in you, that you've forgotten,\" she says.

    "body": "4 hours agoTiffany WertheimerRenee Nicole GoodRenee Nicole Good was an award-winning poetThe woman shot dead by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who had just moved to the city.She was a prize-winning poet and a hobby guitarist, who city leaders have said was there as a legal observer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death has sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"probably terrified\" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot and that she was \"one of the kindest people I've ever known\".\"She was extremely compassionate,\" Ganger told the daily newspaper. \"She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"Her father, Tim Ganger, told the Washington Post that \"she had a good life, but a hard life\".A fundraiser for Good's family, which was set up with a target of $50,000 (£37,000), raised more than $500,000 in 15 hours.In what appears to be Good's Instagram account, which has now been made private, Good described herself as a \"poet and writer and wife and mom\", who was \"experiencing Minneapolis\".A US citizen, Good was originally from Colorado Springs and had moved to Minneapolis just last year from Kansas City.The Minnesota Star Tribune reports that she used to host a podcast with her second husband, Tim Macklin, who died in 2023. They had a son together, who is now six years old, Macklin's father told the newspaper. She had two other children with her first husband, who spoke to US media on condition that his name was not used. He said that Good was not an activist and that she was a devoted Christian who went to Northern Ireland on youth missions when she was younger.She had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union, but had mainly been a stay-at-home mum in recent years, according to the Associated Press.Getty ImagesPeople have left flowers, candles and messages at a make-shift memorial for Good in MinneapolisGood studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, and in 2020 she won an undergraduate prize from the Academy of American Poets for her piece entitled On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs.\"When she is not writing, reading, or talking about writing, she has movie marathons and makes messy art with her daughter and two sons,\" her biography from the prize reads, as quoted in US media. It seems to have now been removed.Good graduated the same year from the university's College of Arts and Letters with a degree in English.Its president said in a statement that her sudden death was \"yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation\".\"May Renee's life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,\" Old Dominion University president Brian Hemphill wrote.How the ICE shooting in Minneapolis unfolded second-by-secondSeveral state leaders have said that Good was at the scene of an ICE raid in the south of Minneapolis as a legal observer - a volunteer who monitors police and security forces at protests and operations. Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"not part of anything\" that involved challenging ICE agents.But White House officials, including the president, have said Good was not simply observing, but also interfering in the officers' work.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had been \"stalking and impeding their work\" all day by \"blocking them in\" with her car and \"shouting at them\".Good \"weaponised her vehicle\", Noem told reporters, and then tried to run over one of the officers \"in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism\".The ICE agent feared for his life, Noem said, and \"fired defensive shots\".This account was backed up by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social that \"the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting\".He called her a \"professional agitator\" who \"violently, willfully, and viciously\" ran over an ICE officer.But the city's mayor said the agent who shot Good had acted recklessly.\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bullshit,\" Jacob Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"Good reportedly lived just a few blocks from where she was killed, and the scene is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.",

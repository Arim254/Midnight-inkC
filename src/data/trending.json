    "body": "When does a 147 become a 180?When you're Ronnie O'Sullivan, making more history. That's when.In a year when snooker's maximum break, once considered as suppositious as the Himalayan Yeti, has repeatedly shown up for the cameras, it fell to O'Sullivan to show that nobody does it better.When he sank his second maximum in barely two hours at the Saudi Arabia Masters in August, O'Sullivan secured a record £180,333 in bonuses.As his 50th birthday arrives in December, O'Sullivan retains an audacious streak that sets him apart. Nearly three decades after his famous five-minute 147 at the Crucible, he remains pure box office.But O'Sullivan, who begins his bid for a record-extending ninth title on Tuesday, is not alone in knowing the route to a maximum. There have been an eye-watering 25 already on the professional tour in 2025, obliterating the calendar year best of 14 - 2024's tally.Chang Bingyu's 147 in November came in a UK Championship qualifier in Wigan. It took the tour's 2025-26 season total to a record 16 - the campaign began in late June and runs until May.England's Shaun Murphy has made two maximums in 2025 - timeless brilliance from the 2005 world champion and this year's Masters winner.Ireland's Aaron Hill has also had two 147s in 2025, and if you're thinking \"who's Aaron Hill?\", you're probably not alone.He's the world number 43, but he's had wins against Judd Trump and O'Sullivan. Remember the name.BBC Sport has spoken to Murphy and Hill about this rush of maximums.So what's happening, given the recipe - 15 reds and blacks followed by the colours in order - remains untouched?And what next, if the code to snooker's one-time final frontier has been cracked?\"You can imagine Moira Stuart in 1983 coming on the Six O'Clock News and telling the nation Cliff Thorburn's had a 147 at the Crucible. It would now get missed because it's just like, 'oh, there's been another 147'.\"That's the verdict of Murphy, fourth on the all-time list with 10 maximums.He is not wrong. Thorburn's maximum was a defining moment for 1983's armchair sports fan, alongside Steve Cram and Daley Thompson winning World Athletics Championship golds in Helsinki.It was only the second official maximum, Steve Davis making the first at the Lada Classic in Oldham 15 months earlier. Davis' reward? One of the sponsor's cars.There were just eight 147s across the 1980s, a snooker decade bursting with soap opera drama and towering characters.For sheer quality, nothing touches the current era.One long-time Crucible spectator, who also attended World Championship qualifiers at Stockport in the early 1980s, recently said of the latter: \"You were lucky if you saw a fifty break all day. People think it was the glory days, but the standard was terrible.\"At the World Championship qualifiers this year, Wales' Jackson Page became the first player to have two 147s in the same tour match.Page did not reach the Crucible but earned £167,000 in bonuses and £15,000 for reaching the final qualifying round - total earnings just £18,000 short of Mark Williams' prize as the tournament's runner-up.\"Players are chasing their career records and the tour are putting incentives out there,\" says Murphy.\"People are more aware of these challenges. They're practising for them.\"Alex Higgins never had a maximum break on tour. Nor did fellow world champions Terry Griffiths, Dennis Taylor, Joe Johnson, John Spencer and Ray Reardon.Davis was one and out.Yet Hill made two inside four weeks. The 23-year-old from Cork cannot believe Higgins never had a maximum.But Hill says: \"There will be a lot of players who haven't had one. It was always a goal to have my name on the board of those who have. The buzz is great.\"Everyone on the tour now could make one. We're almost expecting one in every tournament. It's everyone egging each other on.\"Is Hill pleasingly rich now? Not quite.His maximums came at September's English Open and October's Xi'an Grand Prix, events with £5,000 high-break prizes and no bonuses. Rubbing it in, there were other maximums, so the money was shared with Ali Carter at the English Open and split three ways in China.Is there a 147 society on tour? A WhatsApp group unlocked by a first maximum?\"There won't be anything like that. Players aren't that friendly!\" Hill says.I think if there is a knack to it, it's seeing it early, like with a 59 in golf when you make a few birdies in the first few holes and think 'I'm on for something good here'.If you come to the table early and take a couple of reds and couple of blacks, and you see the black's available to both pockets and the reds aren't on cushions, we all think 'hang on a minute, there's a 147 on here'.I've always been proud of the one I made in the Shoot Out a couple of seasons ago because I tried to make it from the very first pot.To have the personal challenge of 'let's see how far down the 147 journey you can get', and then get it in the cauldron of the Shoot Out, was pretty special.I think I'd had three or four double gin and tonics - that had something to do with it. It's not quite as serious as some events and the hospitality was being well used.When you're on a maximum, everyone in the room knows it and it heightens their attention.Everyone's focus zooms in on you. When I made one at the Masters this year at Ally Pally the whole room went silent.Are maximums losing their magic? I don't think so.Snooker awaits its first official maximum by a woman. China's Bai Yulu had a 145 at the recent International Championship.Two 147s in the same match has been achieved. Two in successive frames next?The 155 (a 147 plus eight points from a free-ball scenario, external at the start of a frame) has never been achieved in competition. Footage exists of Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh making one in practice.The 167 is \"probably the next step\", says Murphy. At the Riyadh Season Championship, a player must follow a 147 with a 20-point golden ball to earn $1m (£760,000), snooker's biggest prize.Ronnie O'Sullivan, he's coming for you...Murphy suggests the surge of maximums is easily explained.\"I just think everyone's getting better,\" he says. \"Some of the players down the rankings that the general public have never heard of, on their day they can beat anyone.\"World Snooker Tour points to improving \"quality and consistency of playing conditions\", crediting table-fitting teams and suppliers.The players are the ones sinking the balls though.Hill has two maximums. O'Sullivan holds the record of 17.Watch out Ronnie, he's coming for you.It is said in jest, but Hill fancies the chase.\"At the end of my career, I believe I'll be well up there with maximum breaks,\" he says.At the very least - and Murphy is the same - Hill will go about his daily business with the thought in the back of his mind that the next frame is rich in promise.Sink the red, add the black. Rinse and repeat.",

    "body": "3 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesAn Italian mayor has apologised to the family of opera star Luciano Pavarotti after the town of Pesaro encased a statue honouring the late singer within a Christmas ice rink. The singer's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani, told local media that she was \"angry and upset\" at what she called the decision to \"ridicule\" her late husband. The temporary ice rink was constructed in the centre of the town's piazza, leaving Pavrotti's statue knee-deep in ice and surrounded by perspex walls. In response, Biancini said that he didn't mean to offend anyone, and admitted that his council had \"made a mistake\".Before it was opened on 29 November, Mayor Andrea Biancani posted a doctored image of Pavarotti's statue playing ice hockey with the hashtag #DaiUnCinqueAPavarotti, which translates to \"Give a high-five to Pavarotti\".\"I didn't expect a town would allow this treatment of the memory and the image of a person who made Italy great around the world,\" Ms Mantovani told local outlet Il Resto del Carlino. She accused the council of making a \"poorly executed, absurd decision\". The life-size bronze statue was officially unveiled in Pesaro in April 2024, with Ms Mantovani and the couple's daughter, Alice, in attendance. The couple often holidayed in Pesaro, where Pavarotti had a villa and was an honorary citizen.Biancini told Il Resto del Carlino, which nicknamed the incident \"Pavarotti on Ice\", that when plans for the ice rink were initially presented to him, he was assured that the Pavarotti statue would not be touched and that it was only later that he found out designers had been forced to alter their construction. He said it would not be possible to dismantle the rink or move the statue at this late stage, but insisted that it would \"not happen again\".Pavarotti was an Italian tenor, and is widely known as one of the most successful opera stars of all time.His performances in the Three Tenors concerts were seen around the world, and his rendition of Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot, which he performed at the 1990 football World Cup in Italy.His final performance was at the opening of the Winter Olympics in Turin in February 2006.He died the following year at the age of 71, after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Pavarotti left behind four daughters from his two marriages. Ms Mantovani was his second wife. She remarried, to financial advisor Alberto Tinarelli, in 2020. ",

    "body": "16 hours agoEsyllt CarrBusiness reporterPolice officers investigating the Post Office Horizon IT scandal are now considering corporate manslaughter charges.In an update, shared with victims in the past few days, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said the investigation was currently focused on eight suspects, with five interviews conducted under caution.It said there were now 53 persons of interest, most of whom were likely to be raised to suspect status at a later stage in the probe.The NPCC said the investigation remains focussed on offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice, but it was also considering charges of corporate manslaughter. Companies, rather than individuals, face such charges.The Horizon IT system, which began operating in 1999, falsely created shortfalls in Post Office branches for which sub-postmasters were held liable.The scandal has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.More than 900 people were prosecuted and some went to prison. Some died while waiting for justice.The criminal investigation into the scandal, Operation Olympos, began in 2020. A year ago, a team of about 100 officers was launched in four regional hubs, scaling up its activity after the end of the public phase of the inquiry into the scandal.Officers are now appealing to any former sub-postmasters who may have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the Post Office to come forward, after it was confirmed that the NDAs would no longer be enforced.The NPCC said: \"The primary and sole focus remains the offences of Perverting the Course of Justice and Perjury and this has not changed.\"However, as was done with fraud offences previously, advice is being sought from the CPS around the offences of Corporate and Gross Negligent manslaughter.\"The chair of the public inquiry, Sir Wyn Williams, published the first part of his final report on 8 July and the second volume is expected next year.The police officer leading the investigation previously told the BBC that any criminal trials may not take place before 2028.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterandNick Eardley,Political correspondentThe UK government has criticised delays in aid being allowed into Gaza after a consignment of more than 1,100 tents it sent to the strip took more than a year to arrive.The foreign secretary has also raised concerns that other UK-funded aid had been unable to reach residents, despite the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.Yvette Cooper said the situation in Gaza remains \"dire\" as the United Nations warned that 1.5 million people are in need of urgent shelter amid worsening rains and plummeting temperatures ahead of winter.The BBC has asked the Israeli government for a response.The tents - each capable of housing a family of five - reached Gaza on Monday, with more expected to arrive this week.Government sources said the tents will provide shelter to as many as 12,000 people over the winter months.Cooper said the delay in getting aid into the strip could not be allowed to continue  and that all crossings into the territory should be opened to allow unhindered humanitarian access. She said: \"The situation in Gaza remains dire, with worsening weather conditions compounding the critical issues caused by damaged infrastructure and over two years of conflict. \"Parents have been trying to shelter their children under broken roofs and open skies. \"These tents will provide a lifeline to thousands of people needing shelter, protecting them from the cold winds and relentless rain turning rubble into mud.\"About 1.9 million people in Gaza, nearly 90% of the population, have been displaced since the Israel-Hamas conflict began in October 2023, according to the UN.Cooper said the arrival of the aid was welcome but only a step towards the major reconstruction that is \"badly needed\" and she was frustrated to see \"yet another consignment of aid stuck at the border\" earlier this year.\"This cannot be allowed to continue,\" she said. \"The arrival of these tents shows the scale of potential impact when our aid gets in, and we will continue to do all we can to urge unhindered humanitarian access, the opening of all the crossings, the implementation of the peace plan, and a path to peace.\"Unicef Special Representative to the State of Palestine Jonathan Veitch said the arrival of the tents \"represents months of ongoing work by the international community to push for greater aid access\".\"The situation in Gaza is devastating as cold, and heavy rains continue to affect families living in extremely difficult conditions. \"Even with the ceasefire, daily life remains incredibly challenging for children in the Gaza Strip. \"UK aid–supported tents have now entered Gaza and will provide urgently needed shelter to help families face the harsh winter. Much more is needed.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesFast-fashion giants Shein and Temu are facing increased pressure in the US after two senior politicians pushed for investigations, including into claims of forced labour and intellectual property theft. In Texas, the state's Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a probe into Shein, mirroring similar moves targeting the firm in several European countries. At a national level, Senator Tom Cotton called for a federal investigation into Shein and Temu, which he labelled \"Communist Chinese\" platforms and accused them of intellectual property theft that has \"devastated\" US firms. Shein said it took concerns raised about its business practices seriously. The BBC has also contacted Temu for comment.\"We welcome constructive engagement with Attorney General Paxton,\" Shein said in a statement, adding that it will cooperate with the investigation. The company did not refer directly to Cotton's calls for a national probe. The retailer is headquartered in Singapore but most of the goods sold on its platform are made in China, where it was founded.In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday, Cotton - senior Republican from Arkansas - said that millions of packages from China now sit in US warehouses after Washington changed its rules on low-cost shipments in August.US President Donald Trump abolished the longstanding de minimis rule, a global tariff exemption widely used by buyers of low-cost goods.The change subjected shipments to levies and stricter customs checks.The new regulations gives the Department of Justice and Homeland Security a \"golden opportunity\" to act, said Cotton, a key ally of Trump and a vocal critic of China.Designers and small American brands have accused Shein of systematically copying their original creations, often just days after launch, and selling them at a fraction of the price, he said.Cotton also accused Temu of carrying \"sophisticated and deceptive fakes\" on its platform, which has hundreds of millions of users.He cited a US investigation which found a significant proportion of items that its researchers bought on Shein and Temu were likely counterfeits.Separately, Paxton from Texas said that numerous reports have raised serious concerns about Shein's alleged reliance on forced labour, and claims of the use of unsafe materials and deceptive marketing.The brand has been under scrutiny over the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business and the working conditions of the people who make the products on its site.The Republican lawyer said the investigation will assess if Shein's practices violate Texas law by allegedly using hazardous materials and if it has misled consumers about ethical sourcing. The probe will also examine Shein's data collection practices, he added.\"I will not allow cheap, dangerous, foreign goods to flood America and jeopardise our health,\" said Paxton online.Shein also faces calls by the European Union to curb sales of childlike sex dolls and weapons on its third-party marketplace place after French authorities flagged the products in November.Temu is also being investigated in France over the spread of harmful content accessible to young people.Shein is not the only firm under fire by Paxton, who, like Cotton, is a close ally of US President Donald Trump. He sued Roblox in November for \"flagrantly ignoring\" safety laws and deceiving parents about the dangers that the platform is said to pose to young gamers.Roblox has denied the claims, which it said are based on \"misrepresentations\" of its online gaming platform.",

    "body": "2 hours agoYvette TanVideo shows speed fire spread in Hong Kong high-riseHong Kong's leader John Lee has ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of a devastating fire that killed at least 151 people.Last Wednesday, seven of eight tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex - which had been undergoing extensive renovations - went up in flames. Investigators have since found that a protective netting used around the buildings failed to meet flame retardant standards. At least 13 people have been arrested for suspected manslaughter, including the directors of a construction company. The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years and the death toll could rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.Chief Executive Lee said that the committee would be led by a judge and would conduct \"comprehensive reform\", adding that he would work to \"prevent similar tragedies from occuring in the future\". Asked at a news conference why he should keep his job, Mr Lee acknowledged that reform was needed but failed to directly address the question. \"Yes, it is a tragedy, it is a big fire. Yes, we need reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plucked,\" he said. The fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.Getty ImagesThe fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 yearsSeparately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry into the fire. An online petition gathered more than 10,000 signatures in less than a day before its contents were wiped.Two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police, according to local media reports.Asked about this on Tuesday, Lee did not address the question directly but said that \"criminals that commit offences must be taken to justice\". \"I emphasise I will not tolerate any crimes, particularly crimes that exploit the tragedy that we are facing now.\"Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticised the reported arrests.\"Now is the time for the Hong Kong authorities to transparently investigate the causes of the devastating fire...rather than silencing those who ask legitimate questions,\" Amnesty International said.Getty ImagesChief executive John Lee said that the committee would be led by a judgeWang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse. The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died.",

    "body": "White House doctor releases Trump's 'perfectly normal' MRI results6 hours agoNardine SaadGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump \"remains in excellent overall health\" after undergoing a  \"comprehensive executive physical\", according to his White House physician.Captain Sean Barbabella released a memo on Monday that said advanced imaging of the 79-year-old president's heart and abdomen came back \"perfectly normal\". He wrote the president underwent the MRI during a physical in October \"because men of his age group benefit from thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health\".The release comes as Democrats, including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, have been pushing for the results of the scan amid concerns about Trump's age in his second term.In his memo, Barbabella wrote that there was no evidence of arterial narrowing impairing blood flow or abnormalities in Trump's heart or major vessels. The doctor added that overall, Trump's cardiovascular system \"shows excellent health\".Likewise, the doctor, a US Navy emergency physician who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said results of Trump's abdominal imaging showed that \"everything evaluated is functioning within normal limits with no acute or chronic concerns\".The doctor called the scan \"standard\" for an \"executive physical\" for someone at Trump's age. The White House had previously declined to explain why Trump had an MRI during a physical exam in October or say what part of his body was scanned. Riding aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump told reporters that it was \"OK with me\" to release the results of the MRI. When pressed by a reporter about which body part the MRI examined, Trump said: \"I have no idea. It was just an MRI - what part of the body? It wasn't the brain, because I took a cognitive test and I aced it.\"Trump underwent his annual physical screening in April. In October, he said that he received an MRI at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center during a visit the White House said was part of his \"routine yearly checkup\".Trump said at the time that the MRI \"was perfect\".In the memo, Barbabella said the purpose of the MRI was preventative, \"to identify issues early, confirm overall health, and ensure he maintains long-term vitality and function\".White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read Barbabella's memo during a news briefing on Monday.\"I think that's quite a bit of detail in the effort of transparency,\" Leavitt said. \"The president promised it last night and we have it delivered today.\"Two outside physicians who reviewed the memo told the BBC that MRIs were \"not typically standard\" for preventive care.But some people do opt for testing which is outside standard age-based guidelines, says Dr Carla Perissinotto, a geriatrics specialist at the University of California San Francisco.Likewise,  Dr Jeffrey A Linder, chief of general internal medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, says the memo does not specify whether an MRI or CT scan was performed, making it difficult to know exactly what was done.Linder says routine anatomical imaging - whether MRI or CT - is generally discouraged in asymptomatic patients because potential risks outweigh the benefits.And even for executive physicals - which cater to busy professionals and include a host of additional tests - he says it is still uncommon for that imaging to come back \"perfectly normal\" with no coronary calcification.Trump has been seen with swollen ankles and bruising on his right hand and has been spotted dozing off during meetings.In July, the White House said that he had  been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a vein condition that can result in swelling in the legs.",

    "body": "Jury trial reforms set to be announced7 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentBBCThe jury box at Court One of the Old BaileyThe government is set to announce plans to restrict the right to a jury trial in England and Wales in an attempt to turn around unprecedented backlogs and delays in justice.David Lammy, the deputy prime minister and justice secretary, will lay out the proposals in Parliament later on Tuesday.Last week his final \"decision\", contained in a document circulated around government, was leaked to the BBC and The Times.It is not clear if that plan - which would end jury trials other than for most serious cases including murder - has been approved by Cabinet or retreated from.The proposals to cut jury trials are based on recommendations from a senior retired judge, who advised ministers that the reform would help tackle delays.There are currently 78,000 cases waiting to be completed in Crown Courts. In practice, this means that some suspects being charged with serious crimes today may not have a trial until late 2029 or early 2030. Officials predict the caseload will grow to more than 100,000 before then, unless there is further action.Last week's leak of an internal government briefing showed final Ministry of Justice plans to create new forms of jury-less trials, where cases would be decided by a judge alone. Jury trial would therefore end for the majority of crimes currently before Crown Courts - including theft, most drugs, violent and sexual offences and fraud.Cases would only definitely go before a jury if the defendant was likely to be jailed for more than five years or was accused of murder, manslaughter or rape.Volunteer magistrates - who handle the overwhelming majority of criminal cases in the lowest courts - would see their sentencing powers doubled to two years.The leaked plan does not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland and was circulated to other departments before final Cabinet sign off. It goes further than recommendations earlier this year from retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Brian Leveson.Speaking ahead of the announcement in Parliament, Lammy declined to confirm the final package, but said there would be an extra £550m over three years for specialist victim support services - and £34m aimed at attracting more barristers into criminal work.\"Juries remain and will always remain a fundamental part of our justice system and play a very, very important role the decision,\" he said.\"[If] someone steals an iPhone from an electrical shop tomorrow -  is it right that that individual should be able to opt for a jury?\"That case will be in the system, it will be two or three days in court, and therefore delay the rape, the murder, the more serious offence.\"In all of the decisions that we're making, we are determined to put victims at the centre of the system and to balance those victims against the process.\"But Riel Karmy-Jones KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said that it was not juries that had caused the unprecedented delays - but years of underfunding.\"Imposing an untried, untested layer of complexity and cost in the form of any new division of the Crown Court on our desperately underfunded system with its crumbling infrastructure is counter intuitive,\" she said.Many criminal barristers blame the previous Conservative government for the backlogs - saying that the courts have been starved of resources for more than a decade.Robert Jenrick MP, shadow justice secretary, said David Lammy had extensively defended juries in the past - and accused him of abandoning his principles.\"Labour have chosen to spend billions of extra pounds on benefits payments rather than funding the courts to get the backlog down,\" he said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoThe Financial Times leads with the news of the Office for Budget Responsibility chair's resignation after its early Budget leak. Richard Hughes's departure follows a review that found \"the same failures had allowed early access to the Spring Statement\" and left concerns that \"other Budgets could also have been compromised\".For The Daily Telegraph, it is \"Reeves clings on as OBR chief silenced\". Richard Hughes will not now appear in front of a Treasury committee after his resignation, \"sparing Ms Reeves further criticism when she is already under pressure to resign\". In further Budget news, council houses worth more than £2m will not face the new property tax introduced by the Chancellor, it reports.The i Paper also runs the exit of the OBR chair in its top slot, though says he was \"forced out after contradicting Chancellor\". Relations between the financial watchdog and the Treasury were at an \"all-time low\" after Richard Hughes chose to publish a timeline it says challenged Reeves's claims about \"difficulties she faced balancing the books\".The headline in the Times says the the OBR chair stepping down came after he was \"publicly rebuked\" by the prime minister. A review of the Budget's early release found it was the \"worst failure\" in the office's history. Singer Kylie Minogue is splashed across the front wearing Jonathan Anderson to the Fashion Awards, where the designer won the top award. The Guardian says Richard Hughes took \"full responsibility\" for the Budget leak as he exited the OBR, while Sir Keir Starmer \"notably failed to express confidence in the senior economist\". Labour MP Tulip Siddiq is also pictured on the front page after being been sentenced to two years of jail in Bangladesh after being put on trial in her absence over corruption allegations. She said the process had been \"flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end\".The Daily Mail calls Ex-OBR chair Richard Hughes \"the fall guy for Reeves' Budget lies\", saying the government has \"no shame\". It writes that Hughes \"exposed the truth about her financial 'black hole',\" referring to the funding gap she had indicated she needed to fill.The Independent also leads on the \"Budget black hole\" but with a denial from Sir Keir Starmer that \"we didn't mislead anyone\" over it. Now, the \"Labour briefings row\" - over what Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir discussed with ministers about the improved OBR forecast - \"deepens\", says the Indy.The Daily Express focuses on a speech the prime minister gave on Monday where he referenced the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. Sir Keir Starmer made \"vows to appease Brussels as he scrambled to defend his under-fire Chancellor\" it says.The Daily Mirror calls for \"justice for the lost victims\" of the Post Office Horizon scandal. Police could now bring corporate manslaughter charges in cases where staff took their own lives after being accused of theft due to a faulty IT system, the Mirror reports.The Sun says a former England and Premier League football player has been arrested over an allegation of attempted rape. The paper says the man, who it reports played for England in the 2010s, has been bailed pending further inquiries after being arrested at Stansted airport following an allegation from an ex-partner.\"Striker clashes with right winger\" writes Metro over a row on X between former England player Gary Lineker and far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Robinson had shared a photo of Lineker with his daughter-in-law.There are \"tears for cheers\" for \"humble hero\" Kevin Sinfield, writes the Daily Star. The former Rugby league player - currently on an ultramarathon challenge - has raised more than £10m for motor neurone disease, the paper says.Most of the papers focus on Monday's resignation of the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, or as the Daily Mail describes him, \"the fall guy\" for the chancellor's \"Budget lies\". Sources tell the i Paper that Richard Hughes could have survived the OBR's accidental leak, but his relationship with the Treasury had \"tanked\" after he \"undermined\" Rachel Reeves' position on the state of the public finances. According to the Times, the pair were \"barely on speaking terms\" in the lead up to his resignation, a period described by the Financial Times as \"a moment of high tension\".Ministers are hoping, the Guardian says, that Mr Hughes' departure will \"draw a line\" under what it calls the \"chaos\" surrounding the Budget. But the paper says Ms Reeves \"remains under pressure\". The Daily Telegraph describes her as \"battling to save her political career\". One government insider tells the Mail that she is \"radioactive\" and \"contaminating everyone around her\". The prime minister has \"lashed himself\" to the chancellor's \"lies\", one minister is quoted as saying. \"There's no way out of this for either of them\".As Sir Keir Starmer defended his chancellor in a speech, the Daily Express claims he \"sparked fury\" by \"vowing to appease Brussels\". It highlights the prime minister's comments that the UK should build a closer relationship with the EU, with the paper saying that he \"blamed Brexit for the disastrous economy under Labour\". The Daily Mirror quotes him as criticising \"wild promises\" which were made to people, and not fulfilled.The Sun reports that a former England and Premier League footballer has been arrested on suspicion of attempted rape. Sources describe to the paper how the unnamed man was detained at passport control at Stansted Airport. Essex Police says a man has been bailed while inquiries continue.The Justice Secretary David Lammy sets out his case in the Daily Telegraph for proposed changes to jury trials due to be outlined later. He cites the Magna Carta, writing that \"if its authors saw the delays in our courts today, they would not urge us to cling rigidly to tradition\". But the Times reports that he has dropped the more \"radical\" part of his plan, to scrap jury trials in all cases except murder, rape and manslaughter.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Multinational retail giant Costco has sued the US government to secure a full refund of import duties if the Supreme Court rejects President Donald Trump's authority to impose tariffs without congressional approval.Costco's lawsuit urges the federal trade court to declare Trump's 'emergency' tariffs illegal, an authority the president says he has under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Two lower courts have already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority by using emergency powers to impose tariffs. The case has now reached the Supreme Court, and several companies are trying to protect their rights to refunds should the justices strike down the tariffs.In the lawsuit filed over the Thanksgiving holiday, Costco said its business had suffered because of the tariffs and was concerned it wouldn't get its money back even if the apex court upheld previous rulings.Lawyers for Costco said a \"separate action is necessary\" as a refund is not guaranteed  \"in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief\".The world's third-largest retailer didn't say how much it was seeking back but trade data from the US customs agency shows importers like Costco have already paid about $90 billion in IEEPA-related tariffs as of late September.Costco brought the suit to the US Court of International Trade ahead of a 15 December 2025 deadline after which it would struggle to recoup any funds paid to the government.In May, that court was the first to rule that Trump's tariffs were unlawful, a decision that has been subsequently affirmed by the US Court of Appeals. At the hearing last month, Supreme Court judges appeared sceptical of the president's authority to impose the levies without congressional approval.Trump administration lawyers have argued in court the emergency powers give the president the authority to impose the global tariffs. The administration has warned an unfavourable ruling will restrict its ability to negotiate with countries and the treasury will lose billions already collected.\"The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNBC in a statement. \"The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" the statement added.Last month, the president said the US was \"taking in Trillions of Dollars\" in tariffs and promised \"a dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone\".",

    "body": "15 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentEPAResident doctors last walked out in November, demonstrating in Liverpool (pictured) as well as across EnglandThe British Medical Association has announced a fresh round of strikes in England in the long-running pay dispute.Resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, will stage a five-day walkout from 17 December.This will be the 14th strike by the doctors' union since March 2023 and is expected to cause significant disruption, particularly in hospitals.NHS bosses said it was an \"inflammatory act\" by the BMA as the lead up to Christmas was always challenging.But the union said it had been left with no choice because it had not received a credible offer from the government.Resident doctors represent nearly half the medical workforce and range from doctors fresh out of university through to those with up to a decade of experience.They will walk out of both emergency and routine care, with senior doctors brought in to provide cover.Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said: \"This is an inflammatory act by the BMA.\"Everyone knows in the run-up to Christmas we need all hands on deck.\"It's really important to be able to discharge as many patients as possible so that where appropriate they can be at home with their loved ones.\"It's totally unfair to patients and to other staff working for the NHS.\"Both sides need to get back round the table to break the logjam.\"The walkout follows a five-day strike held last month and that came after talks broke down between the government and union.The government had offered doctors a deal which involved creating more training posts, improving working conditions and helping them with out-of-pocket expenses such as exam fees.But the BMA turned that down, saying any deal needed to involve an increase in pay.Health Secretary Wes Streeting has maintained he would not negotiate on pay after resident doctors had received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years.But the union argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.Dr Jack Fletcher, chairman of the BMA's resident doctors committee, said as the government had failed to come forward with a credible plan the union had been left with no choice.But he added: \"These [strikes] do not need to go ahead. Gradually raising pay over a few years and some common-sense fixes to the job security of our doctors are well within the reach of this government.\"Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The BMA have clearly chosen to strike when it will cause maximum disruption, causing untold anxiety. “Patients and NHS staff deserve better than this cynical attempt to wreck Christmas.”The BMA's mandate for strike action ends in early January, but it has announced it will be holding another ballot of members.",

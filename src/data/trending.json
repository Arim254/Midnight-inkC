    "body": "9 hours agoAndrew Harding,Paris correspondentandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterGetty ImagesUp until now French police would rarely intervene to stop crossings, due to the perceived risk to officers and civiliansFrance has agreed to start intercepting small boats in the Channel, following months of pressure from the UK.The change in policy comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wrote to President Emmanuel Macron urging him to back the plan and saying we currently \"have no effective deterrent\" in the Channel, according to a report in Le Monde.French security forces will be allowed to stop the small boats at sea, but only before they've picked up their passengers, the maritime police force has confirmed to the BBC.  French police have rarely intervened to stop the overcrowded boats leaving the coastline because it is considered too great a risk to both officers and civilians.Le Monde reported Sir Keir's letter as reading: \"It is essential that we deploy these tactics this month... We have no effective deterrent in the Channel.\"Now, a French maritime police spokesperson says officers will start intervening at sea, with the aim of safeguarding human life.Notably, the spokesperson ruled out the use of nets to intercept boats, which Le Monde has previously reported could be used to snarl the propellers of the boats.The decision to intervene at all is a significant step forward, following a short-lived change towards a more aggressive approach this summer, driven by former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.The BBC reported in March that Retailleau wanted these interceptions to begin - but had conceded it was a difficult issue for his government to solve because of their maritime policing rules.In the run-up to July's summit between Sir Keir and President Macron, the BBC witnessed French police wading into the sea south of Boulogne to slash the sides of a boat.But the French authorities insisted that incident did not reflect any broader change in strategy, and on the UK side there seems to be surprise that it has taken so long to resolve the problems Retailleau had already identified and said he would fix.Now French authorities will again be allowed to intercept boats before they pick up migrant passengers from the beaches of northern France, although it's not clear how the small boats will be stopped. Strong winds are currently delaying the start of interceptions and the people-smuggling gangs will be looking for ways to adapt to avoid interception, as they have done so often in the past.A UK government spokesperson said: \"We continue to work closely with our French partners on the shared challenge of illegal migration, and we have already worked to ensure officers in France review their maritime tactics so they can intervene in the shallow waters.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "Brisbane is not a city to give England some much-needed Ashes optimism.After defeat by Australia in the first Test, the tourists must stir themselves for a trip to the Gabba, a ground where England have not won since 1986.Men wearing three lions have habitually been lambs to the slaughter at the Gabbatoir.Among a recent history of broken English hopes, dreams and bodies is a source of inspiration delivered by a shining knight.It is exactly 15 years since Sir Alastair Cook conquered the Gabba with a career-defining 235 not out, saving the first Test of 2010-11 and setting England on course to their only Ashes series win in Australia in the past 38 years.It was the beginning of Cook's triumphant circumnavigation of Australia; three hundreds and 766 runs. Wally Hammond is the only Englishman to score more runs in a series in this country.After that first Test draw at the Gabba, England won 3-1, with all victories by an innings They have not won a Test here since.\"You forget the tough times, the nervousness and anxiety that went into that,\" Cook tells the Test Match Special podcast.\"I look back with pride. I played a significant part in a series when England won 3-1 in Australia and all three games were won by an innings. That just doesn't happen. One day, I need to sit down and watch some of it.\"Cook's road to his Australian epic began 18 months earlier, at the end of the 2009 Ashes in the UK. England won, but the opener averaged less than 25 with just one score above 50.He wanted more.\"Cricket is a team game, but the individuality does make you feel like you want to pull your weight,\" he says. \"The stats are very clear. I wanted to be part of an Ashes series I did well in, then it would have meant more.\"I wanted to judge myself against the best and my game wasn't stacking up against the best bowlers in the world.\"Two days after the celebrations I was back hitting hundreds and hundreds of balls in the nets with Graham Gooch, trying to groove something very unnatural, thinking in the long run it would be better for my technique.\"The initial results were encouraging. Cook made three hundreds on the 2009-10 winter tours to South Africa and Bangladesh.When Cook returned to England for the 2010 summer, the left-hander had a \"stinker\". In eight innings against Bangladesh and Pakistan, his highest score was 29.On nought not out at the end of the second day of the third Test against Pakistan at The Oval, Cook was convinced he was playing his last Test innings before being dropped.\"I was sitting in the bar, trying to find the answer in the bottom of a beer bottle,\" he says.\"I made the promise to myself: 'Don't get out defending tomorrow'. That was where I was at.\"It was a clearing of the mind. I decided to go back to my old technique. I attacked and had 76 by lunch on the third day.\"Cook's 110 guaranteed his seat on the plane to Australia, albeit via an infamous team-bonding trip to Bavaria dreamt up by England coach Andy Flower and captain Andrew Strauss.Players carried bricks uphill and did hundreds of press-ups. James Anderson suffered a cracked rib in a boxing session. Luckily for Cook, he missed almost all of it.\"I was at my brother's wedding,\" he says. \"I turned up for the last day. The most broken men were Strauss and Flower. I thought it served them right because they organised the thing.\"I'm genuinely disappointed I did miss it. For the next little while there were always references back to that camp. At the time it was horrendous, but the fact we were still talking about it years later shows it had its worth. I think people really opened up around the camp fire every night.\"Well-drilled on and off the pitch, England continued their preparations by winning two and drawing one of their warm-up games in Australia - Cook scored a century against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval.Come the first Test at the Gabba, they were hit by Peter Siddle's hat-trick, then hundreds from Mike Hussey and Brad Haddin.An hour before the end of the third day, Cook and Strauss opened England's second innings with a deficit of 221 runs. They reached 19-0 at stumps and followed up with a performance etched in Ashes folklore.\"I don't remember the messages, anything of what we spoke about,\" says Cook. \"We had an experienced team and the pitch had no demons. We just had to show some fight.\"The left-handers added 188 for the first wicket. Strauss made 110. When the captain fell, Jonathan Trott eased into Cook's slipstream for an unbeaten 135.Cook's 235 not out was the highest score by an Englishman in Australia for 82 years, beaten by his own 244 not out in Melbourne seven years later. England racked up 517-1 to save the Test and put Australia on the back foot.\"It was my 14th Test hundred, but the first time when it felt like I had really contributed and made a difference,\" says Cook.\"It gave us a lot of belief the Australian team were there for the taking. We got out of jail, but in a way that gave us a lot of confidence.\"England capitalised on an astonishing first morning of the second Test in Adelaide. Simon Katich was run out by Trott's direct hit from the fourth ball of the match and Australia captain Ricky Ponting was out first ball to Anderson.When Anderson also nicked off Michael Clarke, Australia were 2-3 and never recovered. The home side spiralled to 245 all out, leaving England one over to bat at the end of the first day.\"We got into the changing room and Flower asked if we were having a nightwatchman,\" says Cook.\"If Jimmy Anderson opened the batting, got out, then I went out to bat, imagine the stick I'd have got from the Australians when they were pumped up.\"Straussy usually took the first ball, but I said to him 'I'm going out there now and will face the first ball. You do what you want'.\"He said 'OK. I'll do it as well'.\"Cook followed up his Brisbane heroics with 148 in a Test remembered for Kevin Pietersen dismantling the Australian attack in his 227. Off-spinner Graeme Swann took five wickets in the second innings to bowl England to victory just before the heavens opened on the fifth day.\"After struggling the whole last summer, I was hungry for runs, and there's no better place to be hungry than a flat Adelaide pitch in 40-degree heat,\" says Cook.\"The KP double hundred was a real marker of dominance, of taking Australia down. He led it, the team got ahead of the game. He hammered Australia into the ground.\"England could have retained the Ashes in Perth, only for Mitchell Johnson to foreshadow the havoc he would cause four years later.England bowled out Australia for 268 and reached 78-0 in reply before Johnson got going. The left-armer took nine wickets in the match and England lost by 267 runs.\"We had a team meeting straight after and I wasn't sure it was the right thing to do,\" says Cook.\"It turned out to be the right move. Flower wanted us to look at how we lost the game.\"Did we take our eyes off what we were doing and started to think about the end result? Did we think we had done all the hard work and were going to win? Maybe we were thinking about retaining the Ashes there in Perth. I don't know.\"There were questions we maybe didn't have the answer to, but it was important to get them out. We went to Melbourne and the Perth game was buried. It was 1-1 and it became a two-match series.\"Australia were flying, there were pictures of Ricky Ponting all over the newspapers, people were saying we were done.\"What followed was perhaps England's single greatest day of Ashes cricket in Australia.At the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the 100,000-seater cathedral of Australian sport, and on Boxing Day, the highlight of the calendar in this country, the home side were blown away for 98. England - Cook and Strauss - were 157-0 at the close.\"If Carlsberg did Boxing Days, it was that. There was disbelief at the end of the day,\" says Cook. \"Me and Strauss cleared the MCG with our batting - most people wanted to go home when we were batting together.\"The Aussies are very proud of how many people they can get to the MCG on Boxing Day. By the end there were only 20,000 English people watching me and Strauss grind it around Melbourne.\"If I could go back through my career and play any one day over again, that would be right up there because of what we did as a group.\"Trott made 168 and England won by an innings and 157 runs. They celebrated retaining the Ashes with a sprinkler dance on the MCG outfield.\"I felt a little bit uneasy doing it, because we hadn't gone there to retain the Ashes - we'd gone there to win,\" says Cook.\"I enjoyed the dressing room in Melbourne and a few of the lads went out and enjoyed a night with the Barmy Army, but we hadn't finished yet.\"A result of 2-2 would have felt a bit of an injustice. However good Melbourne was, we still had Sydney.\"Fuelled by the focus to win the urn, Cook was at it again at the Sydney Cricket Ground. His 189 lifted England to 644, their highest total in a Test in Australia.The question was not if England would win the match and the Ashes, but when.\"The fourth evening, Chris Tremlett bounced out Brad Haddin and brought Mitchell Johnson to the wicket,\" says Cook.\"The song the Barmy Army sang, I've never heard anything like it. I spoke to Tremmers and he said 'I'm just going to bowl this as fast as I can'. He bowled an absolute jaffa to Johnson, and it bowled him. I've never heard noise like it.\"England took the extra half an hour on that fourth evening, but could not get over the line.The fifth morning was a victory procession. The Barmy Army and the rest of the travelling supporters were joined in the SCG by every ex-pat and backpacker in Sydney for an English Ashes party.\"The atmosphere was incredible,\" says Cook. \"It felt like an age, I was desperate to take the final wicket.\"When Tremlett got Michael Beer out to win the match, it was a moment of pure elation, just incredible.\"It was so early in the day, we had so much time to soak it in. I don't know when we left the ground, but we stayed for absolutely ages, on the outfield and in the changing rooms. It was very, very special.\"Cook was player of the series. The remaining seven years of his Test career were illuminated by other milestones: a starring performance in the 2012 series win in India, winning the Ashes as captain in 2015 and breaking the England records for most Test runs and hundreds.There were low moments, too, most notably the humiliating 5-0 defeat in Australia when he was captain in 2013-14.Following his international retirement in 2018, Cook was knighted for services to cricket. That service was best delivered on the 2010-11 tour of Australia.\"I couldn't have played any better,\" he says. \"I was very lucky to have been part of that team, achieving something rare for England in Australia.\"When you win games of cricket, it is unbelievably special. It was hard work, but international sport is hard work.\"It was such a good team to be part of. Flower and Strauss were tough, and that regime was very regimented, but we had the time of our lives there.\"",

    "body": "10 minutes agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentGetty ImagesAirbus has warned flights will be disrupted after it requested immediate modifications to thousands of planes over the discovery that intense radiation from the sun could corrupt data crucial to flight controls.About 6,000 planes are thought to be affected, about half the European aerospace giant's global fleet, but it is understood most will be able to undergo a simple software update.The UK's aviation regulator said carrying out the updates would likely cause \"some disruption and cancellations to flights\".Airbus said the problem was discovered following a recent \"incident\" in the US involving an A320 family aircraft and apologised for disruption to passengers.The incident, which happened on 30 October, involved a JetBlue Airways A320 making an emergency landing in Florida, after a sudden drop in altitude. At least 15 people were reported to have been injured.The issue affects the A320 - its best selling aircraft - but also models from the same design fleet, including the A318, A319 and the A321. It is understood that on around 5,100 Airbus planes, the issue can be addressed using a relatively simple software update. However, the remaining aircraft which are older versions will need new hardware as well and will need to be taken out of service to be modified.Airbus said it acknowledged this will lead to \"operational disruption to passengers and customers\", and has apologised.Wizz Air said some of its aircraft were among those that require updates and that it had scheduled the necessary maintenance, while Air India said the directive from Airbus could lead to delays.British Airways is understood not be be heavily impacted by the issue. Easyjet said it was \"expecting this to result in some disruption\" and would inform passengers directly.\"Safety is our highest priority and easyJet operates its fleet of aircraft in strict compliance with manufacturers guidelines,\" the airline said.The Civil Aviation Authority [CAA], the UK's aviation regulator, said \"only some UK airlines are affected\".\"The requirement will mean the airlines flying these aircraft will in some cases have to change software over the days ahead or remain on the ground from Sunday onwards until the software has been changed,\" the regulator said.Giancarlo Buono, director of aviation safety at CAA, added: \"Passengers should check with their airline whether their flights are affected.  Airlines have a duty of care to look after passengers when a flight is delayed.\"The problem affecting the aircraft is that intense solar and cosmic radiation at high altitudes can affect the working of the ELAC computer, which controls the elevators and ailerons. These are aerodynamic surfaces that are used to make the aircraft pitch up or down or roll to turn.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive, ordering airlines to replace ELAC computers on the worst affected planes before carrying passengers again.The A320 family are what is known as \"fly by wire\" planes. This means there is no direct mechanical link between the controls in the cockpit and the parts of the aircraft that actually govern flight. The pilot's actions are interpreted by computers - which actually \"fly\" the plane.Airbus has issued an alert to airlines requesting them to take \"immediate precautionary action…in order to implement the available software and/or hardware protection and ensure the fleet is safe to fly\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoAndrew HeadandJonathan Coffey,BBC PanoramaBBCAlison Porter-Garroch (L) went to help put out the fire at Mike Chesworth's home (R) - only for her own to then catch fireTwo residents who had been involved in a long-running dispute with a holiday park company saw their homes destroyed by fire on the same day.Their mobile homes, situated on opposite sides of Wyre Country Park in Lancashire, went up in flames within 90 minutes of each other in August.Both residents had appeared in a BBC Panorama programme last year that alleged some mobile home owners had been cheated out of their life savings.Exclusive Resorts Ltd, which owns the site, said in a statement that Panorama was presenting a narrative that appeared to insinuate, without foundation or evidence, that the company may have been involved in an arson attack. \"This suggestion is wholly untrue,\" it said.According to the company, a concern was raised with the police that one fire might be connected with an insurance claim.Lancashire Police said the fires had been investigated as potential arson, but no definite cause had been identified.\"We investigated as far as possible but all enquiries have been exhausted at this time,\" the statement said. \"The victims are aware this will now be filed as closed until such time as any further evidence becomes available to identify a suspect.\"Mike Chesworth was the first resident to lose his mobile home. He and his wife had left the park and were travelling to see a relative on 5 August when he got a call to say his home was on fire.\"I turned around as quick as I could and drove back to the park,\" he told the BBC. \"When I got there, my lodge was absolutely ablaze and lots of fire engines were turning up.\"No definitive cause for the fires has been establishedThe second resident affected by the fires lived on the other side of Wyre Country Park.Alison Porter-Garroch said she was at home when she saw the smoke coming from Mike Chesworth's unit and went to help people who were trying to put out the fire.She then went to visit another resident on the park, who spotted that Alison's home was also ablaze.\"I remember running over to my lodge, opening the front door because I had my mum and dad's ashes in there. It was just black smoke, and I couldn't see anything. I got the ashes out but I could just see my home going. It was just horrendous.\"Both homes were left uninhabitable by the fires.Wyre Country Park only has a holiday park licence, which means caravan owners are not supposed to live there full time.But last year, half a dozen residents told Panorama the site owner had told them they could live on the park full time when they bought their caravans.They said they had been sold the properties under false pretences and cheated out of their life savings by David Welch - the director of Exclusive Resorts Ltd.The programme then sent in an undercover reporter, posing as a potential customer who wanted to buy a home on the park.Both the sales manager and Mr Welch told the undercover reporter she could live on the site all year round.Mr Welch later told Panorama that the sales agreements and signs at the park made it clear the caravans were for holiday-use only.Following the programme, relations between Mr Welch and some residents, including Mr Chesworth and Ms Porter-Garroch, deteriorated further in a dispute over electricity payments.This July, the company commenced eviction proceedings against Mr Chesworth and his wife.The Chesworths owned their mobile home and had signed a lease allowing them to live on the land at Wyre Country Park.The eviction notice terminated that lease and required them to leave by 4 August, the day before the fires. The Chesworths had refused to leave.Exclusive Resorts said Mr Chesworth and his wife had been required to vacate their home because of \"serious and persistent\" breaches of their licence, including harassment.The company said it has \"co-operated fully and transparently with all lawful investigations\". It also said that the matters are now under the control of the relevant authorities and it would be inappropriate and irresponsible to infer baseless wrongdoing against the company.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoImogen FoulkesGeneva CorrespondentThe United Nations committee on torture says there is evidence that Israel is operating a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\". The committee regularly reviews the records of all countries which have signed the convention against torture, taking testimony from their governments, and from human rights groups.During Israel's review both Israeli and Palestinian rights groups gave harrowing details about conditions in Israeli detention centres. It is alleged that thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel since the Hamas attacks of October 7th 2023. Under Israel's laws on administrative detention and on Unlawful Combatants – suspects who cannot be classed as prisoner of war - they can be held for long periods without access to a lawyer or family members. Many Palestinian families say they have waited months to even find out that a loved has been detained, amounting, the UN committee said, to \"enforced disappearance\".The committee was particularly critical of Israel's reported use of the Unlawful Combatants law to detain whole groups of Palestinians, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly.But it is the reported conditions in detention which make the grimmest reading in the committee's conclusions, published today. Palestinians, the evidence suggests, are regularly deprived of food and water, and subjected to severe beatings, attacks by dogs, electrocution, water boarding, and sexual violence. Some are allegedly permanently shackled, denied access to a toilet, and forced to wear diapers.The committee concluded that such treatment \"amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity\". It said evidence of a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\" by Israel was one of the acts which constitute the crime of genocide under international law. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.One committee member, Peter Vedel Kessing of Denmark, said he and his colleagues were \"deeply appalled\" by what they heard. Committee members also said they were very concerned at the lack of investigations or prosecutions into allegations of torture. They called on Israel to launch independent investigations, and to ensure those responsible, including senior military officers, are held accountable.Israel, which has long accused the UN of bias against it, did not comment publicly today on the committee's findings, but during the committee hearings its ambassador, Daniel Meron, described the allegations of torture as \"disinformation\". He said that Israel was \"committed to upholding its obligations in line with our moral values and principles, even in the face of the challenges posed by a terrorist organisation\".In its conclusions, the UN committee took care to unequivocally condemn the Hamas attack of October 2023, and acknowledged the security challenges Israel faces. But it also warned that violations of international law by one side did not justify the other side doing the same. Under the convention, to which Israel is a party, the prohibition on torture is absolute: it is not allowed under any circumstances.Israel's domestic law is less clear however, suggesting that the convention only applies to Israeli territory, and not to the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank – an interpretation that many international lawyers dispute.The findings come amid increasing pressure on Israel over its human rights record. On Friday in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Office said the killing by Israeli soldiers of two Palestinians in the West Bank looked like a \"summary execution\". Video of the killing showed the two men with their hands up, apparently surrendering to Israeli forces.And UN aid agencies say conditions for people in the Gaza strip remain dire, despite the ceasefire. Thousands of families are facing the winter cold and rain in tents, they warn, not enough aid supplies are getting in, and Israeli air strikes against what Israel says are Hamas targets continue.",

    "body": "A search has continued for a British man who fell overboard from a cruise ship off the coast of Tenerife on Thursday. The 76-year-old was last seen entering the water while the Marella Explorer 2 was en route to the island of La Gomera.The Spanish coastguard has been coordinating search and rescue efforts since yesterday morning but said he was still missing on Friday evening.TUI, which operates Marella Cruises, said that it was supporting the man's family and working with local authorities.Lesley-Anne Kelly, one of the passengers on the ship, recalled the moment an alarm sounded followed by an announcement of \"man overboard\" as she was having having breakfast with her mother on Thursday morning.The search then began shortly before 10:00 local time (10:00 GMT), with the ship taking part before it docked in Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the early hours of Friday. \"It was pretty sombre last night, especially after the announcement that they were standing down the search,\" Mrs Kelly said.Passengers were told witnesses were being interviewed, she added.Mrs Kelly said she believed people \"had clearly seen it happen\", adding: \"Everybody was up and about. It was pretty bright, so yeah I can imagine if someone had gone in at that time of the day they would have been seen by multiple people.\" The coastguard continued the search on Friday with rescue boats, two helicopters and a specialist search and rescue aircraft.Local media reports say the ship was on its way back to the Canary Islands from the Portuguese island of Madeira when the incident happened. It is believed to have departed Tenerife on 21 November for a seven-day tour around the Canaries and other nearby islands.The Foreign Office said it has not been approached for consular assistance in this instance.The Malta-registered Marella Explorer 2 holds up to 1814 passengers across its 14 decks and 907 cabins, according to TUI's website.",

    "body": "Scientists believe they have recorded electrical activity in the Martian atmosphere for the first time, suggesting the planet is capable of lightning.Nasa's Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology and has spent the last four years exploring the Jezero Crater region.Electrical discharges nicknamed \"mini lightning\" were picked up from audio and electromagnetic recordings made by the rover's SuperCam instrument.Scientists hope new instruments for measuring atmospheric discharges and more-sensitive cameras could be sent to Mars to try to confirm the findings.A team of researchers from France analysed 28 hours of microphone recordings made by the Nasa rover over two Martian years (or 1,374 Earth days).They found that electrical discharges were normally associated with dust devils and dust storm fronts.Dust devils are small whirlwinds that form from hot air rising from the ground, and their internal movements can give rise to electrical discharges.Lead author of the research Dr Baptiste Chide told news agency Reuters: \"These discharges represent a major discovery, with direct implications for Martian atmospheric chemistry, climate, habitability and the future of robotic and human exploration.\"He and other scientists at the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in France believe that Mars now joins Earth, Saturn and Jupiter as planets known to have atmospheric electrical activity.Particle physicist Dr Daniel Pritchard wrote in scientific journal Nature that, although the recordings would \"provide persuasive evidence of dust-induced discharges\", because the discharges were only heard and not seen, \"some doubt will inevitably remain as to whether this really was Martian lightning\". He added: \"Given the history of this field, the debate is likely to continue for some time.\"In September this year, scientists found rocks with unusual markings on Mars. The intriguing markings, nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds, contain minerals produced by chemical reactions that could be associated with ancient microbes.It is possible the minerals were produced by natural geological processes, but Nasa said the features could be the clearest signs of life ever found.Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life.Perseverance was dispatched to the Jezero Crater because it showed qualities that may have meant it was once conducive to life, including signs it was once a delta when Mars could sustain liquid surface water.",

    "body": "6 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentChancellor Rachel Reeves has said that people whose only income comes from the state pension will not have to pay tax.The state pension is set to rise above the normal level for paying tax in April 2027, due to increases in payments and tax thresholds being frozen.But Reeves has confirmed that anyone who receives the state pension but no other income will not have to pay income tax before 2030.The announcement has raised questions over the winners and losers of such a policy. Most pensioners have other pension payments which means they already pay tax, and experts say the move could add further complexity to the system.Anyone solely receiving the new flat-rate state pension - for those who reached state pension age after April 2016 - will get £12,547.60 next year.That is just below the income tax threshold of £12,570. That threshold is frozen and highly likely to be breached by the state pension from April 2027, meaning the portion of pension income over this threshold would be taxed.Small tax sums would normally be collected by the Simple Assessment process where HM Revenue and Customs does all the calculations and sends the pensioner a tax demand at the end of the year.But the chancellor said in her speech that, if this was the only source of income people had, then they would not face the administrative hassle.She later told Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, that \"in this Parliament, they won't have to pay the tax\".The Conservatives made a similar pledge during the last general election campaign.About three-quarters of pensioners already pay income tax because they have additional income to the state pension.They include 2.5 million pensioners - including widows and widowers - whose state pension operates under the pre-2016 system. They receive a basic pension and a SERPS pension, which means they pay tax.Steve Webb, partner at pension consultants LCP and former pensions minister, also highlights those with a very small private pension who would have to pay tax.Workers on the same income as the level of state pension would also be taxed, while pensioners would not be.\"There is a real risk that pensioners on the new system will be more favourably treated,\" Mr Webb said.\"There is no costing for this policy in the Budget documents which suggests that it is still very much an idea rather than a firm plan.  But it will be incredibly difficult for the Treasury to come up with something that is workable and fair.\"Rachel Vahey, head of public policy at investment platform AJ Bell, said: \"Collecting the little bits of tax owed from millions of pensioners was always going to be an administrative headache for the government. \"It's no wonder they've put their tax collecting thinking caps on to find ways to avoid it, but we will have to wait and see what process they come up with and whether it will indeed make pensioners' lives simpler.\"",

    "body": "'Callous' beheading of stag prompts police investigation28 minutes agoBarry O'ConnorBBC News NIFingal County CouncilThe eight-year-old stag (pictured) was part of the herd at Newbridge Demesne, Donabate in County DublinA council in the Republic of Ireland is seeking information following the \"callous\" beheading of a stag.Fingal County Council has issued an appeal for information after the headless body of the stag, that was part of a herd at Newbridge Demesne, Donabate in County Dublin, was found by staff on Thursday.The stag's head was removed from the grounds and staff say they have no doubt it was taken as a trophy, Irish broadcaster RTÉ is reporting.Gardaí (Irish police) confirmed they are investigating a reported incident of wildlife crime.Fingal County CouncilIvan Smith, foreman of Works at Newbridge House and Traditional Farm, said: \"He was a lovely stag\"\"It had been killed overnight [on Wednesday] by intruders who had broken into the park. The discovery was made when staff went to feed the herd of Irish Red Deer,\" Fingal County Council said in a statement.The stag, who was eight years old, was one of two in the herd.The killing of the stag is also under investigation by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.'He was a big favourite with the public'The Mayor of Fingal, councillor Tom O'Leary, condemned the killing.He said: \"I have visited this park area with my granddaughters who really enjoyed meeting the stag and deer.  A wonderful animal to behold close up. \"It's truly shocking that someone would carry out this act,\" he said.\"I am appealing to anybody with information to contact the gardaí or the National Parks and Wildlife Service. It is illegal to kill deer without a licence and I hope that the perpetrators can be brought to justice.\"Ivan Smith, foreman of Works at Newbridge House and Traditional Farm, said the team was \"absolutely shocked\" by the incident.\"He was a lovely stag with a beautiful pair of antlers and was a big favourite with the public who walk through the park.\"'Unnecessary killing'Ireland's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) have expressed \"horror\" at the attack.\"The unnecessary killing of such a majestic creature for, what appears to be, a trophy is appalling,\" Pat Watt of the NSPCA said.\"It is the NSPCA's hopes that the perpetrator/s will be caught and prosecuted with the full force of the legal system relating to this type of crime. Animal abuse is not acceptable in any situations.\"'Disgusted and appalled'Councillor for the area Eoghan Dockrell told BBC News NI that he was \"in shock\".\"The one common response to anyone I've spoken to in the community is they're disgusted and appalled,\" he said.He added that he has \"an awful lot of sympathy for the staff members who would have had to come upon that scene and how distressing that must have been\".\"I have been in touch with council officials to see if they'd review security procedures in the park and while a lot of patrols are being carried out during the day, we're going to see if we can increase patrols at night time,\" he said.Anyone who has any information should report it to National Parks and Wildlife Service, Fingal County Council or their local Garda Station.Gardaí (Irish police) also said they wish to speak with anyone who has footage, including dashcam, from between 00:00 and 02:30 local time on Thursday on the R126 road, Cobbe's Lane and Turvey Avenue, around Newbridge Demense, to make it available.",

    "body": "'Predatory' head teacher struck off after exposing himself in school6 hours agoMaria CassidyBBC WalesCadle Primary School / XJames 'Jamie' Richards served as head teacher of Cadle Primary School from 2011 to 2021A head teacher from Swansea who exposed himself to members of staff in school and while on a school trip has been banned from working in schools in Wales for at least 15 years.James 'Jamie' Richards was head of Cadle Primary School in Swansea from 2011 to 2021.Richard's behaviour was described as \"predatory\" and \"sexualised\" with the father-of-two banned from working in maintained or non-maintained schools after a professional standards panel found all allegations against him to be proven.During the four-day hearing, former and current staff described how his actions had left numerous women traumatised. Panel chair Sue Davies said Richard's behaviour was \"harassing, abusive, and predatory\".Richards did not appear at the Education Workforce Council (EWC) hearing - the professional regulator for the education staff in Wales - nor was he represented, and he did not respond to the allegations against him. As such, all allegations were taken as denied by the panel, which found Richard's conduct in exposing himself was sexual in nature, or sexually motivated, and that his behaviour amounted to unacceptable professional conduct.'Shocked' and 'frightened'The hearing was told the women were left \"shocked\", \"numb\", and \"frightened\" by Richard's actions.One member of staff was called to his office to find him standing next to his desk with his trousers and pants pulled down, while another said he showed explicit pictures from his phone during a meeting. On another occasion, he revealed a video of him caressing himself, the panel heard.At times, he had appeared apologetic after an incident and was said to have told one female staff member he \"can't help myself\". In total, five women who worked with Richards described that he had exposed himself to them, leaving them too scared to report him.The hearing was told that Richards had not returned a laptop he was provided, as requested, during an internal investigation.It was this laptop, the panel heard, which he used to show naked images of his genitals.The women feared they would not be believed if they reported his actions - and one said she felt justified in that belief when South Wales Police were alerted but decided there was no criminal case to answer in late 2021, the panel was told.She told the hearing she felt let down by the school and the police, and was very upset Richards had been able to resign from his post during an internal investigation after he was suspended in 2021.She said she had felt silenced, while the man who exposed himself to her and others seemed to have \"got away with it\".Fraud team filmingChair Ms Davies said Richards had refused to be interviewed for the school's independent internal investigation in 2021. He had also claimed through his union that he was unable to be interviewed owing to ill health affecting his cognitive and physical abilities.However a Swansea Council fraud team followed Richards while he claimed to be ill and filmed him driving and going with a group of friends to play golf, the panel heard.EWC presenting officer, Sara Lewis, said it was an aggravating feature that he not only abused his position of trust but also told his frightened victims not to say anything. The panel said it did not have any information on his current work, or whether he intended to try to return to the teaching profession, but said they had no alternative but to strike him off the EWC register. The panel ruled Richard cannot apply to be considered to be reinstated to the register until at least November 2040. He has the right to appeal against the decision to the High Court within 28 days.South Wales Police have been approached for comment. More top storiesRelated internet links",

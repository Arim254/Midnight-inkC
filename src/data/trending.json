Orban wants to keep buying it, but Trump wants countries to wean themselves off Russian energy and help put the brakes on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Will Trump choose to keep an old friend close, or put pressure on Putin? We speak to Nick Thorpe, the BBC’s correspondent in Budapest, who has covered Orban since the 1980s. \nProducer: Viv Jones \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nMix: Travis Evans  \nPhoto: U.S. President Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

    "body": "EU forces free crew after Somali pirate attack on tanker 2 hours agoRachel HaganEuropean Union Naval ForceThe Hellas Aphrodite was seized by pirates on ThursdayEuropean Union naval forces have rescued 24 sailors from a Maltese-flagged oil tanker that was attacked by pirates off the coast of Somalia.The Hellas Aphrodite, carrying petrol from India to South Africa, was seized on Thursday when armed pirates opened fire with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades before boarding the vessel. The crew locked themselves inside a fortified citadel while the attackers took control of the ship.A Spanish warship, the ESPS Victoria, operating under the EU's anti-piracy mission Operation Atalanta, reached the tanker on Friday afternoon. Special forces boarded the vessel and found all 24 crew members unharmed.\"The crew is safe and no injuries have been reported. Throughout the incident, they remained in the citadel in direct contact with Atalanta,\" the EU mission said, adding that a \"show of force\" had prompted the pirates to abandon the ship before the warship arrived.It added that the threat risk in the area \"remains critical\" as the pirates are still in the area. The rescue operation involved a helicopter, drone and surveillance aircraft. Just hours earlier, another ship in the same area was approached by a small speedboat but managed to evade it.It is the latest in a spate of attacks that have created concern about a resurgence of piracy in the area. Such activity had declined when international naval patrols and security measures were introduced after peaking more than a decade ago.However, attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on ships in the Red Sea, which have been carried out for the past two years, have led vessels to be diverted through East Africa's Indian Ocean - creating new opportunities for Somali gangs.There were seven reported incidents of piracy that took place off the coast of Somalia last year, according to the International Maritime Bureau - including three hijackings. It reported only one incident of piracy in 2023. ",

    "body": "Alex Salmond died with debts of more than £340,000 and assets of just over £2,000, according to the accountants winding up his estate.  The news came as Kenny Craig, an accountant with insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor, was named as trustee in sequestration of the former first minister's estate.This is a professional appointed to manage the bankruptcy process in Scotland and follows an application by Salmond's widow Moira.It emerged last week that Salmond's estate had been forced to seek the equivalent of bankruptcy over the cost of court action taken against the Scottish government in the final years of his life.The firm said part of that process will involve considering the value of the legal action the former SNP leader was pursuing over the handling of a misconduct investigation into him.Salmond previously won £512,000 from the Scottish government after it was found the process in handling harassment complaints against him by civil servants was \"tainted with apparent bias\".He was later acquitted of a number of sexual misconduct charges at a criminal trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.Begbies Traynor, which describes itself as the \"UK's leading corporate rescue and recovery practice\", confirmed the winding-up of Salmond's estate would include considering the value of all assets, including rights of action raised against the Scottish government.At the time of his death in October 2024, the former first minister had raised further proceedings seeking damages against the government he once led.Thomas McKay, managing partner for Begbies Traynor in Scotland, said: \"This is an unusual and complex appointment, particularly because it involves ongoing legal proceedings by a high-profile individual against the Scottish government.\"Kenny Craig, supported by our personal insolvency team at Begbies Traynor Group, will of course do all that he can to manage the sequestration as respectfully and sensitively as possible.\"Salmond died after suffering a heart attack while attending an event in North Macedonia.",

    "body": "UK records warmest ever Bonfire night - when will November temperatures finally drop?ByHelen WillettsLead Weather PresenterThe current mild weather will continue over the weekend and into next week. Temperatures will remain comfortably above average for the time of year by several degrees.Bonfire Night on Thursday was the warmest ever recorded with temperatures staying above 14C in a number of places - something more akin to what we might typically expect during the day.The previous record of 13.9C, was set in 1938 at Gordon Castle in Scotland.How mild has it been?Typical overnight temperatures at this time of year range from 2C in Scotland to 5C in the south of England.During the first week in November they have rarely fallen into single figures, instead hovering at around 10 to 14C. These temperatures are closer (and even a little higher) than those experienced on an average November day. The daytime has also been incredibly mild with temperatures peaking at 19C in Plymouth on Wednesday. Temperatures on Thursday were some 5 or 6C above average.  Why has it been so warm recently?The warmth is down to the position of the jet stream, whose winds steer our weather systems across the Atlantic .The UK is currently sitting to the south of these winds and is tapping into air originating in the Azores, close to the equator. Plus the sea temperatures to our southwest are as much as 2C above average, which adds to the equation.Image caption, Warm winds from the south are influencing the UK's weatherThe situation has been aided by a milder than average October, as well as nighttime cloud cover which acts like a blanket to keep the heat in.When will temperatures start to drop?Temperatures will remain above average across the weekend and into next week.Towards the middle of the November there are hints that we may see temperatures dip back closer to average.However, at this stage and that far ahead, confidence is low so keep checking our longer range outlook for updates.At this time of year, average day temperatures vary between 8C in northern Scotland  to 11C  in southern England (2C to 5C at night respectively).What does the weekend hold in store?Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / MarkieBImage caption, Churches up and down the UK will be holding Remembrance Services on Sunday 9 November, including the National Service of Remembrance at the Cenotaph in LondonThe weekend is looking like a mixed bag, with most parts of the UK likely to have one dry day. Saturday might well start murky with fog that's slow to clear but then looks promising for sunny spells to develop quite widely.  Expect temperatures to be around 11 to 15C north to south.Saturday night will be a little cooler with some eastern parts of both Scotland and England falling to 5 or 6C with patchy fog. By Sunday morning rain will have moved into Northern Ireland and will then progress eastwards to all but East Anglia and southeast England by dusk.  Still mild with temperatures in the range of 10 to 14C.Keep up to date with the forecast where you are here or via the BBC Weather app.",

    "body": "7 hours agoDaniel Wainwright, Gerry Georgieva and Nicholas BarrettBBC VerifyGetty ImagesThe recent cases of prisoners being mistakenly released has put a fresh spotlight on the demands facing the justice system.Prison overcrowding, staffing levels and government funding have all been called into question.How many prisoners have been released by mistake?There were 262 prisoners accidentally released in the 12 months to March 2025, compared with 115 the previous year.Of 121 prisons across England and Wales, 72 released at least one prisoner by mistake in 2024-25.The overall number of releases has also increased - but not by as much.  There were just over 57,000 releases of prisoners who had finished the custodial part of their sentences in England and Wales in 2024-25. This includes the period when some prisoners were released after serving 40% of their sentence.The year before there were about 50,000 releases. That's a rise in the number of releases of about 13% - a lot lower proportionally than the increase in errors.One in 10 released from 'escort areas'The majority of accidental releases were from a prison itself.Pentonville Prison in London released the most in 2024-25 - 16, up from six the year before.To put that in context, Pentonville had a population of just under 1,200 in March 2025. So that's equivalent to letting out more than one in every 100 prisoners by mistake over the year.Another category of mistaken release is from \"escort areas\" - places where prisoners are being taken between prisons, to and from court hearings or to immigration removal centres.Around one in 10  were released in error from these areas, the figures show.However it's not clear from the data how many had been convicted or were in prison on remand, awaiting a trial or sentencing hearing.Staffing challengesAt the end of June 2025, there were a total of 36,627 people working in prison service establishments across England and Wales.That's 787 fewer people than a year ago, but well above the staff numbers in previous years.However staff turnover is an ongoing issue.In the year to June, nearly 13% of staff left the prison service, almost twice the 7.1% turnover rate across the Civil Service.Half had spent a year or less in the job.Sickness rates also impact operations.In the year to June, prison staff missed an average of 12 days of work due to sickness. In two out of five cases, the absence was related to a mental health issue.For comparison, average workers in the UK miss just over four days a year due to sickness.Government funding The mistaken releases have led to renewed questions over government funding for the justice system.Former Conservative justice secretary Alex Chalk says the MoJ, which is responsible for prisons, the probation system, courts and legal aid, spends in a year the amount \"spent by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) every two weeks\".MoJ is spending this year is around £13bn  according to the National Audit Office - compared to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which spent nearly £276bn in 2023-24.And, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, the MoJ is expected to be 5.6% smaller than it was in 2010 by the end of the current parliament.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJonny HumphriesLiverpool Crown CourtFormer footballer Joey Barton has been found guilty of six counts of sending \"grossly offensive\" social media posts aimed at broadcaster Jeremy Vine and television pundits Lucy Ward and Eni Aluko.Barton, 43, compared Aluko and Ward to the serial killer couple Fred and Rose West, and called Vine a \"bike nonce\" in posts sent between January and March 2024.Jurors at Liverpool Crown Court accepted the prosecution's argument that Barton, from Huyton in Merseyside, had \"crossed the line between free speech and a crime\". But they cleared the ex-Manchester City and Newcastle player of six other counts of sending a grossly offensive electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety.Judge Andrew Menary KC warned Barton about wearing a scarf printed with a British flag in the dock as a \"stunt\", and told the former footballer's legal team he would not be permitted to wear it when he is sentenced on 8 December. Barton was reminded his bail conditions prohibit him from mentioning his three victims in any way before that hearing.During his trial Barton argued he was the victim of a \"political prosecution\" and that his comments aimed at football pundits Aluko and Ward were simply \"dark and stupid humour\". He said he had been \"trying to make a serious point in a provocative way\".Barton, who has 2.7 million followers on X, also claimed his posts about Vine were merely \"crude banter\" and that in using the phrase \"bike nonce\" he had never intended to imply the radio presenter was a paedophile.Jurors cleared Barton on a charge relating to a post containing a mock apology to Aluko for comparing her to Rose West.That post went on to say: \"She's clearly in the Joseph Stalin/Pol Pot category.\"She's murdered hundreds of thousands if not millions of football fan's [sic] ears, in the last few years.\"However, the jury did convict Barton over a post in which he said ITV pundit Aluko was \"only there to tick boxes\".\"All off the back of the [Black Lives Matter]/George Floyd nonsense,\" he added. Barton was cleared of writing that Ward and Aluko were the \"Fred and Rose West of football commentary\" after an FA Cup tie in January 2024 between Crystal Palace and Everton.But the former Fleetwood and Bristol Rovers manager was convicted of a count relating to another post in which he superimposed their faces onto a photograph of the serial killers.He was also convicted over posts suggesting Vine had visited \"Epstein island\" - a reference to the paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein - and one saying: \"If you see this fella by a primary school call 999.\"In his closing speech to the jury of seven men and five women, prosecutor Peter Wright KC said Barton had crossed the line \"by some considerable margin\" beyond what is tolerable in society.He said Barton was not \"the victim here\" and called the footballer: \"A little bully who takes pleasure sitting there with his phone in his hand and then posting these slurs.\"Directing the jury, Judge Menary explained that the term \"grossly offensive\" in the charges required a \"high bar\" for conviction.\"The criminal law is not there to punish bad manners, sharp humour, or unpopular opinions,\" he said. \"The law only intervenes when the content is of such an extreme, degrading or dehumanising character that society as a whole would say 'that goes too far, that crosses the line of what we can tolerate'.\"Barton was released on bail and Judge Menary ordered a pre-sentence report be prepared.The judge also warned him it would be \"very foolish\" to post anything on social media about the case before then.",

    "body": "Why does GTA 6 keep getting delayed?2 hours agoTom RichardsonBBC NewsbeatRockstar GamesFans will have to wait a little longer to experience the story of main characters Jason and Lucia\"Here we go again.\"When Grand Theft Auto 6 was delayed on Thursday, the famous quote from the series perfectly captured the feelings of many video game fans.Resignation, frustration, déjà vu.It's the second time maker Rockstar Games has told players they'll have to wait even longer for what is likely to be one of the biggest entertainment releases ever.The notoriously perfectionist developer has a history of holding on to its blockbusters until it's happy with them, so the news wasn't a complete surprise.But it has got millions asking what's taking so long, and why. A timelineRockstar Games officially confirmed it was working on GTA 6 in February 2022 and an initial trailer, released almost 18 months later, said it would come out in 2025.It also revealed that the game features two protagonists - couple Jason and Lucia - and takes place in Leonida, a fictional US state based on Florida.Rockstar later announced the game had been pushed back, providing an exact date of 26 May 2026. This got fans excited, especially when some realised it was the date of Bonnie and Clyde's funeral.The famous outlaw lovers are thought to have provided inspiration for GTA 6's lead characters, and the timing seemed too perfect to pass up.But in the end, it was. The game has received another delay and a new release date of 19 November 2026.What's taking so long?Rockstar GamesPictures from the game show characters hanging out in the seedier parts of Vice CityEven Grand Theft Auto is not immune from factors that affect any company making a modern blockbuster video game.Development has become more expensive, more complex, and the gap between big releases has been widening.But there are some challenges unique to Rockstar.The first is hype.Both of GTA 6's trailers have smashed YouTube viewership records, and it regularly tops lists of the public's most-anticipated games.Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive, has said that each new release from the developer needs to wow players.Rockstar is known for breaking new ground with its games, and its last big release, the western adventure Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR 2), helped to bolster that reputationIt is still widely considered a benchmark for open-world video games due to its depth and obsessive attention to detail, despite coming out in 2018.The studio's impressive track record is attributed to its famously high standards which, in turn, creates ever-higher expectations for its games.Maintaining its rep is something Rockstar appears to take seriously - both RDR 2 and 2013's GTA 5 were delayed twice.And when Mr Zelnick was quizzed on GTA 6's recent delay at a meeting with investors this week, he told them those working on the game were \"seeking perfection\".A money-making machineRockstar GamesRockstar has released images of the game's large cast of charactersAnother unique factor in Rockstar's case is the continued success of its existing library.GTA 5 is the second best-selling game of all time, and continues to rack up sales 13 years after release.It sold 730,000 copies in the UK alone last year, according to the Entertainment Retail Association, while RDR 2 sold 350,000 copies in the same period.That put both games in 2024's top ten for video game sales.And then there's GTA Online, the wildly successful multiplayer mode that continues to rank among the world's most-played games every month. It's been credited with bringing in a big chunk of the $8.9bn (£6.7bn) the series has reportedly made since the release of GTA 5.Its sequel is expected to be one of the most expensive video games of all time, but Rockstar is still making money from its older titles.However, Take Two said this week that it had seen an expected decline in GTA Online's numbers. Experts have previously told BBC Newsbeat that the true success of GTA 6 will be measured by how well it manages to lure current players over to its own online mode.Will GTA 6 get delayed again?Rockstar GamesWe'll be waiting: Some fans are happy for Rockstar to take their timeWhere GTA is concerned, there are no guarantees.Rockstar has previously been accused of forcing employees into \"crunch\", or mandatory overtime, in order to hit release dates and deadlines.The practice, which has been employed by other big game developers, has been heavily criticised for keeping workers away from their families and driving them to exhaustion.Rockstar said at the time no-one was forced to work extra hours but it was always looking at methods to improve the ways it worked. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who published in-depth reports on RDR 2's development, said there appears to be a \"real desire\" from studio management to avoid crunch on GTA 6.Earlier this week, 30 employees who were sacked by Rockstar accused it of trying to prevent them from unionising.The company denied this and accused the workers of committing gross misconduct by sharing confidential information - something the IWGB Game Workers' union has rejected.It is unlikely that the sackings are directly related to the recent delay, but the loss of experienced staff could have an impact on the game's development.For now, most fans seem happy to wait a little longer for what many of them expect to be the \"game of the century\".Whether their patience will pay off, or be wasted, is in the hands of Rockstar.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "6 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterAlamyITV has said it is in \"preliminary\" discussions to sell its broadcasting business to Sky for £1.6bn, a move that could reshape the UK's television landscape.The talks focus on ITV's Media and Entertainment division, which includes its free-to-air TV channels as well as the ITV X streaming service.The discussions with Sky, which is owned by US-based Comcast, come as the television industry faces fierce competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+.The deal would not include ITV's production arm - ITV Studios - which makes popular programmes such as Love Island and I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here.However, one analyst said the broadcaster could lose those shows if the deal goes through as the channel would have to bid alongside rival companies for the contracts, despite ITV being the biggest customer at present.Tom Harrington, from Enders Analysis, said: \"It would be unlikely for current shows to leave ITV as there will already be agreements in place.\"But splitting the two businesses could make it less likely for new shows to appear on ITV, he added.Comcast, which owns Universal Studios, bought Rupert Murdoch's Sky in 2018 and is a major player in the US media sector. It owns NBCUniversal, which contains the NBC and CNBC channels, DreamWorks Animation and streaming service Peacock.Media analyst Ian Whittaker told the BBC's Today programme that a combination of Sky and ITV would mean they had \"70% plus\" of the UK TV advertising market, which he said \"in normal circumstances\" would be rejected by regulators because of the dominance it would give them.But he added that with rising competition from the streaming services raising questions over the future of TV, a takeover could be seen as almost a rescue deal.Mr Harrington said ITV Studios itself was a \"very desirable operation\" that was \"unencumbered by a legacy linear [TV] business\".Sir Peter Bazalgette, television executive and producer, who was chair of ITV until September 2022 and is a shareholder in the company, told the Today programme that the deal made sense given the pressure from streamers.On the question of whether a Sky-ITV link up would run up against competition issues, Sir Peter said the regulator needed to \"redefine\" what the advertising market is.He said Google owner, Alphabet and Facebook owner, Meta should be treated as the rivals, not the traditional TV advertising market.Talking about ITV's TV channels, he said: \"Free to air channels across world are not seen to have a great amount of value,\" adding that \"there's going to be an inevitable consolidation of domestic broadcasters all across Europe\".Mr Whittaker said streaming was where the growth was for broadcasters - even though with established streamers \"the penetration rates have started to level off in the past couple of years\" in the UK. He added that competition was also now coming from YouTube TV, which showed live events such as sports and news.A recent report from media regulator Ofcom found that YouTube has become the UK's second most-watched media service, behind only the BBC.Big live sporting events, traditionally shown on television, may also increasingly move to streamers as sporting giants such as UEFA seek to cash in on the huge streaming market.ITV Studios, which makes programmes for several platforms including the BBC, Netflix and Amazon, has reportedly been the subject of takeover talks in the past. It made the hit TV series Alan Bates vs The Post Office, and popular anime series One Piece on Netflix.ITV's share price was up 15% at about 78p following news of the takeover talks, although that remains well below the high of 258p reached in 2015.Liberty, one of ITV's biggest shareholders, recently sold half of its 10% stake in the broadcaster.But Liberty might be \"kicking itself\" at this move, said Dan Coatsworth, an analyst at AJ Bell.He said it was \"a surprise\" there was an interest in ITV's TV channels, describing it as a \"ball and chain\" compared with ITV Studios, which he called \"the jewel in ITV's crown\".Sky's interest was \"Christmas come early for management and shareholders\", he  added, saying ITV Studios could be \"an instant takeover target itself\" as content-hungry streamers seek a hub to generate more programmes to feed their platforms.On Thursday, ITV forecast that its advertising revenue would be 9% lower in the last three months of 2025, saying that advertisers were being cautious ahead of expected tax rises in the Budget.The broadcaster also said it would carry out a further £35m in cost savings, which would lead to some programmes being delayed until next year.",

    "body": "3 hours agoTiffany Wertheimer and Alys DaviesGetty ImagesElon Musk became the first person ever to achieve a net worth of more than $500bn (£370.9bn) in OctoberTesla boss Elon Musk has been one of the world's richest people for several years now, and that wealth recently went stratospheric when he became the first half-trillionaire.Despite this, Musk has insisted he leads a largely unglamorous lifestyle. He said in 2021 that he lived in a Texas home valued at $50,000 (£38,000).His former partner Grimes, with whom he has two children, told Vanity Fair in 2022 that he does not live the extravagant life of excess luxury many assume.\"Bro does not live like a billionaire. Bro lives at times below the poverty line,\" she told the magazine. Once, she said, he refused to buy a new mattress, despite her side having a hole in it.While his day-to-day living quarters may not be as lavish as one might expect, he is known to have a love of unique cars, including one that can morph into a submarine. He also has a private jet collection, worth many millions of dollars.And then there was that small splurge back in 2022, when he bought Twitter for a casual $44bn.The luxury mansions - that he soldMusk once had an impressive real-estate portfolio. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2019 that he had spent $100m on seven houses in about seven years - most of them a stone's throw from each other in the prestigious neighbourhood of Bel-Air, California.Collectively, the properties boasted swimming pools, a tennis court, wine cellar, private library and a ballroom. One was a ranch house once owned by legendary Willy Wonka actor Gene Wilder.But in 2020, Musk had a change of heart - tweeting that he would be \"selling almost all physical possessions\" and \"will own no house\".\"Don't need the cash. Devoting myself to Mars and Earth. Possession just weigh you down,\" he wrote.There was one stipulation - that Gene Wilder's house, \"cannot be torn down or lose any [of] its soul\". He did indeed sell the three-bedroom property - to Wilder's nephew, Jordan Walker-Pearlman, after giving him a multi-million dollar loan to buy it. But in June 2025, Musk reclaimed ownership, after Mr Walker-Pearlman reportedly fell behind on the repayments.In 2021, Musk tweeted that his \"primary home\" was a modest prefabricated house that cost him about $50,000 on the southern tip of Texas, where his aerospace company SpaceX operates - an area that has officially become a city called Starbase. \"It's kinda awesome,\" Musk said about the humble dwelling.The following year, Musk said he did not own a home at all, using it as an example of how low his consumption is, despite his enormous wealth.\"I'm literally staying at friends' places,\" he told head of media organisation TED, Chris Anderson. \"If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most of Tesla engineering is, I basically rotate through friends' spare bedrooms.\"This is nothing new - in 2015, then-Google CEO Larry Page told author Ashlee Vance that Musk was \"kind of homeless\".\"He'll e-mail and say, 'I don't know where to stay tonight. Can I come over?'\"There has been various speculation over the years that Musk is buying up properties around the US, however the home in Texas appears to be the only official house he personally owns.Getty ImagesBel-Air has been home to many Hollywood icons and celebrities, from Beyoncé and Jay-Z to Alfred HitchcockCars that are out of this worldWhile Musk does not spend big on property, cars are a different matter.As the owner of Tesla, it's not surprising that he has a large collection of unusual, and in some cases extraordinary, vehicles.They have included a Ford Model T, the 20th Century car credited with being the first affordable vehicle, revolutionising the motor industry.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe Ford Model T - nicknamed Tin Lizzie - made cars affordable for the average worker in the early 1900sOthers were a 1967 Jaguar E-Type Roadster, which Musk is said to have coveted since he was a child; a 1997 McLaren F1, which he crashed and spent a lot of money repairing before selling; and a Tesla Roadster, which was the first Tesla model to go on sale and was famously fired into space by Musk in 2018. The most unusual, however, is the 1976 Lotus Esprit driven by James Bond in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me. In the film, the car, nicknamed Wet Nellie, could transform into a submarine. Musk bought the car in an auction in 2013 for almost $1m with the aim of making its submarine transformation capabilities a reality once more. Screen Archives/Getty ImagesMusk bought Wet Nellie with the aim of re-engineering its submarine capabilitiesFlying to workMusk has admitted that planes are another thing he is happy to splurge on, but insists it is to do with his dedication to his work.\"If I don't use the plane, then I have less hours to work,\" he said in the 2022 TED interview.Among the private jets in his collection are a number of Gulfstream models, which cost tens of millions of dollars each. He uses them to travel between SpaceX and Tesla sites in the US, as well as for international travel.Unconventional philanthropy?Musk has donated billions of dollars in shares to charities, according to US regulatory documents, and has pledged many millions to various causes. But his philanthropy has been criticised.The New York Times last year called it \"haphazard and largely self-serving - making him eligible for enormous tax breaks and helping his businesses\".His charitable organisation, the Musk Foundation, says on its website that it is \"dedicated to advancing humanity's progress through ground-breaking scientific research, technological innovation, and ambitious endeavours that push the boundaries of what is possible\".But the New York Times reported that the foundation fell short of the amount it was required to give away for three years in a row. The paper, which saw the foundation's tax filings, also found that many of its donations went to organisations with links to Musk.Elon Musk, and the Musk Foundation have been contacted for comment.When asked about philanthropy and charitable causes in the past, Musk appeared to be sceptical of traditional charitable gifts.\"I think if you care about the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it, philanthropy is extremely difficult,\" he told Chris Anderson in 2022.To Musk, the very existence of his business ventures is philanthropic: \"If you say philanthropy is love of humanity, they are philanthropy,\" he insisted.Tesla is \"accelerating sustainable energy\", he said, while Space X \"is trying to ensure the long-term survival of humanity\" and Neuralink \"is trying to help solve brain injuries and existential risk with AI\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterJeremy Corbyn's new left-wing party is in a stand-off over £800,000 raised by Zarah Sultana, who is meant to be founding the party with him.The money was raised when Sultana launched an unauthorised membership scheme for people wanting to join the group currently operating under the name Your Party.Senior figures have accused her of withholding the funds despite publicly agreeing to transfer the money.A spokesperson for Sultana said she \"is in the process of transferring all funds and data\" but was conducting \"essential due diligence as part of this process\".But the delay has sparked anger among Your Party insiders, who say the funds are essential for its founding conference later this month. A source in the party said it would likely be \"forced to reduce delegate numbers\" at the event. The problems stem from a schism in the party caused when Sultana launched a membership portal through its official email account, taking payment and data from an alleged 20,000 people.The money was held by MoU, a company set up in April to hold donations for the fledgling movement.Corbyn branded the emails \"unauthorised\" and urged supporters to cancel direct debits.The membership portal was later replaced, but not before the dispute escalated into legal threats and accusations of a \"sexist boys' club\".The pair have since reconciled.The plan had been to transfer all the money and data from MoU to Your Party after it was registered with the Electoral Commission on 30 September, then wind up the company. But the money, believed to be around £800,000, has not yet been transferred.Last week, the founding board of MoU, which included former Labour mayor of North of Tyne Combined Authority Jamie Driscoll, resigned en masse - making Sultana the sole director.In a joint resignation statement, the three directors insisted they wanted to transfer the funds but Your Party officials had ignored questions about governance and legal liabilities.Your Party officials have dismissed MoU's complaints as irrelevant and accused it of shifting the goalposts. Officials claimed they sent multiple proposals to move the funds, but were ignored by MoU.A Your Party spokesman said \"We are focused on delivering a successful founding conference for our members. \"While this task is made considerably harder by the continued retention of Your Party funds by MOU Operations Ltd, we will not allow anything or anyone to stop this party from going ahead. \"Working-class people need a party which stands up for them.\"A spokesman for Sultana, Sultana, a co-director of Your Party, said: \"Zarah is in the process of transferring all funds and data to Your Party, as she has already made clear publicly. \"Obviously, she has a duty to conduct essential due diligence as part of this process.\"The row is the latest twist in a turbulent start for the party, which has attracted tens of thousands of members but been dogged by internal disputes over leadership and even the party's name.Sultana has pushed for the party to be called The Left Party, while Corbyn hinted the name Your Party could stay.Members will vote on the official name at a founding conference in Liverpool on 29 29 November.Despite high-profile clashes, Sultana told the BBC the party was a \"40-year project\" aimed at \"running\" the government.Sultana said she hopes to co-lead the new party with Corbyn, but will \"throw her hat in the ring\" if members opt for a single leader when the party constitution is agreed at conference.",

    "body": "41 minutes agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Manjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

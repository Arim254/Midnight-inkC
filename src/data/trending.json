It led to what some saw as the unjustified cancellation of a prize-winning writer and teacher - but to others, was a long overdue reckoning for the world of publishing.

The Government says the legislation is designed to protect the mental wellbeing of Australian children and teens – but it’s already proving controversial, not least among American tech companies and some politicians who see the ban as a threat to free speech.  \nIn today’s episode, we are joined by Katy Watson, the BBC’s Australia correspondent, to discuss how the country became a global test case for a bold new policy – and crucially, whether it will succeed.  \nProducers: Cat Farnsworth, Aron Keller and Xandra Ellin\nMix: Travis Evans\nSenior News Editor: China Collins\nPhoto: A teen using her phone ahead of social media band for users under 16.

    "body": "The Church of England is considering a complaint against the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury over her handling of an abuse allegation.Dame Sarah Mullally has been accused of improperly handling a complaint against a priest in London, where she currently serves as bishop.Church authorities said the complaint about her was initially made to Lambeth Palace - the home of the Archbishop of Canterbury - in 2020, but was not followed up due to \"administrative errors and an incorrect assumption about the individual's wishes\". They said Dame Sarah was not told of the complaint at the time it was made.She is due to take office on 28 January and said the victim had been \"let down\".\"While his abuse allegations against a member of clergy were fully dealt with by the Diocese of London, it is clear that a different complaint he subsequently made against me personally in 2020 was not properly dealt with,\" she said in a statement. \"I am seeking assurance that processes have been strengthened to ensure any complaint that comes into Lambeth Palace is responded to in a timely and satisfactory manner.\"Earlier this week the complainant spoke to the Premier Christian website, saying that the way the case was handled had a serious impact on his mental health.Premier said it had seen evidence that when the complainant filed his original case against an accused priest, Bishop Sarah contacted the priest involved about the allegations, breaching the Church's disciplinary protocols.The complaint against her was not formally dealt with and Lambeth Palace officials now say that they assumed the complainant no longer wished to proceed but are understood not to have sought confirmation of this with him.A spokesman for Lambeth Palace said Church authorities had written to the complainant - known as N - to outline the next steps.\"The Bishop of London was unaware of the matter, as the process never reached the stage at which she would have been informed of the complaint or its contents.\"The provincial registrar has apologised to those involved and urgent arrangements are now being made for the complaint to be considered according to the relevant statutory process.\"Dame Sarah, a former NHS chief nurse, became a priest in 2006 and was appointed as the first female Bishop of London in 2018 - the third most senior member of clergy in the Church of England.She was named as the next Archbishop of Canterbury - the first woman to take on the role - in October after Justin Welby resigned over a safeguarding scandal.He stepped down after a damning report into a prolific child abuser associated with the Church. It found that he \"could and should\" have reported John Smyth's abuse of boys and young men to police in 2013.His last day in the role was in January and the Church, as a result, has been without someone in the top job for almost a year. The Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, has been taking on most of Mr Welby's responsibilities in an interim move.Mr Cottrell was one of the voting members of the body charged with choosing his successor. but has himself faced calls to step down over his handling of an abuse case.",

    "body": "11 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterPresident Donald Trump has launched a scheme offering fast-tracked US visas to wealthy foreigners who can pay at least $1m (£750,000).The card will give buyers a \"direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,\" Trump said on social media on Wednesday.The Trump Gold Card, which was first announced earlier this year, is a US visa awarded to those who can demonstrate they will provide a \"substantial benefit\" to the country, according to the scheme's official website.It comes as Washington intensifies its immigration crackdown, including raising work visa fees and deporting undocumented migrants.The Gold Card scheme promises US residency in \"record time\" and will require a $1m fee which is \"evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States\", the programme's website said.Businesses sponsoring employees are required to pay $2m, along with additional fees. A \"platinum\" version of the card that offers special tax breaks will also be available soon for $5m, the website said.Extra fees to the government may be charged depending on each applicant's circumstances, the site said. Individuals are also required to pay a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee before their application is reviewed.The gold card scheme has faced criticism since it was first announced in February, with some Democrats saying that it would unfairly favour wealthy individuals.When Trump first unveiled the plan he described the visas as similar to green cards, which allow immigrants of various income levels to live and work permanently in the US. Green card holders typically become eligible for citizenship after five years.But the Gold Card is aimed specifically at \"high-level\" professionals, Trump said, emphasising, \"we want people that are productive\".\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"The scheme comes as the Trump administration has devoted significant resources to deporting immigrants.The US has also paused immigration applications by individuals from the 19 countries, mostly in Africa and in the Middle East, which are subject to the president's travel ban.The government has also halted all decisions on asylum applications and said it would review thousands of cases that were approved under the administration of President Joe Biden.In September, Trump also signed an order to charge a $100,000 fee for applicants of the H-1B visa programme for skilled foreign workers. The decision caused panic among overseas student in the US and technology firms. The White House later clarified that the fee would apply only to new applicants who are currently abroad.",

    "body": "Sir Chris Hoy says he is on crutches and \"hobbling about\" after breaking a leg in a cycling crash which he described as the \"worst\" of his life.Six-time Olympic champion Hoy announced in October 2024 that his cancer is terminal, but the 49-year-old has continued to ride his mountain bike since entering \"a bit of a stability period\" in his treatment.However, in an interview with Sky Sports, the Scotsman said: \"I've smashed my leg up, that's the worst thing that's happened recently. You just don't bounce like you do when you're younger.\"It was a big one. I'm doing better now, I'm still on crutches, hobbling about.\"Worse things happen. I've been riding bikes for 43 years and it's the worst crash I've ever had. I'm pretty lucky that's the worst one I've had in all those years of riding.\"Hoy, whose seven Olympic medals also include one silver, is Britain's second-most decorated Olympic athlete behind fellow track cyclist Sir Jason Kenny (seven golds).He also claimed 11 World Championship golds and 34 World Cup titles before retiring in 2013.\"I want to live my life and I want to make the most of it. None of us are here forever so you want to make the most of the time you have and do the things you enjoy,\" said Hoy.\"I've just had an unfortunate spill and it's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm doing alright now, I wasn't doing so well in the immediate aftermath of it, but looking forward to Christmas.\"Hoy announced in February 2024 that he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. He confirmed in October 2024 that his diagnosis was terminal after the primary cancer spread to his bones, with doctors giving him between two and four years to live.Hoy said his terminal cancer diagnosis has improved his life \"in some ways\" because it has changed his outlook.\"It's changed my life without question, but I think in some ways it's improved my life,\" Hoy told BBC Sport in November.\"It's changed my outlook on a lot of things. I'm not as bothered by small things. I think I try and focus on the here and the now, enjoying the moment, making the most of today, and trying to find something positive in any situation.\"I'm doing well. I'm able to keep doing all the things that I enjoy, spend a lot of time with my family, and I hope to be around for a lot longer yet.\"",

    "body": "The Queen has recorded a special radio broadcast with the BBC racing commentator John Hunt, whose wife and two daughters were murdered at their home last year.Louise Hunt, 25, her sister Hannah Hunt, 28, and their mother Carol Hunt, 61, were killed by Louise's ex-partner Kyle Clifford at their home in Bushey, Hertfordshire, on 9 July last year. Mr Hunt and his daughter Amy were invited by Queen Camilla to Clarence House as part of a special edition of BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which will be broadcast on New Year's Eve.A fundraising gala for the Hunt Family Fund, set up in the memory of Carol, Louise and Hannah, will take place on Thursday evening. At Cambridge Crown Court in March, Clifford, 27, was sentenced to a whole life order, after pleading guilty to the murders and his conviction for raping Louise. The announcement of the special broadcast coincides with the final day of the UN's 16 days of activism against gender-based violence. Recorded on 27 November, the broadcast was chaired by the BBC's Emma Barnett and included former prime minister Baroness Theresa May, who will guest edit the Today programme on 31 December.Earlier this year, Mr Hunt and his daughter said they were both keen to keep the spirit of their loved ones alive. Mr Hunt said: \"From the moment I wake up, I say good morning to each of them.\"Sometimes I say out loud to Hannah and Louise: 'Girls, sorry I can't be with you, I'm with your mum at the moment'. As I close my eyes at night, I chat to them as well.\" MS Hunt said: \"My mum, Hannah and Louise became a statistic. \"They became victims of Kyle Clifford.\"I want to breathe life back into my mum, Hannah and Louise as fully rounded people.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoSimon Jack,Business editorandArchie MitchellWatch: GSK boss Dame Emma Walmsley lays out competitions facing the UKWhile successive governments have stressed that the UK is a superpower in life sciences, in the eyes of one of the country's biggest pharmaceutical companies, the US is the best place to invest.The boss of the vaccines and medicines giant GSK, Dame Emma Walmsley, has told the BBC the company will invest $30bn (£23bn) in the US by the end of this decade.The cash injection across the pond comes as other major drug makers have pulled UK projects worth billions after years of frustration over NHS drug budgets and pressure from President Donald Trump to set up production in the states.And despite a new deal which will see the NHS pay more as part of a zero tariffs deal on shipping UK pharmaceuticals to America, Dame Emma is not going to \"shy away\" from GSK's US investment plans.The US is where the pharma giant makes more than half its turnover and is \"still the leading market in the world in terms of the launches of new drugs and vaccines,\" she says. Alongside China, it is \"the best market in the world to do business development\".GSK's latest stateside investment drive followed US pharmaceutical company Merck - which is called MSD in Europe – scrapping a planned £1bn expansion of its UK operations.UK drug maker AstraZeneca has also announced it is pausing a planned £200m investment in a Cambridge research facility while ploughing tens of billions of dollars into the US.Other drug companies have also said there is little appetite to invest in the UK, which successive governments have insisted is a life sciences superpower. Dame Emma, who will leave GSK in January after eight years at the helm, stressed that GSK remains committed to the UK, noting that the interview was being carried out in its new global headquarters in London.\"No one should be deluded that the UK is going to be a massive scale market, a domestic market, but it can be an exporter of innovation in life sciences,\" she says.\"For GSK, it's 2% of our sales are here. More than 50% are in the US. But we're very heavily invested, and remain committed to being invested in terms of manufacturing and research and development.\"Despite challenges facing Britain's pharmaceuticals industry, Dame Emma welcomes the deal to scrap tariffs on UK drug shipments to the US as \"a step in the right direction\" for Britain.The deal means the UK will pay more for medicines through the NHS - in return for a guarantee that US import taxes on pharmaceuticals made in the UK will remain at zero for three years.Dame Emma says it is a welcome reversal of a long term decline in the portion of the NHS budget spent on medicines compared to other countries' health systems. The move, she suggests, will encourage the kind of innovation that supports ground-breaking new medicines, such as GSK's new asthma drug which can be taken twice a year and could slash hospital admissions by 70% for serious asthma sufferers.GSK hopes the new treatment will be approved for use by the NHS within weeks. Asked about the health of the UK, Dame Emma says there are \"social demographic root causes\" for its decline.She says health outcomes vary widely depending on where you live: \"You can probably get a 10 or 15-year difference in lifespan prospects depending on which postcode you're in.\"Dame Emma pointed to British diets and a lack of education around nutrition as part of the problem.  \"I think there's no question that the food system is fundamentally something we need to look at harder.\"Dame Emma also opened up about the differences she has experienced between the NHS and the private healthcare system in the US, having given birth in London, Paris and twice in New York.\"Both the experience of childbirth and all the follow up that happens afterwards are very, very different,\" she says. \"Anything from the advice you're given.. .the frequency with which you are expected to be visited, how long you are in hospital and what kind of follow-up advice.\"Dame Emma added what matters is the balance of price, access and outcomes, and that the NHS still has \"work to do\" on getting the balance right.Dame Emma, who also sits on the board of Microsoft, says the world is on the cusp of major advances in health science thanks in part to advances in AI which promise to accelerate innovation \"90% of the projects in our industry don't work, they take a decade and cost billions. Getting to a place where you just double that to you know, instead of 10% working, 20% working will completely change the trajectory of innovation.\"In the end, she adds, few things are more important than health. \"It is one of the few things that every single person on the planet ends up caring about.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoCara BerkleyBBC ScotlandBBCThe letter will go on display at Perth Museum for three monthsThe public are to be given a rare chance to see the last letter by Mary Queen of Scots, which was written just hours before she was beheaded.Mary penned the letter in the cell where she had been imprisoned for 19 years by her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I.Mary tells her brother-in-law, King Henry III of France, that she is \"to be executed like a criminal at eight in the morning\".The manuscript will be on show at Perth Museum for three months.It will be the first time in a generation that the letter will be on prolonged public display.There were long queues outside the National Library of Scotland's George IV Bridge building in Edinburgh the last time it went on show in 2017.Mary Queen of Scots was executed on 8 February 1587 for plotting against Elizabeth.The four-page letter was written in her native French from her prison cell at Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire.Mary asserts her right to the English crown and her belief that she was being persecuted for her Catholic faith.She says: \"I scorn death and vow that I meet it innocent of any crime.\"Mary also asks for her servants' wages to be paid after her death, and signs off: \"Your very loving and most true sister, Mary R.\"Chris Cassells says the letter has a \"relic-like quality\"The manuscript is usually kept in secure storage at the National Library of Scotland (NLS).Chris Cassells, head of archives and manuscript collections, said it was incredibly special to see it \"in the flesh\".\"It is really important in that it gives us an insight into Mary's final hours on earth. It is obviously testimony to how she views herself in those final moments,\" he said.Mary Stuart was nine months old when she was crowned Queen of Scots following the death of her father, James V, in 1542.She was raised in France, where she married the heir to the throne, the Dauphin Francis.Mary was widowed by the age of 18 and returned to Scotland to rule as queen at a time when her Catholicism was viewed with suspicion.Shona Hunter says they want to reduce the amount of light on the letterMr Cassells said Mary's \"sincerity of religious conviction\" stood out in the letter which had a \"relic-like quality\".\"It's in her own hand. It has her signature. She touched it. She folded it up to be sent off to France in the hours right before her death.\"So it's undeniably a really special document.\"The manuscript is kept in a specially-designed mount to protect it from damage.Shona Hunter, who works conserving documents at the NLS, said they had to strike a balance between giving people access now while also making sure others will be able to see it in the future.\"It's such an important and precious document that we're really careful about who will see it because we want to reduce the amount of light that will fall onto the object,\" she said.Mary Queen of Scots was executed in 1587Bright or ultraviolet light, in particular, could cause irreversible damage to the letter.\"What we need to do is monitor, control and, where possible, just reduce the amount of light exposure and that way we protect it for generations to come.\"The letter will be on display for three months as part of an exhibition at Perth Museum which is due to open on 23 January.Ashleigh Hibbins, head of audiences at the museum, said it was a \"huge coup\".She said Mary had many links to the area and spent a lot of time in Perthshire.\"Most famously, she was actually imprisoned for 11 months in Loch Leven Castle, \" she said.This was where she abdicated the throne in favour of her baby son, James VI.Ashleigh Hibbins, head of audiences at the museum, said it was a \"huge coup\"James was estranged from his mother from infancy and raised a Protestant.In 1603, following the death of Queen Elizabeth I without a direct heir, he became James I of England, uniting the crowns of the two old enemies.The fractured relationship with his mother Mary was evident in the hours before her death.She wrote: \"As for my son, I commend him to you in so far as he deserves, for I cannot answer for him.\"Ms Hibbins said she believed the intrigue around the life and death of the \"doomed queen\" would attract visitors.\"To have her last words on display for the first time in a generation, and we believe the first time it's been seen north of Edinburgh, is just fantastic for us,\" she added.\"It feels like a bit of a homecoming.\"",

He was in a critical condition after hitting his head on a rock, and would spend the next eight weeks in hospital isolated from his family because of Covid restrictions.But this was still only the start of his ordeal – he told his mother he wished he had never woken up as he faced the prospect of learning the most basic of tasks again.Now the 33-year-old from Rogerstone, Newport, says he enjoys his life more and, after five years of gruelling physiotherapy, he is helping others by volunteering on a brain rehabilitation unit.Looking back to the dark days that followed the accident, he said: \"At that time I wanted to be dead.\"I said to my mum I wish I'd never woken up.\"David WhiteMr White has endured five years of gruelling physiotherapy which included learning to walk againIt was in September 2020, the engineer set out with friends for a day paintballing in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan.After this activity passed fairly uneventfully, the group was packing up to go home, when David had what seemed like a minor fall, which left the right side of his skull crushed.He remembers waking up in intensive care and wondering what the doctors and nurses would tell him about his injuries as they milled around.The bombshell news that he would need surgery to reconstruct his skull and may never walk again left him in an \"atrocious\" state mentally.His brain injury exacerbated his previously mild obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms, and he described being in hospital as \"unbearable\".He was also coming to terms with his new situation alone, as he was only allowed to see his mother and partner a few times over the first month in hospital because of Covid restrictions.David WhiteDavid had to have surgery to reconstruct his skullBut from the depths of despair, he has rebuilt his life – and recently got engaged.\"There are bits and pieces of my body that don't work properly, so I learned to compensate in some way so I walk funny,\" he said.\"It's getting those muscles to work properly again.\"I'll never been the same as before but I'm getting as close as possible.\"Unable to do his old job, he said he started to think what a help it would have been to have been able to talk to someone else recovering in hospital from a brain injury and decide to volunteer.At Llandough Hospital, he tells people there is hope and a future out there.His enthusiasm and bravery means brain injury charity HeadwayUK has nominated him for an award for his contribution.One thing he points out is that the recovery can be very slow – explaining that he is still having physiotherapy now, five years later.\"There are times when I see other people moving around so much more easily than I can and I wish this didn't happen, but at the same time, I'm happy with my life,\" he said.\"If my accident hadn't happened I wouldn't be going out to help people like I do now and that is what I love to do.\"If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.More Top Stories",

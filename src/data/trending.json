    "body": "There were two key talking points at the first of two pre-season tests in Bahrain - whether the new cars were still \"Formula 1\", and the performance of the new Red Bull engine.Four-time champion Max Verstappen said the revised cars and engines had turned the highest level of motorsport into an exercise in \"management\".\"As a pure driver, I enjoy driving flat out,\" Verstappen said. \"And at the moment, you cannot drive like that. A lot of what you do as a driver, in terms of inputs, has a massive effect on the energy side of things. For me, that's just not Formula 1.\"The reigning world champion Lando Norris did not agree, saying the new cars were \"a lot of fun\" and pointing out that Verstappen was welcome to race somewhere else if he didn't like it.Mercedes' George Russell - who has a tense relationship with Verstappen and a friendly, wind-up one with Norris - was somewhere in the middle.\"If you've got the best cars for us to enjoy, it doesn't mean it's going to give the best racing,\" said Russell. \"And you can argue potentially the racing will be a bit more chaotic.\"'The chef can drive the car' - AlonsoIf you watched the hour's worth of coverage shown on television at the end of each day, you might have been wondering what all the fuss was about.The cars are clearly different in some ways from previous years, but they still look and sound recognisably like F1 cars on a superficial level.In the cockpits, though, they are very different, as a consequence of the biggest regulation change in the sport's history.The cars, engines and tyres are all built to new rules this year and they are running for the first time on carbon-neutral sustainable fuel.The engines are at the heart of the drivers' concerns, whether enjoying the cars or not.The cars are energy starved - the electrical part of the engine now produces about half its total power, while the batteries are about the same size as last year.The various ways of recovering the energy so it can be deployed to maximum lap-time effect are changing the traditional sense of what being a racing driver is about.The demand for energy recovery is forcing teams to run the electrical motors against the engines along the straights and in the corners.That means the engines have to rev high in the corners, so drivers are using lower gears. As Russell pointed out, drivers have to take the corners in ways that maximise energy use over a lap, rather than simply go as fast as they can at all times. As a consequence, they will not always be on the limit of grip.Veteran Fernando Alonso, a two-time world champion who is regarded by his peers with the highest possible levels of respect, said the team's chef could drive his car around Turn 12, so far below the limit was he in the attempt to save electrical energy.\"Here in Bahrain, Turn 12 has historically been a very challenging corner,\" Alonso said, referring to an uphill right-hand sweep towards the end of the lap.\"You used to choose your downforce level to go Turn 12 just flat. So you remove downforce until you are in Turn 12 just flat with new tyres and then in the race. So it was a driver skill, decisive factor to go fast in a lap time.\"Now in Turn 12 we are, like, 50km/h slower because we don't want to waste energy there and we want to have it all on the straights.\"So to do Turn 12 at 200km/h instead of 260, you can drive the car, the chef can drive the car at that speed.\"So I understand Max's comments. But at the same time this is Formula 1 and it has been always like that.\"Now it is the energy, last year or two years ago, when he won all the races, it was downforce. He could go in the corners at 280km/h and we could go in the corners at 250km/h because we didn't have the downforce.\"Alonso urged caution before jumping to too many conclusions at this early stage of the new rules.\"We still love motor racing, we still love competing and for the regs I understand there is less input by the driving skills,\" he said, \"but I think after three or four races maybe we have a better idea.\"Are Mercedes hiding pace?Judging competitiveness in testing is always difficult because there are so many variables and teams do not reveal the specification in which they run their cars. Indeed, in many cases teams may try to deliberately fool people.But that did not stop Red Bull's rivals noticing something striking about their new engine - it seemed able to deploy more energy for longer on a more consistent basis than other teams.Although Verstappen set only the seventh fastest absolute lap time of the test, Russell said Red Bull's underlying pace was \"pretty scary\".He said that, on current evidence, Red Bull were \"going to be ahead\" at the first race, adding: \"We hope we can catch up.\"Red Bull technical director Pierre Wache rejected this analysis, saying \"clearly the top three teams - Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren - are in front of us\".Race simulations are usually the best way of judging relative pace, and there Verstappen was consistently gaining about 0.6secs a lap on Norris on the straights when they were running concurrently. Fuel loads and engine modes are not known, of course.But the quickest race simulation of the week was done by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, who had the edge on pace over Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari when running at the same time on Friday.Hamilton was matching the pace set by team-mate Charles Leclerc the day before, which was a chunk quicker than Norris was managing at the same time.The complication here is that there may well be an element of politicking involved, because in the background there is a rumbling row about the engine rules, with Mercedes at its centre.Their rivals believe Mercedes have found a loophole in the rules defining the engines' compression ratios. The claim is that this allows them to comply with the rule that dictates the compression ratio is measured at ambient temperature, but then run the engine on track at a higher ratio by clever exploitation of thermal expansion.Ferrari, Honda, Red Bull and Audi are said to be pushing for a ruling from the FIA before the first race that would stop this.So when Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff described Red Bull as the \"benchmark\" on the first day of the test, there were those who wondered whether he was doing so in an attempt to persuade the powers that be that a rule change before the first race was not necessary.But perhaps Mercedes' rivals were playing this game, too. Verstappen described Wolff's remarks as \"a diversion tactic\". Leclerc said he believed Mercedes were \"hiding a lot more\".On the competitive picture, according to Leclerc, Red Bull and Mercedes were at the front, with Ferrari a little behind, \"but it doesn't seem to be too much of a gap for now\". World champions McLaren, he said, were \"a little bit more difficult to understand\".McLaren team principal Andrea Stella urged people to \"just be careful looking too much into what we see in testing. However, early indications from a competitiveness point of view, definitely put Ferrari and Mercedes at the top of the list in terms of those that seem to be ready from a performance point of view in particular\".'The bottom line is we are slow'Behind the top four, there appears to be a gap of in the region of 1.5 to two seconds before a midfield group comprising Haas, Alpine and Audi, followed by Racing Bulls and Williams. At the back are Cadillac and Aston Martin, who are the one team being completely transparent about their performance.There is so much attention and expectation on Aston Martin, with Alonso at the wheel, design legend Adrian Newey at the helm since March, and Honda their new works engine partner.But the year has started badly. The car is way off the pace - around four seconds, Alonso's team-mate Lance Stroll said on Thursday.Break that down over the lap using GPS data available to all teams, and it seems about 1.5secs of it is from the engine and the rest from the car, which performs worse the slower the corner gets.How, one might wonder, is this possible?The answer seems to be a combination of the car design process being behind, partly because of Newey's late arrival, partly because the team are building their own gearbox for the first time ever, and Honda being behind because… well, there is no clear answer to that one.Honda officially pulled out of F1 at the end of 2021, and dismantled much of its engine department before changing its mind in 2023. But it still had people working on upgrading its existing engine in the meantime, and its lead time for the new regulations has not been very different from Red Bull's, and yet the Japanese company seem to be nowhere in comparison.Alonso was not happy about Aston Martin's performance on Thursday, throwing his gloves down at one stage after getting out of the car. And who can blame him?This could be his final season in F1. He is 45 in July and out of contract at the end of the year. Spending it at the back was not what he was expecting.\"Definitely we are not in the position we wanted to be,\" Alonso said, pointing out they had been late to start testing, that reliability was still not good, and that was costing them time to hone the car.The former F1 driver Pedro de la Rosa, who has been with the team as long as Alonso and has now been appointed team representative to take some of the load off Newey, said: \"Looking back is always easy. If we had possibly started earlier, if Adrian would have been here not 2 March, but a few months earlier, if Honda wouldn't have gone and then come back - it's ifs and buts.\"Bottom line is we are slow. We're not where we want to be. Let's get a plan together. Let's look ahead, not back [at] what went wrong.\"It was many reasons. The important thing is that we we know what they are.  That's what gives us the confidence that slowly, gradually, the difference will shrink.\"Fastest lap times, Bahrain test one1 Kimi Antonelli (Ita) Mercedes one minute 33.669 seconds2 George Russell (GB) Mercedes 1:33.9183 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Ferrari 1:34.2094 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 1:34.2735 Oscar Piastri (Aus) McLaren 1:34.5496 Lando Norris (GB) McLaren 1:34.6697 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 1:34.7988 Oliver Bearman (GB) Haas 1:35.3499 Esteban Ocon (Fra) 1:35.57810 Franco Colapinto (Arg) Alpine 1:35.80611 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Audi 1:36.29112 Isack Hadjar (Fra) Red Bull 1:35.61013 Gabriel Bortoleto (Brz) Audi 1:36.67014 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Alpine 1:36.76515 Alex Albon (Thi) Williams 1:36.79316 Liam Lawson (NZ) Racing Bulls 1:36.80817 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Cadillac 1:36.82418 Carlos Sainz (Spa) Williams 1:37.18619 Arvid Lindblad (GB) Racing Bulls 1:37.47020 Lance Stroll (Can) Aston Martin 1:38.16521 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Aston Martin 1:38.24822 Sergio Perez (Mex) Cadillac 1:38.653",

    "body": "US politicians urge Mandelson to give evidence over Epstein10 hours agoRichard WheelerPolitical reporterBBCPeter Mandelson has been urged to answer questions as part of a US Congress investigation into paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a letter to Lord Mandelson, two Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee said it is \"clear\" the former British ambassador to the US \"possessed extensive social and business ties\" to Epstein.They added Lord Mandelson holds \"critical information\" linked to their investigation to Epstein's operations and have requested he makes himself available for a transcribed interview.Lord Mandelson has expressed regret for his continued association with Epstein and apologised \"to the women and the girls who suffered\".  The BBC has contacted him for comment.The committee cannot compel Lord Mandelson to appear before the committee and the request has come from Democrats Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam.The pair told Lord Mandelson they were seeking his \"cooperation\" with the committee's investigation into Epstein's \"sex-trafficking operations\".They said it was seeking to \"uncover the identities of Mr Epstein's co-conspirators and enablers and understand the full extent of his criminal operations\". The letter states: \"While you no longer serve as British Ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that you possessed extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein and hold critical information pertaining to our investigation of Epstein's operations. \"Given the appalling allegations regarding Epstein's conduct, we request that you make yourself available for a transcribed interview with committee staff regarding the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"They have asked Lord Mandelson to provide a response to them by 27 February.Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his titles, including \"prince\", last October following months of pressure over his ties to Epstein. He has always denied wrongdoing.Police investigationLord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025.He was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of this relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against the former government minister came after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents including emails to and from the US financier.Messages from 2008 appeared to show Lord Mandelson - who was at the time business secretary in Gordon Brown's government - discussing Treasury plans for a one-off tax on bankers' bonuses with Epstein.Other emails appeared to indicate that Lord Mandelson gave advance notice to Epstein of a €500bn bailout from the EU to save the Euro.Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.",

    "body": "3 hours agoGetty ImagesInvestigators have found DNA at the home of Nancy Guthrie, the missing mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie, which does not belong to her or those in close contact to her, local officials said. The Pima County Sheriff's Department said they are working to identify who the DNA belongs to, but would not disclose where it was located. Investigators also found several gloves, with the closest discovered approximately two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home.The 84-year-old disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, nearly two weeks ago. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.The sheriff's department said reports that a glove was found inside her home or on the property are inaccurate. All collected evidence has been sent for laboratory analysis, they added.It said investigators had been able to establish identifying details about the suspect after analysing footage from a doorbell camera outside Guthrie's home.Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homeThe suspect was wearing a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack in the footage, the FBI said. After the doorbell footage was released, investigators received more than 13,000 tips, including 4,000 in the 24 hours.The FBI has also increased the reward for information about Guthrie's disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.The county sheriff department said the suspect description \"remains a key focus\", adding: \"However, investigators are not ruling out any individuals or possibilities.\" Investigators have also issued a wider appeal for video footage from Guthrie's neighbours.Police have said Nancy Guthrie, 84, needs daily medication and has limited mobility.Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's abductor.They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her safe return.",

    "body": "4 hours ago\"Palestine Action ban ruled unlawful in blow to ministers\" leads the Guardian, after the High Court ruled on Friday that the decision to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation was unlawful. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will appeal the decision, which the paper says will leave the fates of the 2,500 people who have been arrested for their support of the group uncertain.The Mail has focused on Lord Mandelson, and claims he took \"ghost flights\" on a Russian oligarch's private jet to a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, while serving as EU trade commissioner. The paper also features a photo of British skeleton racer Matt Weston, who won a gold medal in the Winter Olympics in Italy on Friday night.Weston is also front and centre of the Times, which highlights the fact that it is Team GB's first medal of the games. But the paper leads on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's upcoming speech at the annual Munich Security Conference. It says he will use the moment to launch his \"strongest attack to date\" on Reform UK and the Green Party, declaring both \"ideological extremists who would undermine Britain's national security\". Reform says the comments come from a \"prime minister on the verge of being hounded out of office\", while the Greens said he is a \"caretaker prime minister running scared\".The electoral commission has said that ministers do not have sufficient reasons to delay local elections, according to the Telegraph. Vijay Rangarajan, the chief executive of the watchdog, told the paper that ministers had created a \"conflict of interest\" by allowing councillors to decide whether ballots should be postponed. The government is in the midst of a major overhaul of local government structures, and has previously said the \"vast majority\" of elections would still be going ahead.An interview with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay leads the Sun. He told the paper that Brooklyn Beckham, who has had a \"bitter falling-out\" with his parents, needs to remember where he came from. The chef is a close family friend of Sir David and Lady Victoria Beckham, and the paper says he has been \"acting as peacemaker\".The Prince of Wales is pictured alongside Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on the front page of the Mirror, with the headline: \"A stain on the family\". The paper alleges that Prince William clashed with King Charles III and the late Queen Elizabeth over his uncle's 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, and told them that Mountbatten-Windsor was a threat to the monarchy.The weekend edition of the i also hones in on the former prince, reporting that his former royal protection officer has spoken to police \"offering to help their inquiry into links\" with Jeffrey Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously strenuously denied any wrongdoing relating to the convicted sex offender.Meanwhile, the FT reports on quotes from the chief executive of London's Heathrow Airport, who said that passengers in the \"wrong place\" make it feel overcrowded. \"The problem is that all the British people keep to the left and normally Europeans keep to the right,\" he said.The Express leads with its own campaign to honour emergency workers who put their \"lives on the line\" with a medal.And in the Daily Star, \"race ace\" jockey Ruby Walsh is guest editing the Saturday edition. He says: \"Cheltenham's the best of Britain\".Related Internet Links",

The Beckhams have yet to formally respond.One of the most explosive claims Brooklyn made is that Lady Beckham \"hijacked\" the first dance at his wedding, which - he says - had been planned \"weeks in advance\" to a romantic love song.\"She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life,\" he said.A report from British Vogue, who were at the wedding, said: \"Brooklyn invited his mother on stage for a dance and they were joined by David and their 10-year-old daughter, Harper.\"In his interview with the Sun, Ramsay, who was at the wedding, insisted nothing \"salacious\" or \"inappropriate\" took place.Ramsay said \"the relationship with David and Brooklyn is very, very deep and I know how much David loves Brooklyn\".\"I think it's only going to be a matter of time before Brooklyn takes a good look at himself,\" the chef said.He added: \"It's easy to get up on that roller coaster and get carried away, but it will come back\". Asked if he had spoken to Brooklyn, Ramsay said they had messaged \"a little bit\" and that he \"loves him\".\"He's desperate to stand on his own two feet,\" Ramsay said, but he urged Brooklyn to remember \"one day you're not going to have your Mum and Dad\".Ramsay was speaking to the Sun ahead of the release of his new Netflix documentary Being Gordon Ramsay.Sir David has not directly discussed the fall out, but speaking generally about social media in January, he said children are \"allowed to make mistakes\".",

    "body": "'As a Jew - I no longer feel safe in the UK'2 hours agoYunus Mulla,North WestandLauren Hirst,North WestBBCYoni Finlay said antisemitism had been \"allowed to grow, and normalise\" A survivor of the Manchester synagogue attack has said he does not feel safe in the UK after discovering he could have been caught up in another plot to kill.Yoni Finlay was shot by a stray police bullet as he barricaded the doors of Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue during a deadly attack in which two people were killed in October 2025. The 40-year-old had feared for some time that an attack like this could unfold on the streets where he had grown up.\"You fear somebody is going to attack us and that's why we have the security that we do and they do a great job but there's always a chance of something happening,\" he said.But unbeknownst to him, Finlay could have been caught up in an earlier attack if the plot had not been foiled by an undercover police operative.The men had arranged for guns to be smuggled into the UK as part of an \"Isis-inspired plot\". Prosecutors said the men planned to launch a gun assault on a march against antisemitism by the end of summer 2024, and then head to north Manchester to kill more Jews.In one message, Saadaoui said: \"Here in Manchester we have the biggest Jewish community [outside of London]. \"We will carry out here.\"The next day, he took the undercover operative to areas where Jewish communities live in Manchester - this time to identify specific targets he wanted to attack after targeting a march.Finlay was among the thousands of people who attended a march against antisemitism in Manchester in the summer of 2024.At the time, he and his fellow marchers were completely unaware that a plan had been foiled, potentially targeting that event. He only found out when he returned home from hospital after being shot.\"I think for everybody there was an element of it was going to happen because antisemitism has been allowed to grow and fester and become normalised,\" Finlay said.Finlay was among the thousands of people who attended a march against antisemitism in Manchester in the summer of 2024.There had been a similar march earlier in 2024 in January, which Finlay had also attended.\"There's an undercurrent of hate, there's an undercurrent of antisemitism, an undercurrent of we don't want you here,\" he said.\"That's very difficult to live with on a day-to-day basis.\"My son won't walk down the street wearing a kippah in case he's identified as Jewish, he has had threats, he has had things shouted at him.\"I am a Mancunian. I've lived here my entire life.\"I'm a Manchester United fan, always have been, so this is where I feel I belong but at the same time it's not safe for us.\"GMP/ ReutersWalid Saadaoui (left) and Amar Hussein (right) arranged for guns to be brought into the UK to attack the Jewish communityBut despite this, Finlay said he was determined to not let these fears dictate his life.\"I think it's important to not allow terrorism, to not allow hatred to win,\" he said.Saadaoui and Hussein were sentenced to life with a minimum term of 37 and 26 years respectively after being found guilty of preparing acts of terrorism between 13 December 2023 and 9 May 2024.A third man, Saadaoui's younger brother Bilel Saadaoui, 36, was also convicted of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism and was sentenced to six years.

    "body": "Trump says Iran regime change is 'best thing that could happen'4 hours agoHarry SekulichReuters/ EPATrump previously refused to back calls to replace the government led by Ayatollah Ali KhameneiUS President Donald Trump says regime change in Iran is \"the best thing that could happen\", signifying one of his clearest endorsements for replacing the clerical establishment.\"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives,\" he said on Friday.Trump declined to specify who he wants to lead Iran, but noted \"there are people\" who could take over. Iran's clerical ruler Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has not yet responded to Trump's latest remarks.Meanwhile, the US sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to add pressure on Iran to secure a nuclear deal.The USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship and the newest US aircraft carrier, is set to relocate \"very soon\" from the Caribbean to the Middle East, Trump said. On his Truth Social platform, Trump shared an aerial photograph of the carrier,  which appears in transit on its way to join a second US vessel – the USS Abraham Lincoln – already stationed in the Middle East.The Pentagon sent the aircraft carrier in January after the US threatened to strike Iran to stop a government crackdown on mass protests in which thousands of people were killed.The wave of demonstrations marked some of the most dramatic upheavals in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution, which installed the clerical system led by a Supreme Leader.While Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no nuclear agreement can be reached, he insisted after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday at the White House that talks with Tehran would continue.Speaking at Fort Bragg on Friday evening, Trump said Iran should \"give us a deal that they should have given us the first time\" when asked what the Middle East country should do to avoid an attack.The US has pushed for Iran to halt its uranium enrichment, while Netanyahu's government has insisted Tehran should cut its ballistic missiles programme and support for proxy groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.Iran has so far suggested it is ready to limit its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, but the country's President Masoud Pezeshkian warned it would \"not yield to their excessive demands\".Trump withdrew the US from an Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran in his first term in office and reinstated sanctions that have severely strained its economy. The administration restarted talks last year to reach a new deal before the 12-day war between Israel and Iran.",

    "body": "4 hours agoLiberal DemocratsEd Davey painting pottery during a visit to ManchesterThe Liberal Democrats believe hobbies could be the answer to the UK's growing problem of loneliness and social isolation.The party has said £42m could be spent to extend the opening hours of spaces such as libraries and community centres, while a further one-off £40m could go towards helping existing hobby groups hold outreach events or buy equipment.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Sharing a passion with others in your community is one of the most powerful ways to fight loneliness.\"The government says it is committed to helping people to make social connections across a wide range of its social policies. At the end of last year, the Office for National Statistics research found that 33% of Britons aged 16 to 29 reported feeling lonely \"often, always or some of the time\". Long-term loneliness can have damaging health consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia in later life. The NHS has, in recent years, started investing in 'social prescribing' which allows health professionals to refer patients suffering from loneliness to charity-run services such as art classes or gardening.In 2023 more than one million people were referred to NHS social prescribing services.The King's Fund health think tank has said there is a \"growing body of evidence\" that suggests social prescribing can lead to positive outcomes, such as boosting someone's self-esteem as well as improving their mental and physical health. However, it has said there are gaps in the evidence base including, the optimal circumstances for delivering social prescribing. The Liberal Democrats have argued that the country faces a \"silent epidemic of loneliness\" and that a lack of community spaces is forcing people to find human interaction online.The party has said it would set up a 'Hobby Hub' network - listing libraries, community centres and pubs where groups could meet for activities - and integrate the network into social prescribing programmes. The hobby hubs would give GPs additional options when recommending activities for their patients.It has estimated that £42m of funding per year could help hobby hubs in England stay open for an additional 300,000 hours. Sir Ed said: \"The Liberal Democrats want to breathe new life into British high streets and community centres to give everyone a place to do what they love, with other people who love it too. \"It is so important that we do not allow isolation to become the new normal.\"Culture minister Stephanie Peacock has previously said: \"This government is committed to supporting people to have the social connections they need across the nation.\"Rather than treating loneliness as a standalone issue we are embedding this across wider government strategies, including the National Youth Strategy, the Pride in Place Strategy and the Men's Health Strategy.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoMadeline HalpertandSakshi VenkatramanGetty ImagesJames Van Der Beek kept working after being diagnosed with cancerActor James Van Der Beek seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s and 2000s. With the title role in coming-of-age teen drama Dawson's Creek, he walked some of the industry's hottest red carpets, and his face plastered magazine covers - one even dubbing him a \"new superstar\".But when tragedy struck later in life, his family needed to rely on the kindness of his friends - and fans - for financial help, shedding light on the precarious financial situation of not just many actors, no matter how famous, but millions of everyday Americans struggling with medical bills.Van Der Beek - who had six children with his wife - died on Wednesday at the age of 48 after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer three years ago.The cost of his medical treatments were so financially draining, his wife says, that she has now made a public plea for donations so they would not lose their home. They have raised $2.3m (£1.7m) thus far.Getty ImagesJames Van Der Beek auctioned off the shirt he wore in this promotional stillIn the months before his death, Van Der Beek had shared how cash-strapped the cancer treatments had left him and his family. He even publicly auctioned off items he'd saved for decades from the roles that defined his career - a plaid buttoned shirt he wore in the first episode of Dawson's Creek, a necklace he gifted to Katie Holmes' character on the teen drama series and sports shoes he wore when he starred in the 1999 film Varsity Blues.\"I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now,\" Van Der Beek told People Magazine last November.On top of the costly treatments, Van Der Beek was not making the same cash that he'd seen in the prime of his career decades ago. He had said he was paid \"almost nothing\" for Dawson's Creek and his contract didn't include residuals - payments writers, actors and directors receive when their work is re-aired on television. Actors on other still-popular shows from that same period, like Friends, are said to make about $20m annually from such payments.\"There was no residual money,\" Van Der Beek told Today in 2012.  \"I was 20.  It was a bad contract. I saw almost nothing from that.\"He continued working after his diagnosis, appearing in two episodes of the television show Overcompensating in 2025, but it's unclear whether that was enough to qualify him for health insurance from the prominent actors' union in Hollywood. Actors can qualify for health insurance through SAG-AFTRA only if they work 108 days a year or earn at least $28,090 on union shoots. The BBC has contacted the union.Van Der Beek is not the first high-profile American actor to highlight the issue. Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannen Doherty, who died in 2024, said she did not have insurance when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer.Getty ImagesVan Der Beek and his Dawson's Creek co-stars pictured in 1997Benjamin Byron Davis, 53, an actor who has appeared on television shows as well as in movies like Marvel's Ant Man, told the BBC that decreased residuals have become a problem for actors across the board.\"Revenue streams that actors have depended upon have disappeared,\" he said, noting that the rise of streaming has affected how production companies compensate performers. He said many actors depend on these payments both for income and to qualify for health insurance through their union SAG-AFTRA. \"I work when I'm hired and I survive when I'm not.\"Davis said he lost his health insurance during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strikes. \"There wasn't work,\" he said, adding that he ended up getting it back when the strikes were over and he was able to meet the qualifications again.Davis said that just 10 years ago, the union's minimum earnings for health insurance was a third of what it is now, at a level today that is out of reach for the vast majority of actors.Those who are covered by the union plan get good health coverage, said Valerie Yaros, an archivist with SAG-AFTRA.But it was possible Van Der Beek no longer received the union plan because of his fewer work hours, she added.In 2024, Van Der Beek told People that it had become a \"full-time job\" dealing with cancer treatment appointments and his insurance.A heated debate on health insuranceHis death put a new celebrity face on the debate about rising healthcare costs in the US - an issue that Republicans and Democrats have long recognised needs reform but have disagreed on the best ways to resolve the problem.The US has one of the most expensive health systems in the world, with spending on health care estimated to reach $5.9tn in 2026, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.About 100 million people in the US are estimated to struggle to pay off their medical and dental healthcare debt, according to recent data.The GoFundMe page posted online on Wednesday solicited donations to assist Van Der Beek's widow Kimberley and their six children, whose ages range from 4 to 15.His wife shared the page, which noted the \"significant financial strain\" the family had seen as they \"did everything possible to support James and provide for his care\".\"In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. The costs of James's medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,\" the page reads. \"They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time.\"Even with health insurance, cancer treatment can prove extremely costly for those in the US. Some studies suggest the average monthly cost of chemotherapy can range from $1,000 to $12,000.This is because in the US private health-care system, even those with insurance can face high deductibles and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, said Eva Stahl, the vice president of policy at Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that has paid off about $25bn of medical debt for almost 15 million people.\"People simply can't afford vital, life-saving treatments without going into debt,\" she said. \"When even someone with James Van Der Beek's resources has no option but to fundraise for treatment, it's clear how fundamentally unfair our healthcare system is.\"Michael Short, a graphic artist in Tennessee who has had his own battles with medical debt, told the BBC that his sister has had to declare bankruptcy because of medical debt for treatments for her endometrial and another cancer, even with insurance coverage.\"It's in the hundreds of thousands if not millions for these cancer treatments,\" he said. \"The prices on these medications and on these treatments are just so high.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "7 hours agoKatie Razzall'It's a huge culture shock' say British couple after release by TalibanA British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for seven-and-a-half months have described a \"huge culture shock\" after returning to the UK.Peter, 80, and his wife Barbie Reynolds, 76, said they were never told why they were being held, nor why they were released in September.The couple, who have run a charity programme in Afghanistan for almost two decades, told BBC Newsnight the last five months in the UK have been \"totally different\".\"What we've been through changes us. What we've been through in the last, well decades, but also obviously last year, it reshapes you,\" said Barbie.\"You think differently and you see things differently than we did when we used to live here before.\"While living in their long-term home in Afghanistan's Bamiyan province, Barbie said she wore a Hijab at all times and was not allowed out in public without her husband.\"The freedom here is very striking; people are free to wear what they want, go where they want,\" she said.The Taliban said the pair had broken Afghan laws and were released after judicial proceedings - but has never disclosed the reason for their detention.They were released through Qatari mediation but Peter said the reason for their detention was \"a complete mystery\".The couple, who married in Kabul in 1970, previously said they were detained in 10 different prisons and at one point thought they would be executed.\"I wasn't sure whether Barbie was alive,\" Peter said.Barbie said she shared a prison block with 240 women but there were \"many more blocks with women, with 40 children\".\"It was cramped, there were about seven toilets for that number of people. They tried to fix the showers but they broke again and the drains were always overflowing,\" she said.During Ramadan, Barbie had one meal a day but after Ramadan, they were given the same amount of food but just divided at lunchtime and dinner.\"I became very malnourished and I got anaemia - Peter said I aged 20 years when I next saw him,\" she said.\"Sometimes I could hardly walk and I became really quite poorly.\"Taliban officials maintained the pair received adequate medical care during their detention and that their human rights were respected.One of the prisons Peter and Barbie were held in was Pul-e-Charkhi, a notorious maximum security prison outside Kabul that is home to some of the most dangerous criminals.At one point they were held in basement cells with no windows for two months. For the final weeks of their detention they were moved above ground, where they say they had access to better food and were treated with kindness.Peter said he was \"shocked\" when he saw Barbie after months apart.\"She was no longer a 76-year-old, she was in her 90s,\" he said, adding that his wife was unable to steady herself to walk.They previously said they wished to \"hug\" the people who decided to jail them and forgive them.\"I'd want them to know I'm not holding a grudge against them,\" Peter said.He added that he would love still to work with the government of Afghanistan \"for the good of the people of the country\".\"Hang in there, don't lose your hope,\" said Barbie.",

The pair had initially tried to ski in Val d'Isère, but found the slopes too crowded and decided to go for a walk.\"I was watching people free riding and skiing off-piste, and thought it looks very dangerous,\" said Martignon. \"In 20 seconds there was an avalanche, it went down and took people below.\"Val d'Isère has already experienced avalanches this winter, with one person dying in the resort of Tignes nearby last month.France's national weather service had issued a red alert for avalanche risk across the Savoie region on Thursday, which was then lifted on Friday. But the risk level remained high across the Alps with \"very unstable snow cover\".The avalanche comes in the wake of Storm Nils, which passed through France the day before, leaving between 60cm and 100cm of snow, the weather service said.\"We have had some very complicated, very unstable snow since the beginning of the season,\" Luc Nicolino, slopes manager at La Plagne, told AFP.\"It's a kind of mille-feuille with many hidden, fragile layers.\"You can also get in touch the following ways:Email: yourvoice@bbc.co.ukWhatsApp: +44 7756 165803",

    "body": "14 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentEPAThe Home Office's decision to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation was unlawful, the High Court has ruled.But the group remains banned for now to allow for further legal arguments and to give the government time to consider an appeal.In a massive blow to the government, three senior judges said that, while Palestine Action uses criminality to promote its aims, its activities had not crossed the very high bar to make it a terrorist organisation.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the government would appeal against the court's decision, adding she was \"disappointed\" by the judgment.The decision means that while the group has successfully challenged the ban, expressing support for Palestine Action or taking part in its activities remains a serious criminal offence.A critical issue in the case was whether the ban was impacting the rights of others to protest in support of Palestinian issues, according to the ruling.Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori said it was a \"monumental victory for both our freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people\".She said the Home Office's decision to proscribe the group would \"forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history\". Mahmood said: \"The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by Parliament.\"Responding to the government's intention to appeal the High Court ruling, Ammori said it would be \"profoundly unjust\" for the thousands of people who have been arrested since the ban took effect last July.She added it would be a \"draconian overreach\" to arrest more people on Friday and in the coming weeks for defying the ban, which has been ruled unlawful.After the judgment, the Metropolitan Police said it would not arrest people for expressing support for Palestine Action until court proceedings are fully concluded.But it stressed that despite the \"unusual circumstances\", expressing support is \"still a criminal offence\" and officers will continue to gather evidence of any offences.The proscription made membership of or support for Palestine Action illegal, and more than 2,000 people have been arrested at demonstrations in the months since it came into force.Some 694 of the protesters have been charged with allegedly showing support for the group, which can lead to up to six months in jail.Ammori said the ban had unjustly led to the arrest of thousands of people who had held up signs reading \"I oppose genocide – I support Palestine Action\" - although the High Court said its decision attached \"little weight\" to the circumstances of people who had knowingly supported the group and subsequently been arrested.PA MediaAt least 2,200 people have been arrested at demonstrations since the ban came into effectThe High Court said that when the former home secretary Yvette Cooper decided to ban the organisation last June, she had failed to take into account what impact that decision would have on the right to protest.She had also not fully followed her own policies regarding the test for when an organisation should be proscribed under the Terrorism Act, it added.Prior to the ban, the group's volunteers had been breaking into arms firms linked to Israel, leading to charges of criminal damage.Terrorism legislation permits ministers to ban a group which causes serious damage to property in order to further their cause.The judges said that while \"a very small number\" of Palestine Action's activities met the legal test for acts of terrorism, the standard criminal law could be used to confront the group.They added that when a group is proscribed, people are likely to \"adjust their behaviour\" to avoid the risk they might commit a crime. \"One example of this mentioned in [Ammori's] evidence is her fear that she will be 'no-platformed' – that she will not be invited to speak at events because organisers will be concerned that if someone such as her, previously very closely associated with Palestine Action, does speak that will give rise to an offence under [terrorism legislation],\" the ruling said.Ammori brought the challenge against the ban, with her lawyers arguing it was a \"blatant abuse of power\".The Home Office had tried to stop the judicial hearing from going ahead, arguing that Parliament had set out a specific and alternative process for appealing against banning orders.But ministers' Court of Appeal bid to block the challenge failed in October, paving the way for Friday's ruling.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Palestine Action had engaged in \"organised political violence and cannot be tolerated\". \"Conservatives welcome the Home Office's appeal to this ruling,\" he added.Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson said the ban was a \"grave misuse of terrorism laws\" and placing the group in the same legal category as Islamic State \"risked undermining public trust and civil liberties\".Green Party leader Zack Polanski welcomed the ruling, and said those charged with supporting Palestine Action should have their charges dropped.The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said they were \"deeply concerned\" by the High Court ruling and welcomed the home secretary's plan to appeal against it.",

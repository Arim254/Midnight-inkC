    "body": "New Attenborough doc captures lion saving pregnant hyena from wild dogs 4 hours agoElizabeth DawsonEnvironment ResearcherPregnant hyena forced to take risks, saved by lion-sized distractionRare hyena behaviours have been caught on camera, including a mother-to-be trying to steal food from wild dogs and outsmarting rivals by hiding a stolen carcass underwater to mask its scent.This is just some of the remarkable animal behaviour on display in the new BBC wildlife documentary series, Kingdom, which follows the lives of four rival carnivore families over five years.​​The scenes include poignant moments as the animals face threats from snare trappings to brutal ambushes and violent territorial battles. \"We could never have written a script like this, only nature could write this script,\" said executive producer Mike Gunton.​​Behind the scenes, the Zambia Carnivore Programme works to protect these animals.BBC StudiosLeopard Mutima was followed by filmmakers from a cub to an adult​​The team followed four animal families - leopards, hyena, wild dogs and lions - in Zambia's Luangwa Valley, capturing rare moments and revealing the intricate dynamics of life in one of Africa's wildest regions.Viewers will watch five-day-old lion cubs opening their eyes, alongside dramatic scenes shown in Kingdom for the first time, such as a pack of wild dogs rescuing one of their own from the jaws of a crocodile.Other wild animals like elephants and baboons also feature in the new series, which is narrated by Sir David Attenborough.BBC StudiosThe Luangwa Valley is home to Zambia's largest lion population​\"Everything about these species has been shaped by millions of years of competition alongside each other,\" said series producer Felicity Lanchester. \"Now…humans are changing that,\" she added.Filmmakers and scientific researchers in the region have collaborated behind the scenes as the footage is a valuable source of data, informing conservation strategies.​​\"We got a lot of information that we wouldn't have been able to get otherwise... on topography, diet, movement, births, and deaths,” said Dr Matthew Becker, scientific consultant for the series and CEO of the Zambia Carnivore Programme.BBC StudiosA cinematographer films a curious hyena in ZambiaThe greatest threat these large carnivores face is habitat loss, while snaring and a declining prey base also play a role. Wire traps, or snares, are often set for antelope - both for food and illegal trade - but many large mammals become victims as by-catch.These pressures are changing pack sizes, diets and survival strategies, according to Dr Becker. A single incident can have knock-on effects, impacting dozens or even hundreds of animals.​​In one scene, a wild dog reappears after losing a leg in a snare trap. Despite his injury, his natal pack welcomes him back, ensuring he eats his share and keeps up on hunts.​​For those not as fortunate, the Zambia Carnivore Programme exists to protect them. The organisation, along with other local groups, removes snares, safeguards dens and provides information for law enforcement on illegal trade in ivory and bushmeat.BBC StudiosA pride of lions plays beside a riverReflecting on the conservation focus of the series, Dr Becker said: \"Ultimately, it's a message of optimism in the face of some very concerning trends.\"​​Its incorporation in wildlife programmes is now an inevitability, according to the producers. The external forces acting on these creatures are clear and series like Kingdom can shed light on the need to protect them.Speaking about conservation, ​​series editor, Simon Blakeney, said: ​​\"It’s a challenge, but it's not hopeless.\"Kingdom begins on BBC One at 18:20 GMT on Sunday and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer.

The shop made a second report the next day.Anthony Williams, 32, of no fixed abode, was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder relating to the train stabbing and a count of attempted murder in connection with an attack in London on Saturday.A man was left with facial injuries following the attack at about 00:45 at a station in Silvertown.Cambridgeshire Police said in all three incidents a \"crime was raised\" and investigations launched.Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised police, first responders and the \"heroic\" actions of the driver and the members of staff aboard the train when the \"vile and horrific attack\" took place. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also paid tribute to the \"breathtaking bravery\" and \"heroic acts of the passengers and train crew who intercepted the attacker\".Shaun Whitmore/BBCBritish Transport Police is overseeing the investigation with help from Cambridgeshire PoliceAt about 19:10 on Friday, a 14-year-old was stabbed by a man with a knife in Peterborough city centre.Police said the victim was treated at Peterborough City Hospital for minor injuries and later discharged.Cambridgeshire Police said: \"The offender had left the scene when the call was made and despite a search of the area by officers and a police dog, the offender was not identified.\"PA MediaEmergency teams attended Saturday's train stabbing in which multiple people were injuredAlso on Friday evening, a man was seen with a knife at a barbers' shop in the Fletton area of Peterborough.Police said the incident took place at 19:25, but was reported to officers two hours later at 21:10, by which time the man had left the shop.Officers were not sent, the force added. The same barbers' shop called the police at 09:25 on Saturday to report that a man carrying a knife was at the shop. Officers arrived at the site within 18 minutes and searched the area, but were unable to locate or identify the man.A barbers' shop called police twice to report a man at the premises with a knifeCambridgeshire Police said: \"We are currently reviewing all incidents in the timeframe to understand whether there were any further potential offences.\"British Transport Police retain primacy for the overall investigation, which will include these three incidents.\"Cambridgeshire Police referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), as it typical in these cases. The IOPC, however, said it would not be investigating the incident as \"it did not meet the criteria for a valid referral\".Footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, and Forest fan Stephen Crean were injured during the train attack on SaturdayScunthorpe United footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, and Nottingham Forest fan Stephen Crean were travelling on the LNER train from Doncaster to London King's Cross when they were injured during the attack at about 20:00 GMT.Mr Gjoshe was slashed across the bicep and had been operated on, his club said.Mr Crean has been hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, going face to face with him in the carriage.He described how he \"tussled\" with the man, who was shouting at him as he slashed him on the head and hand.He said he was determined to confront the attacker to give another passenger time to close the door of the buffet car, where other passengers had gathered.

We practise our emergency response and keep up to date with our knowledge of the route, so if needed, we know exactly where to stop and what to do.\"The action I took is the same as any other driver. \"I think my colleagues onboard were the real heroes and I'd like to pay tribute to their bravery.\"Related internet links",

They are among 10 people injured on the train during the mass stabbing.Footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, and Forest fan Stephen Crean were travelling on a LNER train from Doncaster to London King's Cross when they were attacked at around 20:00 GMT.Mr Crean has been hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, going face to face with him in the carriage.Mr Gjoshe was slashed across the bicep and has been operated on, his club said.Anthony Williams, 32, has been remanded in custody following the incident and is charged with 11 counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a bladed article and one count of actual bodily harm. One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident.'Incredible bravery' of train crew and passengers saved livesWhat do we know about Cambridgeshire train stabbings?Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Mr Crean's left hand could be seen heavily bandaged and he still had blood in his hair. He is one of the train passengers the 32-year-old is accused of attempting to murder.Mr Crean described how he \"tussled\" with the man who was shouting at him as he slashed him on the head and hand.He said he first saw people running down the train shouting that there was a man with a knife. As people ran to the buffet car he said he wanted to make sure passengers were safe.\"I saw him coming towards me - a guy with a rucksack and he's obviously got something in there.\"Everyone's gone towards the buffet, and that is on the verge of being full up. There's no-one else getting in there. I wasn't even going to bother pushing to get in.\"There's young women and they need to get them in. I confronted this guy, because I've got to make sure that the door's locked and I've looked around to save a bit of time.\"But then he started, he pulled this thing out. It was an over large blade thing\".Mr Crean said the man asked him: \"Do you want to die? Do you want to die?\" \"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms with him and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and must have caught me on the head.\"Scunthorpe UnitedScunthorpe United football player Jonathan GjosheMr Crean says it's nice to hear that people are calling him a hero but that he wasn't the only one.\"It's lovely to hear. But I'd say there are other heroes like the police and the guys that got me off the train and the ambulances and the hospital staff, they're probably real heroes.\"And the train guy that's really badly injured. So, you know, it's a big shout to call someone a hero, but it's nice.\"He says he was determined to confront the attacker to give another passenger time to close the buffet door. \"That door still wasn't shut behind me, because I could still see him struggling to close it. So until I knew it was I wasn't moving away from it.\"Stephen Crean still had blood in his hair when he spoke to the BBC",

    "body": "2 hours agoSeveral papers lead with news that police are probing whether a man accused of stabbing 10 people on a train that passed through Peterborough on Saturday had been involved in separate incidents in the 24 hours before the attack. According to the Daily Express, \"three opportunities may have been missed to stop an alleged knifeman\", adding that 999 calls were made about three separate incidents in the lead up to the train stabbings. The paper quotes a statement from Cambridgeshire Police which says it is \"currently reviewing all incidents in the timeframe to understand whether there were any further potential offences\".The Metro says that an \"investigation\" has begun into whether police \"missed a series of chances\" to stop Anthony Williams, 32, who was accused of 10 attempted murders on the Doncaster to London train on Saturday night, \"another at a DLR station in the capital hours earlier, weapons offences and assaulting a police officer while in custody\".Williams' alleged links to separate stabbing incidents also leads the Times. It writes Cambridgeshire Police referred itself to the police watchdog, the IOPC, but it did not meet the criteria for a referral because \"none of the injured had made police contact before they were attacked\".The police's investigation into the alleged train attackers links to \"a string of earlier knife-related incidents\" leads the Independent.\"Three heroes have been praised for trying to stop Saturday's train horror,\" the Daily Mirror reports. The paper writes the train driver was \"hailed\" for making an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon station, while a train staff member and passenger were \"hurt as they confronted the knifeman\".The Daily Star leads with a profile on the \"hero football fan Stephen Crean\", reporting he \"grabbed a knife from the train attacker\". The paper says Mr Crean was asked by the attacker \"do you want to die?\"Meanwhile, various other papers lead with mooted tax rises in the November Budget. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \"signals 'tough but fair' Budget\", the Financial Times reports. Sir Keir \"promised to tackle the national debt but ruled out deep cuts to public spending\", the paper writes. It adds that many Labour MPs are \"resigned\" to  the Chancellor Rachel Reeves breaking the party's manifesto pledge \"not to raise rates of income tax, national insurance or value added tax (VAT)\".\"Reeves paves way for tax-raising budget,\" the Guardian writes, giving a preview of the chancellor's speech later today \"in which she will be 'candid' about the tough choices ahead\".The Daily Mail also leads with a preview of the chancellor's speech on Tuesday in Downing Street, reporting she will \"address 'speculation' about the contents of her November 26 Budget – when she is expected to raise taxes by up to £30billion\". \"Chancellor to give strongest hint yet that she will raise income tax in a key pre-Budget speech,\" leads the i Paper.The Daily Telegraph reports that the BBC \"doctored\" a Donald Trump speech by \"making him appear to encourage the Capitol Hill riot\", according to an \"internal whistleblowing memo\" seen by the paper. It writes that a Panorama programme broadcast a week before the 2024 US presidential election \"misled\" viewers. The paper says a 19-page dossier on \"BBC Bias\" was compiled by a recent member of the BBC's standards committee and \"is now circulating in government departments\". The paper quotes a BBC spokesman who says: \"While we don't comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "10 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterCivil service bosses have told MPs that Lord Mandelson, who was sacked as UK ambassador to the US due to close links with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was never formally interviewed for the job.The head of the civil service, Sir Chris Wormald, said there was no interview because Lord Mandelson was directly appointed to the role.MPs heard that process meant Lord Mandelson was not directly asked about any conflict of interest with interviewers in person, but instead needed to fill in a form aimed more at potential financial conflicts.Sir Chris said this process has been changed since Lord Mandelson's exit, to ensure a formal, minuted interview happens.Lord Mandelson replaced career diplomat Dame Karen Pierce in Washington DC in December 2024, when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer decided he was the best candidate to build links with the newly-elected Trump administration. Concern around Lord Mandelson's friendship with Epstein were raised at the time, but his ability to deal with President Trump, as well as his ability as a networker and seasoned political operator, was seen as a valuable asset.That changed when emails were published showing Lord Mandelson sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced charges for sex offences in 2008, which the government insisted was new information about the \"depth\" of the pair's relationship.Sir Keir fired him in September, a day after having told MPs the Labour peer retained his \"full confidence\" at PMQs.Ambassadors are managed by the Foreign Office and the civil service, and bosses of both were answering questions from MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee.Foreign Office head, Sir Oliver Robbins, was asked whether Lord Mandelson went through the normal process for appointing an ambassador and told MPs: \"No, it was different because this was not run as a standard civil service process.\"Labour MP Fleur Anderson asked whether Lord Mandelson's interview specifically included the opportunity to share \"anything that could bring the government into disrepute\".Sir Chris said: \"There was no interview for Mr Mandelson, it was done as a direct appointment by ministers, as Sir Oliver has described, and therefore there was no panel interview.\"That was the normal practice for direct ministerial appointments.\"Changes have been made since Lord Mandelson's sacking, Sir Chris added, \"so that we effectively replicate what would normally happen in a panel interview... where there is a minuted conversation with the candidate\".Sir Oliver said Lord Mandelson did complete a conflict of interest form, but when pressed on whether that included \"friendships\", he said: \"No, it's not a sort of reputational conflict that's being targeted by that form, it's about reality of perception of economic or financial conflicts.\"The two were also questioned on why Sir Keir appeared not to have been fully briefed about the seriousness of the new information by civil servants before defending Lord Mandelson at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs).Conservative MP Sir John Whittingdale set out how emails were sent to the Foreign Office by journalists at Bloomberg on Tuesday evening. He said: \"It must have been apparent to you before the prime minister got up at 12 o'clock on Wednesday that this was pretty explosive and did somebody not say to Number 10 'hold on, just before you express your complete confidence in Lord Mandelson there's something here you might like to be aware of'.\"Defending the material being treated \"sensitively and as a management issue\", Sir Oliver said he needed to treat Lord Mandelson \"as an employee to whom I owed a duty of care\". Sir John responded: \"So you're saying to protect Lord Mandelson you gave no indication to Number 10 before PMQs that you had come across information which might cause serious doubt as to the appropriateness of his position?\"Lord Mandelson had not had a chance to respond to the Foreign Office about the \"veracity and risks\" around the emails ahead of PMQs, Sir Oliver said, adding \"I had not personally spoken to the prime minister, no.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "14 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporter BBCKemi Badenoch said the Conservative Party nearly ran out of money when she took over as leader, following their worst-ever election defeat.Badenoch said she inherited a party facing internal problems, with donors considering pulling funding after the loss of 250 seats in last year's general election - the worst result in Conservative history.Speaking to the BBC's Newscast to mark her first year as Conservative Party leader, Badenoch said she spent her first months \"working furiously behind the scenes\", leading to some thinking her team \"were not doing anything\".But Badenoch defended her position arguing: \"Without money, a party can't survive.\"Asked if there was risk that the Conservatives could have gone bankrupt, Badenoch said: \"Yes, there was.\"Badenoch would not say how near the party came to going running out of money, but admitted there was a moment when donors could have walked away.Speaking to the BBC, she said keeping donors on board \"actually took quite a lot of my time\" which she wished she had spent \"out there a bit more\".Badenoch insists the party is now on a firmer footing and has begun to set out a new policy agenda, thanks to the groundwork she laid in the first few months. That work culminated in a policy announcement blitz during her party conference speech in October, where she outlined plans to end stamp duty and pull Britain out of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).In a wide-ranging interview, Badenoch spoke about learning on the job, including thinking of Prime Minister's Questions \"like a panto\" rather than a cross-examination. The Conservative leader admitted she initially spent a day preparing arguments and statistics, only to find that people were not following what she was saying.No matter how much she prepared, Badenoch said Sir Keir Starmer would simply dismiss her points as \"rubbish\".\"I just thought this isn't working,\" she said.\"It is more theatre than it is a prosecution or interrogation.\"\"It is the nature of British politics that we will have a panto\" while political debate in other countries will have other \"culturally appropriate analogies\", she argued.Focusing instead on one thing during PMQs and \"peeling it back like layers of an onion\" had allowed her better scrutinise the prime minister.Badenoch also dismissed talk of rivals plotting against her.Several senior figures, including former leadership rival Robert Jenrick and rising star Katie Lam, have attracted headlines with interventions on issues such as banning the burka and deporting migrants.From today, backbench MPs can launch a vote to potentially topple Badenoch, as the grace period stopping them from submitting letters expressing no confidence in her expires after her first year in office.But Badenoch claimed she had told colleagues \"go on instinct\" and post what they liked on social media to rally support ahead of the party's first conference. \"Just make sure that if it's something that is a new policy line that you check it just so we don't end up going off in different directions,\" she added.Ahead of this month's Budget however, Badenoch said she was instilling greater focus among her colleagues on the party's economic pitch. Despite Reform UK's commanding poll leader, Badenoch denied Nigel Farage was the government's main opposition, arguing she had forced major policy shifts on grooming gangs and the Winter Fuel Allowance.Reform was \"an existential threat\" to every party, she said, adding: \"It is very clear that Reform is hoovering up a lot of discontent, but discontent is not a policy for government.\"She accused Farage's party of chasing headlines and argued Reform's policies \"do not stand up to scrutiny\".Her comments came as Farage rowed back on his party's previous promise to deliver tax cuts worth £90bn a year.Speaking on Monday, Farage said \"substantial tax cuts\" were not currently \"realistic\" because of the \"dire state\" of the public finances.",

    "body": "Budget will be 'fair' says Reeves as tax rises expected4 hours agoJennifer MeierhansBusiness reporterPA MediaTax rises could mean reversing a core election manifesto pledge of not raising VAT, National Insurance or income taxChancellor Rachel Reeves says she will take \"fair choices\" in the Budget as economists continue to predict tax rises to try to balance the books.Reeves is expected to give a speech to Downing Street later ahead of the 26 November Budget. Labour explicitly ruled out a rise in VAT, National Insurance or income tax in its general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said with an \"emergency press conference\" Reeves was \"all but confirming what many feared - higher taxes are on the way\". He called for the chancellor to be sacked if she \"breaks her promises yet again\".Meanwhile influential think tank the Resolution Foundation has said tax rises are now \"inevitable\".Avoiding cuts to VAT, NI or income tax \"would do more harm than good\", warned the foundation which has close links to Labour - Treasury Minister Torsten Bell was previously its chief executive.Hiking income tax would be the \"best option\" for raising cash, it said, but suggested it should be offset by a 2p cut to employee national insurance, which would \"raise £6 billion overall while protecting most workers from this tax rise\".Extending the freeze in personal tax thresholds for two more years beyond April 2028 would also raise £7.5 billion, its Autumn Budget 2025 preview suggested.The chancellor is expected to say in a speech on Tuesday morning that the Budget will focus on \"fairness and opportunity\" to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living. \"You will all have heard a lot of speculation about the choices I will make,\" she is expected to say.\"I understand that - these are important choices that will shape our economy for years to come.\"But it is important that people understand the circumstances we are facing, the principles guiding my choices – and why I believe they will be the right choices for the country.\"The message from Reeves is expected to echo comments made by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to a group of Labour MPs on Monday night. He told those gathered that the Budget would be \"a Labour Budget built on Labour values\" and that the government would \"make the tough but fair decisions to renew our country and build it for the long term\". The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is widely expected to downgrade its productivity forecasts for the UK at the end of the month. This could add as much as £20 billion to the Chancellor's costs if she is to meet her self-imposed \"non-negotiable\" rules for government finances. The two main rules are:Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliamentTo get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliamentThe Treasury declined to comment on \"speculation\" ahead of the OBR's final forecast, which will be published on 26 November alongside the Budget.However last week, the chancellor confirmed both tax rises and spending cuts are options as she aims to give herself \"sufficient headroom\" against future economic shocks.The Resolution Foundation said changes in the economic outlook and policy U-turns are likely to reduce the current £9.9 billion of headroom against the chancellor's borrowing rule into a fiscal black hole of around £4 billion.It urged Reeves to double the level of headroom she has against her fiscal rules to £20 billion. This would \"send a clear message to markets that she is serious about fixing the public finances, which in turn should reduce medium-term borrowing costs and make future fiscal events less fraught,\" its Budget preview said.It comes after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said last month there was a \"strong case\" to increase the headroom. It said the lack of a bigger buffer brought with it instability, and could leave the chancellor \"limping from one forecast to the next\".",

    "body": "13 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analyst, JerusalemIDFMajor General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned on Friday, admitting her role in leaking the videoThe former top lawyer in the Israeli military has been arrested, as a political showdown deepens over the leaking of a video that allegedly shows severe abuse of a Palestinian detainee by Israeli soldiers.Maj Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned as the Military Advocate General of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) last week, saying that she took full responsibility for the leak.On Sunday, the story took a darker turn when she was reported as missing, with police mounting an hours-long search for her on a beach north of Tel Aviv.She was subsequently found alive and well, police said, but was then taken into custody.The fallout from the leaked video is intensifying by the day.Broadcast in August 2024 on an Israeli news channel, the footage shows reserve soldiers at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel taking aside a detainee, then surrounding him with riot shields to block visibility while he was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object.The detainee was treated for severe injuries.Five reservists were charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm to the detainee. They have denied the charges and have not been named.On Sunday, four of the reservists wore black balaclavas to hide their faces as they appeared at a news conference outside the Supreme Court in Jerusalem along with their lawyers, who demanded the dismissal of their trial.Adi Keidar, a lawyer from the right-wing legal aid organisation Honenu, claimed his clients were subject to \"to a faulty, biased and completely cooked-up legal process\".Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe leaked surveillance video was filmed at the Sde Teiman military base in southern IsraelOn Monday, it emerged the detainee at the centre of the case was released to Gaza in October as part of an exchange with Hamas of convicted prisoners and detainees held without charge by Israel for hostages held by Hamas since 7 October 2023. Last week, a criminal investigation was launched into the leaking of the video.Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was put on leave while the inquiry took place.On Friday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said she would not be allowed to return to her post.Shortly after that, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned.In her resignation letter, she said she took full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from the unit.\"I approved the release of material to the media in an attempt to counter false propaganda against the army's law enforcement authorities,\" she said.That is a reference to efforts by some right-wing political figures in Israel to claim that the allegations of severe abuse of the Palestinian detainee had been fabricated.She added: \"It is our duty to investigate whenever there is reasonable suspicion of acts of violence against a detainee.\"After her resignation, Katz issued a fierce condemnation of her conduct.\"Anyone who spreads blood libels against IDF troops is unfit to wear the army's uniform,\" he said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed his defence minister's words on Sunday, saying that the incident at Sde Teiman was \"perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the State of Israel has experienced since its establishment\".Hours later, the first reports began appearing in the Israeli media that Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was missing, sparking fears that a political scandal had taken a turn towards tragedy.A massive search effort was launched. Several hours later, she was found \"safe and in good health\" in the coastal area of Herzliya, Israeli police said.Overnight, a police spokesperson announced that two people had been arrested on suspicion of \"leaking and other serious criminal offences\" as part of an investigation.Israeli media reported that the pair were Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi and the former chief military prosecutor, Col Matan Solomosh.ReutersIsraeli forces mounted an hours-long search for Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi when she went missing on SundayThe Sde Teiman incident has been a lightning rod for the division between the left and right in Israel.On the right, the leaking of the video is denounced as a defamation of the Israeli military, all but amounting to an act of treason.After Israeli military police went to Sde Teiman to question 11 reservists over the incident in July 2024, far-right protesters - including at least three lawmakers from Netanyahu's governing coalition - broke into the facility to show their support.On the left, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi's decision to enable the footage to be released is seen as the one time she lived up to the responsibilities of her post.The video is regarded by the left as concrete evidence backing up multiple reports of abuse of Palestinian detainees since the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.Last October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been \"subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence\".Israel's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was \"fully committed to international legal standards\". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint.",

    "body": "13 hours agoIsaac AsheLeicesterJulia WandeltUnder cross-examination on Thursday, Julia Wandelt tearfully asked \"why am I here?\" Two women's alleged stalking of the McCanns was \"cruel and unforgiving\" and showed no sign of stopping, prosecutors told a trial.Michael Duck KC said evidence showed Polish national Julia Wandelt, who has claimed to be missing Madeleine McCann since 2022, was \"capable of being incredibly manipulative\".Addressing the jury at Leicester Crown Court, he said Karen Spragg, 61, who helped arrange a doorstep confrontation at the McCanns' home to ask for a DNA test, was \"no sidekick\" and been a \"willing participant\" with a \"preconceived notion\" of the unsolved disappearance in Portugal in 2007.Both deny stalking Gerry and Kate McCann causing serious alarm and distress over two-and-a-half years.A letter Mr Duck said was \"co-authored\" by the two defendants, signed by Miss Wandelt as Madeleine and hand delivered to the McCanns' address in December 2024, a day after they were told to stop trying to contact them, showed the pair's \"torment\" of the family \"was not going to stop\".He said any suggestion having a DNA test carried out would have ceased their stalking was \"a nonsense\".Mr Duck pointed to Miss Wandelt's refusal to accept \"the game was finally up\" when told about the DNA result in April this year.When he suggested Miss Wandelt's supposed childhood memories as Madeleine McCann were \"a manifestation\" and details came from the McCann's home videos which were published online, Miss Wandelt became emotional and left the dock in tears.He also highlighted a shift from signing messages as Madeleine and calling Mrs McCann \"mommy\" to Mrs Spragg messaging Mrs McCann to say Miss Wandelt only \"believes she may be\" the missing girl.PA MediaThe court has heard Karen Spragg drove Miss Wandelt from Cardiff to Rothley on 7 December 2024He said: \"These two operated together, and had an ability and a willingness to manipulate.\"It's absolutely plain there never was and never could be evidence that supported their belief based on nothing other than her own assertions.\"Julia Wandelt is not Madeleine McCann, and the only people who are not prepared to accept that are the two sat in the dock.\"PA MediaThe disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007 has never been solvedAddressing the jury, judge Mrs Justice Cutts KC said that anyone with opinions on the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007 should \"put them to one side\" and solely consider evidence heard during the trial.She added both defendants are of previous good character, with just one prior caution on Mrs Spragg's record from 2006 for slapping a neighbour on the back of their head during an argument.'A genuine person'The best friend of Karen Spragg told the trial the 61-year-old was \"sincere, reliable and most definitely honest\".A character reference from care worker Susan Aherne, Karen Spragg's friend of 40 years, was read to the court telling of a \"genuine person\" who would \"listen wholeheartedly and give support\".Julia Wandelt, 24, of Jana Kochanowskiego in Lubin, Poland, and Karen Spragg, 61, of Caerau Court Road, Cardiff, deny stalking the McCanns causing distress and alarm between June 2022 to February 2025.The trial continues.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "He made his money selling camels and gold. Now this warlord controls half of Sudan4 hours agoAlex de WaalAfrica analystAnadolu via Getty ImagesMohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as \"Hemedti\", has emerged as a dominant figure on Sudan's political stage, with his paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) now controlling half of the country.The RSF scored a notable victory recently when it overran the city of el-Fasher, the last garrison held by the Sudanese army and its local allies in the western region of Darfur.Feared and loathed by his adversaries, Hemedti is admired by his followers for his tenacity, ruthlessness, and his promise to tear down a discredited state.Hemedti has humble origins. His family is from the Mahariya section of the camel-herding, Arabic-speaking Rizeigat community that spans Chad and Darfur.He was born in 1974 or 1975 - like many from a rural background, his date and place of birth were not registered.Led by his uncle Juma Dagolo, his clan moved into Darfur in the 1970s and 80s, fleeing war and seeking greener pastures and were allowed to settle.After dropping out of school in his early teens, Hemedti earned money trading camels across the desert to Libya and Egypt.At the time, Darfur was Sudan's wild west - poor, lawless and neglected by the government of then-President Omar al-Bashir.Arab militiamen known as the Janjaweed - including a force commanded by Juma Dagolo - were attacking the villages of the indigenous Fur ethnic group.This cycle of violence led to a full-scale rebellion in 2003, in which Fur fighters were joined by Masalit, Zaghawa and other groups, saying they had been ignored by the country's Arab elite.In response, Bashir massively expanded the Janjaweed to spearhead his counter-insurgency efforts. They quickly won notoriety for burning, looting, raping and killing. Getty ImagesThe atrocities of the Janjaweed militia caused international outrageHemedti's unit was among them, with a report by African Union peacekeepers saying it attacked and destroyed the village of Adwa in November 2004, killing 126 people, including 36 children.A US investigation determined that the Janjaweed were responsible for genocide. The Darfur conflict was referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which brought charges against four men, including Bashir, who has denied carrying out genocide. Hemedti was one of the many Janjaweed commanders deemed too junior to be in the prosecutor's sights at that time. Just one, the Janjaweed \"colonel of colonels\", Ali Abdel Rahman Kushayb, was brought to court. Last month he was found guilty on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity and he will be sentenced on 19 November.In the years following the height of the violence in 2004, Hemedti played his cards skilfully, rising to become head of a powerful paramilitary force, a corporate empire, and a political machine.It is a story of opportunism and entrepreneurship. He briefly mutinied, demanding back-pay for his soldiers, promotions and a political position for his brother. Bashir gave him most of what he wanted and Hemedti rejoined the fold.Later, when other Janjaweed units mutinied, Hemedti led the government forces that defeated them, in the process taking control of Darfur's biggest artisanal gold mine at a place called Jebel Amir.Rapidly, Hemedti's family company Al-Gunaid became Sudan's largest gold exporter.In 2013, Hemedti asked - and got - formal status as head of a new paramilitary group, the RSF, reporting directly to Bashir.The Janjaweed were folded into the RSF, getting new uniforms, vehicles and weapons - and also officers from the regular army who were brought in to help with the upgrade.AFP via Getty ImagesThe RSF was an ally of the army, before they fell outThe RSF scored an important victory against the Darfur rebels, did less well in fighting an insurgency in the Nuba Mountains adjacent to South Sudan, and took a subcontract to police the border with Libya.Ostensibly curbing illicit migration from Africa over the desert to the Mediterranean, Hemedti's commanders also excelled in extortion and, reportedly, people-trafficking.In 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called on the Sudanese army to send troops to fight against the Houthis in Yemen.The contingent was commanded by a general who had fought in Darfur, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, now the head of the army at war with the RSF. Hemedti saw a chance and negotiated a separate, private deal with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE to provide RSF mercenaries. The Abu Dhabi connection proved most consequential. It was the beginning of a close relationship with the Emirati president, Mohamed bin ZayedYoung Sudanese men - and increasingly from neighbouring countries too - trekked to the RSF recruiting centres for cash payments of up to $6,000 (£4,500) on signing up. Hemedti struck a partnership with Russia's Wagner Group, receiving training in return for commercial dealings, including in gold. He visited Moscow to formalise the deal, and was there on the day that Russia invaded Ukraine. After the war in Sudan broke out, he denied the RSF was getting help from Wagner.Although the RSF's main combat units were increasingly professionalised, it also encompassed a coalition of irregular old-style ethnic militia.As the regime faced mounting popular protests, Bashir ordered Hemedti's units to the capital Khartoum. Punning on his name, the president dubbed him himayti, \"my protector\", seeing the RSF as a counterweight to potential coup makers in the regular army and national security.It was a miscalculation. In April 2019, a vibrant camp of civic protesters surrounded the military headquarters demanding democracy.Bashir ordered the army to open fire on them. The top generals - Hemedti among them - met and decided to depose Bashir instead. The democracy movement celebrated.AFP via Getty ImagesThe RSF leader turned on then-President Omar al-Bashir, helping to depose himFor a time, Hemedti was lionised as the fresh face of Sudan's future. Youthful, personable, actively meeting diverse social groups, and positioning himself as the challenger to the country's historic establishment, he tried to change his political colours. That lasted just a few weeks.As he and the joint head of the ruling military council, Burhan, stalled on handing power to civilians, the protesters stepped up their rallies, and Hemedti unleashed the RSF, which killed hundreds of people, raped women, and threw men into the River Nile with bricks tied to their ankles, according to a report by campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW).Hemedti has denied the RSF committed atrocities.Pressed by the quartet of countries formed to promote peace and democracy in Sudan - the US, UK, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - the generals and the civilians agreed to a compromise drafted by African mediators.For two years, there was an unstable coexistence of a military-dominated sovereign council and a civilian cabinet.A simple guide to the war in Sudan'I was accused of spying and beaten' - a boy's escape from captured Sudan cityNew videos show executions after RSF militia takes key Sudan cityAs a cabinet-appointed committee investigating the companies owned by the army, security and RSF closed in on its final report - which was set to expose how Hemedti was fast expanding his corporate empire - Burhan and Hemedti dismissed the civilians and took power.But the coup-masters fell out. Burhan demanded that the RSF come under army command. Hemedti resisted. Days before a deadline in April 2023  to resolve this issue, RSF units moved to surround the army headquarters and seize key bases and the national palace in the capital, Khartoum.The putsch failed. Instead, Khartoum became a war zone as the rival forces fought street by street. Violence exploded in Darfur, with RSF units mounting a vicious campaign against the Masalit people.The UN estimates as many as 15,000 civilians died, and the US described it as genocide. The RSF denied the allegation.RSF commanders circulated videos of their fighters torturing and killing, advertising the atrocities and their sense of impunity. The RSF and its allied militia rampaged across Sudan, pillaging cities, markets, universities, and hospitals. An avalanche of looted goods are for sale in what are popularly known as \"Dagolo markets\" reaching beyond Sudan into Chad and other neighbouring countries. The RSF has denied its fighters are involved in looting.Trapped in the national palace under attack from artillery and airstrikes, Hemedti was badly injured in the early weeks of the conflict and disappeared from public view. When he reappeared months later he showed no remorse for atrocities and was no less determined to win the war on the battlefield.ReutersThe war in Sudan has forced millions of people to flee their homesThe RSF has acquired modern weapons including sophisticated drones, that it has used to strike Burhan's de facto capital, Port Sudan, and which played a crucial role in the assault on el-Fasher. Investigative reporting by, among others, the New York Times, has documented that these are transported through an airstrip and supply base built by the UAE just inside Chad. The UAE denies that it is arming the RSF. With this weaponry, the RSF is locked in a strategic stalemate with its former partner, the Sudanese army. Hemedti is trying to build a political coalition, including some civilian groups and armed movements, most notably his former adversaries in the Nuba Mountains.He has formed a parallel \"Government of Peace and Unity\", taking the chairmanship for himself.With the capture of al-Fasher, the RSF now controls almost all the inhabited territory west of the Nile. Following escalating reports of mass killings and widespread condemnation, Hemedti declared an investigation into what he called violations committed by his soldiers during the capture of el-Fasher.Sudanese speculate that Hemedti sees himself either as president of a breakaway state, or still harbours ambitions to rule all of Sudan.It's also possible that he sees a future as an all-powerful political puppet master, head of a conglomerate that controls businesses, a mercenary army and a political party. By these means, even if he isn't acceptable as Sudan's public face, he can still pull the strings.And as Hemedti's troops massacre civilians in al-Fasher, he is confident that he enjoys impunity in a world that does not care much.Alex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in the US.More about the conflict in SudanGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "'Incredible bravery' of train crew and passengers saved lives9 hours agoRachael McMenemyAndrew Johnson/FacebookAndrew Johnson, a LNER train driver, pictured at a Royal British Legion stallTrain staff and passengers have been praised for their heroic actions during a mass stabbing on a train which left multiple people injured. A train crew member, who is in a critical but stable condition in hospital, has been hailed a \"hero\" whose actions saved lives, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said. \"On Saturday, he went to work to do his job – today, he is a hero, and forever will be,\" she told Parliament earlier.Police met the Doncaster-London King's Cross train as it made an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, shortly before 20:00 GMT on Saturday.Anthony Williams, 32, gave his address as \"no fixed abode\" when appearing in court on Monday, where he was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder and remanded into custody.Crew members saved livesMahmood paid tribute to the \"breathtaking bravery\" of those \"on the train\" including the \"heroic acts of the passengers and train crew who intercepted the attacker\".She told Parliament that one member of the crew onboard  \"ran towards danger\" and confronted the man wielding a knife.His actions stopped the attacker from advancing through the train, she said.\"He put himself in harm's way, suffered grievous injuries as a result, and remains in hospital today, in a critical but stable condition,\" she added. Parliament TVHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood says her \"thoughts are with the victims, their friends and family and all those who experienced the terrifying attack\"MPs have also praised the quick reaction of train driver Andrew Johnson, a former  Royal Navy officer.Mr Johnson contacted the control room to get the train diverted from the fast track to the slow track when the alarm was raised.It meant the train could stop in Huntingdon, which allowed emergency services to quickly access the scene.Mr Johnson said: \"As train drivers, we hold a lot of responsibility. We practise our emergency response and keep up to date with our knowledge of the route, so if needed, we know exactly where to stop and what to do.\"He continued: \"The action I took is the same as any other driver. \"I think my colleagues onboard were the real heroes and I'd like to pay tribute to their bravery.\"David Horne, the managing director at LNER, said: \"Andrew's actions are testament to the expertise and skills he has built over his career, both on the railway and in the military.\"The intensive training undertaken by our drivers means they are always ready to respond in any situation.\"'Do you want to die?'Stephen CreanStephen Crean tried to block the attacker from getting into the buffet car, where people were hidingPassenger Stephen Crean, a Nottingham Forest football fan, is also being hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, who slashed him on the head and the hand.He saw fellow passengers running to the buffet car and wanted to make sure they could stay safely barricaded there.Mr Crean told the BBC's Lucy Manning the attacker shouted \"Do you want to die?\" at him.\"I confronted this guy, because I've got to make sure that the door's locked. But then he pulled this thing out. It was an over-large blade.\"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. \"And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and caught me on the head.\"Crean said it was nice to hear that people are calling him a hero, but he thinks there were also other heroes at the scene.\"It's lovely to hear. But I'd say there are other heroes like the police and the guys that got me off the train, and the ambulances and the hospital staff, they're probably the real heroes. \"And the train guy that's really badly injured. So, you know, it's a big shout to call someone a hero, but it's nice.\"Whiskey bottle\"Run there's a guy stabbing everyone\" - witnesses describe attackWitnesses have described seeing fellow passengers attempt to protect each other, while others stemmed bleeding from wounds while they waited for help.Olly Foster, a passenger on the train, told the BBC he initially heard people shouting \"run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone\", and believed it might have been a Halloween related prank.He said within minutes, people started pushing through the carriage, and he noticed his hand was \"covered in blood\" as there was \"blood all over the chair\" he had leaned on.An older man \"blocked\" the attacker from stabbing a younger girl, leaving him with a gash on his head and neck, Mr Foster said.Passengers around him used jackets to try to staunch the bleeding.He added that the only thing people in his carriage could use against the attacker was a bottle of whiskey, leaving them \"staring down the carriage\" and \"praying\" that he would not enter the carriage.Although it lasted 10-15 minutes in total, Mr Foster said the incident \"felt like forever\".Describing the scene when he got off the train, he said: \"There were three people bleeding severely. One guy was holding his stomach and there's blood coming from his stomach and going down his leg. \"He was going 'help, help, I've been stabbed'.\"'You need to run'PAThe incident prompted a huge response by the emergency servicesJoe, who was also travelling back from the Nottingham Forest v Manchester United match, said the scenes were \"like something out of a movie\".The 24-year-old, from Peckham in south-east London, said: \"I was texting my friends about my plans for that night and then people came rushing through from the carriage, running through, saying, 'You need to run, you need to run'.\"At first it didn't really register what was going on.\"And then quickly, I just dropped my stuff and I started running along with them.\"And then I looked back, and I could see this guy - he was quite a tall, black male, and he had a bloodied knife.\"You just looked around and there was blood just everywhere.\"'What if we run out of carriages?'Joe continued: \"We kept moving through the train. We could see him behind us coming through.\"The scariest thing was that I knew that because the stops at this stage of the journey are just Stevenage and King's Cross there's quite a lot of big distances between stops.\"So we had no idea how long we were going to be on the train for.\"The thing that was in my mind was we're running through this train now but what if we run out of carriages to run through? What if we reach the end of the train? What happens there?\"It all happened very quickly. I was just in a fight or flight mode really.\"He ran right towards us... we decided to hide in a taxi', says eyewitness'Panic'Steve was on the King's Cross-bound train with his two children. The family were at the opposite end of the train to where the attack unfolded, but reflected on a \"nightmare scenario\".Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: \"We got on it [the train] about 19:10. We had just departed Peterborough, and then kind of an alarm went off, a kind of a soft alarm went off, which I heard before on the train.\"It said that, you know, an activation alarm has been activated in coach J.\"I didn't know what it was, but then we suddenly started seeing people massing at the end of the carriage by the door... I wasn't really sure what was going on.\"And then people started to get panicky.\"Someone said, 'there's been a stabbing'. And then people started to move quite quickly down towards our carriage.\".He continued: \"A woman came over the tannoy and said, 'we are aware there is an incident. Just keep yourself safe', which was scary to hear, because you didn't know what was going on.\"Then we pulled into a station. I think everybody assumed it was Stevenage, because that was the next scheduled stop.\"Everyone just started to kind of run and then pile off the train, and then everyone just, there's a bit of a panic, and everyone ran through the station forecourt.\"We ran out into the car park and ran up a hill and kind of out on to the road, and then we bumped into two or three young girls.\"We ran to someone's house, and we hammered on all the doors and pressed the buzzers, and we got in, and some very kind, early-elderly couple looked after us until it was safe to leave.\"The kids are very shaken up by it, but dealing with it very well.\"Joe Giddens/PAPA MediaThe incident took place at 19:42 on Saturday and British Transport Police (BTP) received reports of multiple stabbings aboard the 18:25 LNER service from Doncaster to King's CrossThe train's only other scheduled stop before King's Cross was due to be at Stevenage.Wren Chambers, who was due to get off in the Hertfordshire town, said they first became aware something was wrong when a man bolted down the carriage with a bloody arm, saying \"they've got a knife, run\".Wren said they and a friend ran to the front of the train and saw a man who had collapsed on the floor. Wren said they felt \"stressed and pretty scared\" once they knew what was happening, but they were eventually able to get off the train unharmed.\"There was quite a lot of blood on the train, there was some on my bag, some on my jeans,\" they told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"As soon as the train stopped and people got off most of them ran outside trying to get away from it, because we knew the attacker was still inside on the train.\"London Underground worker Dean McFarlane told the BBC that he saw the train pull into Huntingdon railway station at 20:00 with a passenger bleeding.He said that on arrival, he saw multiple people running down the platform bleeding, with one man in a white shirt \"completely covered in blood\".He said he grabbed people and told them to leave the station, and tried to assist passengers who he believed were having panic attacks.More on this storyRelated internet links ",

    "body": "12 hours agoRayhan Demytrie,Caucasus correspondent in Georgia and Pamela Tickell,North East and CumbriaReutersBella Culley told reporters she had not expected to be freed so soonPregnant teenager Bella Culley, who had admitted drug trafficking charges in Georgia, has said she felt \"happy and relieved\" as she was freed from prison.The 19-year-old from Billingham, Teesside, had initially faced a possible 20 years in jail, but prosecutors made a last-minute change to the terms of a plea bargain.Miss Culley, who walked free from court in Tbilisi arm-in-arm with her mother Lyanne Kennedy, told reporters she had not expected to be freed today.The teenager was detained on 10 May having being arrested at Tbilisi International Airport when 12kg (26lb) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lb) of hashish were found in her luggage.Her lawyer Malkhaz Salakaia said prosecutors made the changes to the plea deal and, given her age and pregnancy, decided to free her.Miss Culley's family is trying to get her passport from the police so she can leave the country as soon as possible.Watch: Bella Culley says she is happy and relieved to have been freedWhen she was told she would be freed after five months and 24 days in custody, the teenager broke into a huge smile.She then hugged her lawyer before the court proceedings went ahead with the judge asking procedural questions, including whether or Miss Culley pleaded guilty to the charge of trafficking drugs into Georgia. She answered \"yes\".Throughout the hearing she kept looking at her mother and exchanging smiles, until she was let free from the court and the pair, both crying with happiness, embraced.ReutersMiss Culley, who is eight months pregnant, left court with her mother Lyanne KennedyBefore leaving, Miss Culley, who is eight months pregnant, appeared to worry about what she was wearing.She was heard saying, \"oh my God I look awful\" and \"there are all these cameras\". Her lawyer also called her father for a brief conversation. He said to her: \"Hello Princess\", and she replied: \"I'm not in jail anymore dad\".Lawyers representing the teenager had been locked in negotiations with judicial authorities in Georgia, with details expected to be released later.Her family had recently paid £137,000 to reduce her sentence to two years.Miss Culley previously pleaded guilty to bringing drugs into Georgia, flying from Thailand via Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.But said she was forced to do so by gangsters who tortured her with hot iron.She had initially gone missing while travelling in Thailand and her lawyer said Georgian police had launched a separate criminal investigation into her coercion allegations.Where is Georgia?Georgia sits on the east coast of the Black Sea.It lies to the south of Russia and also shares borders with Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan.The country is a former republic of the Soviet Union, regaining its independence in 1991.At a previous hearing, she told the court: \"I just wanted to travel.\"I am a good person. I am a student at university. I am a clean person. I don't do drugs.\"Miss Culley had been held in pre-trial detention since May, first in stark conditions in Georgia's Rustavi Prison Number Five before being transferred to a \"mother and baby\" unit.Mr Salakaia said he planned to appeal to the president of Georgia to pardon her after finalising the plea deal.More on this story",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Trent Alexander-Arnold has made 10 appearances for Real Madrid since joining them from LiverpoolByChief football writerTrent Alexander-Arnold returns to Liverpool on Tuesday for the first time since moving to Real Madrid, when he will discover if absence has made Anfield hearts grow fonder after the outpouring of ill-feeling that accompanied his decision to leave his boyhood club.Alexander-Arnold fuelled anger among many Liverpool fans by announcing he was leaving at the end of his contract last summer, with supporters making their fury clear by booing him when he emerged as a substitute in the draw with Arsenal in May.This was despite the 27-year-old - celebrated in song by the Kop as \"the Scouser in our team\" - having already played a pivotal role in bringing the Premier League title back to Liverpool.He is in line to play for Real Madrid in the Champions League match after recovering from the hamstring injury that interrupted his start at the Bernabeu.Alexander-Arnold will find out if time has healed wounds felt by Liverpool's followers - and will also have the opportunity to show what they have missed as the champions' form has faltered this season.What reception will Alexander-Arnold get?Media caption, 'He gets a warm welcome from me' - Slot on TrentThe smart money is on a mixed reception - with a section of Liverpool fans unlikely to forgive or forget the manner of his departure, initially on a free transfer, although Real later agreed a reported £8.4m fee to accelerate his arrival so he could play in the Club World Cup.Feelings had cooled when Alexander-Arnold again came on as a substitute for Liverpool's final home game against Crystal Palace, when the trophy was presented to captain Virgil van Dijk by legendary former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen.The warmer response was, perhaps, a reaction to public admonishment from former manager Jurgen Klopp, who was angered by Alexander-Arnold's vitriolic treatment from fans who previously idolised him.Alexander-Arnold's status as the local boy who made good by winning two Premier Leagues, the Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, Super Cup and Club World Cup undoubtedly heightened emotions when he sought pastures new in Spain.Former Liverpool and England defender Stephen Warnock accepts Alexander-Arnold may not receive a rapturous welcome, telling BBC Sport: \"I know local fans will say he was a Liverpool fan in a great Liverpool team, but sometimes players want something else. I respect that.\"I really hope he gets a good reception. I think he'll want to put on a show, demonstrate why he's such a talent, why Liverpool's fans loved him so much.\"Warnock added: \"I think the reception will be mixed. I don't think he will be expecting a standing ovation after the way things went, and we have to respect those opinions as well.\"I don't think he deserves a mixed reception. He was an incredible servant to the club, but wanted to challenge himself.\"Hopefully he gets a great reception.\"Liverpool manager Arne Slot told a news conference on the eve of the match that he has \"only positive\" memories of working with Alexander-Arnold but does not know how the club's supporters will treat him. \"I have great memories of the player and the human being,\" Slot said.\"How our fans will react I have no clue how that's going to be. He gets a warm welcome from me that's for sure.\"Alexander-Arnold's former Liverpool team-mate Ryan Gravenberch said he will \"give him a hug\" because he is \"obviously a friend of mine\".How much have Liverpool missed Alexander-Arnold?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Only Roberto Firmino (21) assisted more of Mohamed Salah's Liverpool goals than Trent Alexander-Arnold (13)The Alexander-Arnold-shaped hole in Liverpool's team is one of the conundrums facing head coach Slot as the near-£450m summer refit of his title-winning squad has struggled to gel, although Saturday's 2-0 win against Aston Villa stopped the rot after six defeats in seven games, including four straight league losses.Alexander-Arnold's absence, however, has had an impact on all areas of Liverpool's team, particularly Mohamed Salah's influence.Salah has struggled to hit his usual heights, although he scored his 250th Liverpool goal in the win over Villa.It has trained the microscope on his previously potent partnership with Alexander-Arnold, a rich seam of goals and creation as Liverpool swept up their trophy haul under Klopp then Slot.Alexander-Arnold's world-class range of passing created space and opportunities for Salah, with opponents living in fear not only of what he might do himself, but also what he could unlock for the Egyptian.He played 147 line-breaking passes for Salah when the title was won last season, the most any player provided for a team-mate in the Premier League.Warnock said: \"There is a great player in Conor Bradley, but he needs to stay fit and get a run of games to build up a relationship with Salah. These things can take time, even with the best players.\"Trent leaving has had an impact on Salah. Their partnership, if not exactly unnoticed, was almost taken as read. Yes, they are world-class individuals, but it was also a partnership.\"They really complemented each other. Trent could go inside, draw people towards him, which freed up more space for Salah. And when Salah drove at people he had the ability to feed Trent because teams were backing off.\"Alexander-Arnold's comfort in possession with his fellow defenders, plus the ability to move into midfield, means his presence is also sorely missed elsewhere.Warnock said: \"I think Ibrahima Konate probably misses him as well. He knew he could give Trent the ball under pressure. I think it is having an impact on the right-hand side of the pitch, both in defence and attack.\"Liverpool also created a box system in the centre of midfield, which they did so well, when Trent was in the side.\"There was a lot of praise given to Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai, but Trent was a big part of that as well. Losing that extra body in the midfield area, when he was in there, is also missed because opponents were drawn to him, fearful of what he could create.\"Jeremie Frimpong, signed in a £29m deal from Bayer Leverkusen to compete with Bradley for the place vacated by Alexander-Arnold, has had his Anfield start curtailed by hamstring injuries.Warnock said: \"The biggest issue with Frimpong is not only injuries, but what is his best position? At Bayer Leverkusen he spent a lot of time as a right wing-back.\"Liverpool '100%' missing Alexander-ArnoldAs Liverpool's title defence stalled before beating Villa, Alexander-Arnold's ability to unlock defences may have aided them as, by Slot's own admission, they have struggled against teams who defend deep and use long balls.Warnock believes Liverpool are missing a creative source that can be placed in the same bracket as one of the Premier League greats, former Manchester City star Kevin de Bruyne.He said: \"Trent was a right-back, but effectively he was a midfielder [in] that position.\"I liken him to De Bruyne. I know they were different positions, but the way they pass the ball, the way they put fear into defenders with their ability to cross a ball or deliver a pass, is just incredible.\"Warnock added: \"When Trent was at Liverpool, teams would back off. He was hitting balls over the top, trying to find killer passes. Even if he was a fraction off, the opposition were thinking 'if he gets one of these right we're in big trouble'.\"They drop deeper, then he was firing balls into Mac Allister on the half-turn, Szoboszlai, or last season Luis Diaz. He may not find that killer ball every time, but he strikes fear into defences, the fear that he will eventually get one right, which he so often did.\"I actually think this was the idea of bringing Florian Wirtz in, to open up defences.\"If you put all that together and ask if Liverpool are missing Trent? Yes, 100%.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Alexander-Arnold was an unused substitute in Saturday's La Liga win over Valencia",

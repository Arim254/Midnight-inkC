They have to make their position very clear, that's what we ask them.</p><p>\"Our review needs to be very detailed, very analytical, it needs to take into account the point of view of our two drivers, and then we will form a common opinion based on which we will see whether we can just confirm our initial interpretation or there's something else that we should conclude.</p><p>\"Every time we start our conversations with the drivers, we always remind ourselves, as a premise: 'This is hard'.</p><p>\"Because this is the only matter in which, when you race together as a team, actually you can't have exactly the same interest for the two drivers, because they want to pursue their aspiration.

It equals Red Bull's feat in winning with six races to go in 2023, although that was a 22-race season compared with 24 this year.</p><p>It is also not as early in percentage terms as McLaren's 1988 title with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost and the great McLaren-Honda MP4/4.</p><p>But the car has not had the superiority over the field shown by the winners in either of those years.</p><p>Red Bull won all but one race, and Verstappen all but three, in 2023. McLaren this year have had the best car, but crucially two drivers able to consistently win with it, while Sergio Perez faded badly after his two early wins that year.</p><p>Piastri and Norris have won 12 of the 18 races so far, seven for Piastri and five for Norris. Verstappen has four wins and Russell two.</p><p>McLaren's achievement is remarkable for the fact that it came in a season that was meant to be one of the most competitive in years.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cy7kgg5lxeeo\">McLaren's title last year was won at the final race</a> under severe pressure from Ferrari, and as this is the final year of the current regulations, the teams were expected to converge further.</p><p>McLaren, though, caught them all on the hop with their MCL39 car, which has proved its superiority through devastating cornering speeds particularly in medium-speed turns, which are the most common on the calendar, and the best tyre usage on the grid.</p><p>It is not without its flaws - it does not excel in heavy braking and traction, or over bumps. But it is, as well as being arguably the most beautiful car on the grid with its elegant lines, especially seen from the side or rear three-quarters, also the most effective on average.</p><p>The key to this, says Stella, was \"innovation\". In suspension design front and rear, which have extreme levels of anti-dive and anti-lift to ensure a stable aerodynamic platform. In aerodynamics. And in cooling - the car has noticeably fewer and smaller vents than others, a key advantage when every extra opening of the bodywork has a cost in aerodynamic efficiency.</p><p>Stella said: \"There was loads of innovation applied to what was last year's car, and this required quite a bit of bravery at some stage of the 2024 season to commit to the amount of changes that we have applied to go from the 2024 to the 2025 car.</p><p>\"I talk about bravery, because our engineering understanding, our engineering execution has been challenged to the point of the leading edge of our knowledge.\"</p></div><div><p>McLaren's advantage has reduced as the season heads into its final stages. That is partly because of the characteristics of the three most recent circuits not suiting its capabilities, and partly because McLaren turned off the taps of development some time ago, and Mercedes and Red Bull still have new parts coming to their cars - both had new front wings here.</p><p>That decision by McLaren was rooted in the fact that they were seeing diminishing returns in developing this car, common when a design has such an advantage at the start of a season, and that they wanted to ensure they were well prepared for next year, when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cgeeqr817xxo\">new chassis and engine rules</a> could turn F1 on its head.</p><p>Norris, though, is well aware of the scale of his team's achievement, and the remarkable turnaround they have shown under Stella and chief executive officer Zak Brown from just over two years ago, when they started the 2023 season close to the back of the field.</p><p>There is also the context of the budget cap, and the fact that as world champions, the rules dictated that they were permitted less aerodynamic development time than any other team.</p><p>\"Another one is a great thing,\" Norris said. \"If you look where we were three years ago, we have outdone every team in terms of development in a time when it is harder to do with more restrictions and less wind tunnel time.</p><p>\"In a time when it should be more difficult than ever to dominate, that's exactly what the team has done and given us, by a long way, the best car on the grid.</p><p>\"That's always a very nice thing to say. It always puts a smile on your face. But we've also done very well as a team in terms of drivers, between Oscar and myself pushing each other and delivering every single weekend. You don't see that in any other team.</p><p>\"I've been with McLaren since I started. It was a very different time and place then to where we are now.</p><p>\"So that journey makes it more special - to know the downs, because that's a lot of what it was back then - to see the rise we've had, to see the teamwork, the changes, the atmosphere difference, and the leadership from Zak and Andrea especially, has turned things around and made us the best team in the world.</p><p>\"That's something not many people ever get to say.\"</p></div><section><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p></section></article></div>",

It is an office that must be untainted by controversy or distraction.\"</p><p>The 54-year-old Dubliner added he knew the campaign would be \"robust and challenging\", however issues that have surfaced in recent days \"have given me cause to reflect\".</p></div><div><p>Gavin did not elaborate on the reason for his withdrawal in his statement. But his withdrawal followed a news report in the Irish Independent newspaper on Saturday alleging Gavin owed €3,300 (£2,870) to a former tenant.</p><p>Gavin was asked about the story on RTÉ's presidential debate on Sunday and said: \"If it happened, I'm very sorry that it happened. I'm looking into it and I will deal with it with urgency.\"</p><p>He added that he did not have \"all the information\" about the matter.</p></div><p></p><h2>Taoiseach supports withdrawal</h2><p></p><div><p>Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said Gavin's decision to withdraw was \"the correct one\".</p><p>\"Jim has accepted that he made an error in relation to an issue that has arisen in recent days,\" he said.</p><p>\"He himself has said the office of Uachtarán na hÉireann is the highest in the land and the pinnacle of public service. He is clear that he does not want to bring controversy onto this office.\"</p><p>Martin added it was a \"very difficult decision\" for Gavin to withdraw given his \"commitment to public service\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Who is Jim Gavin?</h2><p></p><div><p>Gavin is a former Irish military pilot and a current aviation expert but he is best known for his successes as a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) football manager.</p><p>He managed the Dublin men's team from 2012 to 2019, when it won six All Ireland Senior Football Championship titles - five of which were back-to-back victories.</p><p>He had 20-year career in the Irish Air Corps and was later appointed as Chief Operations Officer of the Irish Aviation Authority.</p><p>Last month, Gavin said he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3vzn723l92o\">had sent legal letters to some social media firms</a> after \"smears\" of a \"very personal nature\" were posted about him online.</p><p>He said online misinformation had \"become normalised\" in society and he was \"going to make a stand\" by contacting media regulators and social media platforms.</p></div></article>",

The consumer group is accusing the chip company of anti-competitive practices.</p><p>It claims the firm forced Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices and licensing fees for essential handset components, which then pushed up the cost of those smartphones for consumers.</p></div><div><p>The BBC has reached out to Qualcomm for comment.</p><p>The trial starting on Monday will focus on whether Qualcomm held market power and, if so, whether it abused a dominant position.</p><p>If Which? is successful, there will be a second stage seeking £480m from Qualcomm, to be distributed among an estimated 29 million British phone owners affected.</p><p>Which? is seeking damages for all affected Apple and Samsung smartphones purchased between 1 October 2015 and 9 January 2024.</p><p>The consumer group says this would probably work out at around £17 each. Qualcomm has previously said the case has \"no basis\".</p><p>A similar case against Qualcomm is ongoing in Canada, and the firm has also previously been fined by the EU for antitrust.</p><p>Anabel Hoult, chief executive of Which?, said: \"This trial is a huge moment. It shows how the power of consumers - backed by Which? - can be used to hold the biggest companies to account if they abuse their dominant position.\"</p><p>Qualcomm is one of the world's biggest producers of smartphone chips and has faced allegations about anti-competitive behaviour before.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission in the United States sued the firm for unfair practices in the way it licensed its technology back in 2017, but had its case dismissed in 2020.</p></div>",

Speed, connected data and stakeholder simplicity should be key goals.\"</p><p>However, Conservative shadow housing minister Paul Holmes said: \"Whilst we welcome steps to digitise and speed up the process, this risks reinventing the last Labour Government's failed Home Information Packs - which reduced the number of homes put on sale, and duplicated costs across buyers and sellers.\"</p><p>The announcement comes as the Conservatives are set to detail changes to its tax policy for first home buyers at the party's conference in Manchester.</p><p>The party will lay out plans to \"reward work\" by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzv9j78dyo\">giving young people a £5,000 tax rebate towards their first home</a> when they get their first full time job.</p><p>Shadow chancellor Mel Stride will announce proposals for a \"first-job bonus\" that would divert national insurance payments into a long-term savings account.</p><p>The party say it will be funded by cuts to public spending worth £47bn over five years in areas such as welfare, the civil service and the foreign aid budget.</p></div></article>",

Trump said it saved the city from burning to the ground.</p><p>It is the troops still in Los Angeles from that deployment who the Trump administration redeployed to Portland.</p><p>\"This isn't about public safety, it's about power. The commander-in-chief is using the US military as a political weapon against American citizens,\" Newsom said, accusing the president of ignoring courts. </p><p>\"We will take this fight to court, but the public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct.\"</p><p>Protests have been ongoing in Portland and other cities over the Trump administration's increased immigration enforcement. </p><p>Portland, in particular, has long drawn Trump's ire over its alleged concentration of people his supporters describe as Antifa, short for \"anti-fascist\". The president recently signed an executive order designating the group, which is a loosely organised movement of far-left activists, as a domestic terrorist organisation.</p><p>The Portland deployment came one day after Trump authorised the deployment of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dnk0ee6pyo\">300 National Guard troops to Chicago</a> under a similar pretext.</p><p>The city in Illinois has also seen protests over increased immigration enforcement. On Saturday, protests became violent, with immigration authorities saying they opened fire on an armed woman after she and others allegedly rammed their cars into law enforcement vehicles. </p><p>The woman's condition is unclear, but officials said she drove herself to hospital. </p><p>State and local leaders have decried Trump's deployment plans there and called it an abuse of power. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said Trump was \"attempting to manufacture a crisis\".</p><p>On Sunday, Gov Pritzker told CNN that the authorisation of troops there will incite protests. He accused the administration of creating a \"warzone\" to rationalise the response.</p><p>\"They want mayhem on the ground. They want to create the warzone so that they can send in even more troops,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"They're using every lever at their disposal to keep us from maintaining order.\"</p></div>",

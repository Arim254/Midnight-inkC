    "body": "8 hours agoWill GrantCuba correspondent in HavanaBBCA sizeable exhibit in the Museum of the Revolution in Havana is dedicated to conditions in Cuba before the revolution took power in 1959. Inside the ornate former presidential palace, photographs and oral testimony detail the grinding poverty and ingrained corruption of the dictatorship of Cuba's then-military strongman, Fulgencio Batista.The enduring image is of a woman in a dirt-floored palm-leaf hut cooking with firewood. Similar pictures appear in state museums across the island from the Bay of Pigs to Birán, the birthplace of the father of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro. The inference is clear: the revolutionaries saved Cubans from the ignorance and hardship of life under a Washington-backed de facto leader and led them to dignity, education and true independence.Yet today, Lisandra Botey identifies more with the impoverished woman in the photograph than with the revolutionaries who liberated her country from Batista.\"We're living like that now, we're exactly like that\", says housewife Lisandra outside her home in Havana, which is cobbled together with pieces of sheet metal and wood.\"Every morning, we have to go down to the beach [in Havana] and look for firewood. Then we bring it home to cook breakfast with – because if we get power, it comes on during school hours.\"Lisandra says she identifies with the impoverished woman in the photograph from pre-revolution CubaLisandra's nine-year-old daughter set off for school that morning with nothing in her stomach, she explains, tears pricking her eyes. Her husband, Brenei Hernández – a construction worker with next to no work – says they often have no idea where the next meal is coming from.\"Every day is the same hunger, the same misery\", he says, stirring a pot of white rice – so at the very least his daughter will come home from school to something hot to eat.With the Cuban economy in freefall since the coronavirus pandemic, no gas has been delivered to Brenei's flimsy home in a Havana suburb for months. He and his neighbours were already cooking with firewood and charcoal before US troops forcibly removed Cuba's closest ally, the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, from power on 3 January. Since then, though, Washington has seemingly taken full control of Venezuela's oil industry and the supply of crude to the communist-run island has dried up.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesBy 1958, the revolution had spread throughout Cuba, culminating in the fall of Havana in early 1959The decades-long US economic embargo on Cuba has been ramped up like never before: US President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on any nation which sends oil to the stricken island.None of Cuba's traditional allies – whether Mexico, Russia, China, Vietnam or Iran – have stepped up to fill the void left by Venezuela, although the US Treasury this week said it would relax restrictions on a limited number of oil sales, to \"support the Cuban people for commercial and humanitarian use.\"The move comes amid rising tensions between Washington and Havana. Cuba's government has reported that its border guards fatally shot four people travelling in a US‑registered speedboat. It said the individuals were Cuban nationals living in the United States. According to a US official, at least one American citizen was shot dead and another injured by Cuban officials intercepting the speedboat.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was investigating the \"highly unusual\" incident. \"Washington's old playbook on Cuba doesn't apply anymore and whoever hasn't appreciated that yet is in for a shock,\" says Cuban economist, Ricardo Torres. \"Trump is changing the rules of the game.\"Trump has declared that \"Cuba is ready to fall\", intensifying pressure on the island at its most vulnerable moment since the Cold War. Some commentators have said one of the aims of Washington's removal of Maduro in Venezuela was to deepen Cuba's economic crisis. It appears the Trump administration hopes to weaken the revolution – possibly terminally – and push for the collapse of state-run socialism on the island.The underlying calculation is straightforward: that a worsening internal crisis could create the conditions for the Cuban Revolution to unravel from within. What remains far less certain is whether such a strategy will force regime change, or whether the communist-run Cuban government will, as it has in past crises, find new ways to endure.Blackouts and 'extreme rationing'The effects of the fuel crisis are being felt the length and breadth of Cuba.Blackouts in Havana can last for 15 hours a day or more. Hospitals are in darkness with only emergency cases being admitted. Schools are often shuttered. Rubbish is piled high on street corners with no fuel for the state's garbage trucks to collect it. Scrawny and elderly residents can often be found sifting through the discarded waste.Watch: BBC examines life in Cuba without electricity and gasolineFor an island proud of the social safety net it built for its people since 1959 – universal healthcare, the eradication of illiteracy, tackling infant mortality rates and preventable diseases – the picture is bleak, and getting worse.One constant question since Maduro's arrest is: how long can Cuba hold on without new fuel supplies reaching the island?\"Perhaps the oil inventories could last for six to eight weeks,\" suggests Ricardo Torres – but he admits it's hard to know with any degree of precision. \"Cuba doesn't publish figures on fuel inventories.\"\"Extreme rationing\" could be introduced, he says, but draconian restrictions are already in place. People are limited to 20 litres of fuel at the petrol pumps, which must be paid for in US dollars.They're obliged to use a government-run app called Ticket. But the wait can last for days, even weeks. Drivers are finding more than 10,000 people ahead of them when they join the virtual queue for half a tank of petrol. Unsurprisingly in such circumstances, the price of black-market fuel has skyrocketed.AFP via Getty ImagesThere is a limit of 20 litres of fuel at the petrol pumps, which must be paid for in US dollarsDespite it all, Brenei Hernández doesn't direct his ire at Washington. Quite the opposite, in fact: he blames the Cuban state.\"I'd like Trump to take this place over. Then let's see if things get better,\" he says with unerring honesty. \"What can I tell you? I'm not going to lie,\" he adds.Regime changeHaving spent years listening to Cubans repeat anodyne revolutionary slogans when asked for their opinions on camera, it's disarming to hear such frank views expressed with no outward fear of the repercussions. Such is the level of disgust and exhaustion, the public's fear of reprisals for speaking out is beginning to evaporate.\"It's too much,\" Brenei says. \"We're only eating white rice. Hopefully I can get enough money together in the next couple of days for a packet of hot dogs, or three or four eggs.\"Lisandra already worries that her daughter will want a birthday cake this year, which is well beyond their means.\"Every day is the same hunger, the same misery,\" says Brenei HernándezSuch suffering may be part of the Trump administration's strategy of \"maximum pressure\" on Cuba. But while the methodology may be new, says Ricardo Torres, Washington's ultimate goal in Cuba remains the same as always: regime change.\"Whether the change in Cuba is something very sudden or a negotiated solution, in the end, it's regime change that Trump wants.\"The issue for Cubans is how Washington intends to make that change happen, Torres adds, with more acute pain from the oil shutout on the horizon.The Cuban government has repeatedly described the policy as inhumane, cruel and illegal under international law: \"What right does a world power have to deny fuel and the ability to function to a smaller nation?\" said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel.It's all a far cry from the optimism of Washington's Cuba policy of a decade ago. After decades of enmity, in 2014 President Barack Obama opted to re-establish ties with the island in a historic but short-lived thaw. Hardliners in the Cuban government warned that Obama's overtures amounted to the same aim of regime change dressed up in nicer clothing. For the ordinary Cubans who lived through it, though, the diplomatic reset felt like the polar opposite of the current Trump approach.AFP via Getty ImagesIn 2014 President Barack Obama opted to re-establish ties with CubaNext month marks the tenth anniversary of Obama's visit to Havana as the first sitting US president to step foot on the island in almost a century.In front of the Cuban leader, Raúl Castro, he delivered an extraordinary address – broadcast live on state television – in which he said he had come to \"bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas\" and \"extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people\".The man who oversaw the diplomatic thaw was the then-US ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis. I asked him whether the Cuban Revolution was now facing an existential threat.\"That will depend upon what some other countries might do\", DeLaurentis replied.Venezuela's oil support was worth some 35,000 barrels of crude a day to Cuba. There have been some broad indications that Russia might send oil to the island and the Cuban foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez, was recently in Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart and with Russian President Vladimir Putin. So far, though, no Russian fuel tankers have docked in Cuban ports.Rodríguez also travelled to China, Vietnam and Spain trying to drum up support.Getty ImagesUS troops forcibly removed Cuba's closest ally, the Venezuelan president, Maduro, from power on 3 January\"The rush to defend and help has certainly not been as enthusiastic and as significant as we've seen in the past. But there's still a chance that other countries might take some action,\" says DeLaurentis.As to what Trump specifically wants in Cuba, the former lead US diplomat on the island says the administration is \"trying to take coercive steps to bring the government to the table or capitulate but not necessarily collapse\".\"That's a pretty risky strategy it seems to me, with a lot of potential for unintended consequences,\" he adds.Those consequences are already visible in the rapidly worsening humanitarian crisis which prompted Mexico to send tonnes of emergency aid to Cuba, including powdered milk and personal hygiene items. They're already being felt every day by the families forced to cook with firewood and the drivers in urgent need of petrol.Esteban Bello Rodríguez runs several \"almendrones\", 1950s classic American automobiles, in which he ferries tourists around the iconic spots of Havana. His trade has been heavily impacted by the fuel scarcity and the fall in tourism.Esteban Bello Rodríguez's trade has been heavily impacted by the fuel scarcity\"There's a problem here – the fuel problem – so surely the people at the top on both sides have to sit down, figure it out,\" he says bluntly. \"All I know is that a solution must be found because this is affecting the entire country – the people, nationwide. All of us.\"The real powerOn the US side, Cuba policy is largely being led by the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio – a Cuban-American son of exiles and former Florida senator.Trump says Rubio is talking to the top tier of the Cuban government and for days there's been widespread speculation over who might lead that negotiation on the Cuban side. Cuban economist Ricardo Torres says that the only dealmaker on the island is Raúl Castro, even at the revolutionary leader's advanced age of 94.AFP via Getty ImagesTrump says Marco Rubio is talking to the top tier of the Cuban government \"The only people with capacity to engage in a meaningful negotiation are people close to Raúl. The civilian government doesn't have any real power – including President Miguel Díaz-Canel\", he argues.\"The real power in Cuba is Raúl and the closed circle around him.\"Last week, the Axios news outlet reported that his grandson, Raúl Rodríguez Castro – commonly known in Cuba as \"El Cangrejo\", meaning The Crab – is the Trump administration's point of contact inside Castro's inner circle. If so, he's considered one of his grandfather's most trusted confidantes, having been his personal bodyguard, and more business-orientated than ideological, with no high-level diplomatic experience. Neither side, especially not the Cubans, have confirmed he's in talks with Rubio.\"In the case of Venezuela, the Trump administration has been very pragmatic,\" adds Torres.Rubio has seemingly been happy to deal with an interim government in Caracas under Delcy Rodríguez and Washington appears to be looking to persuade the conservative Cuban-American lobby in Florida of the benefits of negotiating with a similarly defenestrated regime in Havana.However, despite the public adherence to the \"maximum pressure\" strategy, Washington does seem to fear that total political change overnight in Venezuela or Cuba would be profoundly destabilising and could prompt a migration crisis as well as humanitarian one.AFP via Getty ImagesRubbish is often left uncollected on street cornersSeveral Cuba watchers have noted that Rubio's tone towards the island was markedly softer in recent comments he made at the Munich Security Conference, with an emphasis on economic reforms rather than a root-and-branch political transformation.\"In a way it almost sounded like a strange variant of Obama 2.0 in terms of economic reforms and so forth,\" said former ambassador DeLaurentis. \"That signalled to me that they are looking for a Delcy-like figure to negotiate with.\"\"Ten to 20 years ago, the diaspora in south Florida would have been completely opposed to that kind of approach. But I guess that now they'd give the president and the secretary the benefit of the doubt, and allow this sort of scenario to play out,\" adds DeLaurentis.Meanwhile, any visitor wanting to see the photograph of the pre-revolutionary woman cooking with firewood will have to wait. The museum has been closed for over a year for refurbishments and now there's no fuel to continue the work.In what is now the most challenging time in the island's modern history, it's not yet clear if only the Museum of the Revolution will be undergoing a renovation this year – or the Cuban Revolution itself.Top picture credit: AFP via Getty ImagesMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Early voting has begun in the primaries and Democrats are hopeful they could win a Texas senate seat for the first time in over 30 years. \nThe election will have national consequences - Texas is one of America’s political power centres, and Republicans from here have dominated the national agenda from immigration, to the courts, to reshaping electoral districts.  Taking back Texas could help Democrats take back the House, the Senate, and check Trump’s executive power in a way they have so far been unable to do in his second term.  It could also realign the presidential election in 2028.  \nJustin and Anthony - who grew up in Texas and knows its politics well - unpack the primaries, which are fast becoming the most expensive in modern US history.  On the Republican side, there is meltdown and infighting, as Senator John Cornyn faces a serious challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton.  The US president - who is campaigning in Texas - hasn’t yet endorsed one candidate. \nOn the Democrat side, two of its biggest stars are fighting for the nomination.  Jasmine Crockett, well known for her fiery public battles with the Trump administration and James Talarico, who is tipped as a future Democrat presidential candidate.  We look at what their realistic chances are, and what it tells us about the future of the party.  \nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Grace Reeve, Sophie van Brugen and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "8 hours agoSima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondent andJamie WhiteheadPA MediaIan Huntley is serving a life sentence for the murders of the two schoolgirlsSoham double murderer Ian Huntley remains in hospital in a serious condition after being attacked with a makeshift weapon by another inmate. The BBC understands that triple killer Anthony Russell, 43, is suspected of attacking Huntley.Huntley, 52, has suffered significant head trauma from his injuries and is undergoing treatment. He is serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 40 years for murdering schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in August 2002.In an update on Friday, Durham Constabulary said there had been \"no change in the 52-year-old man's condition overnight - he remains in hospital in a serious condition\". Previously police said a male prisoner in his mid-40s suspected of carrying out the attack was \"in detention\" but had not been arrested \"at this stage\".The force also confirmed a police investigation is under way and that detectives are liaising with staff at the prison.Sources have told the BBC Huntley was found lying in a pool of blood after being bludgeoned with a makeshift weapon at a prison workshop at HMP Frankland - the high security prison in County Durham.Russell is serving a whole-life prison term for murdering Julie Williams, her son David Williams and Nicole McGregor, whose body was found in woodland near Leamington Spa.He had admitted the murders during a week-long spree in October 2020.This is not the first time Huntley has been attacked at the prison - he was slashed across the throat in 2010 - and needed 21 stitches. The prison - nicknamed Monster Mansion- houses some of the most dangerous criminals including murderers and rapists.Huntley was also attacked in 2005 by a convicted murderer who chucked boiling water over him at HMP Wakefield.As Huntley lies in hospital with serious injuries from the attack, many will be remembering the horror of what he did more than 20 years ago.In the commuter town of Soham in Cambridgeshire, Ian Huntley killed two ten-year-old girls in the summer of 2002.Holly and Jessica had been at a family barbeque. It is believed they were on their way to buy sweets when Huntley, then aged 28, lured them back to his home and killed them.The photo of the girls he killed - in their red Manchester United football kits - is etched in the minds of many who vividly remember their disappearance and murder.It was taken by Holly's mum Nicola just an hour-and-a-half before they were last seen. It dominated news reports at the time as a nationwide search for them took place.Four hundred officers worked full-time on the case. Hundreds more volunteers joined the search but nearly a fortnight after they disappeared – the girls' bodies were found in a ditch in Suffolk.Huntley was arrested the same day. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to a minimum of 40 years for the double murders - with the judge saying \"in your lies and manipulation up to this very day, you have increased the suffering you have caused the two families\".His girlfriend Maxine Carr was also jailed in 2003 after being found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice for giving him a false alibi. She has since been released.",

    "body": "2 hours agoVanessa ClarkeSenior education reporterGetty ImagesA legal challenge by a group of private schools over the government's decision to remove the VAT exemption on the fees they charge has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal.Lawyers representing the families of low-paying faith schools had argued that the policy was discriminatory and in breach of human rights law - but the court rejected this and said home schooling was an option if they did not want to accept state provision.The schools are now hoping to apply for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.The policy came into effect on 1 January 2025 and the government has said it would raise £1.8bn a year by 2029/30 which would help pay for more teachers at state schools in England.Last year, three separate claims were brought in the High Court against the government from families with children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), those attending same-sex schools, and low-paying faith schools.While the court did acknowledge the negative impact on some groups, including children with SEND and who attend faith schools, it said this was outweighed by the money raised for state sector schools.The schools and families who were part of the low-paying faith schools group appealed the decision.But the Court of Appeal dismissed the challenge on Friday.In their judgement, Sir Geoffrey Vos, Lord Justice Singh and Lady Justice Falk acknowledged that the measure may have \"a serious impact\" if the families were unable to afford private education which accords with their religious convictions.\"But it is important to bear in mind that they have the option of home schooling if free education in the state sector is not acceptable to them,\" they added.Government lawyers had argued that families who wished to opt out of state-funded education were free to send their children to private school or to educate them at home.Speaking to the BBC prior to the judgement, Caroline Santer, the head teacher of a small private school in Hampshire, said: \"It's important for my parents to see that I'm prepared to take a stand and fight. No other country taxes education in this way.\"Chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, Andrea Williams, said the group would keep going in the courts. \"Not everyone can home educate,\" Williams said.A government spokesperson said they welcomed the ruling. \"Ending tax breaks for private schools will raise £1.8bn a year by 2029/30 to help fund public services, including supporting the 94% of children in state schools to achieve and thrive\", they added.

We are being bled dry.\"And I don't think it's extreme or radical to think working hard should get you a nice life.\"She added: \"I think that absolutely everybody should get a nice life.\"Palestinian flags featured on Spencer's leaflets and she made clear during the campaign that she believed a \"genocide\" was taking place in Gaza.Spencer, who used a campaign video to say she spends her \"life fixing things that are broken\", also said she wanted to end privatisation in the NHS and nationalise water companies.Spencer worked as a plumber after leaving education aged 16, and started 2026 with the ambition of \"new year, new trade\".She explained she had returned to college to start a full-time plastering course, but within weeks she was combining this training - commuting by car to a college in Stoke - with her campaigning efforts in Gorton and Denton.Spencer posted on LinkedIn about how she had \"slowly taught myself and done bits\" of plastering in recent years, but had signed-up for an intensive course to ensure she could \"cover more parts of a project\".Spencer added: \"Plus, I just really love trying something new and not stopping until I crack it.\"ReutersHannah Spencer and Green Party leader Zack Polanski believe the party will make more electoral gainsWhile Spencer noted in her victory speech that she \"didn't grow up wanting to be a politician\", the House of Commons will not be Spencer's first experience of working in politics.She currently leads the Greens on Trafford Council, where she has represented the Hale ward since May 2023. Spencer also stood as the Green Party's mayoral election candidate for Greater Manchester in 2024.Now she'll be the Green Party's fifth MP, sitting alongside Siân Berry, Adrian Ramsay, Carla Denyer and Ellie Chowns.'Hugely blighted'When announced as the party's by-election candidate, the Green Party highlighted Bolton-born Spencer's ties to the area and how she has \"lived in Greater Manchester all her life\".Spencer, regarded as straight-talking and authentic, once wrote that she was \"glad\" to move out of Gorton and Denton.During the campaign, media attention focused on a post by her on Mumsnet in 2021 in which she said Levenshulme has been \"hugely blighted\" by \"(supposedly) money laundering takeaways\" and that independent businesses \"can't get a look in\".The Greens responded by saying the post made clear Spencer's \"affection\" for the area and her \"disappointment\" that independent businesses were being crowded out.Spencer also describes herself as a marathon runner and \"housemate to four rescued greyhounds\", with the dogs spotted campaigning with her in the constituency.PA MediaSpencer describes herself as \"housemate to four rescued greyhounds\"In the aftermath of her victory, Spencer said \"this is only the beginning\" for the Greens.She told a press conference: \"This was number 127 on the list of Green Party target seats. There are at least 126 seats where we can win with a smaller swing than we saw here, but actually we can win anywhere.\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski added: \"What happened last night is despite the fact that the other parties threw the kitchen sink at us, we had Hannah the plumber.\"And ultimately Hannah has demonstrated the complete opposite. You can be absolutely true to your values and you must be true to your values.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoBrian Wheeler,Political reporterandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterReutersParty observers watch as votes are counted for the Gorton and Denton by-electionNigel Farage has reported allegations of \"family voting\" at the Gorton and Denton by-election to Greater Manchester Police and the Electoral Commission.The Reform UK leader is urging an investigation into reports by independent election observers of \"extremely high\" levels of family voting.Family voting is where a family member is seen to be influencing somebody else's vote, for example by entering the polling booth with them.Concerns were raised by Democracy Volunteers, a group of voluntary election observers who check voting processes are being followed correctly.The Electoral Commission said it took the claims \"very seriously\" and would \"carefully consider\" the report.A statement from the organisation, which oversees elections in the UK, said: \"We are in close contact with the returning officer and Greater Manchester Police to speedily and carefully review the concerns that have been raised and all the information available.\"Greater Manchester Police said in a statement: \"We can confirm a report has been made. We are in the process of reviewing this report and will provide a further update in due course.\"Reform UK were beaten into second place by the Green Party by more than 4,000 votes at the by-election but Farage has claimed it was \"a victory for sectarian voting and cheating\".He said: \"Reform has today reported the many cases of 'family voting' to the Electoral Commission and the police.\"What was witnessed yesterday is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about the integrity of the democratic process in predominantly Muslim areas.\"If this is what was happening at polling stations just imagine the potential for coercion with postal votes.\"If action isn't taken now, then we will ensure it is after the next general election.\"In a letter to the elections watchdog, Farage urged them to launch a full investigation and to work with police \"with a view to prosecutions\" and to \"assess whether the extent of the irregularities is such that the validity of the election result may be called into question\".Earlier, the Green Party hit back at Reform's criticisms, with a spokesman saying: \"This is an attempt to undermine the democratic result and is straight out of the Trump playbook.\"We've just won a historic by-election by a comfortable margin.\"We've shown the country that Greens can beat Reform, despite their big business donations.\"Gorton and Denton by-electionThe Conservative Party, which came a distant fourth in the by-election, have also written to the Electoral Commission to ask for a full investigation into the Democracy Volunteers' allegations.In a letter to the watchdog, shadow communities secretary James Cleverly said: \"There is clear evidence that electoral offences were committed and a blind eye was turned to corruption and criminal activity.\"Family voting was effectively made illegal through the Ballot Secrecy Act 2023, which made it a criminal offence to be in or near a polling booth with another person in order to influence them to vote in a particular way.While Tower Hamlets in east London has been the focus of multiple allegations of family voting in recent years, Democracy Volunteers has repeatedly described the issue as \"widespread\" across all parts of the UK in its reports.Democracy Volunteers director John Ault issued a statement after polls had closed on Thursday, saying observers had seen \"the highest levels of family voting at any election in our 10 year history of observing elections in the UK\".He said: \"We rarely issue a report on the night of an election, but the data we have collected today on family voting, when compared to other recent by-elections, is extremely high.\"In the other recent Westminster parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby we saw family voting in 12% of polling stations, affecting 1% of voters. \"In Gorton and Denton, we observed family voting in 68% of polling stations, affecting 12% of those voters observed.\"The group said four observers attended 22 of the 45 polling stations in the constituency, spending 30 to 45 minutes in each.Of the 22 polling stations observed, volunteers reported potential family voting in 15.They observed a sample of 545 individuals casting their vote and saw 32 cases of family voting in total, including nine cases in one polling station.The official responsible for running the by-election rejected the claims, saying no reports of family voting had been made by polling station staff.A spokesperson for the acting returning officer said polling station staff are trained to \"look out for any evidence of undue influence on voters\" and said \"no such issues\" were reported on Thursday.They said: \"If Democracy Volunteers were so concerned about alleged issues they could and should have raised them with us during polling hours so that immediate action could be taken. \"We have operated a central by-election hub which has been rapidly responding to reported issues during the day, in liaison with the police - who had a presence at every polling station - where necessary.\"It is extremely disappointing that Democracy Volunteers have waited until after polls have closed to make such claims.\"Democracy Volunteers responded by saying it followed the \"international best practice of not interfering with the electoral process\" and issued its findings after voting closed to \"ensure we did not disrupt the administration of the election\".The group signalled it was not planning to report incidents to the police, telling the BBC \"it is not our job to administer the elections, purely to observe\".They added: \"We saw police present in many polling stations yesterday to check whether staff were having any issues.\"Labour Party chairwoman Anna Turley told BBC Newsnight reports of family voting in the Gorton and Denton by-election were \"extremely worrying and concerning\". \"We need to see the evidence and the report, and then make due decision about what authorities should look into this,\" she added.",

    "body": "1 hour agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsWatch: Emergency services at the scene of tram derailment in central MilanAt least two people have been killed and up to 40 others are reported to have been injured, after a tram derailed in the northern Italian city of Milan.The crowded tram was travelling on the line 9 route along Milan's Viale Vittorio Veneto at about 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) when it left the track and crashed into a building.One of the people who died, a 60-year-old man, is thought to have been a pedestrian hit by the tram, while the other fatality and most of the injured were passengers. Numerous ambulances went to the scene as reports emerged of people trapped in the wreckage.ReutersThe tram crashed into the side of a building after it derailedPassengers described hearing a noise underneath the tram, after which it veered off its track, gathered speed and went into the side of a building.\"I thought it was an earthquake. I was sitting down and I fell on the floor, along with the other passengers,\" one man told Ansa news agency. \"It was terrible.\"As it left the track, the tram apparently first hit a traffic light before smashing the window of a restaurant. A delivery rider waiting at the traffic light and a young man on a pavement narrowly escaped injury, La Repubblica website reported.\"I got on at the first stop, [Piazza della] Repubblica,\" one female passenger told Corriere della Sera. \"I was standing next to the driver, and they all crashed into me.\"\"I just heard an enormous bang,\" said 27-year-old Anna, who was in an office nearby, quoted by AFP. \"I saw a bit of the tram had gone into a shop.\"Civil protection teams set up a tent at the scene to help the injured.It is not clear what caused the derailment, although media reports suggested the tram had taken a sharp corner too quickly, as it turned out of Viale Vittorio Veneto.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her \"deepest condolences\" over the deaths.Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala and other city officials visited the scene of the crash.Sala said the incident was a \"tragedy\" and that there would be investigations. The driver was \"very experienced\", he said, adding that he had only been on duty for an hour and was not working overtime.\"The thing that is a little strange, you see, is that there is a stop here that was skipped, and so that adds another element to what happened,\" Sala said, quoted by Reuters.  He added that the possibility the driver had suddenly been taken ill was being considered.ReutersEmergency workers have been tending to victims at the site of the crashTransport company ATM said in a statement it was \"deeply shaken\" by the incident, and said its thoughts were with the victims and their families.The incident comes at a time when the city is packed with international visitors, celebrities and journalists for Milan Fashion Week. It has also just finished hosting the Winter Olympics and is preparing to host the Paralympics.The three-car tram is one of a new bidirectional type with drivers' cabs at either end, introduced in the city only a few weeks ago, according to Corriere della Sera.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRebecca MorelleScience EditorNASAThe Artemis missions will return humans to the Moon for the first time in 50 yearsNasa is adding an extra mission to its Artemis programme before it attempts to land astronauts on the Moon for the first time in half a century.The original plan was to fly around the Moon for the Artemis II mission, which is currently scheduled for April, and then attempt a lunar landing with Artemis III in 2028.Now Artemis III will stay closer to home - a crew will head to low-Earth orbit in 2027 to practice docking with a lunar lander. Nasa said this additional flight would not slow down its return to the Moon - it is still aiming for 2028 for one or even two lunar landings in what will be Artemis IV and V. Nasa administrator Jared Isaacman told a media briefing that he was adding an extra step to the Artemis programme because he did not want such long gaps between launches. He added that the extra flight to low-Earth orbit would help to test the technology before a Moon landing.The US space agency also provided an update on the Artemis II mission, which will see four astronauts fly around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth.Nasa was targeting March for the launch, but its plans were delayed after a helium leak was discovered on the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket.The rocket has now been taken from the launchpad to the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida where it will be repaired. The earliest launch opportunity is now in April - but Nasa said the exact date would depend on how long the technical work would take.Watch: Nasa official says Artemis issue leading to delay \"disappointing\"The new plans are a significant change to Artemis programme.Isaacman said the current architecture was \"not a pathway to success.\"\"You don't go from one uncrewed launch of SLS [Artemis I], wait three years, go around the Moon [Artemis II], wait three years and land on it.\"He said sending the Orion capsule - which is the spacecraft that the astronauts will travel to the Moon in - and a lunar lander into low-Earth orbit first would reduce risks.\"I would certainly much rather have the astronauts testing out the integrated systems of the lander and Orion in low-Earth orbit than on the Moon,\" he said.\"It's also an opportunity for us, maybe, to get our suits up there before the astronauts actually have to wear them on the surface of the Moon ... this is all going to help take down risk for a subsequent landing.\"However Nasa's lunar plans have a major missing part - the lander that will take astronauts to the Moon's surface has not yet been selected.Elon Musk's SpaceX company has a contract to build the lander - which will be flown to the Moon on a SpaceX Starship rocket. But delays to the Starship rocket have led Nasa to ask SpaceX for a new streamlined plan to speed a return to the Moon.Nasa has also asked rival company Blue Origin - which is owned by Jeff Bezos - to come up with an accelerated plan for a lunar lander.Isaacman said the Artemis III docking in low Earth orbit could take place with one or both of the landers.The US is under pressure to return to the Moon. China is aiming for a lunar landing by 2030, and has been making steady progress towards this.Both nations are planning to land at the Moon's south pole - and are competing for the best spots to build their lunar bases.NASAFour astronauts will head around the Moon for the Artemis II mission",

    "body": "5 hours agoHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentLightRocket via Getty ImagesThe Green Party's winning candidate Hannah Spencer addressed the press after winning the by-electionThere are so many implications of the Gorton and Denton by-election that are essential to understand, but it's best first to dwell on the winner: the Greens.The closest they had come to winning a Westminster by-election before was in 2023 in a seat in Somerset where they got about 10% of the vote and finished third.Blasting away one of Labour's biggest majorities shows that under the more left-populist leadership of Zack Polanski, the Greens are now playing in a different political league.Polanski and the party's new MP, Hannah Spencer, were explicit that they do not see this as a self-contained local contest but as the blueprint for all sorts of other parts of the country.The fear among plenty of Labour MPs is that they are right. Labour politicians have over the past year or so become comfortable with the idea that Reform UK could usurp the Conservatives as the main force on the right of British politics.Now they are confronted with the niggling possibility that something similar could be happening on their side of the political spectrum too.It is much too soon to assert that this is likely or even plausible. But it certainly is possible, and that is part of the reason why this by-election may linger long in the memory.As it stands - and that is an important caveat - there are no signs that result in Greater Manchester will precipitate another Labour leadership wobble in the immediate term. Getty ImagesGreen Party leader Zack Polanski was also present to celebrate the win with SpencerEven a Labour MP who messaged me about Sir Keir Starmer in the aftermath of the result simply saying \"time to go\" took the view that any change should happen after the May elections rather than now.Nevertheless, the call from Angela Rayner, Sir Keir's former deputy, for Labour to take this as a \"wake up call\" and become \"braver\" was notably forthright.A word about the Conservatives. Gorton and Denton was not their natural terrain and tactical voting was rife, but even so getting just 700 or so votes and losing their deposit is a bleak omen. The party which was in government less than two years ago ended up about 14,000 votes behind the winner and only 547 votes ahead of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party's \"Sir Oink A-Lot\".It's worth remembering that this is the second by-election since the 2024 general election. Yes, it is fairly typical for governing parties to get a kicking in by-elections. But taken together, along with the Conservatives' political no-shows in both contests, these by-elections point to a new dynamic of surging political forces to the traditional parties' left and right.",

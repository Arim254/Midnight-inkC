    "body": "51 minutes agoAlys DaviesAFP via Getty ImagesMore than 30 people are thought to be missing following the landslide in CebuRescue workers are racing to find dozens of people still missing following a landslide at a landfill site in the central Philippines earlier this week, an official has said.Mayor Nestor Archival said on Saturday that signs of life had been detected at the site in Cebu City, two days after the incident.Four people have been confirmed dead so far, Archival said, while 12 others have been taken to hospital. Conditions for emergency services working at the site are challenging, the mayor added, with hazards such as unstable debris and crew waiting for better equipment to arrive. The privately-owned Binaliw landfill collapsed on Thursday while 110 workers were on site, officials said.In a Facebook post on Saturday morning local time, Archival said: \"Authorities confirmed the presence of detected signs of life in specific areas, requiring continued careful excavation and the deployment of a more advanced 50-ton crane.\"Conditions for rescue workers at the site are difficult, with the wreckage still unstable.Relatives of those missing have been waiting anxiously for any news of their whereabouts. More than 30 people, all workers at the landfill, are thought to be missing.\"We are just hoping that we can get someone alive... We are racing against time, that's why our deployment is 24/7,\" Cebu City councillor Dave Tumulak, chairman of the city's disaster council, told AFP news agency.AFP via Getty ImagesRelatives of the missing are waiting anxiously for any news of their loved onesJerahmey Espinoza, whose husband is missing, told Reuters news agency at the site on Saturday: \"They haven't seen him or located him ever since the disaster happened. We're still hopeful that he's alive.\"The cause of the collapse is still unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera previously said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices.Operators had been cutting into the mountain, mining the soil, and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman on Friday.The Binaliw landfill is about 15 hectares (37 acres).Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "body": "2 hours agoZhara Simpson,South WestandArchie Farmer,South WestA man in his 50s has been found dead after a tree fell on to a caravan during Storm Goretti. Devon and Cornwall Police said emergency services were called to the Mawgan area of Helston, Cornwall, at about 19:35 GMT on Thursday after the tree fell during a red weather warning for wind.\"Tragically, a man aged in his 50s was located deceased within the caravan,\" police said, adding his next of kin had been informed and were being supported by officers. Police said work took place at the scene on Friday to safely remove the tree and make further inquiries at the scene. The death was not being treated as suspicious and a file would be prepared for the coroner, they added.The Met Office issued the rare red weather warning on Thursday between 16:00 to 23:00, which caused major damage and disruption across the county.Red warnings say \"exposed places\" are most at risk, bringing the risk of falling debris and a danger to life. The storm saw gusts of up to 100mph (160km/h) in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.Cornwall Council said the storm had been \"one of the most severe\" the county had experienced \"in living memory\", with crews working around the clock to clear fallen trees and carry out emergency repairs.The clean-up is continuing into the weekend.A yellow warning for ice, including in parts of east Cornwall, issued from 12:00 GMT on Friday is due to end at midday. More than 34,000 premises are still without electricity in the south-west of England, the National Grid said. Staff were working \"tirelessly\" to fix issues, it added.",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ronnie O'Sullivan has won seven world crowns, eight Masters titles and eight UK Championships since turning professional in 1992ByLorraine McKennaBBC Sport journalistRonnie O'Sullivan has withdrawn from the Masters for medical reasons. The 50-year-old world number eight, who won a record-extending eighth title in 2024, also pulled out of last year's event on medical grounds. He was due to face Australian Neil Robertson in the opening round on Wednesday but has now been replaced in the draw by Scottish Open champion Chris Wakelin.O'Sullivan, who claimed his first Masters crown in 1995 at the age of 19, said he made the \"nightmare decision\" not to take part in the Triple Crown event in 2025 because he was under a lot of pressure and \"lost the plot\". The exact nature of his medical condition has not been disclosed.O'Sullivan has cited medical reasons or the need to prioritise his mental health for his withdrawals from serveral tournaments in recent years, including the British Open, Wuhan Open and World Grand Prix. 'The Rocket', who now lives in Dubai with his family, last competed at the UK Championship in December when he was beaten 6-4 in the first round by China's Zhou Yuelong at York Barbican. After his elimination, the Englishman said he was still unsure whether he would play at the Masters and would wait to see how he felt in January.His next opportunity to play competitively in Britain will be either the Tour Championship in Manchester at the end of March or the World Championship in Sheffield in April.O'Sullivan will be disappointed to miss out  - analysisJamie BroughtonBBC 5 Live Snooker ReporterThis is the second year running the record eight-time champion has been forced to withdraw from the Masters on medical grounds.And he'll be very disappointed to miss out on playing in one of his favourite tournaments. This Triple Crown event only features the world's top-16 ranked players and is one of the most prestigious tournaments to win.O'Sullivan always receives an incredible reception when he plays at Ally Pally, and many snooker fans were looking forward to watching his match against the two-time winner Neil Robertson on Wednesday night - which was arguably the pick of the first-round action.Robertson will now face Wakelin, who has played well this season, having already won the Scottish Open.",

    "body": "'Unprecedented' numbers seeking debt help post-Christmas, say charities12 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesDebt charities say they are receiving an influx of calls as people worry their financial situation has slipped towards becoming unmanageable.The first weeks of January are usually the busiest time of year for helplines following a particularly expensive period.Advice charity StepChange said Monday was busier than any single day last year, and credit counselling service Money Wellness said a fifth of those accessing its services at the turn of the year did so between 22:00 and 03:00.Dave Murphy is working his way out of debt and said demands from creditors could have become overwhelming, but he urged anyone struggling to ensure they asked for help - for their financial and mental wellbeing.Money Wellness, which runs free debt and money advice services, said thousands of people had accessed its services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Expanded assistance online allows people to increasingly find information outside of normal hours - including overnight.Sebrina McCullough, its head of advice, said: \"The numbers we're seeing over Christmas and New Year are unprecedented.\"People often feel pressure to celebrate the holidays, even when money is tight, and our data shows many are turning to us late at night when they feel most anxious.\"Pressure of priority billsStepChange's website had 3,958 visitors on Christmas Day, and 15,401 on New Year's Eve and 1 January combined.Many may have simply been exploring their options, but calls came in thick and fast at the start of the month. While not at the level of the energy crisis of a few years ago, call numbers were notably up on last year.The Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline, said the first working days of January had seen more calls than last year.Monday was the busiest single day in its history, when 1,365 calls came in.Concerns are particularly acute for those struggling to pay priority bills such as council tax and rent.The colder weather could also place extra strain on vulnerable households, with £4.4bn already owed to energy suppliers following a period of high prices, although the government's cold weather payments have been triggered in many areas.Charities are urging anyone whose debt has become unmanageable to seek help as soon as possible, rather than making matters worse by ignoring the situation.That is a view shared by Dave, who has managed to work his way out of difficulty. A few years ago, he found his previously manageable credit card debt becoming a problem when he was unexpectedly made redundant at the same time as going through a divorce.Dave has turned his finances around after receiving help from StepChange\"They were two quite dramatic things in six months,\" said Dave, who has previously spoken to the BBC about his debt issues.\"The debt was around £20,000 to £25,000 at its height. It became so overwhelming. You feel that you are letting creditors down because you want to do what they ask of you - but you are scared, you are renting, and at times you struggle to get through each day.\"Once you are in a spiral, it is really hard to get out of it.\"He is now working in insurance, his debts are manageable and being paid off, and he said he wanted to help others \"to show that you can get through these things\".Figures published earlier in the week by the Bank of England fuelled concerns that everyday costs were becoming harder for some households to manage without turning to borrowing.The data showed that credit card borrowing grew at the fastest annual rate in nearly two years in the run-up to Christmas.The annual growth rate for credit card borrowing increased to 12.1% in November, from 10.9% the previous month - the highest figure since January 2024 when it was 12.5%.",

    "body": "Elon Musk has said critics of his social media site X are looking for \"any excuse for censorship\", after its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok drew criticism over its use to create sexualised images of people without their knowledge or consent.Ofcom says it is conducting an urgent assessment of X in response, with the backing of Technology Secretary Liz Kendall.But the chairwomen of Parliament's technology and media committees have both said they are concerned that \"gaps\" in the Online Safety Act might hinder the media regulator's ability to deal with the matter.X has now limited the use of AI image function to those who pay a monthly fee, a change dubbed by Downing Street as \"insulting\" to victims of sexual violence.The BBC has seen several examples of the free AI tool undressing women and putting them in sexual situations without their consent.Kendall said on Friday that expects an update from Ofcom within days, and that it would have the government's full support should it decide to block X in the UK.Musk reposted a number of messages on the site overnight criticising the government's reproval of Grok - including one which showed AI-generated images of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a bikini.\"They just want to suppress free speech,\" Musk wrote.Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Elon Musk's children, told BBC Newshour on Friday that Grok had generated sexualised photos of her as a child. The conservative influencer said her image had been \"stripped\" to appear \"basically nude, bent over\", despite her telling Grok that she did not consent to the sexualised images.St Clair, who filed a lawsuit against Musk in 2025 seeking sole custody of their child, accused the social media site of \"not taking enough action\" to tackle illegal content, including child sexual abuse imagery. \"This could be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" she said.As of Friday morning, Grok was telling users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that \"image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers\", adding users \"can subscribe to unlock these features\".An Ofcom spokesperson said on Friday: \"We urgently made contact [with X] on Monday and set a firm deadline of today to explain themselves, to which we have received a response.\"We're now undertaking an expedited assessment as a matter of urgency and will provide further updates shortly.\"Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping X raise money or be accessed in the UK - should the firm refuse to comply.But Dame Chi Onwurah, chairwoman of the innovation and technology committee, said she was \"concerned and confused\" about how the matter is \"actually being addressed\", and has written to Ofcom and Kendall for clarification.Dame Chi said it was \"unclear\" under the Online Safety Act whether the creation of such images using AI was illegal, as was the responsibility of social media sites for what was shared on their platforms.\"The act should really make something so harmful to so many people clearly illegal, and X's responsibility should be clear,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Caroline Dinenage, chairwoman of the culture, media and sport committee, likewise said she had a \"real fear that there is a gap in the regulation\".\"There are doubts as to whether the Online Safety Act actually has the power to regulate functionality - that means generative AI's ability to nudify someone's image,\" she told BBC Breakfast.The use of Grok to generate non-consensual sexualised images has been condemned by politicians on all sides: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called it \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said it was \"horrible in every way\" and that X \"needs to go further\" than the changes it had made to Grok on Friday, but he added that banning the platform would be an attack on free speech The Liberal Democrats called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site was investigated.Elsewhere, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he agreed with Starmer that the material was \"completely abhorrent\".\"It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility,\" Albanese said, adding that Australia's digital safety commissioner was looking at the situation.\"Australians and indeed, global citizens deserve better.\"Meanwhile, Grok was temporarily suspended in Indonesia on Saturday. The country's digital minister said \"non-consensual sexual deepfakes [were] a serious violation of human rights, dignity and the security of citizens in the digital space\".",

    "body": "England international Georgia Stanway will leave Bayern Munich upon the expiry of her contract at the end of the season.The 27-year-old moved to Bayern from Manchester City in 2022 and has won three league titles.During her time in Germany, she has won two European Championships with the Lionesses and has become recognised as one of the best midfielders in the world.Stanway, who has 87 caps for England, is permitted to sign a pre-contract agreement with another club this month with a view to joining in the summer.It is understood Arsenal have emerged as the frontrunners and have been in talks with Stanway over a potential agreement, though other clubs have shown interest.\"I am incredibly grateful to Bayern. Thankfully, my time here isn't over yet,\" Stanway said in a club statement on Saturday. \"The decision to leave was incredibly difficult. I definitely didn't make it lightly. I've made friends and memories here that will last a lifetime, and I've been able to develop enormously as both a player and a person. \"I will give absolutely everything for Bayern and our sporting success until the very last day - just as I have for the past three and a half years.\"Should Arsenal agree a deal with Stanway, it would be regarded as one of the biggest transfers of the January window. Arsenal are looking to build a squad capable of winning the Women's Super League, having lifted the Champions League trophy in May, and are working to secure additions for the summer. Manager Renee Slegers also signed a new three-year deal this week.Ben Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "body": "4 days agoAnna LewisBBC Wales Getty ImagesCharlotte Church says her father's \"deep stewardship\" helped her navigate being a child star Charlotte Church has said she \"would be dead\" without the influence of her father, after growing up in the spotlight.The Cardiff-born singer opened up on her close relationship with her father, James Church, in public speaking coach Deborah Thomas's podcast, These Three Things. Church, 39, credited her dad with helping her navigate the \"child star route\", adding: \"It's so arduous and there are so many temptations along the way, and so it would have been so easy for me to have fallen into addiction...\" In the interview, the star said she had a \"lot going on\" and that her father, who has a terminal diagnosis of rare blood disorder amyloidosis, was currently in hospital. During the podcast, which asks guests to share a special person, place and possession which has shaped them, Church said her father was an \"absolutely extraordinary human\" who had been through \"so much\", including battling septicaemia seven times. Describing the start of her career as a child touring with mother Maria, she said: \"We really missed him on the road. My family aren't very traditional in any way at all, and so my father was far more sort of like the nurturing one.\"The singer, who recently appeared on Celebrity Traitors, was just 11 years old when she rose to global fame and earned the moniker the Voice of an Angel.Church said her father joined them on the road after a year and would help take care of her while her mother dealt with the business side of her career, describing him as like \"the hearth\". \"He was sort of worldly and wise enough that he could ground me in a perspective, ground me in the transience of it all, and that it probably wouldn't be forever, and just [try] to say let's enjoy it while it's here.\" Church, who runs a wellness retreat in the Nant Caethon Valley in Powys, said it had been a \"journey\" since her father's terminal diagnosis nearly a decade ago. \"Pretty much every year in those nine years, he's had a near-death experience where it's like something's happened.\"He has really had to tolerate this rollercoaster of health and emotions and everything associated. But it's also a very long time to live with a terminal diagnosis, and so it's massively changed him.\"Speaking about her father's impact on her life, Church added: \"I'm making him a photo album, and I think that'll be very emotional for us to go through. \"But in general, I am able to tell him what he means to me, and how he has massively shaped my life and shaped who I am.\"Without him, I'd be dead.\" More top stories",

    "body": "11 hours agoSarah SmithNorth America editorPresident Donald Trump says the US needs to \"own\" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from doing so. \"Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland,\" Trump told reporters on Friday, in response to a question from the BBC.We will do it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\", he added. The White House said recently the administration is considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato member Denmark, but it would not rule out the option of annexing it by force. Denmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale. Denmark has said military action would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic defence alliance.In a joint statement on Friday night, Greenland's party leaders, including the opposition, reiterated their call for the \"US's disregard for our country to end\".\"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" they said. \"The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\"Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US president has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, claiming without evidence that it was \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\".The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a lease agreement was not good enough.\"Countries can't make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals,\" he said, adding that they had to have ownership. \"I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia,\" Trump said. \"But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen.\"\"And by the way Nato's got to understand that,\" the US president added.Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that \"only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations\".Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week.In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.",

    "body": "Video emerges of Minneapolis shooting filmed by ICE agent who opened fire1 hour agoElaine OkyereWatch: Video filmed by ICE agent who shot Minneapolis woman has emergedA video filmed by the US immigration agent who fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday has emerged, showing the moments before gunfire rang out.The 47-second footage, obtained by Minnesota-based outlet Alpha News, shows Renee Nicole Good sitting behind the wheel of her car and speaking to the officer. US Vice-President JD Vance shared the clip on social media, commenting that the agent had acted in self-defence. Local officials have insisted the woman posed no danger.Good's wife has paid tribute to the 37-year-old, saying the pair were trying to support their neighbours when she was shot. Her death has sparked protests across the US. President Donald Trump's administration says Good tried to run over the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in an act of \"domestic terrorism\" after blocking the road and impeding the agency's work.Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has described that account as \"garbage\" based on the video footage.The BBC has asked the homeland security department and the White House for comment on the new video that emerged on Friday.The footage starts with the officer getting out of his car and filming Good's vehicle and registration plate while he walks around the Honda SUV. A dog is in the backseat. Good says: \"That's fine dude. I'm not mad at you.\"Her wife, Becca Good, is standing on the street filming the interaction with her mobile phone. She tells the ICE agent: \"That's OK, we don't change our plates every morning just so you know. It will be the same plate when you come talk to us later.\"She adds: \"You want to come at us? You want to come at us? I say go and get yourself some lunch, big boy.\"Another agent approaches Good on the driver's side and uses an expletive as he says: \"Get out of the car.\" The agent filming the clip moves in front of Good's car as she reverses.In a chaotic couple of seconds, she turns the wheel to the right and pulls forwards.The camera jerks up to the sky. \"Woah, woah!\" a voice says, as bangs are heard.In the final part of the video the car is seen veering down the road. The ICE agent swears.Other clips released previously from the scene show the maroon SUV crashed into the side of the road after the woman was shot by the agent.The officer appears to stay on his feet, and is later seen in other videos walking towards Good's crashed car. Federal officials say the agent was injured and treated in hospital. The FBI is investigating the incident.An earlier video shows the incident from another perspectiveThe officer who fired on Good is Jonathan Ross, a veteran ICE agent who was previously injured in the line of duty when he was struck by a car. When asked about the video at the White House on Friday, President Trump said: \"You have agitators and we will always be protecting ICE, and we're always going to be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.\"On Friday, Vance reposted the video on X, and defended the agent's actions, saying: \"The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self-defence.\"White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt also reposted the video, saying the media had smeared an ICE agent who had \"properly defended himself from being run over\". Good's wife told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours. \"We had whistles,\" Becca Good said. \"They had guns.\"When speaking about Good - a mother-of-three, including a six-year-old son - she said \"kindness radiated out of her\".\"We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness,\" she added.Demonstrators turned out for a third night of protests on Friday over the killing of Good. Photos showed protesters gathered outside a hotel in the city, believed to be where some ICE agents were staying.Minnesota's Department of Public Safety said it assisted police officers with arresting people suspected of unlawful assembly, after responding to an area around the Canopy Hotel in the city and giving dispersal orders.The public safety department said it received \"information that demonstrations were no longer peaceful and reports of damage to property\".Minnesota Governor Tim Walz earlier said he had activated the state's National Guard to help with security of the protests.On Friday, Minnesota officials said they would open an inquiry into the shooting after saying they had been frozen out of the federal investigation.Trump was asked by a reporter at the White House on Friday whether the FBI should share its findings with Minnesota, and said: \"Well normally I would, but they're crooked officials.\"Hennepin County's top prosecutor Mary Moriarty and the state's Democratic attorney general, Keith Ellison, said they were launching their own probe.It came a day after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the FBI had initially pledged a joint investigation, then reversed course.One federal agency that is not looking into the shooting is the US justice department's Civil Rights Division, which has in the past investigated alleged excessive use of force by law enforcement.But prosecutors have advised its criminal section that there will be no investigation in this case, sources told the BBC's US media partner CBS News. Governor Walz, a Democrat, has accused the Trump administration of blocking state officials, but Vice-President Vance said it was a federal matter. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern Europe correspondent in Crans-Montana'In this shared grief we stand united': Day of mourning for New Year's Eve fire victims in SwitzerlandTragedy brought people together in Crans-Montana and brought the country to a standstill.On Friday, just down the road from the bar where 40 young people were killed by fire on New Year's Eve, church bells rang in their memory.They tolled right across Switzerland, to mark a national day of mourning.Then, moments after the last notes of a special memorial service had faded, came the news that one of the bar's owners had been detained.Swiss prosecutors said Jacques Moretti, a French national, was a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Many of the victims' families had demanded action like this from the start: more than a week after the fire, the anger in this community has been increasing.At the main ceremony in Martigny, down in the valley, relatives of the dead were joined by survivors. Some had come from hospital for the memorial. People held white roses in their laps and gripped each other's hands for support.\"The images we faced were unbearable. A scene worse than a nightmare. Screams ringing out in the icy cold, the smell of burning. It was apocalyptic,\" a young woman called Marie told the audience. She had been in a bar opposite Le Constellation when the fire broke out and suddenly found herself helping the injured as they ran from the flames.She said she would never forget what she'd seen.Listening in the front row were the presidents of France and Italy, whose citizens were among those killed and injured in the fire. Both countries have opened their own investigations.Back in Rome, Italy's prime minister vowed to make sure all those responsible were identified.\"This was no accident. It was the result of too many people who did not do their jobs,\" Giorgia Meloni said. She wants to know why the music wasn't cut as soon as the fire started.\"Why did no-one tell the young people to get out? Why did the council not make the proper checks? There are too many whys.\"In Crans-Montana people have the same questions and many more.For now, the only two formal suspects are the co-owners of Le Constellation, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. Early on Friday, the pair were called in by prosecutors.  They are being investigated for causing death and injury through negligence but have not been charged. Now Jacques Moretti has been remanded in custody. In a statement, the public ministry said the move followed a \"new assessment of the flight risk.\"\"I constantly think of the victims and of the people who are struggling,\" his wife told a crush of TV cameras after several hours of questioning at the ministry.It was her first public comment since the fire.\"It is an unimaginable tragedy. It happened in our establishment, and I would like to apologise.\"Nine days on, Le Constellation is still obscured from view behind white plastic sheets. A lone policeman stands guard, his face covered against the relentless snow.What unfolded inside the building's basement has gradually become clearer – and it's the story of a disaster that should never have happened.Mobile phone footage shows a sparkler tied to a champagne bottle apparently starting the fire as it brushes the ceiling. Covered with soundproofing foam that was never safety tested, it ignites quickly.When the crowd eventually rush for the exit in panic, there is a crush on the stairs. It seems the emergency doors were blocked.But another video, from six years ago, suggests the risk was well known. On the footage, a waiter can be heard warning that the material on the ceiling is flammable.\"Be careful with the foam,\" the voice shouts, as people wave the same sparklers.But the questions here are not just for the owners.This week the local authorities in Crans made the shocking admission that they hadn't carried out mandatory safety checks of the bar for five years.They offered no explanation.\"It was a hell inside that bar. More than 1,000 degrees of temperature. There was no way to escape,\" Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told the BBC, citing a long list of safety violations.  Six Italians were killed as a result.\"Italy wants justice, the Italian government wants justice and the Italian people want justice, for sure. The families want justice,\" the ambassador stressed.That includes for those with life-changing injuries.The regional hospital in Sion took the first major influx of patients. The stress was compounded by the fact that many doctors' own children were partying in Crans for the New Year.\"They were all scared the next stretcher to arrive would be carrying their own child,\" hospital director Eric Bonvin remembers.But he's proud of how his team coped.Some casualties were unconscious and so badly burned, it took time to identify them.The most serious cases were moved to specialist burns centres elsewhere in Switzerland and in Europe where some are still in a critical condition.All face a long, tough path to recovery which the doctor likens to a \"rebirth\" because many of his young patients have severe burns to the face.\"First the body needs to be protected, like the foetus in a mother's womb. That's what's happening for many now. Then they will have to re-enter the world and find their identity,\" Professor Bonvin says.\"It will take a lot of work and resilience.\"Add to that the anguish of surviving.\"They came round and at first they felt lucky to be alive. But some now feel this guilt, wondering why they are here, but not their friend or brother,\" Bonvin explains.\"It is a delicate moment.\"In central Crans, the heap of tributes for the dead is still growing, protected from the elements by a canvas.After leaving their own fresh flowers on Friday, many people then stood in front of the ruins of the bar itself for a moment. Remembering, in silence.",

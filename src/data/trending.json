    "body": "2 hours agoIsaac AsheEast MidlandsGetty ImagesThe Serious Fraud Office said the charges were a \"critical step\" in its investigationsTwo people have been charged following the collapse of a pre-paid funeral firm that left tens of thousands of people out of pocket.About 46,000 customers lost thousands of pounds when Safe Hands Plans Ltd collapsed in 2022 and went into administration.The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has charged two men - Richard Wells and Neil Debenham - with conspiracy to defraud. It said Wells was the former director of SHP Capital Holdings Ltd - the parent company of Safe Hands - with Debenham described as a \"fellow senior executive\".Wells and Debenham are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 5 February.The SFO said the charges of Wells, 39, residing in Spain, and Debenham, 43, of Norwich, were a \"critical step\" in its investigation.Emma Luxton, director of operations, added planholders were left \"exposed, out of pocket and uncertain about their funeral arrangements\".Pre-paid funeral plans are designed to allow people to pay for their own funeral in advance, in order to help their families financially when they die.Since July 2022, pre-paid funeral providers have required approval to operate from the Financial Conduct Authority.Safe Hands was one of dozens of companies operating in the previously unregulated sector, and collapsed four months before the measures came in.Overall, planholders like Denise Hudson are owed an estimated £70.6m in totalThe administrator for Safe Hands, FRP Advisory, initially said planholders could receive repayments of between 8.5p and 12.5p for every pound they lost by June 2025.But after a six-month delay, the amount repaid to those affected by the funeral firm collapse proved to be much less - about 4p for every pound.Planholders are owed an estimated £70.6m in total.Among them are Denise Hudson, from Derby, who paid nearly £2,500 for a Safe Hands plan after seeing a TV advert in 2019, and was last year given a cheque for less than £100 by administrators.\"That was my savings. I gave it in good faith. I actually thought what it said on the tin, it is in safe hands,\" she said.Hudson told the BBC she might \"frame\" the cheque for £96.50, using it as a reminder to keep fighting.David and Sandie Beatty said they were \"angry\" and \"disappointed\" when Safe Hands collapsedIn 2017, Sandie and David Beatty, from Bingham in Nottinghamshire, paid Safe Hands £3,395 to cover the funeral costs for the first of them to die.Sandie said they felt \"angry, disappointed, sick\" when the firm collapsed.Aimee Geary, an NHS worker from Anstey in Leicestershire, paid £3,000 to Safe Hands in 2017.Geary said: \"Other people thought I was young [to be planning my funeral]. I'm very organised, and I didn't want anyone else to have a job when I'm not here.\"It's sad that you try to plan something and it has been taken away from you.\"Aimee Geary paid £3,000 for a Safe Hands plan in 2017Related internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterandJoshua Nevett,Political reporterEPADanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Sir Keir Starmer meet at ChequersDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has thanked Sir Keir Starmer for his \"strong support\" over US President Donald Trump's threats to annex Greenland, as the pair met in the UK.Frederiksen said it was important to know \"Europeans stand together\" and \"don't get divided\" during what she described as \"a difficult time for us\".Trump caused jitters across the western world when he ramped up calls for the US to take control of Greenland, a Danish territory in the Arctic.But the US president has now abandoned talk of a trade war after meeting Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte at Davos, saying the pair had come to an agreement over a potential deal on Arctic security.Sir Keir welcomed Trump dropping his threat to impose 10% import taxes on eight countries, including the UK.\"Now we can start hard yards and finding a way forward on security in the Arctic,\" said the prime minister.Speaking on a visit to Hertfordshire on Thursday, Sir Keir said \"it is a good thing\" that on Wednesday \"the threat of tariffs against the United Kingdom was lifted\".\"Now we can start hard yards and finding a way forward on security in the Arctic, which may seem a long way away, pretty remote, but actually it does matter to all of us in terms of the safety and security of our country,\" he said.\"And we've got through the last few days with a mix of British pragmatism, common sense, but also that British sense of sticking to our values and our principles.\"But now, as I say, the hard yards of actually finding a better way for security for our country, for Europe and across the globe.\"As she met Sir Keir at the British prime minister's grace-and-favour country estate Chequers, Frederiksen praised the \"British way\" of doing diplomacy.\"You are very pragmatic,\" Frederiksen said. \"You have a cup of tea and then you think a bit about everything. You get the facts on the table, and then you find a way forward, and that's exactly what we're doing now.\"Echoing lyrics from a Beatles song, the Danish prime minister said: \"So just to finalise, I think we've got to get by with a little help from our friends, also in this situation.\"Downing Street says \"serious behind-the-scenes diplomacy\" has resulted in President Trump withdrawing his threat of sanctions on Nato members over Greenland.The prime minister's official spokesperson said the UK had been in \"constant communication\" with the US administration and had been working closely with the Nato secretary general.No 10 said there was now an agreement to draw up a new framework on Nato's role in bolstering Arctic Security.Watch: Trump rolling back on tariffs threat a 'good thing', Starmer saysThe potential deal was reached when Trump met Rutte on the fringes of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where the US president suggested the framework could involve mineral rights.Details are currently sparse, but Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was \"not aware of any discussions at all\" on Greenland's  vast - and largely untapped - reserves of rare earth minerals, many of which are crucial for technologies including mobile phones and electric vehicles.Instead, she said the agreement was around an \"Arctic sentry\" allowing Nato countries to work together on a \"shared threat\" with \"different Arctic countries coming together, supported by other Nato countries\".Cooper said the climbdown was due to the UK's \"determined diplomacy\" and \"a very co-ordinated approach across allies\".This was despite a volley of social media posts by Trump aimed at the UK, including one where he branded the agreement to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands an \"act of great stupidity\", despite having previously welcomed the deal as a \"monumental achievement\".Those plans give the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while leasing back a key UK-US military base, following legal advice that otherwise the UK riosked losing the asset entirely.The prime minister came under fire at PMQs on Wednesday for his focus on a calm response to such threats rather than ramping up rhetoric around retaliation, with Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey insisting the UK must stand up to \"bullies\".  Sir Keir responded by making his most open statement of opposition to the US president yet, telling MPs that he would \"not yield\" in his stance over Greenland and vowed to stand up for British principles.Trump changing his stance on the UK's Chagos Islands deal was done with \"the express purpose of putting pressure on me and Britain\" over the Government's position on Greenland, Sir Keir told the Commons. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch backed the PM's stance on Greenland but criticised him for \"giving away territory we own and paying £35bn for the privilege,\" adding that the money should instead go towards the armed forces.Asked about the Chagos deal, Cooper said the figure was wrong and actually equated to \"0.2% of the defence budget\", adding opposition leaders were \"swallowing some of the propaganda\" and undermining the national interest.She added that Trump used the Chagos deal as a way of putting pressure on the UK over Greenland in recent days, calling it shameful that the Conservatives \"jumped on that bandwagon\".Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "16 hours agoAlex TaylorBBC NewsBBCNicky spent 10 years as a hostage negotiator for the Metropolitan PoliceBeing a parent and working as a hostage negotiator don't immediately appear to have a lot in common, but someone who has been both says tricks she learnt in her profession can help you at home.Nicky Perfect spent over 30 years as a Metropolitan Police officer, including 10 years as an international hostage and crisis negotiator, in the elite New Scotland Yard Hostage and Crisis Negotiation Unit.At times, she says, knowing what to do or say as a parent, can feel high-stakes - the difference between keeping the peace and a full-on meltdown or argument.Here are the three techniques from her high-pressure career which will help you stay calm and in control as a parent, she told the BBC's Parenting Download podcast, 1. Give them a 'no choice choice'Getty ImagesKids regularly push boundaries and often want to do the opposite of what you ask them.In situations like these rather than asserting your authority and using the \"because I said so\" phrase, try the \"no choice choice\", trick, says Nicky.This means reframing the situation by continuing to enforce one choice, but doing so in a manner that still gives your child a sense of control and influence. So, asking a child whether they want to put their coat on in the house or when they go outside, for example, can help them feel heard, respected and involved - all while leading to the same outcome.Another example could be giving a child that is refusing to eat vegetables the option between broccoli or sprouts.This may not work every time, but it can help limit immediate resistance.2. Wait 90 seconds before respondingGetty ImagesWhen dealing with sensitive topics, Nicky advises not responding for 90 seconds to  stop you responding emotionally.As an FBI agent once told her: \"your job in life is not to change people… you can't… the only thing you can choose is how to respond.\"It is important to remember this choice exists even when emotions threaten to overwhelm the logical side of our brain.\"The response might just be, 'do you know what? I'm being quite emotional now. I need to go away and think about this',\" says Nicky. \"Or it might be you just don't say anything, and you listen to what they've got to say.\"As a co-parent, she had to put this into practice herself when her stepdaughter admitted she wanted to spend Christmas Day with her dad and siblings after they moved further away.Internally, Nicky desperately wanted her to stay. But, she says, \"somewhere along the line you have to press the pause button... and say this is your Christmas. It's a day in my life. What do you want?\"Accepting this made it easier for her to decide how to spend the day herself - as well as plan a new way of celebrating together with her stepdaughter, either before or after.3. See their perspective Getty ImagesSeeing the world from the other person's point of view, be they big or small, is key, says Nicky.This way you can sell the benefits of your outcome to the other person, while also making them feel heard.\"It's called the 'power of' negotiation, because if you give people reasons why something should or shouldn't happen, they're more likely to accept it,\" says Nicky.\"It's about recognising it and being really honest with people. People are far more receptive to your honesty than you think they're going to be,\" she says.Take the common problem of tantrums over bedtime. Children can often struggle with the loss of autonomy that a sudden bedtime announcement brings.A solution, says Nicky, is to consider how the child feels in that moment, rather than view it as an adult.  If they're enjoying playing and then you suddenly say it's time to go to bed, this can feel abrupt and naturally upset them.Instead, her suggestion is to prepare the child as soon as they get home - weaving the night time routine naturally into the conversation and reinforcing it regularly throughout the evening. Something like \"we'll have dinner, then watch some TV and then it's bedtime\" acts as a good framework.The child then feels more involved and aware of what is coming, even if they don't necessarily like it - meaning hopefully fewer tantrums.",

    "body": "US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detained a 5-year-old boy on Tuesday during an enforcement operation, Minnesota school officials have said, as part of an immigration crackdown in the state.Pre-schooler Liam Ramos was with his father - named by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias - when Conejo Arias was approached by agents on his driveway. In a statement posted on X, the DHS said \"ICE did NOT target a child\", but was conducting an operation against his father, an \"illegal alien\" who \"abandoned\" his son when approached.Zena Stenvik, the Columbia Heights Public Schools superintendent, asked: \"Why detain a 5-year-old? \"You can't tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.\"Photos provided to the BBC by the school district show a boy, identified as Liam Ramos, wearing a bunny-shaped winter hat, standing outside as an officer holds onto his backpack.The Columbia Heights Public Schools authority described these as bystander photos. The district did not identify the individuals who took the pictures, referring to them as \"known and confirmed community members\".Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, told journalists that Liam and his father were likely being held at a detention centre in Texas. School officials said that the father had an active asylum case with no deportation order.The son had just arrived home from pre-school at the time of the apprehension, Stenvik said during a press conference on Wednesday.Around the time of the incident, school officials were present at the Ramos house to provide support, according to the schools superintendent.Stenvik said that ICE had recently detained a total of four students in her school district, including a 10-year-old, and two 17-year-olds.The DHS did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the incident.In its post on X, the DHS described the arrest as a \"targeted operation\". It added: \"For the child's safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias.\"Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administration's immigration enforcement.\"According to Stenvik, another adult living in the home did ask to take the young boy inside but was refused. It was not clear why. Instead, the school officials allege, an agent asked the child to knock on the door of the home to see if anyone else was there.Columbia Heights Public Schools Board of Education Chair Mary Granlund said in a statement: \"Our children should not be afraid to come to school or wait at the bus stop.\"Their families should not be afraid to drop off or pick up their children from school.\"The DHS has previously said it is arresting the \"worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\" in an effort to restore public safety in Minnesota.At a DHS press conference on Tuesday, Gregory Bovino of the US Border Patrol discussed the wider operation and said: \"Our operations are lawful, are targeted, and are focused on individuals who pose a serious threat to this community.\"The mission, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, has sparked outcry from residents in Minneapolis, St Paul, and other cities in the state.On 7 January, a federal officer fatally shot a woman named Renee Good in Minneapolis, sparking nationwide protest and condemnation from local and state officials.",

    "body": "Met Office weather warnings - including a more severe amber warning - have been issued for rain in parts of the UK.Heavy rain in eastern Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of England and Wales will bring significant rainfall totals and the risk of flooding.Strong winds will accompany the rain, particularly in north-east Scotland.Into Friday, Storm Ingrid - named by the Portuguese weather service - will bring rain and strong winds into south-western areas of England and Wales with further warnings issued here.Heavy rain and strong winds have continued in eastern Scotland, where there is a Met Office amber warning in force for Grampian, Angus, and Perth and Kinross until 18:00 GMT.Rainfall accumulations of 60-80mm are likely, with as much as 100-120mm over high ground. Totals since Wednesday evening may exceed 150 mm in a few places. This is expected to lead to some surface water and river flooding across the area.There is also a wider yellow warning across the rest of eastern Scotland where rainfall accumulations of 30-60mm will be seen widely.The Met Office warns that with the ground already saturated from recent rain and and snow thaw, this may lead to some flooding in places.A strong south-easterly wind in north-east Scotland will also make it feel particularly unpleasant.Additional yellow warnings are in force on Thursday across south-east Wales, Somerset and Devon from 08:00 to 16:00 and Northern Ireland from 10:00 to 23:59.Persistent and heavy rain in these areas through the day falling on saturated ground could lead to some flooding and transport disruption.On Thursday morning there were nearly 160 flood warnings in force across England, Scotland and Wales.Weather warningsFlood warningsElsewhere, the weather remains generally cloudy and breezy, with rain and drizzle.On Friday, the UK will be impacted by Storm Ingrid, which was named by the Portuguese weather service due to the impacts expected there from strong winds and heavy rain.The centre of Ingrid will move close to the south-west of England and north-west France. Winds in the UK will strengthen on Friday, with gusts up to 60mph expected in south-west England and Wales along with further heavy rain at times.A Met Office yellow warning will come into force here from 02:00 GMT Friday to 09:00 Saturday.While the winds won't be as powerful or dangerous as the near 100mph winds experienced in south-west England during Storm Goretti, there could still be some impacts.With saturated ground, flooding is possible and, with coastal gales, there will be large overtopping waves.It will likely stay windy through Saturday morning as the centre of Ingrid stalls to the south-west. Winds will gradually ease as the day progresses.The rest of the UK will avoid any impacts associated with Storm Ingrid, but the rain in eastern Scotland will continue, with some snow over higher ground.While Storm Ingrid will affect south-western parts of England, for the rest of the UK, we will start to see a brisk south-east to easterly wind.Drawing in colder air from north-east Europe, temperatures will start to drop over the weekend and next week with a cold snap.By Monday, temperatures will fall to 4 to 6C below the average for the end of January.The easterly wind will also likely bring occasional wintry showers, with snow for some parts of the UK.Where exactly, and how much snow, is not yet certain, but wintry hazards are likely.",

    "body": "11 minutes agoHenry Zeffman,Chief political correspondentandIain Watson,Political correspondentFormer Labour minister Andrew Gwynne has announced he is standing down as an MP, paving the way for Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to potentially run in a by-election in his Gorton and Denton constituency.In a statement, Gwynne said he had suffered \"significant ill health\" and had been advised by his GP that it wasn't safe for him to return to work as an MP.Gwynne's resignation possibly opens up a path for Burnham to return to the House of Commons and make a leadership challenge against Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.Speaking earlier, Burnham did not rule out such a challenge but said people \"shouldn't rush to conclusions\", adding he was \"very focused on my role as mayor\".Gwynne was elected as a Labour MP but was suspended from the party in 2025 after a reports he had sent offensive WhatsApp messages.His departure from the House of Commons triggers a by-election in his Greater Manchester constituency of Gorton and Denton, which Labour won at the last election with a majority of 13,000.One senior source told the BBC that Gwynne had reached agreement on a pension on Thursday – which would allow him to retire as an MP on medical grounds.Gwynne said his ill health had been \"greatly exacerbated by the impact of last year's events regarding leaked text messages\".He quoted extensively from his GP's advice, which said: \"I worry that there is still a marked dissociation between the reality of his difficulties and the 'front' that he shows to the world.\"The GP continued: \"I think that he will remain extremely vulnerable and further stress will cause rapid deterioration as it did in February.\"I do not think that he will be able to safely return to work as an MP.\"A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"We look forward to local residents in Gorton and Denton soon having the opportunity to get the representation they deserve with a new Labour MP.\"Asked about the speculation over Gwynne's seat, Sir Keir said: \"It is a very early stage, and the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party will set out the process in the usual way, as it always does for by-elections.\"Andy Burnham is doing an excellent job as Mayor of Manchester\".There have been suggestions Burnham would like to replace Sir Keir as party leader, however he would only be able to enter any leadership race as a Labour MP. If he decides to run in Gorton and Denton, Burnham would need approval to run from Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) a body which is generally seen as being supportive of Sir Keir.Several Labour sources said they expected the NEC to object on the grounds that Burnham standing for Parliament would in turn trigger a election for the Greater Manchester mayoralty, which would be seen as a drain on party funds as well as politically risky.It is also possible that the NEC would insist that there should be an all-women shortlist of possible Labour candidates for a by-election in the Commons because a majority of the party's MPs are currently men.But others in the party questioned whether, if the NEC blocked Burnham from standing, his allies among Labour MPs could force party officials to overturn that decision.If selected as Labour's candidate, he would still have to win a by-election in Gorton and Denton at a time when the party's popularity is low - although recent polling suggests Labour could hold on to the seat.In the 2024 general election, Gwynne won with 18,000 votes. The Reform UK candidate came second securing 5,000 votes, just ahead of the Greens who picked up 4,810 votes.Burnham has previously not denied he could challenge Sir Keir, saying: \"I'm not going to rule out what might or might not happen in the future.\"Steve Wright, general secretary of the Labour-affiliated Fire Brigades Union, said: \"It would be a democratic outrage if Andy Burnham was blocked from seeking selection as Labour's by-election candidate in this seat.\"Our union will fiercely resist any attempts to stitch up the selection.\"Commenting on the reports, SNP Westminster Leader Stephen Flynn said the Labour Party was in \"crisis\" and \"stuck in another bitter civil war\".\"While Labour MPs fight like rats-in-a-sack over Starmer's future, millions of families are paying the price,\" he said.Gwynne was sacked as a health minister and suspended from Labour last year after the Mail on Sunday published some of his private messages, including one disparaging an elderly constituent. Gwynne apologised for offence cause and said he regretted \"badly misjudged\" comments in the WhatsApp group named Trigger Me Timbers. The parliamentary commissioner for standards launched an investigation, which 11 months on has yet to be concluded. ",

    "body": "15 hours agoPaul AdamsDiplomatic correspondentGetty ImagesProtesters have taken to the streets outside the US consulate in Nuuk, Greenland this monthWhat on earth has the last fortnight been all about?In the wake of a successful military operation in Venezuela earlier this month, a buoyed-up Donald Trump started to ratchet up the rhetoric on Greenland.Day after day, the world was treated to claims of ownership, threats of military action and tariffs against traditional allies in Europe.Now, in an apparent puff of smoke, it may all have gone.Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, arguably the Trump whisperer-in-chief, seems to have talked the president down from his dangerously high hobby horse.Watch: Trump takes aim at world leaders in Davos speechThe ground may have been laid last week during a visit to Washington by the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland. The visit concluded with agreement on a \"working group\" to discuss Greenland's future.But Rutte appears to have finessed an issue that had threatened to shatter the north Atlantic alliance.We don't yet know the details of the deal, but many will wonder why it needed a frenetic two-week crisis to get here.Denmark had long said that it was only too happy to see an increased American military presence on Greenland.If Nato has now pledged to up its presence on and around the island, then that will go some way towards reassuring Donald Trump that the alliance is finally paying proper attention to Greenland.The New York Times quotes anonymous officials as saying one idea under discussion is for Denmark to cede sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases - similar to the arrangement by which the UK maintains sovereign bases on Cyprus.Watch: How was Trump's Davos speech received?Trump said the deal would involve access to Greenland's mineral resources.Neither Denmark nor Nato has confirmed these or any other reports.Nato said discussions would \"focus on ensuring Arctic security through the collective efforts, especially the seven Arctic Allies\" (the US, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland) and aimed to prevent Russia and China from gaining a foothold, economic or military, in Greenland.It won't be long before details of the deal emerge. But the fact that Donald Trump triggered a fortnight of high drama and a sense of existential crisis within Nato to get here will not easily be forgotten.Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney called it a \"rupture\", saying the old order was \"not coming back.\"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke of \"seismic change\" and urged greater European independence.It's hard to see a quick return to business as usual.Ros Atkins on...

    "body": "It remains one of the greatest quips the game has heard.\"And let that be a lesson to you all. No-one beats Vitas Gerulaitis 17 times in a row.\"Gerulaitis' acerbic assessment came in 1980 when the American finally beat Jimmy Connors after losing their previous 16 meetings.British number two Cameron Norrie has also turned to drollness as he prepares to face another opponent who has a 100% winning record over him.Norrie, Britain's final hope in the Australian Open singles, faces Germany's Alexander Zverev in the third round on Friday, having lost all six of their previous meetings.Asked what he can use as a positive, 30-year-old Norrie joked: \"I think I beat him in juniors once.\"Lopsided head-to-head records are not unusual at the highest level but some are considerably more dominant than others.France's Gael Monfils has lost all 20 of his meetings with 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic - the worst head-to-head record in ATP Tour history.Other flawed records include Richard Gasquet's 18-0 against Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer's 17-0 against Roger Federer.Being bounced by the all-time greats is not surprising, but there are some anomalies among the statistics.Reigning Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek, for example, has lost all of her six meetings with Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko.After losing to Ostapenko in Stuttgart last season, Swiatek disputed she had a mental block, saying her head \"was much more clear\" than previous matches.But two-time major champion Coco Gauff, who lost her first seven matches to Swiatek, said finally beating the Pole allowed her to \"play free\" when they met.American Gauff is now on a four-match winning streak against Swiatek, although she still trails 11-5 overall.\"It's still a big gap in the head-to-head, [but] I just erase it from my mind. I can't change the past, but I learned from it,\" Gauff said.\"I don't know how it will be at the end of our careers, but at least I know in future matches I won't be starting with the mental deficit.\"Norrie is not a player who seems fazed by the player across the net.But joking or not, harking back to beating Zverev when they played as teenagers over a decade ago might provide an additional boost.\"Since then he's got me every single time. He'll know that,\" 26th seed Norrie said.\"But it's nice being the underdog again. To go and play him, nothing to lose.\"There is no doubt 28-year-old Zverev has more damaging weapons than the Briton, but it remains a match-up that Norrie relishes.Going toe-to-toe with the three-time Grand Slam finalist in a Melbourne five-set thriller two years ago provides optimism.\"It's a match I feel quite comfortable with - especially in the rally I'm going to get rhythm,\" said Norrie, who was ranked as high as eighth in the world in 2022.\"I'm going to have to really to push him and make him uncomfortable for four hours to have a chance.\"He's a very complete player and he looks like he's playing well. I'm looking forward to it.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterUbisoft has cancelled six video games - including its long-awaited Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake - as part of a \"major reset\" of its operations.The French developer and publisher, known for popular games such as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Just Dance, has closed two studios and delayed seven titles as part of its changes.Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said the move would \"create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth\".The firm's shares plunged by 33% on Thursday morning following the announcement.The move comes at a time when studios are increasingly turning to video game remakes and remasters, with new versions of Super Mario Galaxy, Oblivion and Metal Gear Solid 3 proving popular in 2025.So the decision to bin the remake of Sands of Time - which sold millions of copies in 2003 - has left many fans scratching their heads.Ubisoft has not specified which titles it has discontinued alongside the Prince of Persia remake.But it says among them are four unannounced titles, including three based on new intellectual property, and a mobile game.Ubisoft has closed its studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Halifax, Canada as part of the move, which will include restructuring three others.The developers were working on a new intellectual property (IP) and mobile titles for Assassin's Creed, respectively.The closure of Ubisoft Halifax was previously announced in January - the same week the studio formed a union.  \"While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organisation over the long term,\" Guillemot said.\"Taken together, these measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term\".Gaming industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls told the BBC the move indicated the firm was trying to mitigate risk.\"It's less risky to maintain scale by investing in existing big franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six than launch entirely new IPs and that's reflected in the cancellation of a number of games based on new IPs,\" he said.It is the second restructure from Ubisoft in subsequent years, after the firm cut 185 jobs across Europe in 2025.In the UK, it closed its office in Leamington and restructured another in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.Guillemot said the new move was in part due to a competitive market for triple-A games - blockbuster titles which cost millions to develop and dominate large studios' offerings.\"On the one hand, the triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday.Such big offerings are increasingly facing delays - with Grand Theft Auto VI pushed back for a second time to November 2026.But Guillemot said despite these hurdles, successful blockbuster games could bring \"more financial potential than ever\".\"In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time,\" he said.Ubisoft will now focus on developing open world adventure games - which let players freely navigate vast environments - and live service games which seek regular payments from players.The firm said its subsidiary Vantage Studios, created after a €1.25bn ($1.25bn; £1bn) investment from Chinese tech giant Tencent, would aim to turn Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six \"into annual billionaire brands\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoSofia Ferreira Santos,Tom SymondsandHelena Wilkinson,Royal Courts of JusticeElizabeth Hurley has said she felt \"crushed\" by her privacy being invaded by the press, the trial against the publisher of the Daily Mail has been told.In her witness statement, Hurley alleges that the Mail tapped her landlines and placed \"surreptitious mics on my home windows\" in an effort to get stories.The actress became tearful as she gave evidence in her case against the Mail and Mail on Sunday publisher Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) at London's Royal Courts of Justice on Thursday.She is one of seven high-profile claimants accusing ANL of \"grave breaches of privacy\" over a 20-year period. The publisher has denied wrongdoing.Hurley's claim relates to 15 articles published between 2002 and 2011, through which she says ANL \"wilfully exploited my stolen information using its arsenal of illegal means\". Five of those are about her son, Damian, and his late father, film producer Steve Bing.She alleges the Mail also stole her medical information while she was pregnant with Damian, whom she calls the \"centre of my world\".She is also claiming for 10 more articles which \"were written by journalists who were commissioning other private investigators to do similar unlawful things\", she said in her statement.When shown some of the articles relating to her claim, she became tearful in court and wiped her eyes and nose with a tissue.In tears, she said it was \"deeply hurtful\" to read the statement of a private investigator, Gavin Burrows, who Hurley alleges admitted, \"bugging and listening to all my conversations.\"Hurley told the court on Thursday that she had learned about Burrows' statement just before Christmas in 2020. He has denied he made it and claimed the signature on the document was false.Hurley said in her witness statement that discovering the alleged phone tapping \"devastated me\". \"I had not come across this brutal invasion of privacy in either of my two battles with the other newspapers,\" she said. \"It wasn't just phone hacking... it was a violation on a whole different mortifying and enraging scale.\"She became emotional as she concluded her evidence, saying she found it \"traumatic\" to appear before the court.\"With respect, I don't want to be here,\" she told her lawyer, and said it was \"very painful\" to discuss the events of the past.When asked in the witness box why she had not previously taken legal action against the publisher, Hurley said it was because from what she remembered, \"complaints were for libel\" and the articles were \"in essence true\".\"I believe that is because people were listening to me speak,\" she told the court.It was put to her by Antony White KC for ANL that there had been \"leaks in your camp\" which had led to stories, and she agreed she had initially thought that.But Hurley insisted that none of her close friends would have talked to the press without her permission.Challenged about a 2001 story in Hello Magazine, the barrister pointed out that two friends had been quoted talking about her.\"They would never ever say anything indiscreet about me,\" she replied.Another claimant, the Duke of Sussex, was seen entering the court after a spokesperson said he would be present \"to support, and show solidarity\".Joining Hurley and Prince Harry in bringing the lawsuit against ANL are:Fellow actress Sadie FrostSir Elton John and his husband David FurnishSir Simon Hughes, the former Liberal Democrat MPBaroness Doreen Lawrence, a campaigner whose son Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racist attack in south London in 1993The claimants have accused ANL of \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for stories between 1993 and \"beyond\" 2018, including through private investigators and blagging.ANL has previously denied allegations of unlawful information gathering.White, representing the publisher, has said the claimants are \"clutching at straws\" and that the claims had been brought too late. Privacy cases must usually be brought within six years of the alleged breach, unless victims can show they could not bring a case at the time.White argued the reporters behind the stories had provided a \"compelling account of a pattern of legitimate sourcing of articles\", saying that in some cases celebrities' friends and social circles contributed as sources to Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday journalists.In court on Wednesday, he suggested Prince Harry knew his social circle was \"leaky\", to which the prince, giving evidence, responded: \"My social circles were not leaky, I want to make that absolutely clear.\"Prince Harry was visibly emotional in the witness box as he said the publisher made the life of his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, \"an absolute misery\". The prince's voice broke as he said the court battle had been a \"horrible experience\" for his family and that all he wanted was \"an apology and some accountability\".The case continues and is expected to last nine weeks. This is a civil trial, so there is no jury and the judge, Mr Justice Nicklin, will decide the case on his own.",

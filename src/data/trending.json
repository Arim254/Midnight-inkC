    "body": "Grand Theft Auto 6 delayed again until November 20269 hours agoLaura CressRockstarGrand Theft Auto 6 tells the story of lovers Jason and LuciaGrand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed - for a second time - until 19 November 2026.One of the most anticipated gaming releases ever, the sequel by developer Rockstar Games was due to come out in May 2026.It had already been postponed once before, from autumn 2025. But in a statement on Thursday, Rockstar said it needed extra months to to finish the game with the level of polish fans had come to \"expect and deserve\".GTA 5, the latest in the series, was released in 2013 and is the second best-selling game of all time.Despite being 12 years old, it remains extremely popular with fans today due to its online mode.In its statement, Rockstar said it was \"sorry for adding additional time\" to a long wait and thanked fans for their patience.It said it was \"incredibly excited\" for players to experience the game's setting of Leonida - a fictional US state based on Florida - and a modern-day version of the Miami-inspired Vice City.The announcement follows the firing of 31 workers from Rockstar's UK studios on 30 October.The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gaming sector, has accused the developer of sacking UK staff to stop them unionising.Members led rallies outside the company's offices in Edinburgh and London on Thursday. The BBC has approached Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for comment.IWGBPickets have taken place outside Take-Two Interactive's UK head office in London.Rockstar has stayed tight-lipped about GTA 6, releasing only two trailers so far, with the second arriving in May this year.With over 100 million views, the nearly three-minute video gave players more insight into the backstory of protagonists Jason and Lucia - a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida - as well as revealing new characters and map locations.Rockstar has form for delaying its games and a reputation for perfectionism, with its previous big release - Red Dead Redemption 2 - delayed by roughly a year from its original release date.Increased demand for complexity and scope from players, as well as soaring development costs, has meant publishers are less willing to take risks on unfinished products.When it finally lands, GTA 6 is likely to be one of the most expensive video games ever made, but also expected to set records with its launch sales.Whether it will live up to the hype remains to be seen.",

    "body": "Image source, SNSImage caption, A Rangers banner unfurled at Ibrox on ThursdayByScott MullenBBC Sport ScotlandMay 30 was meant to be the day of a new beginning for Rangers. New investment. New regime. New manager en route. A new outlook, all triggered by the arrival of a US-based consortium vowing to get the club \"back to the top\". Already the Trumpesque \"Make Rangers Great Again\" merchandise seen back then has been parked. The star-spangled banners in the Ibrox stands now replaced with statements of protest, accompanied by howls of dissatisfaction.Five harrowing months on from when the group led by Andrew Cavenagh walked in the big door in the Bill Struth Stand, the feel-good has been has been banished amid interminable disappointment. It's been catastrophic so far. A new head coach, Russell Martin, has been and gone - smuggled away in the back of a car - after 123 days. The process of appointing his replacement garnered ridicule as candidates were in and out like a managerial Hokey Cokey, all before Danny Rohl re-emerged to take charge after earlier withdrawing from the race. Fans have been seen accosting board members in hotel lobbies and airports, while on the pitch the team languish 14 points off the Premiership summit as Europe continues to to be a traumatic experience.The latest torturous episode came courtesy of a Roma team who played most of their 2-0 Europa League victory at Ibrox in second gear. In truth, there was no real need to reach for a third against a Rangers team which was again complicit to stay anchored on zero points.There have been flickers of improvement under German Rohl, who has won two of his first five games. Some Rangers fans will be willing for a January window to come quickly, but is there any real faith that it will be their saving grace?'It was uninspiring'A seventh successive European defeat in a row was meted out on Thursday, achieving an embarassing club record. Giant tifo displays of Rangers' Roman warriors pre-match made way for banners reading \"This is not a hobby this is our lives\" as the game followed a similar European pattern founded on self destruction. An unmarked Matias Soule nodded Roma into the lead after 13 minutes. The killer second came through a sumptuous Lorenzo Pellegrini finish, assisted by Artem Dovbyk and a gawping Rangers defence. There was no need for a third.Rohl, who already seems more popular than the man he replaced ever was, shuffled the hand his predecessor had dealt him. Five substitutes - one at half-time - were made and the system changed more than once.To an extent, he got a reaction. Rangers got into good areas but far too often the final ball was poor. You got the impression Roma could have upped it if need be.\"It was uninspiring,\" said former Rangers striker Steven Thompson on Sportsound. \"They huffed and puffed in the second half. It was improved, but not good enough.\"He added: \"You can see he's forward thinking, willing to try things and take baby steps, and they might improve. But they're not going to improve to the level that will satisfy the supporters.\"Media caption, 'Is this a bigger job than you first thought?''Have they signed anyone better than they've let go?'That latter point is perhaps the key one for the Rangers support, the head coach, and Cavenagh. A squad which has already undergone major work requires further surgery.In June, the American businessman spoke of the club being \"impatient\" in their thirst for success as £20m of investment was announced. A lot of the narrative at the time surrounded whether that would be enough to narrow the gap to Celtic and would there be more coming?It's safe to say plenty of money has been poured into this Rangers squad - whether it's been done wisely or not is open to great debate. A reported fee of £8m was given to Everton for Youssef Chermiti, who had not scored for 28 months prior to joning. Twelve Rangers appearances later, only one goal has followed.Oliver Antman, Oscar Cortes, Thelo Aasgaard, Emmanuel Fernandez and Djeidi Gassama have also come in for reported significant fees. But to what impact? Hamza Igamane left for a fee reported to be north of £10m. The maligned Cyriel Dessers also left for big money after scoring 29 goals last season. Vaclav Cerny and his 19 goals departed upon completion of his loan deal.\"Have Rangers signed anyone better than who they've let go?\" Rangers legend Ally McCoist asked on TNT Sports. \"Forget one transfer window for Rangers, it might be three. It's a big job. A big, big job.\"\"Rangers are crying out for help,\" added Alan Hutton, referring to reinforcements in this January window.Get in touchSend us your views on RangersFor Rangers to bring players in, you'd expect some will need to go out in what is traditionally a harder transfer window to manoeuvre in. Especially when supporters are so critical of what they've already seen under this regime.Chief executive Patrick Stewart and sporting director Kevin Thelwell have been the subjects of protest from the club's support. Banners protesting against them returned on Thursday, as did more cries from the crowd.There's no hiding place for either, particularly now Martin is no longer there to be the primary target for the ire. They removed him, but it has not been enough to alleviate the pressure mounting on them. Only wins will do that, and quickly.Rangers' priority will be the domestic scene, and it should be. On Sunday, they competed with 10 men for a large spell of their extra-time League Cup semi-final defeat by Celtic. There's positives they can take from clinging to a win at Easter Road, and also shaking off a Kilmarnock resurgence to ease to victory.Rohl spoke post-match about seeing a team \"willing to turn things around\" and being \"totally convinced\" the tanker can be turned. Remarkably they are only five points adrift of Celtic, albeit a long way further back from Hearts. The season is far from a lost cause.But that is a long way off right now. Five months on from that new dawn, better days seem further away than they did that day in May. In that impatient pursuit to the top, there may well be more testing days ahead.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNardine SaadLos AngelesShutterstockMeghan Markle and Prince Harry look on in the third inning between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers during Game 4 of the 2025 MLB World Series at Dodger Stadium. The Duke of Sussex has apologised to Canada for wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers hat while attending a World Series game against the Toronto Blue Jays.Prince Harry joked that he was \"under duress\" when he wore the bright blue cap during the epic Game 4 of the World Series in Los Angeles. He thought it was \"the polite thing to do\" after being invited to the game by the Dodgers' owner.His headgear choice upset many in Canada - a Commonwealth nation- who criticised him for not showing his allegiance to the realm, or to the only Canadian team in Major League Baseball. Prince Harry's father King Charles is the head of state of Canada and of 13 other Commonwealth realms. \"Firstly, I would like to apologise to Canada for wearing it,\" he said in a CTV interview. \"Secondly, I was under duress. There wasn't much choice.\"The prince - wearing a Blue Jays hat during the interview - quipped that \"when you're missing a lot of hair on top, and you're sitting under flood lights, you'll take any hat that's available\".He plans to wear a Blue Jays hat from now on and rooted for the Toronto team in subsequent games, appearing to do so in a clip posted on social media by the Duchess of Sussex - a Los Angeles native - when the Dodgers won the series in Game 7 a few days later.Prince Harry, who was given a Blue Jays hat while meeting with Canada's oldest veterans for a Remembrance event on Thursday, also said that admitting that he is a Toronto fan would likely make his  reception in California more difficult. Nathan Denette /The Canadian Press via APPrince Harry received a Toronto Blue Jays hat as he meets with some of Canada's oldest veterans, joining them in a creative arts program at Sunnybrook Hospital's veterans centre in Toronto on Thursday.The prince and his wife, a former actress who lived in Canada while filming her TV drama Suits, moved to California after stepping back as full-time royals in 2020.The couple's presence in the Chavez Ravine-set stadium in Los Angeles also disgruntled many Dodgers fans in the US. They took to social media to voice their upset over the couple's plum front-row seats during the 18-inning game, while local legends such as Magic Johnson and former pitcher Dodgers Sandy Koufax were seated behind them. Incidentally, Prince Harry published an essay this week about \"What it means to be British\" ahead of his visits with military veterans in Canada this week.In it, he said \"banter\" in pubs and sports grounds and a spirit of good-humoured \"self-deprecation\" are some of the things that he loves about Britain and what he thinks define British culture.",

    "body": "16 minutes agoLaura BickerChina correspondentChina's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has entered service days after a grand commissioning ceremony overseen by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, state media said. The Fujian, the country's third warship, is equipped with electromagnetic catapults which will allow planes to be launched at higher speeds.Its launch marked a significant step forward for Beijing, which now has the world's largest navy in terms of sheer number of ships.  China has been expanding its navy at breakneck speed under Xi, putting pressure on the United States and its allies to keep up.The Fujian can launch three different types of aircraft with its electromagnetic catapult and flat flight deck, according to state media. The domestically-built vessel can carry planes with heavier weapons and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from a greater distance, making it more powerful than China's first two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong - both built by the Russians.State media hailed the Fujian as a \"major milestone\" in the development of China's navy.The US is the only other country in the world to have an aircraft carrier with the same electromagnetic catapult system as Fujian.The Fujian's commissioning ceremony was held in southern Hainan province on Wednesday, during which Xi toured the ship's deck to hear more details about its performance at sea.State media claimed Xi had personally made the decision to adopt electromagnetic catapult technology. The reports also said Xi spoke to sailors who lined up along the flight deck and dock, saluting and shouting in unison: \"Follow the party's command, fight to win, and uphold fine conduct!\"",

    "body": "Discrimination against black people is \"baked\" into the leadership, culture and governance of the Metropolitan Police, an internal review has found.The independently commissioned review, authored by Dr Shereen Daniels, surveyed 40 years of evidence of how racism had affected black communities, as well as black officers and staff.Baroness Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, said that she welcomed the review but it contained \"nothing I did not already know\".Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the \"powerful\" report \"calls out that further systemic, structural, cultural change is needed\".The review, commissioned from the consultancy HR Rewired, concluded that darker-skinned Met staff were \"labelled confrontational\" while lighter-skinned employees might receive quicker empathy and leniency. Dr Shereen Daniels said that systemic racism was \"not a matter of perception\", adding that \"true accountability begins with specificity\".\"The same systems that sustain racial harm against black people also enable other forms of harm. Confronting this is not an act of exclusion but a necessary foundation for safety, fairness and justice for everyone,\" Dr Daniels said. Baroness Lawrence said that discrimination \"must be acknowledged, accepted and confronted in the Met\", adding that racism was the reason why her son had been killed and why the police had \"failed to find all of his killers\".She added: \"The police must stop telling us that change is coming whilst we continue to suffer. That change must take place now.\"Imran Khan KC, the Lawrence family's barrister, likewise said that the report's conclusions were \"little surprise\", adding that Sir Mark Rowley should resign if he did not \"recognise, acknowledge and accept\" its findings.He added: \"This Report lays out in shocking clarity that the time for talking is over, that promises to change can no longer be believed or relied on.\"The report is the latest to highlight racism within Britain's biggest police force, after Louise Casey's 2023 review - commissioned after the murder of Sarah Everard -  concluded that the Met was institutionally racist, misogynistic and homophobic. Reviews conducted decades ago have criticised discrimination within the Met - including the 1999 Macpherson report that called the force \"institutionally racist\" after the mishandling of Stephen Lawrence's case. Earlier this year, secret BBC filming found serving Met Police officers calling for immigrants to be shot and revelling in the use of force. Several officers have since been sacked, after Sir Mark Rowley pledged to be \"ruthless\" in getting rid of officers who are unfit to serve. The president of the National Black Police Association, Andy George, said Friday's report was the latest in a long line of reviews \"which have highlighted the same issues again and again\", and action to address them had not been taken.\"There is a culture of denial, dismissal, of almost waiting for the spotlight to be on - and as soon as the spotlight goes, then it's business as normal,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.He criticised Sir Mark's response to the report: \"He said the same things in Baroness Casey's review, he said the same things after Panorama… the words are fine, what we're not seeing is action to back that up.\"Following the publication of the latest report, Sir Mark Rowley said: \"London is a unique global city, and the Met will only truly deliver policing by consent when it is inclusive and anti-racist.\"He added that the force would \"go after the patterns of discrimination that show up in our operational work, and within the organisation by identifying and addressing their root causes\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoSPOILER WARNING - The Celebrity Traitors winner is revealed in today's newspapers review. The Times leads with the latest on the forthcoming Budget, noting that Chancellor Rachel Reeves \"has informed the Office of Budget Responsibility that a rise in personal taxation is one of the 'major measures' on tax and spending she is preparing to announce\". The paper writes this move is the \"clearest signal yet that the chancellor is preparing to break Labour's manifesto pledge not to increase income tax rates\". Ahead of the 2024 election, Labour vowed not to increase taxes on national insurance, income tax and VAT.\"Labour splits at the top\" over Reeves's mooted budget tax rises, reports the Metro newspaper. The paper writes the newly elected deputy leader of the Labour Party. Lucy Powell, \"warns the PM [Sir Keir Starmer] and Chancellor that breaching the party manifesto pledge on taxes would damage 'trust in politics'\".The Guardian also leads with Powell's \"challenge to Reeves\" to not follow through with tax increases. It also features a tribute of Pauline Collins, who died aged 85, known as the Oscar-nominated star of the 1990 film Shirley Valentine.Interest rates \"kept on hold at 4% in knife-edge BoE [Bank of England] decision\" is the top story in the Financial Times. Policymakers voted 5-4 in favour of leaving rates unchanged, after \"cutting rates five times since 2024\". It reports BoE governor Andrew Bailey, who voted to keep rates on hold, \"could change his stance in favour of a rate cut as soon as December\".\"Grinning Billy Smith laughed as he gave himself up at the jail that mistakenly freed him,\" headlines the Metro newspaper, leading on the latest development on the two men mistakenly released from Wandsworth prison earlier this week. It writes Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy \"was asked five times in the Commons whether more asylum seekers had been freed in error\". He has since promised the \"strongest checks ever\" to prevent further errors.The Daily Mirror leads with the US Democrats' formal request for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to appear before a congressional committee to give evidence about his connections to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \"More pressure for ex-prince on day he officially lost his title,\" is the paper's take.\"Andrew is summoned to US Congress\" also tops the Sun, quoting the Democrats' letter suggesting the former prince could hold \"valuable information\" on Epstein.Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is calling for BBC Director General Tim Davie to \"'explain or resign' over the bias scandal engulfing the broadcaster\", the Daily Telegraph reports in its lead. Earlier this week, the paper \"disclosed that a Panorama documentary had spliced together different parts of a speech by Mr Trump and made it seem as though he had told supporters to go to the Capitol and 'fight like hell' on the day of the 2021 riot\", quoting a leaked complaint. In response, the BBC has said it does not comment on leaks and that it considers feedback carefully. The Telegraph contrasts the Panorama response with the BBC's decision yesterday to uphold 20 complaints relating to \"Martine Croxall, the BBC newsreader who rolled her eyes while changing the phrase 'pregnant people' to 'pregnant women'\", saying she \"broke impartiality rules\". The Daily Mail also leads with accusations of \"double standards\" levelled at the BBC over its impartiality, including from Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. The Celebrity Traitors finale is also splashed on the front page, revealing comedian Alan Carr as the winner – describing his gameplay as \"ruthless\".\"Carr Smash\" reads the Daily Star's headline, referring to Alan Carr being declared the victor of the Celebrity Traitors. Fans are questioning \"how on Earth could the Faithfuls miss that? They're 100% numpties\", in reference to non-traitors playing in the popular show.\"Nigel Farage ramps up calls for parliamentary probe into grooming scandal,\" is the headline of the Daily Express. It reports on Farage's remarks, saying \"grooming gang survivors fear the government's national inquiry is 'less about the truth and more about a cover-up\".The Times reports the Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that she plans to increase income tax. The paper says her remarks in the official submission to the OBR is the \"clearest signal yet\" that Reeves is planning to break Labour's manifesto pledge. The Guardian leads with the comments from Labour's deputy leader, Lucy Powell, that the party should stand by its commitment not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. The paper describes this as a \"significant intervention\" that will \"put pressure\" on the chancellor.Tim Davie must \"explain or quit\", is the message from Boris Johnson to the BBC director general in the Daily Telegraph. The former prime minister was responding to a week of disclosures by the paper about the corporation, which was accused of \"one-sided\" reporting about Gaza, censorship of the trans debate and doctoring a speech by Donald Trump. The BBC has said it does not comment on leaks and that it considers feedback carefully.According to the Times, a cabinet colleague has described as \"cowardly\" the justice secretary David Lammy's handling of a row about the mistaken release of inmates from prison. \"Guilty of ineptitude\" is the Daily Mail's verdict on Lammy, who is also the deputy prime minister. The Guardian is equally withering, saying: \"There's one prisoner who won't be released early. Step forward, the hapless justice secretary.\"\"Summoned\", declares the Daily Mirror, as it leads on the request for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to give evidence to a US Congressional committee investigating the sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. The paper's editorial says there is \"no hiding place left\" for the former prince. The Sun also has the story on its front page, with the headline: \"Tell us what you know, Windsor\".A \"night of shame\" is how the Daily Mail describes what happened before Aston Villa's match with the Israeli side, Maccabi Tel Aviv last night. The Daily Telegraph says the images were \"damning\", with a \"huge cordon of police vans, Jewish people corralled behind wire mesh and a marauding hoard of pro-Palestinian disruptors\". The Times points out the \"worst fears\" were \"allayed\" as police kept a lid on any tensions.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "10 hours agoNick EardleyPolitical correspondentThe government has recovered £74m from excessive profits made by companies running asylum accommodation, the BBC can reveal.The Home Office said it had recouped the money following a review of contracts after Labour came to power last year.Ministers had faced criticism from MPs for neglecting day-to-day management of the contracts.But the amount recouped remains a small percentage of the overall cost of asylum accommodation.Home Office figures show the overall cost was £2.1bn in 24/25 - an average of about £5.77m per day.That makes the sum recovered less than the cost for the government of accommodation every fortnight.Accommodation providers had previously told Parliament they would be returning some profits to the government, under the terms of their contracts.The cost to the taxpayer of the contracts has increased significantly since they were signed.Dame Karen Bradley, the Conservative chair of the home affairs select committee, said the recovery was \"welcome\" but only a \"first step\".She added: \"This is only a small part of the many billions that the contracts have and will cost. \"The government must now set out its long term plan for how it will deliver a resilient and cost effective asylum accommodation system.\"Ministers have promised to end the use of asylum hotels before the next general election - and the prime minister has said he would like to bring that deadline forward.But the Home Office has also sought to bring down the immediate costs of hotels and other types of accommodation, like private flats.The costs for 2024/25 were a reduction from the previous year - when accommodation cost £3bn - or £8.3m per day.Much of that was down to reducing the average nightly cost per person, as a result of room sharing and cheaper accommodation being used. Ministers are also planning to use alternative accommodation- such as military sites - to house asylum seekers.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"This government inherited asylum hotel contracts that were not delivering good value for taxpayers' money.\"We have already saved £700m in hotel costs. Now we are recouping millions more in excess profits. And by the end of this parliament, we will have closed every asylum hotel.\"Last month, the Home Office was strongly criticised by the home affairs committee for its handling of asylum accommodation.MPs on the committee said the government had \"squandered\" billions of pounds of taxpayer money.They also accused the Home Office of under-utilising mechanisms to reclaim excess profits made by accommodation providers.There are break clauses in some contracts that would allow ministers to end use of some accommodation in 2026.The home secretary told the BBC last week that all options were on the table - and that she would study the legal arrangements \"carefully\".Conservative Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: \"The only way to end this crisis is to end the use of hotels altogether. \"The Home office is spending £5.77m per day on asylum hotels, meaning these savings will disappear in just 12 days.\"The truth is the Labour government is accommodating more illegal immigrants in hotels than at the election, and the first nine months of this year have been the worst in history for illegal immigrants crossing the Channel.\"\"Only the Conservative Party has a serious, hard-edged plan to take control of our borders,\" the shadow home secretary added.",

    "body": "5 hours agoLily Jamali,North America Technology correspondent and Osmond Chia,Business reporterWatch: Tesla shareholders cheer Elon Musk's $1tn pay dealTesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders.The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares.The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him.Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name.\"What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\" he said.\"Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,\" he added.The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade to maximise his payout include raising Tesla's market value to $8.5tn from $1.4tn at time of writing.He would also need to get a million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles into commercial operation.But his early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want Musk to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business.Watch: Elon Musk dances in sync with Tesla robots\"Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,\" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X.\"His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet.\"Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was \"almost comfortable\" allowing drivers to \"text and drive essentially.\" US regulators are investigating Tesla's self-driving feature after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries.Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months.Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring.Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk's pay deal marks \"another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business.\"Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.ReutersElon Musk will get hundreds of millions of new shares if he hits his targetsIt is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added.Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over \"the polarisation of [Musk's] persona\" which has \"demolished the value of the brand\".\"Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,\" he said.Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him \"Tesla's biggest asset\" in a note published after the vote.\"We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,\" Mr Ives added.ReutersMusk said everyone would want an Optimus robotTesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon MuskMusk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did.But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk.Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision.The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors.Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursdays meeting.In recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts.A video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAnnabel RackhamCulture reporter Dan KennedyBroadcaster Emma Barnett has said finding out she was going through perimenopause at the age of 38 felt like she had been \"mugged, robbed\". Barnett, now 40, said it was the \"first time in my life I haven't really wanted to be a woman - it's the first time I've thought, I'd really quite like to be a bloke\".She was speaking on her new BBC podcast, Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett, the first episode of which was released on Friday.Perimenopause, which commonly occurs around the age of 46, is when you have symptoms of menopause but your periods haven't yet stopped. These symptoms can include anxiety, mood swings, brain fog, hot flushes and irregular periods.Barnett joined the presenting line-up of BBC Radio 4's Today programme in 2024In the episode, Barnett says perimenopause made her feel as though she had lost her identity - and that she is still waiting to \"come back\" to who she was before.Speaking to friend and guest Kate Thornton, she goes on: \"I do feel there has been a theft. I do feel there's no emergency number to call. 'I'd like to report a crime. Yeah, someone stole me.' There is no one to report this to.\"Thornton, also a journalist and broadcaster, talked about her own experience of perimenopause, saying the \"worst\" thing she experienced was going from being somebody \"who can multitask... being very capable\" to somebody who felt \"entirely incapable\". Barnett has previously spoken out about her health. In 2019, she wrote the book Period: It's About Bloody Time, chronicling her experience of endometriosis.During the podcast episode, she said it was \"pretty nerve-wracking\" to share certain parts of her life - but that she \"wanted to create this space for other people to be ready to talk about things\".Barnett, who hosted Radio 4's Woman's Hour until last year, said she ultimately wanted to make the podcast so she could not only tell the stories of others, but give listeners her perspective and experience.\"I'm usually the interviewer, I'm usually hosting,\" Barnett told Thornton.\"It's not easy to share and I know that, and I think that's why it's important that somebody who interviews does, when appropriate - not all the time, because that's not my job and it's not about me - but where appropriate and especially when you're asking others to do the same, share themselves.\"Rounding off the episode, Barnett could be heard saying she hoped that \"the normalisation - which we both said needs to happen around perimenopause and this degradation of one's hormones that happens from... the age of 30s right through in women - can move into common parlance\".\"And it doesn't mean what happens feels any less extraordinary or outrageous, but how we meet it could change,\" she added.How to treat menopause symptomsA growing number of women take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to alleviate menopause symptoms.HRT tops up and stabilises oestrogen levels, sometimes in combination with a synthetic or bioidentical version of progesterone.But it may not be suitable for people who have a history of some cancers, blood clots and high blood pressure.Women may also be able to improve how they feel by:eating a balanced diet, low in fat and high in calcium to strengthen bones and protect the heartexercising regularly, to reduce anxiety, stress and guard against heart diseasestopping smoking, to prevent heart disease and hot flushesavoiding alcohol, to reduce hot flushesThere is also research that suggests eating plant oestrogens - contained in soy and red clover - could help with symptoms. Talking therapy known as CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) may be offered to women over 40, alongside HRT - or, if the patient's individual circumstances call for it, in place of it.Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett is on BBC Sounds from 7 November, and will be released in weekly episodes.",

    "body": "Typhoon barrels towards Cambodia after killing at least 193 in Philippines and Vietnam3 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent and Sen NguyenWatch: Typhoon Kalmaegi barrels through central VietnamTyphoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 188 people in the Philippines and five in Vietnam, according to the latest figures from the two countries.The storm is now headed west to Cambodia and Laos after it barrelled through central Vietnam on Thursday with winds of up to 149km/h (92mph).Towns along Vietnam's central coast were littered with debris this morning after taking the full brunt of the storm overnight. The strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows. Thousands of people sought shelter in schools and other public buildings as the army was deployed to help deal with the damage. Vietnamese authorities have warned of possible flooding in low-lying areas. Central Vietnam has already seen record rainfall in the past week which has killed 50 people.Earlier this week the same storm devastated parts of the Philippines when heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods. The death toll reported on Friday was a jump from the 114 reported the previous day. Another 135 people are listed as missing. The Philippines government has declared a state of calamity across the country as it prepares for another typhoon which is building up in the Pacific Ocean.Ahead of Typhoon Kalmaegi, Vietnam's military on Thursday deployed more than 260,000 soldiers and personnel for relief efforts, along with more than 6,700 vehicles and six aircraft. Some airports and expressways in the country were closed and hundreds of thousands were evacuated.Shortly after the typhoon made landfall at 19:29 local time (12:29 GMT), hundreds of residents in Dak Lak province called for help, local media reported.Dak Lak province is approximately 350km (215 miles) north-east of Ho Chi Minh City.Many people said their homes had collapsed or been flooded, while strong winds and heavy rain continued to batter the area.AFP via Getty ImagesTrees came down in high winds near Quy Nhon beach in Gia Lai, central Vietnam, as Kalmaegi approached on ThursdayAccording to local media reports, Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh held an online meeting to direct the emergency response.\"We must reach isolated areas and ensure people have food, drinking water, and essential supplies,\" he was quoted as saying.\"No one should be left hungry or cold.\" Before making landfall in Vietnam, the typhoon, known locally as Tino, left a trail of devastation in the Philippines.At least 188 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated, particularly from central areas including the populous island and tourist hotspot of Cebu, where cars were swept through the streets. Kalmaegi dumped the equivalent of a month's worth of rain on the island in just 24 hours, sending torrents of mud and debris down mountainsides and into urban areas. Stunned survivors who had made it to higher ground watched as buses and shipping containers were tossed about in the raging floodwaters. The storm has wiped out entire neighbourhoods in poorer districts, where building materials are flimsier.In Talisay City, which suffered some of the worst destruction, Mely Saberon looked on in despair at the pile of debris that had once been her home.\"We don't have any home anymore,\" she told the BBC. \"We weren't able to salvage anything from our house. \"We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons before, but this one was different.\"Residents have now started the backbreaking task of cleaning away the thick layer of mud, and picking through the wreckage for anything that can be used. Early on Thursday, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency, the threshold of which involves mass casualty, major damage to property, and disruption to means of livelihoods and the normal way of life for people in the affected areas.EPAWaves crashed on the beach in Cua Dai, Da Nang, central Vietnam, on Thursday",

    "body": "7 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesRosalía emerged in 2018 and has become one of the biggest Latin stars in musicOver her brief discography, Rosalía has never met a convention she couldn't break.Born in Barcelona, the singer has spent the last seven years innovating at a speed that makes her contemporaries look comically lazy.Her breakthrough album El Mal Querer (recorded as her graduate thesis in 2018) took the folkloric traditions of Flamenco and fused them to addictive R&B rhythms.The follow-up, 2022's Motomami, was a wildly innovative pop smash, twisting Latin American genres like cumbia and reggaeton around glitchy hip-hop beats and her playful, sinuous melodies.With lyrics about fame, sex and self-discovery, Motomami debuted at the top of Spotify's global albums chart, took home album of the year at the Latin Grammys, and became 2022's best-reviewed record on Metacritic - even topping Beyoncé's celebrated Renaissance.After Rosalía's tour for her critically acclaimed album ended three year ago, her fans were left wondering where she'd go next.The answer is revealed on her fourth album, Lux, released on Friday. Rosalía/Columbia RecordsThe album cover shows Rosalía hugging herself while wearing a nun's headdress, reflecting themes of self-acceptance and spiritual yearningRather than walk in the footsteps of its predecessors, Lux carves its own, unique path - harnessing Rosalía's classical training at the prestigious Catalonia College of Music.Recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra, and featuring multiple arrangements from Pulitzer Prize winner Caroline Shaw, it's a radical, rebellious operatic opus that sounds like nothing else in the pop sphere.Lead single Berghain riffs on Verdi's Dies Irae, the strings played with serrated knives as a German chorus chants about fear and anger, until Bjork arrives to inform everyone, \"the only way to save us is through divine intervention\".Another early highlight, Reliquia, chops and splices a chamber quartet into unrecognisable electronic patterns, as Rosalía reconciles herself to the idea that she loves too hard, and locates the beauty in that vulnerability.\"Take a piece of me, keep it for when I'm gone / I'll be your treasure, I am your relic.\"Fellow pop iconoclast Madonna has already declared herself a fan, posting a message to Rosalía on Instagram, saying: \"I can't stop listening! You are a true visionary!!!\"'Emotional terrorist'Pieced together over three years, Lux reflects on a period of personal and professional upheaval for the 33-year-old.In that time, Rosalía broke off her engagement to Puerto Rican reggaetón star Rauw Alejandro, ditched her management in favour of Adele's manager, Jonathan Dickins, and landed her first major acting role in the teen drama Euphoria.The split from Alejandro seems to inspire the record's most barbed lyric. La Perla is aimed at a man she calls an \"emotional terrorist\" and \"the Olympic gold medallist of sons of whores\" – with a jaunty waltz arrangement that suggests she's thoroughly enjoying her litany of insults.The cathartic Focu 'Ranni (only available on CD and vinyl copies) pairs a desolate melody with a scrambled vocal sample; reflecting the emotional turmoil of a bride who calls off her wedding at the last moment.In an interview with France's Le Monde, she said the song was inspired by her namesake, Saint Rosalia de Palermo, who fled the altar to dedicate her life to God.\"I found that coincidence pretty insane,\" the star added, but refused to elaborate, simply saying it was a \"long story\".Getty ImagesThe singer's tour for her album Motomami featured a minimalist stage and backing dancers The quest for spiritual fulfilment underscores the rest of Lux – whose title is the Latin word for \"light\".Sauvignon Blanc is a gossamer ballad that contains the self-deprecating pledge: \"I will listen to my God / I will throw away my Jimmy Choos\"; while the dazzling dopamine rush of Divinize finds her, in the word of Loki, burdened with glorious purpose.\"Bruise me up, I'll eat all of my pride / I know that I was made to divinize.\"But it's the more reflective moments that steal your breath. The closing track, Magnolias, is a delicate acceptance of death: \"What I never did in my life, you'll do when I'm dead.\"And the tender, subdued La Yagular is an acknowledgement of the divine on earth that celebrates our shared humanity.\"I fit in the world / And the world fits into me / I take up the world / And the world occupies me,\" she sings, in wide-eyed wonder.The song ends with a recording of Patti Smith in 1976, encouraging artists to shatter expectations.\"Break on through to the other side,\" the rock star exclaimed. \"Going through one door isn't enough, a million doors aren't enough.\"As an encapsulation of Rosalía's creative impulse, it's almost too perfect.Rosalía/Columbia RecordsRosalía studied 14 languages including Hebrew, Ukrainian and French during the creation of the latest album Ahead of the album's release, the singer advised fans to play Lux on headphones in a darkened room, calling it an antidote to TikTok trends and viral videos.\"The more we are in the era of dopamine, the more I want the opposite,\" she told the New York Times. \"I know it's a lot to ask, but that's what I want.\"Anyone who accepts the challenge will be richly rewarded.Despite its grand orchestral sweep, Lux is a thoroughly modern album, with cutting edge production and hip-hop phrasing sneaking into Rosalía's stunning, operatic vocals.A lesser artist might have been crushed by its conceptual weight – singing in 14 languages, over four movements, inspired by the mystical writings of French philosopher Simone Weil – but somehow she avoids the trap.Lux is audacious but it's also accessible. Turn off the lights, give it your full attention, and discover one of the most singular, original artists of our time.",

    "body": "After weeks of tension, plots and sabotage, Celebrity Traitors has come to a nail-biting end9 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterBBCSpoiler warning: This article reveals details from The Celebrity Traitors finaleThere have been murders, betrayals, a serious side-eye, and a fart that cut through all the tension.But on Thursday night, we finally found out who had emerged victorious in the inaugural Celebrity Traitors.Out of 19 contestants, just five remained. Traitors Cat Burns and Alan Carr, and faithfuls Joe Marler, Nick Mohammed and David Olusoga.Soon, it was down to just three: Carr, Mohammed and Olusoga.And in the end, it was comedian Alan Carr who was crowned the winner, in a move that broke the internet - and left him in floods of tears.\"It's been tearing me apart, I'm so sorry,\" he howled, as he revealed to the remaining faithfuls that he'd always been a traitor. \"I'm an awful human being.\"\"You did brilliantly,\" they consoled him. \"It's all right.\"Social media quickly erupted with the news. \"Most awful traitor ever being the best traitor ever,\" wrote one X user.\"There could not have been a more iconic ending,\" wrote another, while a third called it \"the TV moment of the year\".His chosen charity, Neuroblastoma UK, will get all the prize money, with the final pot coming to £87,500.Spoiler alert! Watch the moment The Celebrity Traitors comes to a dramatic conclusionCarr's transformation from giggling liability to cold-hearted killer was one of the standout highlights of the series.But his win still left the nation in shock, said entertainment reporter Indigo Stafford.\"The idea of Alan, of all people, pulling off a masterclass in deception felt about as likely as him keeping a straight face through one of his own punchlines.\"On the Uncloaked podcast later, the other contestants summed up why no-one had ever really suspected him.\"Alan could have come down to breakfast in a green cloak and I still wouldn't have thought he was a traitor. I was too busy laughing,\" Olusoga said.\"Most people didn't vote for [Carr] because, how can you vote for someone who is so loveable?\" asked Paloma Faith.Carr said he had \"absolutely loved\" his time on the show.\"I want to do it again... I don't think it would work a second time!\"Alan Carr and Cat Burns made a pinky promise to back each other - but Burns still got banishedThursday evening's final episode was extended to 70 minutes on BBC One. It had a different start than usual, as all the celebs knew who'd make it to the breakfast table.There was some very uplifting, and very un-Traitors-esque music, as we recapped some moments from each of the finalists' time in the castle.As ever, Carr gave us some of the most memorable lines.\"Let's face it, I started this game a bit of a nervous wreck. I've thrown some really good friends under the bus, I've murdered national treasures in plain sight. I'm clearly a better liar and traitor than I thought I was.\"Meanwhile, ex-rugby player Marler noted that being in the final was \"way more stressful than playing for England\", while Olusoga said he was \"completely amazed\" to have made it so far. You and us both, David.Early on in the episode, various contestants appeared to be making a bid to be the new style icon of the castle, taking over from murdered Jonathan Ross.Carr emerged at breakfast looking like a 1950s US chat show host in a checked maroon suit, before changing into a bejewelled white outfit.But he was out-jacketted by Mohammed's maroon velvet tuxedo. What a look.Next up was the challenge, with the remaining contestants getting on board a train named - of course - The Traitors Express.The challenge saw them ripping up portraits of former contestants. Spare a thought for Marler, who managed to get hit on the head THREE times by the lid of a heavy wooden box.Before long, it was time for the roundtable. Burns and Carr did a pinky promise beforehand, pledging to stick together. \"We've come a long way, I'm not going to throw him under a bus,\" said Burns, while Carr just giggled.And Carr did stick to his promise. But, having slipped under the radar for most of the game, Burns still got the most votes.Carr looked like he was in a world of pain to be the last traitor standing. \"Now I'm on my own, I feel terrified,\" he said. \"I'm a loose cannon, a rudderless ship.\"Social media and onlookers were equally disappointed.\"Caaaattt! I did NOT want Cat to be banished. A truly loveable traitor,\" said culture journalist Natalie Jamieson.\"Cat Burns, you will forever be remembered in Traitors history,\" wrote one X user.But there was no time to dwell on her departure. Before long, they were at the endgame - which was what we were really all here for.\"To me, the most hated man in Britain,\" Alan giggled as he raised a toast at the end of the episodeThe final four stood over the fire pit. And the Nick-Joe alliance broke down, just when it mattered the most, in a truly WTF moment.Marler was painfully banished - after a shock vote from Mohammed, who turned against him.\"It hurts to be stabbed in the back last minute like that,\" said Marler. And on the Uncloaked podcast, we learned that if Marler ever texts Mohammed, he calls him Judas. Brutal (but deserved).Finally, just three players remained in the game: Carr, Olusoga and Mohammed.Carr, looking incredibly smug, voted to end the game. So did Olusoga, and it all came down to Mohammed, who did the same - which meant that Carr, as a traitor, was the winner.For Jamieson, the moment where Olusoga and Mohammed comforted Carr was \"beautiful TV\". \"I predict it will be in the running for memorable moment at next year's Bafta TV Awards,\" she said.Happily, Carr soon recovered from his bout of tears, and was able to enjoy the moment.\"What a rollercoaster. I was awful at lying, I had no poker face and here I am a winner,\" Carr said.And he even made light of that infamous murder - his best friend Paloma Faith in episode two - by reaching over to host Claudia Winkleman in the final scene and touching her cheek.\"You've got something on your face Claudia,\" he said, with his trademark giggle.The last few weeks of celebrity gossiping, scheming and the occasional fart may feel like one big crazy jumbled dream. But it really did all happen. And we will miss it.",

    "body": "Matheus Cunha scored a dramatic late winner for Manchester United as they defeated Premier League leaders Arsenal in a five-goal thriller at Emirates Stadium.The Gunners' first home defeat of the season, following wins for their title rivals Manchester City and Aston Villa, means their lead has been narrowed to four points.Arsenal had started the match extremely well, taking the lead when United defender Lisandro Martinez put the ball into his own net in the 29th minute.The hosts gifted Manchester United a route back into the match when Martin Zubimendi's loose pass put Bryan Mbeumo through on goal and the United striker calmly went past David Raya and put the ball into an empty net.United then shocked the home side, taking the lead five minutes into the second half through a superb strike from Patrick Dorgu, who hammered in a shot off the underside of the crossbar.Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta tried to force a turnaround in the match as he made a quadruple change, throwing on Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Mikel Merino and Ben White. It was Merino who thought he had rescued at least a point when he bundled in from a corner in the 84th minute. However, just three minutes later, substitute Cunha picked up a pass from Kobbie Mainoo and curled a superb strike into the bottom corner from about 25 yards out.The win moves Manchester United into fourth place.This is undoubtedly a blow to the Gunners who will feel it is a missed opportunity to maintain a significant gap at the top of the table.Arsenal had chances in the last two rounds of Premier League fixtures to further extend the gap between themselves and their rivals but after two goalless draws and now a loss to United, the difference is only four points.It is still a strong position for the Gunners but one that could be even better if Arteta's side had taken the opportunities given to them.Arteta cannot be accused of letting this game pass him by with a quadruple change when the score was 2-1 to United, but the substitutions never gave Arsenal the control of the match he desired.The atmosphere in the stadium was tense throughout the second half with supporters making their displeasure known to the players on the pitch.Arteta has spoken about how the groans from the crowd in previous matches was just down to a willingness to win, but this result will be a warning to the Arsenal manager as he looks to bring the title back to north London.Manchester United's transfer business has largely been poor since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 and it will be some time yet before they can feel they are on top of it.But after just 19 appearances, it is already fair to declare Mbeumo a success.United made three bids for the Cameroon forward in the summer, so keen were they to prize him from Brentford.In the end, they paid £65m, attracted by the 20 Premier League goals he scored last season.Now he is up to eight in the league for this season, calmly rounding Raya to finish when Zubimendi presented him with the chance to equalise.But he does not just do simple things well. He is also capable of moments of inspiration, which is what he came close to when he met Bruno Fernandes' lofted pass with a first-time lob towards the Arsenal goal that had Raya worried for a moment.Arsenal are next in action on Wednesday when they host Kairat in the Champions League (20:00 GMT) before a trip to Leeds United in the Premier League on Saturday (15:00). Manchester United are home to Fulham on Sunday, 1 February in the league (14:00).",

    "body": "2 hours agoThomas MackintoshEPASince 8 January families have been spending the night outside the El Rodeo jail in ZamoraA leading Venezuelan human rights group says at least 80 political prisoners have been released under pressure from the US.Alfredo Romero, head of Foro Penal, said his group was verifying the identities of those freed from prisons across the country on Saturday - and more releases were likely to take place.It is the latest batch of detainees released since the US seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a raid, and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges earlier this month.On Friday Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez said more than 600 prisoners had been freed - but Foro Penal says this figure has been inflated.Romero announced the releases on social media. He also posted an image of Foro Penal colleague Kennedy Tejeda who he said had been held in Tocorón prison, west of the capital caracas since August 2024.In a post on X, Foro Penal lawyer Gonzalo Himiob said the number of releases could rise above 80 \"as we proceed with verification\".Previously, Foro Penal said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped.This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group said.Before this weekend's developments, the group had confirmed the release of just 156 political prisoners since 8 January.Some domestic opposition figures and at least five Spanish nationals are among those confirmed to have been freed so far.Separately, Rodriguez said she was due to have a call on Monday with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, to ask the UN to verify the lists of those released so far.Human rights groups and activists have long accused the government of using detentions to muzzle critics. The Venezuelan government has denied holding political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, when Maduro claimed victory despite opponents and many countries disputing the results.",

    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge20 hours agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" that young Pakistani student admitted all those years ago. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"\"Don't you find it interesting,\" he asked, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorPA MediaSir Keir Starmer voted against allowing Andy Burnham being allowed to run as an MP The other day I compared the saga of Andy Burnham, his ambitions and the forthcoming by-election in Greater Manchester to a long and twisting marble run.If, and it was a big if, the marble trundled all the way to the bottom, it was possible to imagine Burnham as prime minister, before this year was out.But, as I said then, it was also possible the marble would fly off the run spectacularly – which is precisely what has now happened.In an exercise of brute power, which is simultaneously an illustration of how they perceive their own weakness, No 10 has scuppered Burnham's attempted run from Manchester to Westminster and perhaps on to Downing Street.Yes, this was a decision taken by a committee of the Labour Party, but allies of Sir Keir Starmer are making it perfectly clear he joined the remote meeting on Sunday morning and he cast a vote to block Andy Burnham.The relationship between the two men has long been fascinating to observe.Burnham's first act in politics was very much as a creature of Westminster: an adviser, an MP for 16 years, a cabinet minister. He has run for the Labour leadership twice before. Here he is talking to me more than a decade ago about his ambition to be prime minister. He later reinvented himself - by defining himself against Westminster as the Mayor of Greater Manchester.But his ambitions beyond the north west of England have long been transparent - and long provoked a roll of the eyes or a raised eyebrow from Sir Keir.Burnham's interventions last autumn, around the time of Labour's annual conference, deeply irritated many within the party. He gave an interview to The New Statesman, which carried the less than cryptic headline \"Andy Burnham's plan for Britain.\"Shortly after came an interview in The Telegraph, headlined \"Andy Burnham: MPs want me to challenge Starmer\".Burnham's team would point out, rightly, that politicians don't write the headlines but the wider point stands – his desires were very, very clear.Just the other day, he set out in The Guardian how he believed his approach to his mayoralty in Greater Manchester could be applied nationally.'You should not block democracy'Of course, aspiring to lead the country is noble, but it shouldn't be surprising that the current occupier of that role might have a rather sniffy view of such manoeuvring, particularly when Starmer can argue that it is he who won Labour's colossal majority not Burnham, whatever people might think of how governing has gone for Labour since.No 10 has calculated that it would rather weather a short-term storm – the gales of reaction for and against this decision currently gusting across social media – than authorise a circus lasting weeks, then months, with Burnham as a by-election candidate and one question dominating: what's your plan if you become prime minister?\"I'm afraid no-one is convinced that Andy is coming in to be a team player and the last thing we should do is allow this kind of psychodrama,\" one senior party figure tells me, adding: \"We can't allow insecurity and destabilisation to indulge one man's personal ambition.\"Others are livid, arguing it is absurd and counterproductive to spike the prospects of someone they see as one of the party's brightest lights.\"You should not block democracy. Keir is running scared and it's a very bad look,\" one senior Labour MP said.All this means that in the space of just a few months, those loyal to the prime minister have briefed heavily against Health Secretary Wes Streeting, whose ambitions they view with nervousness too - and have now blocked Andy Burnham from returning to Westminster.They argue that the electorate is sick of political soap opera and they want to get on with governing – against a tricky international and domestic backdrop.Their critics, within the Labour Party and beyond, say both are acts of a weak prime minister seeking to cripple capable rivals who might, they argue, do a considerably better job than him in No 10.This will likely be far from the last act this year in the drama of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership, and how much of a future it has.",

It is now moored, under guard, at a southern French port near Marseille.Although Moscow is yet to comment, Macron said on Thursday that the shadow fleet helped to \"finance Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine\".The office of the Marseille prosecutor office said the rest of the ship's crew members - all also Indians - were being \"kept on board\" while the 58-year-old captain was taken into custody.\"The investigation aims to verify the validity of the flag used by the tanker,\" prosecutors said. French media report say it was sailing under a Comoros Islands flag.  Nautical and air exclusion zones have been established around the anchorage site, officials say.French Joint Staff of the Armed ForcesSoldiers searched the vessel after it was seized in the MediterraneanAnnouncing the seizure on Thursday, Macron said: \"We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions.\"Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Earlier in January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia.Last October, France seized another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast before releasing it a few days later.Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil.Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.More on this story",

    "body": "1 hour agoJoshua Nevett,Political reporterandChris Mason,Political editorPA MediaPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's allies fear Andy Burnham's leadership ambitionsAndy Burnham has said he is \"disappointed\" after being blocked from standing as a candidate for the upcoming parliamentary by-election in Gorton and Denton by Labour's ruling body.As a directly elected mayor, Burnham had to get approval from Labour's national executive committee (NEC), after he applied to be a candidate on Saturday.But Labour said the party had decided to deny him permission to stand to \"avoid an unnecessary mayoral election, which would use substantial amounts of taxpayers' money and resources\".Burnham, a former minister, is widely seen as a potential leadership challenger to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer should he return to Westminster. Writing on X, Burnham expressed concern about the ruling's \"impact on the important elections ahead of us\", and said he would return with \"full focus\" to his role as mayor.\"I decided to put myself forward to prevent the divisive politics of Reform from damaging that. We are stronger together and let's stay that way,\" Burnham said.However, he criticised how the ruling was made known on Sunday, saying: \"The fact that the media was informed of the NEC decision before I was tells you everything you need to know about the way the Labour Party is being run these days\".The seat in Greater Manchester is vacant after former Labour minister Andrew Gwynne stood down on Friday as an MP on health grounds.The move to block Burnham has infuriated Labour MPs and is likely to anger some ministers who said local party members should have had the option of choosing the Greater Manchester mayor as the candidate.It is a big political gamble by allies of the prime minister and risks inflaming tensions within the party, which is consistently trailing Reform UK in national opinion polls.One senior Labour source who had been supportive of Burnham's candidacy said: \"They're gambling the PM's whole premiership on winning a very hard by-election without their best candidate. It is madness.\"Burnham is yet to comment on the decision. which was made by 10 members of the NEC, including Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, party chair Ellie Reeves and the prime minister himself on Sunday morning.NEC sources told the BBC the vote was 8-1 in favour of blocking Burnham's candidacy.The prime minister was among those who voted to block him from standing.Mahmood abstained as the chair, while Labour's deputy leader Lucy Powell voted to allow him to stand.Labour sources have told the BBC that in the meeting, lots of concerns were raised about the costs of an election to replace Burnham as Greater Manchester mayor and the \"prospect of a divisive campaign\".Burnham was elected as mayor of Greater Manchester in May 2024 for a term that runs until May 2028.Sir Keir's allies say Burnham is doing \"a very good job\" as mayor, arguing that an election to replace him \"would cost the party hundreds of thousands of pounds\" and \"cost the country millions of pounds during a cost-of-living crisis\".The prime minister's supporters were worried Reform UK \"would outspend us ten to one\" during the by-election campaign.The argument those who blocked Burnham intend to make publicly is that during a period of geopolitics dominating the headlines and deep concerns about the cost of living at home, there would be no appetite in the country for a \"return to political psychodramas of the Tory years\".There was \"overwhelming support\" in the meeting \"for upholding clear Labour Party rules preventing mayors and PCCs standing in by-elections\", a source said.Earlier, Mahmood told the BBC allowing elected mayors to run as candidates in parliamentary by-elections had \"organisational implications\" for the party.A mayoral election in Greater Manchester could also be costly for the taxpayer, with the last one costing about £4.7m.In a statement, the Labour Party said: \"The NEC believes that causing an unnecessary election for the position of Greater Manchester mayor would have a substantial and disproportionate impact on party campaign resources ahead of the local elections and elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Senedd in May.\"Although the Party would be confident of retaining the mayoralty, the NEC could not put Labour's control of Greater Manchester at any risk.\"Housing secretary says it's not the right time for Burnham's return to ParliamentLocal government secretary Steve Reed said the NEC had decided against Burnham's candidacy \"because of the huge inconvenience to two million voters across Greater Manchester of having a by-election for a new mayor\".\"I know that's disappointing for Andy,\" Reed said. \"But it's good news for the people of Greater Manchester because he's been doing such a good job as the mayor there.\"Reed said \"voters don't like elections that come mid-term\" but added that \"in due course, I look forward to seeing Andy back in Parliament\".Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC he was \"absolutely furious\" about the decision and suggested the prime minister did not \"understand the depth of anger there will be amongst our members about this\".\"I think it shows weakness and cowardice,\" McDonnell said, describing the move as \"factionalism gone wild\".He said he had messaged Starmer to tell him \"if he thinks this strengthens his position, I think it will used to hasten his demise if he's not careful\".He said it was an \"insult to people's intelligence\" to claim the decision had been made because of the difficulty and expense of finding a new mayor of Greater Manchester.Karl Turner, Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull East, said it was regrettable that the NEC had stopped Burnham from becoming a candidate because he believes he would have been a \"frontrunner to win the seat\".He said while he wanted Starmer to remain prime minister, the decision to block Burnham \"provides more chance of a challenge\" if the party lose the by-election.But other Labour MPs welcomed the decision, with John Slinger, who represents the Rugby constituency, saying the \"quick and clear decision\" meant the party could \"move on from the damaging, introspection and psychodrama of the last week\".Burnham, who was previously MP for Leigh, has been touted as a possible Labour leadership contender but can only mount a challenge if he is an MP.The former cabinet minister has previously not denied he could challenge Sir Keir.But in his letter to the NEC on Saturday, Burnham insisted he would be in Parliament \"to support the work of the government, not undermine it\".\"I have passed this assurance on to the prime minister.\"Labour will now move ahead with picking someone else to be their candidate in Gorton and Denton.Once the deadline for applications passes on Sunday night, an NEC selection panel will shortlist candidates, who will go through to a vote of local party members next weekend.Gorton and Denton has traditionally voted Labour and the party won the seat in 2024 with a majority of 13,000.Since then, the party's popularity has declined and Labour could face challenges from Reform UK and the Green Party, who came second and third there at the general election.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterConservative politicians Sir Andy Street and Baroness Ruth Davidson are launching a new movement that will attempt to attract millions of \"politically homeless\" voters to the Tory party.The former West Midlands mayor and former Scottish Conservative leader will unveil the initiative on Monday in a bid to win back moderate voters who they say snubbed the party at the last general election.It will seek to engage those voters and work with them to develop policies they want the Conservative Party to adopt.Speaking on the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, Sir Andy and Baroness Davidson said they had faith in Kemi Badenoch's leadership of the Conservatives and wanted her to be prime minister.But they said their research suggested that seven million people who describe themselves as centrist, or centre-right, felt no party currently represented them.They feel there is political room for a movement that focuses on issues such as tax, housing, infrastructure and business investment.Sir Andy said: \"So we want to step forward with a national movement, grassroots movement, to get out there, talking to voters, and particularly to businesses, to bring forward ideas, where the tip of the spear is very much around the economy and the bread and butter issues about making people feel better off in this country.\"The movement is being set up at a difficult time for the Conservatives, who suffered their worst-ever general election result in history in 2024.The party is facing a huge challenge from Reform UK, which has been leading in national opinion polls and announcing high-profile defections from the Conservatives for months.Sir Andy, a former managing director of John Lewis who was twice elected as a Conservative mayor in the West Midlands, said \"the forces of populism on the left and the right are rampant across the western world\".He said the new movement was about saying \"no, they are not in Britain\".\"There is still a really, really strong centre-right who believe in Britain, believe in its institutions, believe in its future, and who want to build things up and not knock things down.\"Baroness Davidson said Badenoch was a \"solid Conservative who can speak naturally to a broad range of people who are current supporters or potential supporters\".But she added there was a \"large group of people who are potential supporters, where she might not be the best messenger\".Baroness Davidson, who was Scottish leader when the Conservatives replaced Labour as the second-largest party in the Scottish Parliament, said: \"This is about people that feel that the Conservative party left them but also feel like they don't have a home in Labour or the Liberal Democrats.\"Writing on X, she said: \"We want to speak to those who feel politically homeless and to work with them - and business - to develop practical, pragmatic policies to improve lives & opportunities.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoGrace DeanBBCCrime writer Harriet was not fully convinced that Rachel was a Traitor - until she saw her wear a red dress the day after a pivotal moment in the show.\"She'd gone in looking so sleek and professional… whereas before, she was dressed up more in child-friendly sort of yellows and dungarees and like a Minion,\" Harriet told BBC Local.For contestants on the reality TV show The Traitors, it is not just what they say or how they act that shapes their fellow players' opinions of them - it is how they dress.\"What we wear says a huge amount about us,\" says Carolyn Mair, a chartered psychologist and author of The Psychology of Fashion. Some of the contestants used their outfits \"very carefully and very well\", she says.\"Their clothing becomes their character.\"'How could I be a Traitor if I'm wearing knitwear?'The most recent series of The Traitors, which ended on Friday, was \"the most fashionable yet\", says Mair. \"Fashion has become part of the show's attraction.\"As well as Claudia Winkleman's extravagant gothic looks, some of the contestants' outfits on this year's series blew up online, from Jade's playful cardigans and Jessie's yellow colour palette to Stephen's jumpsuit and Harriet's scarves.The outfits worn by Traitor Stephen - including knitwear, a jumpsuit and tucked-in shirts - were the focus of many of these articles and social media posts.\"He wanted to be seen,\" says Mair. \"He was choosing to be noticed.\"She says that his \"playful\" outfits made him look \"open and trustworthy\" and made other people feel comfortable.In the final episode of The Traitors: Uncloaked, Stephen admitted that his outfit choices were bold an attempt to distract Faithfuls from his expressive and red face.He told the audience: \"I thought if I wore clothes that are a bit flamboyant and loud then maybe they'd just be going 'oh Stephen you look really great today'. \"Rather than looking up here [at my face] and going 'you're a traitor'. So it was all kind of tactics.\" \"He came across as being confident,\" says stylist Sarah Thomson. \"People would be quite relaxed around him.\" She describes his jumpsuit, from Palomo Spain, as a \"wow piece\".Stars including Harry Styles and Beyonce have been known to wear the Palomo Spain designs, with Styles wearing the £858 black and white jumpsuit to perform at Capital FM's Summertime Ball in 2022.Jade's outfits, which included a £430 Hope Macaulay cardigan and a cherry-patterned cardigan from House of Sunny, made her look \"quite young and innocent\" and like \"someone you wouldn't want to hurt\", says Mair.Although Jade appeared to be one of the quieter personalities in the castle, Thomson feels like she used some of her outfits as \"a power play, like non-verbal communication, using colour and playful textures to be taken seriously and to be noticed without doubting herself\".Traitor Rachel opted for bright coloured knitwear in the final episode of the series too, wearing a £350 pink and red cardigan, also from Hope Macaulay. Faithful Matthew told BBC Local he carefully planned his strategy before appearing on the show, right down to his fashion choices: \"I wanted to be a Traitor, so I did deliberately bring every jumper that I owned because I thought: 'How could I be a traitor if I'm wearing nice knitwear?'\"Secret Traitor Fiona, on the other hand, wanted to portray herself as someone with a \"maternal, non-threatening and nurturing persona\", says Mair. Because of this, she dressed in \"soft, flowery, not particularly fashion-forward\" clothes.\"Mothers are typically perceived as trustworthy, self-sacrificing and emotionally safe so this made the contestants trust her,\" says Mair.The way people dress can reflect their mood, the experts say. When Harriet tried to bring down Rachel during a dramatic round table, she wore a red cardigan and a red scarf. Rachel also dressed in red.\"Red is a real confident 'I mean business' colour,\" says Thomson. \"Whether that was done purposely or not, I don't know, but it was really clever.\"Matthew told BBC Local that he did not pay too much attention to what the other contestants were wearing at the time, but when he watched it back he realised that Rachel was dressed \"absolutely fabulously\" when Harriet accused her of being a Traitor. \"That is such a telltale sign, right?\"\"She thought she was getting banished, so she was dressing up to look beautiful for what she thought could be her final moment,\" he said.For Thomson, the key is for contestants to dress in a way that makes them feel at ease.\"Whether they are a Traitor or a Faithful, if you're wearing something that you're super comfortable in and feel really good in, it's going to give you that self-assurance and that little bit more confidence in how you play this game,\" she says. \"I think it also helps people build trust if you're super relaxed in what you're wearing.\"Series three winner Leanne was well aware of how clothing could shape people's perception. She decided to hide the fact that she was a soldier, and met her fellow contestants at the train station in a bright pink suit.\"People are gonna take one look at this pink suit and they're gonna be like, 'She's so girly, she's so ditsy,' and they're so wrong,\" she said on the show.'I didn't pack enough clothes'Contestants on The Traitors bring in their own clothes and style their outfits themselves.Anna, from the third series, said she bought the majority of hers in charity shops, including the crocheted top she wore in the show's promotional images.Matthew, from series four, said that he had to send pictures of the clothes he planned to bring to the Traitors team in advance.Charlotte, who was recruited as a Traitor on the third series, tells BBC News she was not given much guidance about what to wear, other than to avoid logos, bring activewear for missions and a dressy outfit for the dinner party, and pack jumpers in case it was cold. She did not buy anything new for the show, she says.\"I didn't pack enough clothes,\" Charlotte told Digital Spy last year. \"I thought I'd be out day two… I had nothing to wear.\"\"I do regret wearing the dungarees quite so many times,\" she added. \"I literally look like a children's TV presenter.\"Stylists on the show can provide some help, though. Charlotte said in an interview with Cosmopolitan that she brought a black jumpsuit that she wore for the final, but did not plan any shoes to go with it. The show's stylists kitted her out with a black belt and boots to complete her look.Although Charlotte put on a Welsh accent, which she thought would make her come across as more trustworthy, she did not change how she dressed to match her new persona, she says. \"If only I had been that clever,\" she tells BBC News over email.Frankie, another finalist on the third series, told the Not Another Mummy Podcast that when she was choosing what to wear each day, she picked a Cluedo character to theme her outfit around, like a blue denim dress for Mrs Peacock, yellow shorts for Colonel Mustard and a red sequined dress for Miss Scarlett.\"It was just my way of having a little bit of control over the days that you couldn't control, a little bit of focus in the morning rather than worrying about the day,\" she said.In this year's series, Jessie and Jade carefully matched their makeup to their outfits - something they had to do themselves. Contestants are not given help with hair, makeup and nails, Charlotte tells BBC News.\"I had got my nails done before coming to the castle,\" she says, \"but they quickly vanished due to the nerves of playing the game.\"Additional reporting by Alix Hattenstone, BBC LocalPhotography: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/Cody Burridge/Paul Chappells & David Fisher/Global/ShutterstockMore on The Traitors",

    "body": "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said the government should start selling war bonds as there is a need to \"move far faster\" on UK defence spending. Under his party's plan, members of the public could loan the government money in the form of a bond which would run over a two-to-three year period and pay out the same interest as standard government bonds. Davey said the bonds, which the party says could raise up to £20bn for the military, would give the public a chance to \"support patriotically our defence\". A government spokesperson said \"new debt instruments\" were kept under review but that they had to represent \"value for money\" and \"be consistent with wider fiscal objectives\". Calls to increase defence spending have intensified in recent years, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the election of US President Donald Trump, who has frequently criticised Nato countries for failing to spend enough on their military. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Davey said a move to sell war bonds was needed as \"we're in almost a Cold War type scenario\", citing the Russian use of drones, submarines and shadow fleets. He continued: \"This is a serious threat, and we need to move far faster than what the government has been doing.\"We need to go rapidly.\"The Labour government has pledged to raise overall defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, at an estimated cost of an additional £6bn a year.It has also promised to raise levels to 3.5% by 2035, in line with a pledge by Nato members last year. However, there have been reports in the Times and the Sun that plans to make Britain's armed forces \"war ready\" will require £28bn more than has so far been allocated.The government had been due to publish its defence investment plan last autumn but there are suggestions it has been delayed due to concerns about cost.Earlier this month, the head of the Armed Forces, Sir Richard Knighton, said the UK was \"not as ready as we need to be for the kind of full-scale conflict we might face\".On Sunday, Davey said: \"Everyone can see that since the last election things have changed dramatically. The way that Putin is prosecuting that [Ukraine] war, but as significantly, the attitude of Donald Trump to supporting European defence.\"He expressed concern about the Nato alliance given the approach of the US president. \"I deeply regret to say, because of Donald Trump, there has to be a question about whether we can rely on the United States. With him in the White House they're no longer a reliable ally. We have to step up and fast,\" he told the BBC.The Liberal Democrats said the money raised from issuing bonds would be ring-fenced for defence and the investment would help deliver \"growth, jobs and higher revenues\" for the government \"which would partially offset the cost of additional debt servicing\".The party added the scheme would need to be accompanied by an overhaul of the Ministry of Defence procurement process, which has previously been criticised as wasteful. Their proposal, the party says, would be similar to the bonds scheme used during World War One and World War Two. Individual citizens could lend the government money, which would be paid back in six to 10 years with interest. By the end of 1945, the scheme had raised £1.754m.Posters encouraging members of the public to buy bonds - or national savings certificates - used slogans including \"lend to defend\" and \"feed the guns with war bonds\". Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at investors AJ Bell, said: \"War bonds are a proven way of raising money to fund national defence spending, but they can burden a government with long-term debt. \"In theory, the public might demand a better rate of interest than they could get on cash in the bank to take up the bonds. \"While some people might think it is their duty to support the country, there will be others who treat such a bond in the same way as any type of investment.\" ",

    "body": "8 hours agoJacob PhillipsFamily handoutAlex Pretti was killed in Minneapolis on SaturdayA man who was shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis has been identified by his family as 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti.He has been described as an avid outdoorsman who loved mountain biking and is understood to have joined protests after Renee Good, also 37, was shot dead by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in her car earlier this month.Conflicting accounts have emerged about the moments leading up to his death.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an agent fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they claim had a handgun, resisted attempts to disarm him. Some eyewitnesses and officials, as well as Pretti's family, have challenged that account.Videos show no evidence to support the claim he used any armed force to threaten agents.Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, his family said in a statement. They told the Associated Press news agency (AP) that he was upset by US President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration in the city. Pretti's mother also said her son cared immensely about the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations.\"He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,\" Susan Pretti told AP. She added: \"He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.\"Pretti had no interactions with law enforcement beyond traffic tickets, family sayPretti loved adventures with his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog Joule, who died around a year ago, AP reported. His family said he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to AP, court records show he had no criminal record.Pretti's parents, who live in Wisconsin, said they had also recently told their son to be careful while protesting.\"We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,\" his father Michael Pretti told AP. \"And he said he knows that. He knew that.\"Pretti's family also explained he owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota - but they had never known him to carry it.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara also said police believed he was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, the BBC's US partner CBS reported. 'Please get the truth out about our son'After seeing videos suggesting their son was a \"domestic terrorist,\" Pretti's family issued a statement saying \"the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting\".They claimed videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents. \"Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,\" they urged in their statement.Pretti was a Democratic voter and had taken part in the wave of street protests after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, his ex-wife told AP.She said that he was someone who may shout at law enforcement officers at a protest but had never known him to be physically confrontational.ReutersA woman cries as people gather around a makeshift memorial close to where Alex Pretti was shotA US citizen born in Illinois, Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir. He went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to his family.He worked as a research scientist before returning to education to qualify as a registered nurse.His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple of days before he was shot dead when they spoke about repairs he had done to the garage door at his home, AP reported. A Latino man had completed the work and Pretti's parents said with all that was happening in Minneapolis he gave the man a $100 (£74) tip.Doctor Dmitri Drekonja, who worked with Pretti, told ABC News the pair had bonded over their interest in mountain biking and would compare notes on which trails to ride.\"He was the type of person you enjoyed being around and the notion that this helpful, smiling joking guy was being labelled a terrorist? It's galling,\" he said.ReutersPeople gather around a makeshift memorial close to where Alex Pretti was fatally shotNeighbours described Pretti as quiet and warmhearted.\"He's a wonderful person,\" Sue Gitar told AP, who lived downstairs from the nurse and said he moved into the building about three years ago. \"He has a great heart.\"Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbours said.\"I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun,\" said Gitar.",

    "body": "The killing of a second US citizen in less than a month during anti-immigration raids in Minneapolis has sparked angry protests and widespread condemnation.Hundreds of demonstrators braved freezing weather to take to the streets over the shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, during a confrontation on Saturday.Videos from the scene show the scuffle between federal officers and Pretti. Federal and state authorities have offered conflicting versions of what happened in the moments leading to the shooting.Trump ordered federal agents to the Democrat-held state in December, pledging a massive deportation of undocumented migrants. On Saturday night hundreds of people paid tribute to Pretti, lighting candles and chanting his name near the spot where he was shot.During the day, hundreds of protesters showed their anger against the shooting and  raids by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), as armed and masked agents used tear gas and stun grenades.Protests have spread to other US cities, including New York where people held signs saying, \"Justice for Alex\" and \"abolish ICE\", as well as to Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.The Trump administration has described Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist\".  Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said he was there \"to perpetuate violence\", saying he approached federal agents with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun.Videos have emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and the man just before the shooting.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti resisted their attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened.BBC Verify analysed multiple videos showing the moments just before the shooting. They show Pretti filming agents with his mobile phone. One of the agents pushes another person over, and Pretti then stands between that person and the agent.The agent pepper-sprays him in the face and, as he tries to help the woman on the floor, more agents join and he is wrestled to the floor. None of the available videos shows Pretti holding a gun.An agent in a grey jacket can be seen empty-handed as he reaches to remove something from Pretti's waist. He then turns away from Pretti, now holding what appears to be a pistol in his right hand.Less than a second after this, an agent shoots Pretti. Ten shots are heard.What we know  about fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in MinneapolisWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?If you are in Minneapolis, please share your storyIn filed testimony, two witnesses challenged the DHS account of what happened, both saying they did not see Pretti brandish a weapon.But Deputy Attorney-General Todd Blanche told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that the videos were unclear and \"there is a lot we don't see\" in them so it was important to have an investigation.President Donald Trump said local and state officials were \"inciting Insurrection\", suggesting they had called off local police from protecting federal immigration officers at the shooting scene.Governor Walz strongly disputed the federal government's account of the incident. \"I've seen the video from several angles and it's sickening,\" he told reporters.\"Thank God we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It is nonsense, and it's lies,\" he saidWalz reiterated his call for trump to end ICE operations in Minnesota and urged protests to remain peaceful. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also called for ICE agents to leave the state. \"How many more residents, how many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end?\" he said.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the man who was killed was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record other than traffic violations.It is legal in Minnesota to carry a handgun in public if you have a permit.Republican Senator Bill Cassidy called the events in Minneapolis \"incredibly disturbing\". The \"credibility\" of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security are at stake, he said in a post on social media.\"There must be a full joint federal and state investigation.\"The latest shooting follows weeks of tensions between the Minnesota authorities, federal agents and protesters who have taken to the streets to observe the agents during their anti-immigration raids.Earlier this month, an ICE agent shot dead Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident who was taking part in such an observation.Trump's crackdown in Minneapolis was launched in December after some Somali immigrants were convicted in a massive fraud of state welfare programmes. The state is home to the largest community of Somali immigrants in the US.ICE agents have the power to stop, detain and arrest people they suspect of being in the US illegally.",

One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.

    "body": "10 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentReggae legend Sly Dunbar, who played with everyone from Bob Marley to The Rolling Stones, has died at the age of 73.One of the genre's most revered drummers, he played on tracks such as Bob Marley's Punky Reggae Party and Dave and Ansell Collins' classic, Double Barrel.However, he was better known as half of the production team Sly & Robbie - who produced groundbreaking hits for everyone from Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru, to non-reggae acts like Bob Dylan, Grace Jones and Ian Dury.Dunbar's death was first reported by his wife, Thelma, who told the Jamaican newspaper The Gleaner she had found him unresponsive on Monday morning. The musician's agent and publicist confirmed the news to the BBC. Born Lowell Fillmore Dunbar in Kingston, Jamaica, he started out playing on tin cans, after watching Lloyd Knibbs and the Skatalites on television.\"I saw [Knibbs] playing and I thought, 'I want to be a drummer' because he's the hardest worker in the band,\" he said in a 1997 interview.\"He's my idol! In some ways, I'm self-taught but I got a lot of help from other drummers by watching them play.\"In his teens, Dunbar met bassist Robbie Shakespeare and formed the rhythm section of the Revolutionaries, who became regular session musicians at the famed Channel One recording studio.Their sound differed from the melody-rich music of Bob Marley, with a heavier emphasis on the beat - including the pioneering \"rockers\" rhythm, which introduced more syncopation and energy to the music.They spent the 1970s working with major reggae acts like Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown and Barrington Levy, while touring the US with Peter Tosh.According to legend, the duo lived on bread and water in that period, hoping to save enough money to start their own production company.Taxi Records was duly founded in 1980, and nurtured a new generation of Jamaican artists such as Shaggy, Shabba Ranks, Skip Marley, Beenie Man and Red Dragon.Around the same time, they provided the thunderous beats on Grace Jones's hit 1981 album Nightclubbing, which opened the doors for them to work with some of rock and pop's greatest - from Dylan and Joe Cocker, to singers like Marianne Faithfull, Madonna and Sinead O'Connor.At home, they earned a reputation for updating the sound of reggae by incorporating more electronic instruments and textures.Later on, they developed a bright and melodic take on dancehall with the duo Chaka Demus & Pliers, scoring hits with songs such as Tease Me and Murder She Wrote in the early 1990s.At one point, Shakespeare (who died in 2021) estimated that he and Dunbar had taken part in more than 200,000 recordings, either their own or as backup musicians or producers for other artists.\"When you buy a reggae record, there's a 90% chance the drummer is Sly Dunbar,\" producer Brian Eno told the New Music New York festival in 1979. \"You get the impression that Sly Dunbar is chained to a studio seat somewhere in Jamaica, but in fact what happens is that his drum tracks are so interesting, they get used again and again.\"Dunbar's wife said she had found him unresponsive in bed at around 07:00 on Monday, 26 January.\"I went to wake him up and he wasn't responding, I called the doctor and that was the news,\" she said. An exact cause of death was not given, though Dunbar had reportedly been ill for some time.\"Yesterday was such a good day for him,\" Thelma told Jamaica's Gleaner newspaper. \"He had friends come over to visit him and we all had such a good time. He ate well yesterday... sometimes he's not into food. I knew he was sick... but I didn't know that he was this sick.\"Among those paying tribute was British DJ David Rodigan, who called Dunbar a \"true icon\" and \"one of the greatest drummers of all time\".",

    "body": "14 minutes agoKate Whannel,Political reporterandJoshua Nevett,Political reporterGround rents will be capped at £250 a year for leaseholders in England and Wales, the government has announced. Announcing the cap in a TikTok video, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"I've spoken to so many people who say this will make a difference to them worth hundreds of pounds.\"The reforms will be published in the draft Leasehold and Commonhold Reform Bill, which will be introduced on Tuesday.Ground rents - an annual fee leaseholders must pay to their freeholder - were abolished for most new residential leasehold properties in England and Wales in 2022, but remained for existing leasehold homes.Labour's 2024 election manifesto promised to \"tackle unregulated and unaffordable ground rent charges\".It is common for a lease to include a clause that the ground rent doubles or increases by RPI inflation at fixed intervals, which can make it difficult to sell or get a mortgage for a property.The Labour government says under its reforms, ground rent will ultimately be reduced to a peppercorn, effectively zero, after 40 years.New leasehold flats will be banned and forfeiture, whereby leaseholders can lose their home and the equity they built up if they default on a debt as low as £350, will be abolished.The bill will also make it easier for existing leaseholders to convert to commonhold, which means occupants jointly own the ground a flat is built on as well as the building, without an expiring lease.There are around five million leasehold homes in England and Wales, where people own the right to occupy a property via a lease for a limited number of years from a freeholder.Recent reports suggested that the Treasury and the housing department have been at loggerheads over the issue, with concerns over how a cap would impact pension funds which own freeholds.The Residential Freehold Association (RFA), which is the trade body representing professional freeholders, said capping ground rent was \"wholly unjustified\" and warned over the impact on the UK's reputation for investors.An RFA spokesperson said the bill \"will tear up long-established contracts and property rights, which are pillars of the UK's investment reputation\".But campaigners had called for a cap, saying that escalating ground rents had left leaseholders struggling to sell their homes.However, some had wanted the government to go further and limit ground rent to a peppercorn rate - effectively zero.Leaseholds is the default tenure for privately-owned flats, and the Land Registry estimates that 99% of flat sales in 2024 in England were leasehold.The English Housing Survey has estimated that in 2023/24, leasehold owner-occupiers reported paying an average annual ground rent of £304 a year. In 2024, when Labour were in opposition, the current Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said his preference was for ground rents to be capped at effectively zero.Last week, former Labour minister Justin Madders told the BBC that the prime minister could face a \"mass rebellion\" if the government abandoned its pledge to cap ground rents.He said setting the limit at a peppercorn rate would be his preferred choice but that he could accept a £250 cap due to the \"risk of elongated legal challenge\".Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoFallout following the decision to block Andy Burnham from standing in a forthcoming by-election has continued, with the Mail reporting a growing rebellion among government officials. It reports that 50 MPs have signed a letter protesting against the decision, noting that pressure on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has \"intensified\".The Times says that senior Labour figures have \"privately conceded\" that they expect to lose the Gorton & Denton by-election as a result of the Burnham block. The paper says the fight for the seat is \"likely to be deeply divisive\", with the Greens and Reform UK \"set to pile pressure\" on Sir Keir. The prime minister has defended his decision regarding Burnham, insisting that allowing him to run for the seat would \"divert our resources\" from \"very important\" campaigns in May's elections.Several papers picture former Man United footballer Sir David Beckham and his family at an award ceremony in Paris, after Lady Beckham became a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters. Under the headline \"Clan united\", the Sun calls it a \"show of solidarity\", noting it is the first time that the family have been seen together following the row with Brooklyn, the eldest son, on Instagram last week. The couple were joined by their other three children - Romeo, Cruz and Harper.\"You are my everything\" declares the Star, pairing the photo of the family in Paris with a quote from Lady Beckham's Instagram post to mark her acceptance of the knighthood.Though the Beckhams are also front and centre of the Guardian, the paper's headline reads: \"Tories face backlash after 'mental health' jibe over Braverman's exit\". It reports that the Conservative Party had to correct the record after they initially said Suella Braverman had defected to Reform UK because of \"mental health\" issues. In a fresh statement, the party said the original had been a draft version sent out in error.A beaming Braverman and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage are splashed across the Mirror, paired with the headline \"Reform's latest con\". The i Paper says the statement regarding Braverman comes amid a growing Conservative party exodus. The front page also features Farage saying the Tories face a \"cataclysm\" in May's elections. \"More January transfer deals!\" declares the Metro, marking both the defection of Braverman and an updated cast for The Great British Bake Off. It confirms that Nigella Lawson with replace Prue Leith in the forthcoming series of the beloved television show.The price of gold is leading the Tuesday edition of the Financial Times, after it hit $5,000 per troy ounce for the first time. The paper says Monday also saw the US dollar sink to a four-month low, amid fears of another government shutdown.The Telegraph says China has been hacking the mobile phones of senior officials in Downing Street for \"several years\", as part of an operation that the paper understands \"compromised senior members of the government\". Previous claims of phone hacking were dismissed by China as \"baseless\".Holocaust survivor Eva Clarke, 80, has given an interview to the Express to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, telling the paper that she is still hopeful for a better future if people can stand up to prejudice and tackle rising antisemitism.Suella Braverman's defection from the Conservatives to Reform UK features widely. The Daily Mirror says Nigel Farage has welcomed \"another Tory has-been into his ranks\". The Guardian says the Conservatives are facing a \"backlash\" for initially suggesting she had defected following mental health issues. The Sun calls the Tory statement an \"extraordinary slur\". The i Paper quotes the ex-deputy speaker, Nigel Evans, who called the comments an \"absolute disgrace\".\"China hacked phones in Number 10\" is the headline on the front of the Daily Telegraph. The paper says a \"years-long spying operation targeted senior figures\", including aides to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. The government declined to comment on the story. The Chinese embassy said China was a \"staunch defender of cyber security\" and that it had been \"resolute in combatting all kinds of malign cyber activities\".The Daily Mail leads on the letter from Labour MPs to Sir Keir Starmer, criticising the decision to block Andy Burnham from running in a forthcoming by-election. The paper says MPs have warned that the prime minister's strike against the Greater Manchester mayor has \"hastened his demise\". The Times says senior Labour figures have privately conceded that they expect to lose the by-election in Gorton and Denton. Other sources say they're \"not writing the seat off\".A few papers report on a possible announcement by the Treasury of a package of support for the pub sector in England. The Financial Times says it will be worth £100m a year. The Treasury tells the paper that Sir Keir and the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, \"have been clear they are determined to support\" pubs. But the Telegraph says the tax relief is expected to be temporary.The Daily Express marks Holocaust Memorial Day by devoting its front page to an 80-year-old woman who was born in a concentration camp. The paper pictures Eva Clarke looking directly at the camera, and says despite having \"15 of her family murdered by the Nazis\", she is \"still hopeful for a better future\" if we tackle \"rising antisemitism\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "11 hours agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is lent against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

    "body": "1 hour agoRichard Wheeler,Political reporterandToby MannPAAndy Burnham is seen as a potential challenger for Labour Party leadership.Around 50 Labour MPs have signed a letter objecting to the decision to block Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham from standing in a forthcoming parliamentary by-election, BBC News understands.They have written to Sir Keir Starmer to warn the decision is a \"real gift\" to Reform UK, as polling suggests Burnham may be Labour's \"very best chance at winning\" the vacant Gorton and Denton seat.The signatories said there was \"no legitimate reason\" to block Burnham and asked for Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) to \"re-evaluate\".Defending the move, Sir Keir said allowing Burnham to contest the seat would have diverted Labour's resources away from other important elections.\"Resources, whether that's money or people, need to be focused on the elections that we must have, not elections that we don't have to have,\" he said earlier. \"And that was the basis of the NEC decision.\"The names of those who have signed the letter are not expected to be made public, though they are being communicated to the party leadership.The NEC, which includes Sir Keir, said blocking Burham would \"avoid an unnecessary mayoral election\" to replace him should he be successful in the by-election.The previous mayoral election in Greater Manchester costs taxpayers about £4.7m.Burnham has been seen as a potential leadership rival to Sir Keir but would have to return to Parliament in order to mount a challenge.The letter was addressed to Sir Keir, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood in her role as chair of the NEC, and Labour Party General Secretary Hollie Ridley.It said the decision to block Burnham had caused a \"huge amount of anxiety and anger\" amongst colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party and party members across the country.Around half a dozen Labour peers also signed the letter, the BBC has been told. Members of the NEC voted on Sunday morning to deny Burnham permission to stand in the contest.NEC sources told the BBC eight members of its 10 members had voted to block Burnham from running.Only Labour's deputy leader Lucy Powell supported his push to run in the by-election, while Mahmood abstained.Burnham refused to comment when asked for a response to the NEC's decision.\"I've said what I needed to say and here I am back in my job. A full focus on my job as mayor of Greater Manchester,\" he told the BBC.When asked if he thought Sir Keir was scared of him, Burham held to his line.\"I'm not making any further comment,\" he said.He had said earlier he was \"disappointed\" by the move to block him and took a swipe at the Labour Party over how it was made public.Labour won Gorton and Denton in 2024 with a 13,000 majority.Reform UK and the Greens are both expected to pose a greater challenge this time round.Speaking to BBC Newsnight, former Labour cabinet minister Harriet Harman said her parliamentary colleagues should move on and focus on winning the by-election, instead of discussing the decision to block Burnham.Burnham was elected as mayor of Greater Manchester in May 2024.His term runs until May 2028.The Gorton and Denton by-election is likely to be held on 26 February.",

    "body": "Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) have ruled that former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte is fit to attend pre-trial proceedings for alleged crimes against humanity.The ICC also will hold a hearing on 23 February to decide whether the prosecution's case against Duterte is strong enough to proceed to a trial.Duterte's lawyers earlier argued that the 80-year-old was unfit to participate in the ICC proceedings citing \"cognitive impairment\". He has been detained at the Hague since March 2025.He is accused of being responsible for dozens of murders under his so-called war on drugs, during which thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial.Duterte was president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022. He justified his war on drugs by saying peace and order would pave the way for economic development.Citing opinions from a panel of medical experts, ICC judges said they were \"satisfied\" that Duterte is \"able effectively to exercise his procedural rights and is therefore fit to take part in the pre-trial proceedings\".ICC judges also said in their decision on Monday that the mental capacities needed to \"meaningfully exercise one's procedural and fair trial rights\" did not have to be \"at their notionally highest level\".\"This ruling tells victims that in the reckoning of Duterte at the ICC, their voices will not be sidelined by technical evasions,\" said Congresswoman Leila de Lima, one of Duterte's fiercest critics who was jailed during his presidency on drug charges that were later found to be false.Duterte was arrested at Manila airport in March 2025 as his family's alliance with his successor, President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr crumbled.His arrest has divided Filipinos. While his deadly drugs crackdown has drawn sharp criticism from civil society, his populist message resonates with those who feel sidelined by Manila's political elite.In May last year, Duterte was elected mayor of Davao city despite being in prison. His daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte, is also widely expected to run for president in the 2028 elections, where Marcos is ineligible to seek a second term.",

    "body": "4 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorBoth of Westminster's mega brands, Labour and the Conservatives, feel discombobulated and the discombobulator-in-chief is the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage.The thing that ties together the big political stories of the last few days – the stymied manoeuvring of the Greater Manchester Mayor, Andy Burnham, and the shimmying of Suella Braverman out of one party and into another – is the capacity of Reform to give their rivals the heebie-jeebies.Labour are experiencing an anxiety dream, bordering on cold panic, about the possibility of losing the next general election to Reform.It is Labour's anxieties about this very prospect which add rocket fuel to the drama surrounding Andy Burnham. Labour fretting about Reform's rise is what turbo-charges questions about Sir Keir Starmer's future as prime minister and so raises the profile of those seen by some as possible successors.Meanwhile, the Conservatives are witnessing something of an exodus in Reform's direction. It is now four significant defectors just this month.While anyone drawing up a list of potential Conservative defectors to Reform would have put Braverman near the top, this was still a big moment.She is a former Conservative home secretary, a big beast of recent Tory history.And her switch emphasises the momentum Reform are showing in draining the Conservative Party and in particular its Right: a fortnight ago it was former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, the week before last it was Robert Jenrick, a week ago it was Andrew Rosindell, now it is Suella Braverman.On stage at her defection, Braverman shared Reform's diagnosis that Britain is broken, a label the Conservatives disagree with. And like Jenrick before her, she offered a devastating critique of her former party's recent governing record.And all this at just the point Kemi Badenoch has been attracting warmer reviews from her colleagues.Meanwhile, within the Tory fold but outside the Commons, a new group called Prosper UK has launched.Some prominent names in the mix include former Home Secretary Amber Rudd and former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson.These are Conservatives you would least expect to join Reform. Plenty of its supporters backed Remain, many but not all are roughly on the Left of the Conservative tradition. And they are arguing it is time for their voices to be heard once again. Where does this leave Badenoch as a figure of the Right?In short, both the Conservatives and Labour are contorted and strained right now.And let's not forget the questions too for Nigel Farage – not least the recurring one, about whether he leads a convention of cheesed off Conservatives.And whether, even with all the current noise and momentum, Reform really can build a viable prospective alternative government within just a few years.Doing so, Farage insists, has to involve recruiting people with experience of government, like Braverman.But to Reform's critics it dents their claim to run a fresh insurgency untainted by the failures of governments past.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDearbail JordanandPeter HoskinsUS President Donald Trump has announced he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports to 25% after accusing Seoul of \"not living up\" to a trade deal reached last year.In a post on social media, Trump said he would increase levies on South Korea from 15% across a range of products including automobiles, lumber, pharmaceuticals and \"all other Reciprocal TARIFFS\".Trump said South Korean lawmakers have been slow to approve the deal while \"we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to\".South Korea says it had not been given official notice of the decision to raise tariffs on some of its goods, and wanted urgent talks with Washington over the issue.It added that South Korea's Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan, who is currently in Canada, will visit Washington as soon as possible to meet US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.South Korea's benchmark Kospi stock index fell on Tuesday morning but was trading about 1.8% higher later in the day as shares in major exporters recovered.Seoul and Washington reached a deal last October, which included a pledge from South Korea to invest $350bn (£256bn) in the US, some of which would go to shipbuilding.The following month, the two countries agreed that the US would reduce tariffs on some products once South Korea started the process to approve the deal.The agreement was submitted to South Korea's National Assembly on 26 November and is currently being reviewed. It is likely to be passed in February, according to local media.Tariffs are paid by companies who import products. In this case, US firms will pay a 25% tax on goods they buy from South Korea.Trump has frequently used tariffs as leverage to enact foreign policy during his second term in the White House.On Saturday, he threatened Canada with a 100% tariff if it struck a trade deal with China.On Monday, Chinese officials said its \"strategic partnership\" agreement with Canada is not meant to undercut other countries.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country was not pursuing a free trade deal with China and has \"never\" considered it.He added that Canadian officials have made their position clear to their American counterparts.Before that, Trump said he would impose import taxes on eight countries - including the UK - who opposed US plans to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark which is a member of Nato.He later backed down from the tariff threat over Greenland citing progress towards a \"future deal\" over the island, but the episode strained US relations with Denmark and other Nato allies.

    "body": "8 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorGetty ImagesThe menopause is linked to changes in the brain similar to those seen in Alzheimer's, according to a large UK study.The loss of grey matter in areas involved with memory and emotion might partly explain why women are generally at greater risk of dementia than men, researchers speculate.The findings come from nearly 125,000 women, of whom 11,000 had MRI brain scans. In the study, published in the journal Psychological Medicine, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use did not appear to prevent the grey matter loss. Prof Barbara Sahakian, senior author and from Cambridge University, said: \"The brain regions where we saw these differences are ones that tend to be affected by Alzheimer's disease.\"Menopause could make these women vulnerable further down the line. While not the whole story, it may help explain why we see almost twice as many cases of dementia in women than in men.\"The brain changes occurred in:an area which has a major role in learning and memory - the hippocampusa region essential for forming memories and spatial navigation - the entorhinal cortexa part which helps with attention and regulating emotions - the anterior cingulate cortexWhite matter and grey matter are both essential parts of the brain and spinal cord. Grey matter consists of neuronal cell bodies and their dendrites - short protrusions that communicate with neurons nearby. White matter consists of long axons of neurons that transmit impulses to more distant regions of the brain and spinal cord.Asking for help According to guidelines for the NHS, HRT can be considered for menopausal symptoms such as sleep problems and hot flushes. There is limited understanding of the effects of menopause and HRT use on the brain, memory and mood, say the researchers.The study found women on HRT were more likely to suffer poor mental health. But many of those already had poorer mental health before being prescribed the medication.Co-researcher Dr Christelle Langley said it was important to recognise the variety of struggles that can come with menopause. \"We all need to be more sensitive to not only the physical, but also the mental health of women during menopause. \"There should be no embarrassment in letting others know what you're going through and asking for help.\"Prof Channa Jayasena, an expert in hormones and from Imperial College London, said: \"The effect of HRT on brain health in menopause continues to be a topic of debate, and old clinical trials like the Women's Health Initiative have failed to answer this question. Either way, this is an important complication that millions of women experience in the UK, so deserves close attention in the future.\"Michelle Dyson from the Alzheimer's Society said women account for around two-thirds of people living with Alzheimer's disease in the UK.\"And while we still don't fully understand why they are more susceptible than men, it is thought that hormones may play a role,\" she said.\"This large study adds to evidence showing how menopause impacts the brain, including physical changes such as loss of brain volume.\"But without long-term participant tracking, to check if they later develop dementia, we cannot be sure that these brain changes associated with menopause also increase dementia risk.\"She said getting regular exercise, not smoking and limiting alcohol intake can help cut the risk of dementia.",

    "body": "8 hours agoEmma VardyLaurie WatsonLaurie Watson's flight back from a sailing holiday was cancelled Airlines are paying out millions of pounds in compensation to passengers every year after initially saying no, as consumer groups accuse firms of trying to put customers off making claims for severe delays or cancellations.Almost £11m was paid in the year to October 2025 to passengers whose claims were rejected or left unresolved before being escalated to an independent adjudicator, according to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).Customers told the BBC airlines had \"tried to confuse\" them to make them drop claims.Airlines UK said: \"UK airlines take their consumer responsibilities seriously and always look to provide clear information and support for their customers in times of disruption.\"The association, which represents the airline industry, added: \"The latest Civil Aviation Authority Consumer Survey reflects this commitment, showing passenger satisfaction at their highest levels since 2019.\"Graeme Bowd, who runs a consumer group on Facebook advising people on airline claims, told the BBC: \"Weddings get missed, holidays get ruined and business meetings get cancelled and people find it extremely frustrating when they can't get their compensation claims settled.\"What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?Heathrow scraps 100ml liquid container limitThe vast majority of the payouts detailed in the CAA's data came from British Airways (BA) followed by Wizz Air, Ryanair and EasyJet.BA paid £6.9m to passengers whose claims the airline had initially rejected or not resolved.Of 10,679 complaints made against the airline, 81% were upheld in favour of customers after being escalated to an independent complaint body.BA said the \"vast majority\" of its flights run without issue.In the same 12-month period to last October, Wizz Air handed over £1.7m to customers, Ryanair paid £1.68m, and EasyJet shelled out £371,000 in passenger compensation.The CAA's data refers to complaints handled by the UK's two biggest adjudicators - the Consumer Dispute Resolution Limited (CDRL) and the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR).A minority of issues are dealt with by smaller adjudicators.Getty ImagesEasyJet said: \"We always pay compensation if it is due and have an easy form customers can claim through on our website.\"Wizz Air declined to comment. Ryanair has been approached for a response.Bowd said BA used \"several stock excuses\" such as \"adverse weather\" or \"air traffic control restrictions\".But he said: \"When we check out these excuses we often find they're not valid at all, but it's very difficult for ordinary airline passengers to check for themselves.\"I think the general principle is that they don't expect everybody to claim. For those that do, if they can be fobbed off and frustrated for long enough, most of them will give up.\"'Bewildering information'Laurie Watson had been flying back to the UK from Athens after a sailing holiday when his return flight was cancelled.When he tried to claim, BA told him there had been adverse weather conditions and rejected paying him compensation.But Laurie wasn't having it. After checking weather reports for the day he was due to fly, he disputed BA's rejection. \"They send such a bewildering amount of information through that a lay person couldn't understand it,\" he said. \"They're trying to confuse you, I think, and make you drop the claim.\"It was lots of aviation speak and that made me more determined to follow it through.\"In a judgement seen by the BBC, CEDR found there was \"no persuasive evidence\" that Laurie's flight was affected by adverse weather, which would have resulted in such a delay, and the airline was ordered to pay him £700.'It didn't stack up'Heather Follows had been travelling to her sister's wedding in Canada with her children but was told her flight with BA had been cancelled due to an engine issue.She was suspicious from the word go. \"It didn't quite stack up at all,\" she said.\"I just felt like it was a tactical approach that they were using regularly to get away with rescheduling flights that weren't viable.\"Heather felt that BA was unconcerned with \"both the emotional hassle of trying to rearrange things and the personal inconvenience and the costs that I'd incurred and just the amount of time that was involved in actually trying to get the paperwork together\".Adjudicators found that BA had not \"sufficiently demonstrated that there were no reasonable measures it could have taken to avoid the cancellation of the flight\" and that \"the defect was known to the company at least since 2017\".In the end, BA was ordered to pay Heather £1,560.In response, BA said: \"Where customers submit claims for compensation that meet the legislative requirements, our teams work very hard to process them as quickly as possible. \"In the cases raised, our teams have reached out to our customers to resolve the matters.\"It added: \"Most delays and cancellations occur as a result of circumstances beyond our control, such as poor weather or air traffic control restrictions, but when issues occur, we always do our best to make things right.\"EasyJet said: \"If a flight is disrupted, we take our responsibilities seriously and always try to ensure customers are well informed and looked after.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "6 hours agoKate McGoughEducation reporterTheo BatterhamGrammy Award-winning artist, composer and producer Jacob Collier has told the BBC that singing together can combat social isolation in young people and \"bypass the artificial digital boundaries created around us\".He was speaking ahead of the launch of BBC Get Singing, a new music education initiative aimed at getting more teenagers across the UK to sing together.Collier says he \"wouldn't be the person [he is] today\" if he hadn't been encouraged to start singing at school.Recent research suggests singing together as a group is something children become less exposed to as they reach their teenage years. A third of state secondary school teachers said their school didn't have a choir, and over half of state secondary teachers (57%) said their pupils never sang together in assembly, according to a recent survey of approximately 10,000 teachers in England by the survey tool Teacher Tapp. The BBC has now launched BBC Get Singing, its biggest music education initiative in a decade, aimed at getting thousands more 11-14 year olds singing together across the UK. The three-year project can be accessed for free through BBC Bitesize, where there are arrangements of songs available, with additional videos to help teachers and students explore and learn each song, including tips on vocal warm-ups. The two musical arrangements available from Tuesday are 'Live More & Love More', by Celebrity Traitors star Cat Burns, and 'Piping Down the Valleys Wild' by Bob Chilcott. More newly-arranged songs will be released later this year, including Jacob Collier's song 'Something Heavy'. Collier, a seven-time Grammy Award-winning artist, is ambassador for the scheme - a role he said was a \"total no-brainer\", adding that he was \"thrilled to be a part of the whole mission.\"\"I think one of the challenges as a young person in this time is the isolation that comes about when you sit in your little bubble,\" he said. \"Those of us who had the experience as children of singing in choirs never forget the feeling, because you're part of something much bigger than yourself.\"It bypasses so many of the artificial digital boundaries that are created around us, and reminds us of something far more ancient than that. \"Music embeds a sense of confidence, I think, in the individual in a way that nothing else does. And that can be applied to anything that you go on in your life and do.\"Bekki Kosher, head of music at Parrs Wood High School in Manchester, says the mental health benefits of singing are clear among her students, though she admits it is \"sometimes difficult getting students to see that music isn't just something that happens on a phone\". \"It just gives them that lift,\" she says. \"You can park everything else at the door and just be you, just have fun, just smile.\"Kate McGough / BBCStudents in the choir at Parrs Wood High School in Manchester were among the first to try the new musical arrangements as part of BBC Get SingingPupil Alesha, 14, says singing in the school choir brings everyone together.\"It's how I express myself,\" she says. \"So whenever I'm sad, angry, happy, I play music all the time and sing.\"Over the next three years, BBC Get Singing will expand with interactive singing workshops and performances for young people, and training opportunities for teachers and vocal leaders.There are also plans to commission a research project to explore the benefits of collective singing on young people.

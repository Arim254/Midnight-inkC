The video has received significant attention from figures like JD Vance and Elon Musk since being uploaded, prompting the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to declare the agency would target \"blatant fraud that seems to be rampant in Minnesota\".\nDespite the administration’s response to the story, some mainstream media outlets have not found evidence of fraud, while some conservatives feel the story has not had enough attention in the wider media. What’s the truth behind Nick Shirley’s claims and what does it mean for Minnesota and its Somali community?\nAnd, Zohran Mamdani has been sworn in as New York mayor. He delivered a speech outside City Hall promising to show the world that America’s political Left can govern. What are the obstacles he’ll face in that journey as mayor, and how much will it hinge upon his relationship with Donald Trump?\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "4 hours agoPA MediaFreezing weather has led to various challenges for communities across the UKAfter a frightfully cold spell, a return to milder temperatures can cause previously frozen pipes to burst.North-west England's water company United Utilities has warned people to check their pipes for leaks when a period of sub-zero temperatures ends.Warmer conditions can also lead to further strain on the pipes, resulting in water bursts.The company said paying particular attention to the pipes most likely to exposed to cold could save being left with a significant repair job. How can I avoid water bursts?United Utilities advises that the best deterrent is insulating pipes so they don't freeze.It suggest wrapping pipes with \"lagging and pay particular attention to the pipes in cold areas, such as a garage, cellar or those outside your property, as these are the ones most likely to freeze when the temperature drops\".Pipes in lofts are also prone to problems so could benefit from having their own insulation \"duvet\" to stop thaw-related challenges.Are there other preventative steps I can take?Know the location of your stop tap, which is usually under the kitchen sink or stairs, or in a kitchen cupboard, cellar, downstairs bathroom or toilet, garage or utility room.If you do have a burst pipe, you can turn the stop tap clockwise to stop the water.If you have home insurance, check with your policy to see if it covers leaks and bursts.Otherwise, have to hand the contact details of local plumbers or find one on the Watersafe website. Check for household leaks regularly to prevent a small problem becoming a larger issue.People who need extra support can join the United Utilities priority services register for free. What do I do if the pipe bursts?Turn the stop tap clockwise, turn off your heating, and open all your taps to quickly drain the system.If water has leaked near your electrics, switch off the electricity supply at the mains and soak up water with towels.You can find more information on dealing with frozen pipes here.More on this story",

    "body": "The charity Brigitte Bardot established has issued a warning about \"scam\" merchandise purporting to fund its work following the French actress's death.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation said it was aware of \"crude fabrications\" being advertised online alongside claims the proceeds will go to the animal welfare charity.It threatened to take legal action against anyone taking part in \"these alleged illegal fundraising efforts\", stating: \"Everyone is asked to respect the memory of the deceased.\"Bardot died aged 91 last Sunday. After revolutionising 1950s French cinema and becoming a symbol of sexual liberation, she quit acting to devote her life to animals.But the actress-turned-activist courted controversy later in life over a string of remarks about Muslims, gay people and the #MeToo movement. She was fined five times for inciting racial hatred.Her death prompted tributes in France, with President Emmanuel Macron saying the nation was mourning \"a legend of the century\".\"Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom,\" he said.But now, online scammers were co-opting her iconic image for \"vulgar and despicable attempts to exploit her legacy\", the Brigitte Bardot Foundation said.It warned of \"the spread on the internet and social networks of offers for sale of photographs, AI-assisted montages, and all kinds of media\" reproducing her image, including \"in fabricated situations\".\"These are crude fabrications, illicit offers and sales, and purported fundraising campaigns that have never received any endorsement from the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which cannot condone these scams,\" it wrote in a statement on Saturday.Bardot starred in nearly 50 films including And God Created Woman and Contempt, setting fashion trends with her tousled blonde hair and bold eyeliner, before becoming the model for Marianne, the personified symbol of France.She retired from acting in 1973, aged 39, declaring: \"I gave my youth and beauty to men, I give my wisdom and experience to animals.\" Bardot would go on to launch her animal rights foundation 13 years later.Her funeral will take place on Wednesday in Saint-Tropez, southern France, where she lived for decades, in a cemetery overlooking her home and the Mediterranean.The Brigitte Bardot Foundation told French news agency AFP that the private burial  will be \"no frills\" and \"without fuss\", in keeping with her spirit.",

    "body": "17 minutes agoNoor NanjiCulture correspondentFormer Little Mix star Jesy Nelson has revealed that her twin baby daughters have been diagnosed with a rare genetic condition which means they will \"probably never walk\".The singer gave birth to Ocean Jade and Story Monroe Nelson-Foster prematurely last May with musician Zion Foster.On Sunday, Nelson said in an Instagram video that the girls have Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), which she described as the \"most severe muscular disease\".\"It does affect every muscle in the body, down to legs, arms, breathing, swallowing,\" she said.In the video, she explained that her daughters had not been showing as much movement in their legs as they should be, and were struggling to feed properly.\"After the most gruelling three, four months, and endless appointments, the girls have now been diagnosed with a severe muscular disease called SMA type 1,\" she said.\"Essentially, what it does is, over time, it kills the muscles to the body, and if it's not treated in time, your baby's life expectancy will not make it past the age of two.\"Nelson said that the girls were assessed at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.There, she said, she was told that her daughters would \"probably never going to be able to walk. They probably will never regain their neck strength, so they will be disabled\".She added that they have since had treatment, which she was \"so grateful for\".\"Because if they don't have it, they will die.\"Nelson said she had to act as a nurse and put her daughter on \"breathing machines\" since the diagnosis.\"The reason I wanted to make this video was because the last three months have honestly been the most heartbreaking time of my life. I literally feel like my whole life has done a 360.\"But she said she believed her daughters would \"defy all the odds\" and that with the right help, \"they will fight this\".She added that she wanted to share the diagnosis to help other children to get diagnosed as fast as possible.Nelson, 34, gave birth to her twins prematurely at 31 weeks, having previously revealed she had experienced rare complications during the pregnancy.In an Instagram post in October, she said she had \"never felt prouder\" of her body following the birth of her girls, adding that becoming a mother made her \"realise how incredible my body actually is\".Nelson left Little Mix in December 2020, and has since released music as a solo artist, including the single, Boyz, featuring Nicki Minaj, in 2021.SMA is a progressive muscle-wasting disease that can cause death within two years if untreated.In 2021, a life-changing gene therapy drug called Zolgensma was approved by the NHS to treat babies with the disease.According to SMA UK, the drug delivers a healthy copy of the affected gene to the body, but timing is critical because irreversible damage may have already occurred in the nervous system.At present, screening for SMA is only carried out on those who have a sibling with the condition.SMA UK wants the disease to be added to a blood spot test that already checks newborn babies for 10 rare but serious conditions.According to the charity, an estimated 47 babies were born with the condition in the UK in 2024, although about one in 40 people carry the altered gene that can cause the disease.",

    "body": "58 minutes agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesA national day of mourning has been announced in Switzerland for 9 JanuaryThe bodies of 16 more victims of a bar fire in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana have been identified by police.The youngest person was a Swiss girl aged 14, with nine aged under 18. The group includes people of Swiss, Italian, Romanian, Turkish and French nationalities, police said.This brings the number of people who have been identified as killed in the fire to 24.  Among them is 16-year-old Swiss national Arthur Brodard, his mother has said.A criminal investigation into the people who ran Le Constellation bar is under way, while victim's families are enduring an agonising wait for information about loved ones who are still considered missing.Police said no further details will be released about the victims they had identified out of respect for their relatives.However, Arthur Brodard's mother took to Facebook on Saturday night to announce that he \"has left to party in paradise\".\"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light,\" she said as she appeared visibly upset in a video message.While Arthur was still presumed missing and information on his whereabouts was scarce, Ms Brodard-Sitre told local newspaper Le Temps that she had been \"living a nightmare\".Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookArthur Brodard's mother posted a moving tribute to her sonSparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling are the likely cause of the fire during New Year's celebrations at the bar, a preliminary investigation has found. The devastating fire killed at least 40 people and injured 119 others. Many of the dead and missing are teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.The eight identified and returned to their families on Saturday were all aged between 16 and 24, Swiss authorities said.SUPPLIEDVideo from inside the bar appears to show the moment the ceiling covering caught fireOn Saturday, the Italian ambassador to to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, said the identification process was slow because of the severity of the burns many victims had suffered.The French couple who own the bar - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office for the Valais region said.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as the first identified victim of the fire following a statement from the Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father is quoted as saying his son was at Le Constellation. A spokesperson for the Italian foreign ministry previously told the BBC it would not confirm the death.",

IS imposed jihadist rule over parts of Syria and Iraq until 2019.\"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East,\" UK Defence Secretary John Healey said.EPA/ShutterstockThe MoD said no civilians were harmed in the strikesRAF aircraft have carried out patrols over Syria to \"prevent any attempted resurgence\" of IS following its defeat at the battle of Baghuz in 2019, the ministry said.\"I want to thank all the members of our armed forces involved in this operation for their professionalism and their courage,\" Healey said.\"They were among thousands of British personnel deployed over Christmas and New Year. This operation, to eliminate dangerous terrorists who threaten our way of life, shows how our armed forces are ready to step up, all year round, keeping Britain secure at home and strong abroad.\" The RAF has been using aerial drones and manned aircraft to strike IS fighters and targets as part of the international coalition since 2014. The United Nations says IS still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.In November, Syria - under the leadership of new President Ahmed al-Sharaa - became the 90th country to join a US-led coalition to combat the group.The coalition, officials say, is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.Last month, the US military carried out what it called a \"massive strike\" against IS targets in Syria, following an ambush that killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter in Palmyra.",

Their funerals took place at a London mosque on Sunday.The former two-time heavyweight champion was taken to hospital and discharged on Wednesday before returning to the UK this weekend.On Sunday morning he posted two pictures on Instagram, one which shows him sitting alongside his mother and three women, with one holding a photograph of Ghami.The post has the caption: \"My Brothers Keeper.\"Driver Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, 46, was charged at Sagamu Magistrates' Court on Friday. Police sources told the BBC the charges included causing death by dangerous driving.The defendant was granted bail of 5m naira (£2,578) and remanded pending his bail conditions being met. The case has been adjourned until 20 January.Joshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town in Ogun state, near the crash site.The 2012 Olympic champion was on his way to visit relatives for New Year celebrations in the town at the time of the collision, a family member told the BBC.The boxer had been spending time in Nigeria after his recent victory over American YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul on 19 December.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture correspondentThe composer of the musical Wicked has said he will not appear at the Kennedy Center after its board voted to include US President Donald Trump's name in the name of the venue.Stephen Schwartz said in a statement that appearing at the centre \"has now become an ideological statement\", adding: \"As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.\"But Richard Grenell, the center's president, wrote on X that the reports of him pulling out of a gala in May were \"totally bogus\" and that he had never been signed to attend.The Oscar and Grammy-award winning composer is the latest artist to say they will no longer appear at the national cultural institution over the recent changes.Schwartz told the BBC that at the end of 2024 he was asked by the artistic director of the Washington National Opera to participate in the May event with them.He said that he had agreed, but that he had received little communication since last February and assumed it was no longer taking place.The composer explained that, on Thursday, he was contacted by a reporter saying that the gala was announced on the Kennedy Center schedule and asking if he would be participating.He had been listed on the centre's website as appearing in the gala, but this was removed from the website on Friday afternoon, according to CNN.\"The Kennedy Center was founded to be an apolitical home for free artistic expression for artists of all nationalities and ideologies,\" Schwartz, 77, said.\"It is no longer apolitical, and appearing there has now become an ideological statement. As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.\"But Mr Grennell hit back: \"The Stephen Schwartz reports are totally bogus. Shame on the woke high school reporters repeating it.\"He was never signed and I've never had a single conversation on him since arriving.\"He himself said last February he hadn't heard anything on it.\"Two musical acts cancelled their appearances at the centre earlier this week.The Cookers, a veteran jazz band, said they cancelled two New Year's Eve shows. The group did not mention Trump or the Kennedy Center in a statement, but said the decision had \"come together very quickly\".Another group, Doug Varone and Dancers, said they would not perform two shows in April because of the name change, adding: \"We can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution.\"Mr Grenell called the cancellations \"a form of derangement syndrome\".Prior to them, jazz percussionist Chuck Redd called off a Christmas Eve gig he had hosted annually since 2006 at the centre over the name change.Mr Grenell called it a \"political stunt\" and threatened to seek $1m (£740,000) in damages.The Kennedy Center's board, which Trump filled with allies, voted to rename the institution the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in December. New signage appeared on the building's exterior the following day.Some US lawmakers and legal scholars have argued that, because the centre was named in a 1964 law, Congress must have a say on any name change.Some members of President John F Kennedy's family have denounced the move. The centre was named in Kennedy's memory shortly after his assassination.Joe Kennedy III, a former US House of Representatives member and grandnephew of the late president, said the venue was \"a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law\".\"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he added.",

    "body": "3 hours agoGetty ImagesThe passengers were served the food on an LNER train from YorkA train worker who was sacked after first class passengers were served sausage rolls from a bin has said he was going \"over and beyond for the customer\".Peter Duffy, who worked for London North Eastern Railway (LNER), was accused of preparing sausage rolls he had \"retrieved from a bin\", which were then served to passengers by a colleague.Another member of train crew reported hearing laughter from the kitchen before the food was served and made a complaint after noticing sausage rolls that were in the bin had disappeared.Mr Duffy was sacked by the rail firm, but later claimed unfair dismissal and discrimination. However, at a tribunal in Newcastle, a judge concluded LNER had acted reasonably.On 7 May 2023, Mr Duffy and a fellow train crew member were working on an LNER service departing York when two passengers in first class requested sausage rolls.Another member of staff who reported the incident said: \"Myself and a host from standard class had been in the kitchen to get ourselves food when the host who was cooking told us the sausage rolls had just gone in the bin.\"Later, the member of staff reported hearing \"lots of laughing\" from inside the kitchen where Mr Duffy and his colleague were based.Mr Duffy was told CCTV footage appeared to show him retrieving items of food from a bin.The footage suggested the food was plated and re-heated by Mr Duffy and served to customers by his colleague.Both were suspended pending an investigation into the alleged breach of food hygiene standards.'Gone too far'At an investigatory meeting on 17 May 2023, Mr Duffy said he was \"a person who goes over and beyond for the customer\".He said: \"I clearly took them out as there were none left for people in first class, but they were wrapped in foil.,\"We had totally run out. I have just gone too far for the customer in my mind.\"Mr Duffy was found to have committed gross misconduct and was dismissed in July 2023.He claimed at the tribunal in August that he had suffered from anxiety and depression, while a union representative said he \"had suffered from a recognised condition that day, known as transient global amnesia\".Transient global amnesia is a sudden, temporary interruption of short-term memory.In reasons published on Wednesday to support the tribunal's judgment, the judge said Mr Duffy's actions were not something that arose in consequence of his disability.Related stories",

    "body": "5 days agoHeidi BoothNottinghamBBCNatalie Rekowski has a rare condition that only affects one in 500,000 womenFor a long time, everyday tasks like climbing the stairs or doing the washing left Natalie Rekowski breathless. At 18 weeks pregnant with her second child, Natalie's airway closed significantly and she needed emergency surgery to allow her to breathe properly. The mother of two has idiopathic laryngotracheal stenosis, a rare condition that affects one in 500,000 women and causes abnormal narrowing of the voice box and windpipe. \"It is really scary because it's a condition that you can't see, you don't really know what's going on - other than how you feel and how it affects your breathing,\" she said.After having surgery at the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham, Natalie said she felt like a \"new woman\".The 37-year-old added: \"It [her airway] opened wide open, and my pregnancy was great after that, it was like my first pregnancy, I got to actually enjoy it again.\"Natalie will have to have treatment for the condition for the rest of her lifeThe condition, which is often mistaken for asthma, involves inflammation and scar tissue build-up in the airway.Before Natalie was diagnosed, she was prescribed multiple inhalers to try to treat her symptoms.She said: \"It was a scary time, because you know there is something wrong with you but they [test results] keep coming back clear. \"You just had no idea what was going on.\"She is one of a number of women who now travel to Nottingham to receive specialist treatment at the QMC.It is one of three NHS centres in the country to offer a one-stop service for patients with the condition, which includes surgery to remove the affected tissue and steroid injections to slow down the regrowth. 'Feel so alone'Natalie, who lives in Cumbria, was diagnosed in 2021 and did receive some treatment at her local hospital.But a friend from a support group then put Natalie in touch with surgeon Prof Reza Nouraei, consultant ear nose and throat surgeon at the QMC, after she started to find it very difficult to breathe.\"She said that I could come to Nottingham and he'd be willing to meet,\" Natalie said.\"I packed a bag and came down, and he came in to see me from home and he operated the next day.\"Natalie credits Prof Nouraei with changing her life after her initial surgery in 2024.\"He's a hero, he really is, I'm really really grateful, I've got to come here, it does really mean a lot because you feel so alone,\" she said.\"When I was at my previous hospital, they didn't have anybody that had this condition and I was kind of a guinea pig.\"Since coming here, I've met a great group of ladies, we've got a WhatsApp group and we talk all the time, which is great in itself to just not feel so alone.\"Prof Reza Nouraei said the condition could lead to miscarriageProf Nouraei said it was unclear why the condition mainly affected women.\"We don't know why it happens, it just creeps up on them over a course of one or two years,\" he added.\"It can present itself in critical times like pregnancy where the respiratory demand goes up and suddenly the condition deteriorates.\"It can lead to problems like miscarriage - being pregnant is a demanding enough task as it is and if you're breathing through tiny straw, trying to get oxygen to mother and baby that can be very very tricky.\"Prof Nouraei developed a technique during the Covid-19 pandemic to perform awake endoscopies to give patients like Natalie steroid injections. The method involves patients being coached through a variety of breathing techniques while a camera is inserted through their nose and into the throat. He then injects a steroid from the outside.Prof Nouraei said: \"The way that we are now doing it, is to do laser surgery through the mouth to do an extensive removal of the diseased tissue and then bring the patient back in and manage the scarring with steroids that dampen down the scaring.\"Prof Nouraei gives patients steroid injections to slow down the growth of scar tissueHe said the method avoided the risks of general anaesthesia and the subsequent recovery, meaning \"you can treat these conditions more often\".Prof Nouraei added: \"Of course it is cheaper, but it definitely is not a cost-cutting exercise because it means you can do more.\"We are not infinite resources so if we are able to be here doing 20 operations as opposed to doing five under general anaesthesia, that means we are better able to deal with the increased demand.\"More on this story ",

    "body": "'A long road ahead': Venezuelans react to Maduro's arrest with hope and worry9 hours agoGrace Eliza Goodwin,Cristobal VasquezandTom Bateman,US State Department correspondentReutersAs the dust settles in Caracas, Venezuelans are reacting to the news of President Nicolás Maduro's capture by the US with hope, fear, and uncertainty. People began to emerge in the streets Saturday after a night rocked by explosions in the Caracas Valley, with moods that ranged from celebration to condemnation.  Dina, a local resident, told the BBC that for now, she was grateful to the US for \"taking Maduro out of here\" because she \"at least can see some light at the end of the tunnel again\". But the political climate remains tense, part of why she did not give the BBC her real name. Jorge, another Venezuelan who lives near Caracas, told the BBC that while he's grateful to be \"well-supported by Trump and the entire United States\", he fears the coming days will not be easy. \"Now that they are taking this man away, what's going to happen?\" he said. \"It doesn't guarantee us anything. So there is a bit of uncertainty. We don't know what the coming days will bring.\"Supporters of Maduro's government have also been rallying in the streets of Caracas, demanding the US release their leader. Caracas Mayor Carmen Meléndez, a firm government loyalist, joined in the rally to protest against what she called Maduro's \"kidnapping\". Early on Saturday, US forces under President Donald Trump carried out a series of targeted attacks in Venezuela's capital, ultimately taking the country's leader into US custody. The US accuses Maduro of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime, a claim he denies. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election. Maduro - who leads the United Socialist Party and has been in power since 2013 - has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence.As Maduro and his wife are extradited to New York City to face drug trafficking and weapons charges, the future of Venezuela remains unclear. Trump has said the US will run the country - and manage its oil reserves - until a permanent replacement for Maduro can be established. Maduro has previously rejected US claims he has direct involvement in drug trafficking.But even for those who are grateful to see Maduro gone, there's still a lot of fear and uncertainty, several Venezuelans told the BBC.Dina isn't putting much faith in Trump. \"He says something now and tomorrow he changes his mind,\" Dina said. \"I mean, I'm not used to taking his words seriously.\"The \"only thing that was good\" about what Trump has said since Maduro's capture, Dina said, was that the US will be investing in Venezuela, which she hopes will lead to \"a better economic situation\" for the struggling country. Venezuela VP: Maduro is 'the only president'The danger of speaking out against Maduro is still very real within Venezuela, as the National Assembly - which is dominated by Maduro loyalists - passed a law a few weeks ago declaring anyone who expresses support for US naval blockades a \"traitor\".Jorge said he saw motorcyclists from colectivos - pro-government paramilitary groups in Venezuela - roaming the streets with weapons on Friday. \"It makes you a bit afraid to even go out to buy bread right now,\" he said. \"We'll have to wait for the best and have patience.\"Jorge added that he was worried about the influence of Maduro's ally, Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela's Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace.\"He is a very bad person, very spiteful,\" Jorge said. \"I don't know how many people he has on his side. Hopefully, the army stands with the people and he loses some control.\"Sandra echoed Jorge and Dina's relief at Maduro's ousting. But, she too is sceptical about the future and what it means for Venezuelans in exile. Close to eight million Venezuelans have left Venezuela since Maduro came to power - and many of them have been openly celebrating Maduro's capture in the streets of the cities where they have settled.In addition to the millions in exile, others are \"missing, imprisoned, dead, or merely surviving\" - which is \"a true tragedy that had not been addressed by any country\", Sandra said. \"This is only the beginning. We know there is still a long road ahead,\" Sandra added. \"No country had previously heard the cry of Venezuelans in the face of this tragedy\". Additional reporting by Kristina Volk",

    "body": "Starmer regrets welcoming British-Egyptian activist to UK after 'abhorrent' posts came to light13 minutes agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has told the BBC he regrets welcoming British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah to the UK, following the emergence of old social media posts which included calls to kill Zionists.Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Sir Keir again called the posts \"abhorrent\" and said he \"should have been made aware and I wasn't\".The Conservatives, Reform UK, and some senior Labour MPs have called for Mr Abd El Fattah to be stripped of his British citizenship as a result of the posts.The prime minister has launched a review into what he called a \"failing in the system\".The UK has long lobbied for Mr Abd El Fattah to come to the UK under both Conservative and Labour governments, but politicians at the top of successive administrations appear to have been left in the dark about his social media history. On Boxing Day, Sir Keir said he was \"delighted\" the activist had arrived in the UK and had been \"reunited with his loved ones\" following his release from an Egyptian jail.Speaking to the programme, Sir Keir said \"of course I regret that\", stressing that Mr Abd El Fattah's posts had been \"abhorrent\".He said: \"As I've made clear, I didn't know about those comments at the time of welcoming El Fattah to this country.\"Pressed by Ms Kuenssberg on why nobody in government appeared to have \"bothered to check\" Mr Abd El Fattah's background, the prime minister said he had asked the same question of the team involved \"because I do think I should have been made aware and I wasn't made aware\".He added: \"Yes, it's a failing within the system, it shouldn't have happened and I wasn't very pleased about it when I found out, hence we're taking remedial action.\"The prime minister also explained that Mr Abd El Fattah's case had been treated as a \"consular case\" by embassy officials because the government had a duty to step in where a British national was \"being treated in an improper way in another country\".\"That's why I acted in this case,\" he said, adding: \"Actually, previous prime ministers acted in exactly the same way in the actions they took to try and get him released, because that's what happens in consular cases.\"Mr Abd El Fattah had been the most prominent of Egypt's political prisoners, with human rights groups saying he had been unfairly detained for 12 years, with his latest conviction being for sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country.The 44-year-old is a dual national, who was granted UK citizenship in December 2021 through his London-born mother - when the Conservatives were in power and Dame Priti Patel was home secretary.His release from prison followed a long campaign by his family - backed by celebrities such as actors Judi Dench and Olivia Colman - and lobbying by the British government.Mr Abd El Fattah flew to the UK to be reunited with his 14-year old son in Brighton on Boxing Day, but social media posts originally made in 2012 quickly resurfaced.In one, Mr Abd El Fattah appears to say he considers \"killing any colonialists and specially Zionists heroic, we need to kill more of them\". Another appears to say, \"I am a racist, I don't like white people\", and in another he is accused of saying police do not have rights and \"we should kill them all\".The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the case was of \"profound concern\" and demonstrates an \"astonishing lack of due diligence by the authorities\".Adrian Cohen, the board's senior vice-president, said: \"His previous extremist and violent rhetoric aimed at 'Zionists' and white people in general is threatening to British Jews and the wider public.\"Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said Mr Abd El Fattah's social media showed he had \"extremist views that are completely incompatible with British values\" and he should \"be made to live in Egypt or frankly anywhere else in the world\".Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said previous Conservative and Labour governments had \"opened our doors to evil people\", adding that he would change the law to strip Mr Abd El Fattah of his British citizenship and have him deported.Mr Abd El Fattah has \"unequivocally\" apologised for the tweets, saying the comments were \"expressions of a young man's anger\".However, within hours of his apology, BBC News established that his Facebook account had liked another user's post which described criticism of him as a \"relentless smear campaign\" being waged by \"the richest man in the world, a couple of Middle East intelligence services, and a few Zionist organisations\".Stripping a person of their British citizenship has typically only been done in cases linked to terrorism or serious organised crime where someone is deemed a national security threat.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle final (10:20-11:40) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (13:30-14:50 - rearranged from Tuesday because of weather)British teenager Mia Brookes was a potential medal hope in this event but she is not in the final after finishing 16th in qualification. Reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand topped qualification, ahead of Japan's Kokomo Murase.The rest of the field were well behind the pair. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lazio fans made their feelings about VAR clear during matches in JanuaryByFootball issues correspondent\"I believe we forgot the reason why VAR was introduced,\" Uefa referees' chief Roberto Rosetti said last week.His choice of words was important. This was not a criticism of the Premier League. It was aimed across Europe. And it was about the rise of \"microscopic\" video assistant referee interventions.In England the media coverage of refereeing is savage. Any perceived mistake is pounced upon. Social media is full of people saying VAR works fine elsewhere, that the standard of refereeing is better in other top divisions.In the Premier League, are we largely cocooned from much of the controversy in the other top European leagues? BBC Sport spoke to people across the leagues to find out.Bundesliga - 'like horse racing with donkeys'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, There have been regular and visible anti-VAR messages at games in Germany, as shown by the major protest by Augsburg fans at the weekendBundesliga fans have been relentlessly against VAR from day one. Many terraces have 'Videobeweis abschaffen' (Eliminate VAR) banners held up in the ultras section for the duration of each review.For all the controversy of VAR in the Premier League, it is rare to see this type of big public display. Chants yes, but not banners. In Germany it is different. Take Augsburg fans before their fixture against Heidenheim on Sunday. Behind the goal there was a sea of messages against VAR.\"Football with VAR is like horse racing with donkeys,\" read one banner, following a penalty they had conceded against Mainz which VAR did not cancel. BBC Sport has been provided with the most up to date official data from the German top flight. It showed that the rate of interventions is higher in Germany, but the frequency of mistakes virtually identical. That is one every 16 games in England, and 15.66 in Germany.The numbers are collated internally, with only the Premier League having an independent body to judge performance. VAR swamps the media coverage in Germany too, with the nation's football association (DFB) trying several tactics.Only last weekend the head of referees, Knut Kircher, sat in the TV studio throughout Saturday's matches to try to offer perspective. It was the equivalent of Howard Webb, referees' boss at Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO), appearing on Final Score. The DFB felt it was positive but Munich-based newspaper Suddeutsche wrote that Kircher should \"focus on improving referee performance\".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Supporters of VfB Stuttgart hold up a sign which reads 'Eliminate VAR' during a VAR review\"VAR has caused a lot of unrest here,\" NTV journalist Stephan Uersfeld told BBC Sport.\"It continues to be what we call 'Schuldverschiebung' - passing on the blame - to the VAR instead of the on-field decisions.  \"While it brings some fairness to the game, it has become a bureaucrat's dream.\"The Bundesliga introduced semi-automated offside this season but its microscopic decisions and unreliability have only increased the controversy. In January, broadcaster ZDF polled coaches, external in the top two divisions. Of the 27 respondents, 16 said they were unsatisfied by VAR.Another survey carried out by NTV, external found that 80% of coaches felt VAR delays were excessively long.  The opinion was that VAR has not improved.If Premier League fans thought VAR had a better reputation in Germany, that clearly is not the case.La Liga - 'Technology feels distant from emotion of sport'In Spain you won't see any great public displays of dissatisfaction in the stands. The league has plenty of other problems with officiating.Last summer, the Spanish FA replaced its entire refereeing committee and became the first major league to separate the roles completely. A team of 15 dedicated VARs work only as a video assistant. Yet it didn't take long for the first error to happen, and again the semi-automated technology was at fault. It failed to identify a goalscorer was offside, the officials did not realise and the goal counted. The VAR team was stood down from its next appointments.  Specialist VARs have long since been suggested as the big fix. But BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague says it has made no difference.\"There is no agreement of what VAR should do or how referees should act,\" Balague said. \"The suggestion was to use VAR less. Less than what? \"Why less if it is necessary? But when is it necessary?\"It is the question that nobody appears able to answer, in any league.Real Madrid's TV channel produces videos criticising referees on a weekly basis.At the weekend, Barcelona issued a statement, external highlighting \"repeated refereeing decisions it considers damaging to the game\".It followed an incredible eight-minute VAR review to disallow a goal for offside against Atletico Madrid. Again, the semi-automated technology was faulty.Marca analysed, external incidents covered in the league's version of 'Match Officials Mic'd Up'.It found 10 errors in the first 18 rounds of games - higher than the Bundesliga or the Premier League. The paper said that there would further errors not covered by the programme. \"The feeling is that VAR has complicated the game, instead of purifying it,\" Balague added. \"What was meant to simplify decisions, scientific, transparent, logical has instead made them more obscure, interpretative, anything but clear.\"Supporters in Spain often leave stadiums not just disagreeing with decisions, but also confused by them. \"The technology feels distant from the emotion of the sport.\"Does that sound familiar?Serie A - 'Many would prefer more intervention'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lazio fans have been on the end of a series of decisions leading to fan protests throughout JanuarySerie A is in a unique position. Players, coaches and the media complain just as fiercely as their Premier League counterparts.Davide Chinellato, the UK correspondent for La Gazzetta dello Sport, says there is one subtle difference. Serie A not only wants VAR, it \"would prefer more intervention rather than less\".\"Unlike in England, the average Italian fan cannot imagine modern football without it,\" Chinellato told BBC Sport.The league is backing reviewing corners and second yellow cards, which is set to be approved by the International Football Association Board on 28 February. \"What is changing is the level of frustration,\" Chinellato said. \"The expectation in Italy is that every clear mistake should be corrected. \"When that does not happen, the reaction is not to question VAR itself, but to question the rules governing its use.\"Take Lazio supporters last month after the club suffered from a couple of errors.\"Transparency on VAR, audio justifications without logic or sense,\" a banner read. \"They invent everything to ruin old-fashioned football.\"There are similar opinions from players. Veteran Napoli defender Juan Jesus hit out at current VAR standards., externalHe said: \"There's nothing but controversy. It becomes hard for everyone to remain passionate about football.\"Italy might like VAR, but difficult and technical decisions are problematic.\"Fans and media are increasingly impatient with what they see as excessive complexity,\" Chinellato added. \"They want broader, clearer, more straightforward guidelines.\"A system that aligns more closely with the basic expectation that obvious mistakes should be corrected.\"No one has been able to define an obvious error.Ligue 1 - 'There are mistakes every weekend'In France, the story is different.Ligue 1 has the highest intervention rate, pretty much every other game.Across the first 198 matches there were 83 VAR interventions. The referee has stuck with his decision nine times, far more than any other league. France suffers more errors, 17. That is one every 11.65 games compared to 16 in England.There is frustration for supporters, but most of the noise comes from the boardroom. It is compounded by the collapse of TV rights. It means budgets have been squeezed. \"The referee system, including VAR, is costing 25m euros by season,\" L'Equipe journalist Pierre-Etienne Minonzio told BBC Sport.\"So in a time when all the clubs need money, they think it's too expensive.\"Luc Hagege, who writes about refereeing for L'Equipe, says there is a \"misunderstanding between the objective of VAR and the perception of some players, coaches, but mostly presidents\". One of the most outspoken critics has been Lille president Olivier Letang, who says there is a \"a breakdown of trust\" with referees.\"The perception is that coaches feel a kind of arrogance from referees,\" Hagege added. \"Most people, and especially the directors, feel that a gap is growing.\"Many other figures within clubs have been critical.Lyon captain Corentin Tolisso said in November: \"There are mistakes every weekend. We're paying a very high price for the level of refereeing.\"Hagege said errors are magnified by the clubs and the media.\"We speak much more of the mistakes than of all the things that have been corrected,\" he added.\"A few even said that they are fed up with the VAR, we should withdraw it.\"Perhaps there is one factor which binds all five leagues.As Rosetti said, fans and pundits asking \"where is VAR?\" It appears to have created a gradual creep into more areas of the game. It will be hard to stop.",

    "body": "55 minutes agoJoe PikePolitical correspondentGetty ImagesMinisters are considering slowing down plans to pay adults of all ages the same minimum wage.Labour committed in their election manifesto to remove \"discretionary age bands\" and increase the wages of 18 to 20-year-olds so they are paid the same as those over 21.But government sources have confirmed ministers are interested in delaying that rise, though are unlikely to reverse the commitment entirely.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, UK government's Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said it remained government policy to equalise minimum wage.On Tuesday, it was confirmed unemployment had risen to a near five-year high, with the jobless rate among young people at its worst level for more than a decade.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of unemployment rose to 5.2% in the three months to December, up from 5.1% in the three months to November.Under existing rules, people aged over 21 must be paid £12.21 an hour, with a lower rate of £10 in place for 18 to 20-year-olds.Some business figures have argued that moves to push up minimum wage rates by the government have increased costs and deterred hiring. The Times newspaper first reported that minister were weighing up whether to drop the pledge.",

    "body": "12 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykUS Department of Justice/PAEpstein took dozens more flights to the UK than were previously knownEssex Police has said it is assessing information about private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the Epstein files.The BBC understands that while the police is \"assessing\" the information, it would not necessarily lead to a full investigation.Last year a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to the convicted sex offender had arrived at or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the New Statesman last week that police \"urgently\" need to re-examine whether Jeffrey Epstein's victims were trafficked within and outside of the UK.An Essex Police spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\"In December, BBC News discovered that three British women who were allegedly trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK alongside other documents related to the convicted sex offender.US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims told the BBC it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a \"full-scale\" investigation into his activities in the UK.The former PM wrote to the chief police constables and commissioner of the Met, Essex and Thames Valley Police.He added that Stansted, located around 40 miles away from central London, was one of the airports \"where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\".Stansted Airport said in a statement: \"All private aircraft at London Stansted operate through independent Fixed Base Operators, which handle all aspects of private and corporate aviation in line with regulatory requirements.\"The airport said that these terminals are \"entirely independent\" and that \"no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal\". Immigration and customs checks for passengers arriving via private jets are carried out \"directly by Border Force\", it said, adding that it does not \"manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft\".The Essex Police statement comes as a new national group has been set up to support UK forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has said.The force previously said it has held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein during his time as the UK's trade envoy.The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.He was dismissed from his role as ambassador in September, after Downing Street said new information had emerged about the depth of this relationship with Epstein.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "7 hours agoPolice accessing Stansted Airport private flights over Epstein ties leads a number of Wednesday's papers. \"Flight logs and emails for Epstein's 'Lolita Express' are being accessed\", the i Paper reports, after allegations women were flown in and out of England. Meanwhile, MPs are weighing up whether to open \"an investigation into Andrew's work as UK trade envoy\", the paper says. The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.The Sun reports on Mountbatten-Windsor being faced overnight with \"a criminal probe into sex trafficking claims\". It claims there are at least seven UK police forces on the Epstein case. The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Similarly, the Daily Mail covers the \"pressure piling on Andrew\" with claims of a \"fourth police force probe\" into Epstein ties. The Guardian features US civil rights leader Jesse Jackson who died aged 84 on Tuesday morning. The paper remembers the leading Democrat with a quote from Barack Obama saying \"We stood on his shoulders\". Meanwhile, the paper reports that one in nine new homes in England built between 2022 and 2024 could now be at risk of flooding. The Financial Times remembers Jesse Jackson as the leader whose advocacy spanned the death of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 to the election of Barack Obama in 2008 - featuring an image of the late US civil rights leader taking part in a rally in Washington in 1992. The paper also reports that the UK government has pulled the plug on a \"programme to build frictionless post-Brexit trade border\" after the end of a contract with Deloitte and IBM. The Daily Express leads with unemployment figures hitting 5.2%, and points the finger at Labour's job taxes, which it calls the \"silent killer of inspiration\". The paper reports that one Tory claims \"millions are crying out for the reward of hard work\". The Daily Star leads with Gordon Ramsay's reflections on his tough childhood that he says \"made me a better dad\". Elsewhere on the page, Jesse Jackson is remembered and the countdown for the Cheltenham races begins. A \"Putin Critic\" who says he \"checks his door handle every day\" in fear of nerve agent assassinations is the subject of the exclusive lead story in the Metro. The Russian national and journalist, Roman Dobrokhotov, 42, was \"named as a target at the trial of a Putin spy ring in Britain\" and claims to be \"on Putin's kill list\", the paper reports. The Daily Mirror calls Nigel Farage's new team, which he unveiled yesterday, \"no laughing matter\". The Reform UK leader's new cabinet is \"full of Tories\", the paper says, and whom Labour chair Anna Turley says \"failed Britain before\" and would \"do they same again\". Rachel Reeves is reportedly rejecting requests \"from military chiefs to spend billions more on defence\", the Daily Telegraph says. It reports a £28bn shortfall as being flagged by the Ministry of Defence. Meanwhile, Dame Prue Leith takes the lead image in a outfit made out of \"leaves and stems from the King's private estate\" for the opening night of London Fashion Week. Labour considering dropping their youth wage pledge after \"suggestions the policy is fuelling record youth unemployment\" is the focus of the Times. Business groups say ministers are \"pricing a generation of young people out of the workplace\". The front of the paper also has Dame Prue Leith posing in her London Fashion Week outfit on its front page.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "58 minutes agoChris GrahamBBC NewsGetty ImagesThe talks between Russia and Ukraine in Switzerland are being mediated by Steve Witkoff.US special envoy Steve Witkoff said talks between Ukraine and Russia had \"brought about meaningful progress\" to end the war, as both sides prepared for a second day of negotiations in Geneva on Wednesday.However, hopes of a breakthrough remain low, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying it \"was not fair\" that US President Donald Trump keeps asking his country to compromise, adding that \"peace wouldn't be achieved if victory is handed to Russia\".US President Donald Trump has recently suggested it is up to Ukraine to ensure talks in Switzerland are successful, without mentioning Russia. The Kremlin has not wavered from its maximalist demands for Ukrainian territory.\"President Trump's success in bringing both sides of this war together has brought about meaningful progress, and we are proud to work under his leadership to stop the killing in this terrible conflict,\" Witkoff wrote on X after the first day of talks.Zelensky has repeatedly said his country is being asked to make disproportionate compromises compared to Russia.Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including large parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over the rest of the region, which Ukraine has ruled out.Ukraine says robust security guarantees from the West - including the US - must come before any settlement with Russia can be agreed.Zelensky told the Axios website on Tuesday it was \"not fair\" that Trump kept calling on Ukraine to broker a deal, adding: \"I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision.\"In a statement on social media on Tuesday evening, top Ukrainian negotiator Umerov said the first day of talks focused on \"practical issues and the mechanics of possible solutions\". In a video address shortly afterwards, Zelensky said Ukraine was ready to refrain from carrying out strikes, as proposed by the US to both Kyiv and Moscow.\"We don't need war,\" he said, stressing that Ukrainians were \"defending our state, our independence\".\"We are also ready to quickly move towards a worthy agreement to end the war. The question is only for the Russians: What do they want?\"The talks are the third round of trilateral negotiations. Russia's state news agency RIA quoted a source saying that Tuesday's negotiations, which lasted six hours, had been tense and took place in different bilateral and trilateral formats.The talks are being mediated by Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the US president's son-in-law.On the Russian side, President Vladimir Putin's aide Vladimir Medinsky is the top negotiator.The negotiations are being held a week before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The Russian defence ministry said 43 Ukrainian drones were shot down over several Russian regions and Crimea overnight into Wednesday.Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 126 attack drones at Ukraine overnight, adding preliminary data suggested 100 had been shot down before they reached their target.More on this story",

Two other skiers who where part of the group in La Grave, a German and an Australian, escaped without injury.On Tuesday, the French weather service marked the avalanche risk in the La Greve area as \"high\" or four on a five-point scale due to fresh snow and wind.At the Valloire resort, the risk was categorised at the maximum of five.Local authorities have launched investigations to determine the cause of death in both avalanches.Following the deaths of the two British nationals on Friday, a spokesperson for the Foreign Office told the BBC they were \"in contact with the local authorities and stand ready to offer consular assistance\".There have been a number of fatal avalanches in the French Alps since the start of the year, including six deaths in one weekend in January.",

    "body": "1 hour agoKelly NgGetty ImagesAustralia has barred a citizen linked to the Islamic State (IS) group from the country for up to two years.The person is among the group of 34 Australian women and children who tried to head home after being released from a Syrian camp earlier this week, only to be turned back by Syrian authorities for \"technical reasons\".The ban was issued \"on advice from security agencies\", Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said on Wednesday, adding that the other 33 people do not meet \"required legal thresholds\" to be banned.Canberra has refused to repatriate the group, believed to be made up of the wives, widows and children of IS fighters. There are 23 children among them.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stressed that these families will not receive government support to come back to the country.\"You make your bed, you lie in it,\" he told a press conference on Wednesday.\"These are people who chose to go overseas to align themselves with... a brutal, reactionary ideology that seeks to undermine and destroy our way of life.\"However legal experts have warned the government has an obligation to allow citizens the right of return, and, responding to reports the group had valid Australian passports, Albanese said his government would not \"breach Australian law\".This group in the al-Roj camp in northern Syria is among dozens of Australians who have been held in camps and prisons across the country since 2019, when IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria.Opposition politicians have raised security concerns about the possibility of these Australians' return. \"How can only one member of this group be deemed a risk and the rest somehow okay?\" Liberal Party Senator Jonno Duniam said on Tuesday, offering to help amend laws to bar more of the group.The al-Roj camp is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities, mainly women and children. Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.Speaking to ABC, the camp's director Hakmiyeh Ibrahim made an appeal to all countries that have citizens held in limbo there: \"Take your citizens, take these children and women\".The children especially are growing up surrounded by \"dangerous ideas and ideologies\" in the camp, she said. \"The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.\"Several of these camps have made headlines as the women and children living in them are severely malnourished and lack access to basic resources.Several other foreign governments - including France, the Netherlands, and the UK - have also refused to repatriate most of their citizens still held in Syria.",

    "body": "As that rain shifts northwards into Wales and the west Midlands during the late afternoon and evening, some of it will turn to snow, especially over the hills.Several centimetres of snow are expected to accumulate over high ground, above around 150-200m elevation, with the possibility of up to 15cm over the highest ground of mid and south-east Wales, as well as Herefordshire and Shropshire.At low levels a mix of rain and sleet is more likely, with the possibility of a little wet snow at times.This wet and wintry mix could mean difficult travelling conditions for some during Wednesday evening and overnight, as well as possible power cuts.Some snow could also start to affect the Peak District, Pennines and possibly south-west Scotland during the night.There remains some uncertainty in the forecast so it will be worth keeping up to date with the hour-by-hour details on the BBC Weather website and app.Low temperatures will remain part of the story, with the UKHSA cold alert, external covering all of England except for London and the South East.  This warns of the risk of minor impacts on health and social care services. Vulnerable people in particular may be affected by this spell of colder weather, with more use of healthcare services and an increased risk to life.However, significantly milder weather is expected by the weekend.",

    "body": "9 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesIllegal skin lightening products are being sold in butchers and specialist food shops across the UK as well as online, a watchdog has warned.The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) said the dangerous and illicit products are appearing in an increasingly wide range of places.It has told the public to avoid the creams and report shops that continue to sell them.\"As a black woman and a long-standing advocate for equality, diversity and inclusion, I want to be absolutely clear: the sale of illegal skin lightening products is not only dangerous, it is unlawful,\" Tendy Lindsay, a CTSI member and former chair, said.The CTSI said many of the products have been banned for containing ingredients such as hydroquinone, mercury, and powerful corticosteroids.The ingredients are illegal because they increase the risk of skin damage, infections, and pregnancy-related complications.The standards body said users are driven toward skin lightening by \"complex social and personal factors\", including colourism, a type of discrimination which favours lighter skin shades.The BBC this month reported on the dangers posed by illegal skin lightening products and their prevalence.Speaking to Morning Live, Daniel Murrell-Williamson from Essex, said he spent two months as a 17-year-old using a cream he did not know contained toxic and illegal ingredients.Hoping to cover dark patches on his skin that had been caused by acne, Daniel relied on an unmarked product given to him by a friend.\"I definitely saw a difference in my skin complexion and felt like I needed to keep up with it, because if I stopped, I would revert back to my original skin complexion,\" he said.Daniel added that eventually, he was using the bleaching product all over his body on a daily basis.The product he was using was illegal because it contained hydroquinone, which can weaken the skin, increasing the risk of cancer - as well as causing liver and kidney damage.Arlene Dihoulou said she was unaware of the dangers posed by skin lightening creams but had done so after experiencing colourism and racism related to her skin tone as a child.A cosmetics retailer in Peckham, London, was fined £30,000 in November after being caught selling illegal skin lightening products for a second time. Across the borough of Southwark alone, 62 companies or individuals have been prosecuted for selling skin lighteners since 2002. Southwark Trading StandardsA butcher in Southwark sold illegal skin whitening products, seen here on the top shelfAs part of its warning, the CTSI said consumers should: Never use skin lightening products on childrenNever buy them from unverified sellers or social media accounts and avoid buying cosmetics from online marketplacesAlways speak to a doctor or dermatologist before using any product intended to alter skin toneLindsay said she was \"deeply concerned\" about the social factors fuelling demand for skin lightening products, warning that \"colourism and harmful beauty standards can create vulnerability\".And she warned those supplying the products, some of whom do not know they are illegal, that \"a lack of awareness is not a defence\".Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoCatherine SnowdonHealth reporterBBCMore than 22,000 Covid vaccine-harm claims have been made - most relating to the AstraZeneca jabNearly £50m of taxpayers' money has been paid by the NHS to an outsourced firm assessing claims of medical harm caused by vaccines, the BBC has found.The figure is eight times the amount originally estimated for the assessment work carried out by Crawford & Company Adjusters - and almost £20m more than the total so far awarded to those injured or bereaved as a result of Covid vaccines.The firm's five-year contract, initially estimated to be worth £6m, has more than a year left to run - however a new company will start taking over the work in the coming months.The cost of the work by Crawford, and \"level of contract spend\", is because the volume of claims \"has exceeded the anticipated levels\", an NHS spokesperson told the BBC. More than 22,000 claims related to Covid vaccines have been made so far, most of them relating to the jab manufactured by AstraZeneca - but only about 1% have resulted in compensation payouts. They are handled by the UK-wide Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS), for which Crawford has carried out medical assessments since March 2022.One law professor told the BBC that \"the nature of the [Crawford] contract was peculiar\", and that because of the \"significant uncertainty\" at the time it was drawn up, they would have expected to see a shorter one that had a cap on the number of claims processed.Responding to questions as to why costs were allowed to spiral for so long, an NHS spokesperson said the length of time it takes public sector organisations to procure contracts \"can vary\", and the nature of the contract was \"complex\".Crawford - whose parent company is based in the US - was approached for comment, but the firm referred the BBC to the NHS.A surge in claimsThe money paid to Crawford for providing medical assessments is separate from the money awarded to people who have suffered as a result of vaccine damage.Created in 1979, the VDPS currently offers a one-off tax-free payment of £120,000 if it is medically proven that, on the balance of probability, a vaccine has caused severe disabilities.The benefits of vaccination are well documented. The AstraZeneca Covid jab is credited with saving millions of lives. And yet for those who were harmed by the jab, the resulting injuries are devastating.There have been more than three times the number of claims under the VDPS for Covid jabs than during the previous four decades for all the eligible vaccines combined.Despite the increase, the number of successful claims has been small. As of mid-November last year, 249 people had received payouts for harm caused by Covid vaccinations.The payments totalled £29.8m, funded by the UK government and paid separately from the Crawford contract.Spiralling costsMonthly NHS payments to Crawford escalated soon after it began the assessment work for the VDPS, BBC analysis shows.The NHS appears to have begun scrutinising the agreement with the provider as costs spiralled because of the number of claims.The estimated value of Crawford's original five-year contract was £6m - however this figure was reached 14 months in, in May 2023. The new contract with a different provider was only announced on 5 January this year.The original contract between the NHS and Crawford is publicly available, but has been heavily redactedMoves to look for a new provider started in September 2023, but in the interim, spending continued to rise. Eighteen months later, Crawford was paid £5.9m for a single month - almost the same as the entire contract's initial estimated value, the BBC has discovered.Given the uncertainties around the potential number of claims, an expert has questioned why the NHS didn't choose a contract that would have allowed it to \"review the situation\" once more reliable data was available.\"Using firm contracts in uncertain situations carries significant commercial risks,\" says Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor at the University of Bristol Law School who has been researching NHS contracts for more than 15 years.When asked by the BBC about the formulation of the deal and whether mistakes had been made, an NHS spokesperson said there were \"several factors which influence a procurement strategy and construct of the contract\", without elaborating further.A new providerResponsibility for carrying out the medical assessment work is being taken over by Maximus UK Services Limited - another provider whose parent company is based in the US. The exact date when it will start is yet to be confirmed.The new contract is set to run for five years and is estimated at £27m, far more than the value of the contract awarded to Crawford in 2021, but still significantly less than the amount paid to it over the course of its agreement.Of the new contract, the NHS spokesperson said its value had been calculated based on the rate of new claims received - and could \"be flexed\" if that changes.Potential reforms to the VDPS are currently being reviewed by Health Secretary Wes Streeting.Its workings were considered as part of the Covid inquiry, and will be addressed in a report due to be published on 16 April.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoBernd Debusmann JrWhite House reporter Getty ImagesAndrew Ramirez (right) was captured by Yugoslav forces near the Macedonian border alongside Christopher Stone and Steven Gonzales in March 1999. It was May 1999, and US Army sergeant Andrew Ramirez had been held captive for over a month by Yugoslav forces, enduring days of dark confinement and interrogations. Just a few weeks earlier, Ramirez and two other soldiers had been on a routine patrol near the Macedonian-Yugoslav border during the war in nearby Kosovo when they unexpectedly bumped into enemy forces and surrendered after a brief firefight. From captivity, Ramirez had little idea that a behind-the-scenes effort was underway to secure the release of the three US prisoners, he told the BBC in an interview. Leading that effort - against the wishes of the White House - was Reverend Jesse Jackson, who died aged 84 on Tuesday.At the time of Ramirez's capture, Nato forces, led by the US, were just days into a massive air campaign aimed at forcing the Yugoslav government of then Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw from Kosovo. Jackson, then 57, already had a history of what some termed \"private diplomacy\" aimed at helping Americans abroad. This included the 1984 release of a US Navy pilot captured by Syrian forces after being downed in Lebanon, the release of 22 Americans held prisoner in Cuba and the release of US citizens held by the Iraqi government in the build-up to the first Gulf War. But in early 1999, the Clinton administration was against the idea of Jackson's involvement, quietly warning him that the bombs would continue falling even if he went ahead. At the same time, the Yugoslav government was making overtures to Illinois Representative - and later Governor - Rod Blagojevich, then the only Serbian-American in Congress. \"The state department wouldn't allow me to go. I was just a junior congressman,\"  Blagojevich recalled to the BBC in an interview. But at the suggestion of political consultant David Axelrod, later a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama, Blagojevich teamed up with Jackson, first reaching out through his son Jesse Jr. \"Jackson refused to come unless he got access to see our soldiers. What I was able to do was get a guarantee from the government there,\" Blagojevich said. \"We were warned not to go because it was dangerous.\" In late April, Jackson, along with Blagojevich and a multi-faith delegation, flew to Belgrade, meeting directly with Milosovic himself in the hope of brokering a release.\"I had to convince him of what his options were,\" Jackson later told the Associated Press. \"One of the failures of war is a failure of diplomacy, communication and trust.\" Ramirez and the other two soldiers, Sergeant Christopher Stone and Specialist Steven Gonzales, did not know this was taking place. \"Without any explanation [the Yugoslavs] came and got us. They walked us out, handcuffed and everything, to a room. I saw CNN cameras and some other news agencies,\" Ramirez said. \"And there was Reverend Jesse Jackson,\" he added. \"We had no knowledge, and no idea what was going on. I later joked to him that I thought the place was crazy - they even got Reverend Jackson captive!\"Behind the scenes, negotiations were still tense. \"It was a frenetic three of four days,\" Blagojevich added.  \"Milosovic originally offered to let him take one or two of the soldiers back. Jackson was steadfast. He said we're not going to just take one or two. We take either all of them or none of them.\"\"Jesse Jackson was the central figure,\" the former Illinois representative added.\"I was basically just a guy carrying his bags.\" Watch: Jesse Jackson's life in civil rights, diplomacy, and politicsThe Yugoslavs relented. The soldiers were released on 1 May and crossed into Croatia with Jackson and his delegation on 2 May before being flown to a US base in Germany.\"[Jackson] was very confident,\" Ramirez remembers of their initial encounters. \"He said he wouldn't leave without us, and that our families in the United States were rooting for us. He wanted to make sure we knew he was going home with us.\" Ramirez left the Army about a year after the release, moving back to his native California. He kept in touch with Jackson, flying out to Chicago to introduce him to his newborn son and occasionally seeing him at events around the country. He was \"heartbroken\" to hear that the man who secured his released has died.\"He did something for us. He didn't have to do that,\" Ramirez added. \"I truly believe he did it because he saw somebody in need and thought he could intervene. He did it for us and for our families. We're forever appreciative of him.\"",

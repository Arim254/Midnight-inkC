    "body": "Two amber health alerts issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for parts of the country have come into effect.The alerts, which warn of a rise in deaths particularly among elderly and vulnerable people, cover the North East and North West of England until 12:00 on 5 January. Temperatures in these regions are expected to fall to around -4C, with snow predicted in the North West on 3 and 4 January. The low temperatures are likely to affect health and care services, the agency added.BBC weather forecaster Ben Rich has said New Year's Eve is expected to stay largely dry for parts of the country, while wintry showers and colder conditions are predicted for New Year's Day and beyond.Temperatures of 4 to 9C are forecast for Monday with one or two showers predicted overnight. Glasgow is expected to drop to -2C, the forecaster said.Other consequences of very cold weather include temperatures inside hospitals and care homes dropping below the levels recommended for assessing health risks, and challenges for people keeping indoor temperatures at the recommended 18C, the UKHSA said.Staffing issues, due to travel delays, may also arise from the cold spell. Between 2 and 11 January, cold northerly winds in Scotland are expected to become dominant across the UK, bringing snow showers mainly to coastal areas that will work south, the Met Office said. Inland locations across central and southern areas will remain mostly dry but cold.On Friday, temperatures in the the North East and North West will feel colder due to the wind chill - a temperature of -4C could feel more like -8C, the Met Office said. The agency also issued less serious yellow cold health alerts for the rest of England, covering the East Midlands, West Midlands, South East, South West, East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and London.Temperatures in areas covered by the yellow warning are expected to fall to around highs of 6C and lows below freezing from New Year's Day.Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said it was \"vital\" to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are vulnerableThe predicted temperatures can have a \"serious impact\" on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions, he warned. Cold health alerts and weather warnings were issued for parts of the UK on Christmas Day, forcing several annual open water swimming events to be cancelled. ",

    "body": "The man who disarmed one of the gunmen who killed 15 people at a Jewish event at Bondi Beach has revealed his thoughts in the moments before his heroic actions.In verified footage, Ahmed al Ahmed - a Sydney shop owner born and raised in Syria - tackled one of the two shooters from behind, wrestling a long-arm gun from him.\"I hold him with my right hand and start saying a word, you know, like to warn him -  'drop your gun, stop doing what you're doing',\" the father-of-two told the BBC's US partner CBS News in an exclusive interview.Mr Ahmed, who was shot several times by the other alleged gunman, said his actions saved \"lots of people... but I feel sorry still for the lost.\"In the interview, Mr Ahmed recalled the moment he tackled Sajid Akram, 50, who was shooting attendees at a Hanukkah event at Bondi Beach on Sunday 14 December. \"My target was just to take the gun from him, and to stop him from killing a human being's life and not killing innocent people.\"Fifteen people died during the attack - Australia's deadliest mass shooting since 1996 - and 40 others were injured. Police have declared the attack a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.Sajid Akram was shot dead by police while his son Naveed, the other alleged gunman who was hospitalised after the attack, has since been charged with 59 offences including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist attack.Mr Ahmed described the inner thoughts running through his head in the lead-up to his actions, which authorities and politicians have said saved countless lives. \"Emotionally, I'm doing something, which is I feel something, a power in my body, my brain,\" Mr Ahmed said. \"I don't want to see people killed in front of me, I don't want to see blood, I don't want to hear his gun, I don't want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help.\"That's my soul asking me to do that.\"In the days after the shooting, Mr Ahmed was presented with a cheque at his hospital bedside for A$2.5m (£1.24m; $1.7m) which had been raised from tens of thousands of community members moved by his actions. He was shot several times in the shoulder after tackling Sajid Akram and required at least three operations.Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Mr Ahmed in hospital, describing him as \"the best of our country\" while New South Wales Premier Chris Minns called him a \"real-life hero\".Earlier, Mr Ahmed's parents told BBC Arabic that their son was \"driven by his sentiment, conscience and humanity\".",

    "body": "A five-year-old boy in Japan has died while on a ski holiday with his family after his arm caught on a travelator.On Sunday morning Hinata Goto was about to step off the travelator at a Hokkaido resort's ski slopes when he fell down and his right arm became trapped in the machinery, Japanese media reported citing police. The travelator was equipped with a safety mechanism, but it failed to activate. The machine only halted when the boy's mother hit the emergency stop button.Rescue workers spent 40 minutes dismantling part of the travelator to free the boy, who by then had fallen unconscious. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.Staff at the Asarigawa Onsen Ski Resort in Otaru said that the travelator's safety mechanism, which was designed to immediately halt operations if it detected that an object was trapped in the machinery, had worked earlier in the day.Police are investigating the incident to assess whether there was any professional negligence, such as in the manufacturing and maintenance of the travelator.Installed about six years ago, the travelator is about 30m (98 ft) long and 60cm (24 in) wide, with no hand rails. It connects the resort's car park to the ski slopes.Japanese media quoted other visitors saying that they have stumbled while using the same travelator. \"Even as an adult, there are times when I think, 'It's a little scary',\" a regular customer told Asahi Shimbun.A representative of Asarigawa Onsen Ski Resort apologised for the incident and said they will take action to prevent a recurrence.Hokkaido is known to be the ski capital of Japan and welcomes millions of visitors every year, with the bulk of them staying during the winter months for ski holidays.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPA MediaThe medieval David I silver coin was discovered in a wooded area near Penicuik, Midlothian, and has now been allocated to National Museums ScotlandThe earliest known coin to be minted in Scotland almost 900 years ago has been acquired for the nation after it was found by a metal detectorist.The medieval David I silver coin, discovered in a wooded area near Penicuik, Midlothian in 2023, has been dated to the second half of the 1130s.As required by law it was reported it to Treasure Trove and allocated to National Museums Scotland (NMS) by the Scottish Archaeological Finds Allocation Panel.The coin was valued at £15,000, which was paid to the finder as a reward by the King's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer.PA MediaA close up of the historic coin which is almost 900 years oldThe NMS said it would be used for research but it is hoped it will go on display in future. King David I of Scotland, who reigned from 1124 until 1153, introduced the country's first coinage.Alice Blackwell, senior curator of medieval archaeology and history, said it was thought all his earliest coins were created in a mint in Carlisle, Cumbria, which he took control of in the 1130s.But she added: \"This coin is really significant because it's the first of that earliest type, the earliest coins to actually have been minted outside of Carlisle.\"It was minted in Edinburgh, so it's the first time that we have Scottish coinage being minted in what was a core part of the Scottish kingdom.\"She said any coins found before the king's reign could be Roman Age, Viking Age or  medieval coinage. David I later lost control of Carlisle.PA MediaThe reverse side of the coinThe coin found in Midlothian has a portrait of the monarch's head on one side and a cross-based design on the other.It also bears an inscription which indicates it was minted in Edinburgh.The discovery will help experts expand their understanding of how and where coins were minted in medieval times.Dr Blackwell said there was virtually no documentary sources that explained how coinage was produced in Scotland.She added: \"The coins themselves are the primary source.\"This is the first time that we can see this very early minting of coinage in Edinburgh.\"The expert added the first Scottish coins were quite rare.She also said the discovery of another had the potential to increase understanding about how the first coinage was produced and how it began to be used in Scotland.Later in the reign of King David I, coins were minted in places including Perth, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Aberdeen, St Andrews, and Roxburgh in the Scottish Borders.As well as introducing Scotland's first coinage his reign included the foundation of royal burghs such as Perth, Dunfermline and Stirling, and the reorganisation of civil institutions.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSenior Labour MPs have called for Sir Keir Starmer to strip Egyptian dissident Alaa Abdel Fattah of his British citizenship, the Times reports. The prime minister's \"failure to conduct background checks\" on Fattah, who was freed from prison in Egypt and welcomed in the UK, has been widely criticised. Historical social media messages emerged of the British-Egyptian activist calling for Zionists to be killed. Ministers in private have called Starmer's intervention \"ridiculous\" and \"shocking\", according to the Times. The Daily Telegraph spotlights the pressure mounting on Sir Keir to revoke the citizenship of the man its headline labels as an \"extremist\". According to the Telegraph, Mr Fattah did not go through \"good character\" checks for his citizenship \"because of a loophole created by the European Convention on Human Rights\". The Tory leader's fury over the prime minister welcoming a \"freed anti-Semitic Egyptian dissident\" takes centre position in the Daily Mail's reporting. Kemi Badenoch declares: \"I do not want people who hate Britain coming to our country\", and calls for Abdel Fattah to be \"booted out\" of the UK.An image of Brigitte Bardot is draped across the top of the Sun's front page with the headline writer deploying the words \"And God created Bardot\" in reference to her iconic 1956 movie And Got Created Woman. The paper leads on its report on the weekend wedding between Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay, daugher of the TV chef Gordon - whose \"father of the bride speech\" is described as \"explosive\" by the Sun, with its reference to a reported ongoing feud in the Peaty family. The Daily Star also makes the same headline tribute to \"screen goddess\" Bardot, who has died aged 91, again referring to the movie role that catapulted the French actress into superstardom. Writer Emily Hall is evocative in her descriptions of the \"Fifties blonde bombshell\" and \"movie sex kitten\".The Daily Mirror remembers the late French actress as \"La Belle Bardot\". An image of the \"screen legend\" with her iconic blonde tousled hair and black eyeliner, while posing in just a towel, takes up the entire front page.A young Bardot also takes up nearly half of the Guardian front page, but its accompanying report highlights that in her later years she turned her back on film stardom and \"embraced animal rights activism\". In its lead story, the US President has said war talks for Ukraine are in their \"final stages, as Trump sat down last night for a meeting in Florida with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In an exclusive with the i Paper, a co-creator of the Novichock nerve agent alleges the Kremlin \"may be developing even deadlier weapons\". The interview comes amid Trump and Zelensky's latest negotiations for a peace deal. The Financial Times names \"Silicon Valley's hottest start-ups\", which have raised a record $150bn to protect themselves from AI investment going bust. The paper says they have built \"fortress balance sheets\" against the chance of an AI investment downturn.The Daily Express runs an exclusive on new care home inspection plans putting \"thousands of residents at risk\". The proposed overhaul could mean services only undergo full checks every 10 years, according to the paper.The front pages of The Daily Mail, The Times and The Daily Telegraph all focus on social media messages sent by the British-Egyptian activist, Alaa Abdel Fattah, described by the government as \"abhorrent\". Writing in The Daily Mail, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, says she \"does not want people who hate Britain coming to our country\" and says the Home Office should consider deporting him. The Times quotes both a minister and a senior Labour MP calling for the activist to be stripped of his British citizenship, with the minister telling the paper serious questions need to be asked about the lack of judgement in allowing him into the UK. Alaa Abdel Fattah has apologised, but says the meaning of some of the posts has been \"twisted\".President Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky meeting in Florida to discuss a Ukraine peace deal features in most of the papers. The i Paper says there was an \"upbeat\" mood. But the Guardian reports that a former Ukrainian diplomat has accused President Putin of trying to \"sabotage things\" by speaking to Trump on the phone ahead of the talks in Mar-a-Lago.And the face of Brigitte Bardot features on many of the front pages, after her death was announced yesterday. She was 91. The Daily Mail describes her as \"France's most alluring export\". \"La Belle Bardot\" is the headline in the Daily Mirror.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringThe much-anticipated talks lasted two-and-a-half hours, and that's an achievement in itself. Presidents Trump and Zelensky had never before spent this long in one room, negotiating.Afterwards, optimism was much on display at Mar-a-Lago. It was a \"terrific meeting\", according to Donald Trump. Volodymyr Zelensky agreed, describing it as a \"great meeting\" with \"great discussions on all the topics\".But even if the two presidents sounded more upbeat than before, yet again we did not hear any evidence of progress - just like after all the previous talks held this year.Trump says progress made in Ukraine talks but 'thorny issues' remainThere is still no answer to the key question of whether Ukraine will have to give up territory in exchange for a promise of peace. This is one of the main demands put forward by Russia and apparently backed by the US, so the fact that Zelensky has not accepted it - at least not in public - counts as good news for Ukraine. He did appear to leave the possibility of territorial concessions open, however, by saying that a referendum may be held to approve any deals to end the war.There is also no clarity on another crucial issue: security guarantees. Even though President Zelensky says they were \"100%\" agreed with the US, we do not know what they are and whether they would be enough to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.No less importantly, regardless of what agreements presidents Trump and Zelensky may have reached, there is no reason to assume that Russia would accept them. In fact, it has already rejected key ideas floated immediately before the talks in Florida: that a ceasefire be declared and a multinational force be deployed to Ukraine to monitor it.And this begs the question of what Donald Trump is prepared to do should Russia reject his agreements with Volodymyr Zelensky. So far, it has been the Ukrainian leader who has borne the brunt of his pressure, irritation and anger. Donald Trump's continuing positive rhetoric about Vladimir Putin (who, the US president said today, is \"serious\" about peace and \"wants to see Ukraine succeed\") suggests that this is unlikely to change.At the end of the day, all this means that despite Donald Trump's and Volodymyr Zelensky's optimism, we've seen little indication that lasting peace will prevail in Ukraine any time soon.",

    "body": "More than 300 earthquakes were recorded in the UK in 2025, British Geological Survey data shows.The two largest earthquakes occurred just hours apart near Loch Lyon in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, when a 3.7 magnitude tremor was registered on 20 October, followed by one of 3.6. Up to 18 December 2025, 309 earthquakes had been recorded across the UK. Areas of Perthshire and the western Highlands in Scotland, southern parts of Wales, and Yorkshire and Lancashire in England recorded the most seismic activity overall. On average, the UK experienced an earthquake \"almost once a day\" in 2025, seismologist Brian Baptie said.The report said 34 earthquakes in total occurred near Loch Lyon between October and December. \"The west of Scotland is one of the more active parts of the UK,\" Dr Baptie said.Some of this can be attributed to geological faults including the Great Glen and the Highland Boundary Fault.\"By contrast, north-east Scotland experiences very few earthquakes.\"Two minor earthquakes hit Lancashire in as many weeks in December, with the epicentre of the 2.5 magnitude tremor located off the coast of Silverdale, in Morecambe Bay.The BGS confirmed the quake was an aftershock of a 3.3 magnitude earthquake which hit the area at the start of December.Seismic activity is recorded by 80 monitoring stations around the UK, operated by BGS.It said the UK experiences between 200 and 300 earthquakes a year but only about 20 or 30 are felt or heard by people.This year, it received 1,320 reports from members of the public who felt tremors this year.A magnitude-four event in the UK and surrounding areas is typically recorded every three to four years, and a magnitude-five event happens every few decades - with the most recent one in 2008 in Lincolnshire.A magnitude-six earthquake happens every few hundred years. The largest known earthquake in the UK occurred in 1931, near the Dogger Bank, in the North Sea off the coast of Yorkshire.It had a magnitude of 6.1 and was powerful enough to cause minor damage to buildings on the east coast of England, despite its epicentre being 60 miles offshore.In general, earthquakes are caused by the tectonic plates that make up the earth moving and rubbing together. Smaller earthquakes, including those experienced in the UK, can be caused by movements on geological faults in the Earth's crust.The UK is situated within the Eurasian plate, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) away from the nearest plate boundary. This is why it does not experience earthquakes as large as those in other parts of the world.",

    "body": "A rising number of end-of-life patients in hospitals could affect the level of treatment carried out this winter, a group of regional NHS leaders have been told. A consultant in palliative care highlighted the impending \"crisis\" during an online internal meeting of health leaders in Sussex, a recording of which has been heard by the BBC.The consultant at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust described dilemmas facing hospital managers when some patients are having to be given end-of-life care in A&E corridors.The bleak assessment is likely to be echoed in other NHS regions as building winter pressures increase the challenge of trying to find hospital beds for sick patients needing care.University Hospitals Sussex Trust includes Worthing Hospital, Royal Sussex County Hospital, St Richard's Hospital in Chichester and Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath.  Doctors and officials from East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which includes Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital, also took part in the meeting along with community health representatives. The consultant made a slide presentation entitled \"Palliative and End of Life Care in Sussex\" at the meeting, which took place on 4 November.She told the audience that local hospices were struggling and it was difficult to find places for patients who need end-of-life care, while it was sometimes not clear how much support there might be in the local community when people are sent home.She said: \"I am really worried that patients who have treatable conditions are not going to be able to get into hospital and be treated because there are so many end-of-life patients in hospital beds.\"She went on to say \"we are no longer putting patients on the waiting list for transfer who are just straightforward dying\", focusing only on those with complex needs.On giving enhanced palliative care in A&E, the consultant said it was a \"really difficult choice - do you admit them for corridor care or do you turn them round, put them in the back of the ambulance where they may die on the way home\".She argued there were \"lots of patients in hospital who don't need to be there, lots of patients with complex needs who don't have their needs met\".She concluded: \"We've all known this crisis is coming - it is getting worse and worse\".A spokesperson for the NHS in Sussex said it was committed to ensuring that patients have access to the \"best possible, high-quality palliative and end-of-life care\". They said: \"This includes providing a range of places for compassionate, person-centred care - and importantly, where possible, in settings out of hospital, such as community settings, and our hospices.  \"Emergency care services across Sussex remain under significant pressure but staff continue to work incredibly hard to make sure patients can receive the care they need at our hospitals, and across all our health and care services.\"There is robust partnership work in place over the winter period to support individual care plans, and to ensure that people are in the right NHS service for their needs.\"But the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said delayed discharges were a huge challenge across the NHS, and a lack of social or community care could mean some patients needing end-of-life care and support could not leave hospitals.  Its president, Dr Ian Higginson, said the college was \"worried about the number of patients who need end-of-life care who end up in emergency departments, and then hospitals, because the dedicated services they need are not available\". He said: \"Patients who would prefer to be at home may end up in our corridors, which are not the right places for anyone, let alone those who are at the end of their lives.\"Meanwhile, community services are also stretched and hospices are warning of a funding crisis.Toby Porter, chief executive of Hospice UK said:  \"We know just how hard staff across the NHS and care system are working to give people at the end of life the care they deserve.\"But, while hospital can be the right place for some, a busy ward just isn't the right place for most people who die.\"Hospices across the country want to provide more care in the community but this year we've seen it cut back because of funding pressures. And that is having a knock-on effect in hospitals.\"",

    "body": "Just nowKoh EweEastern Theater CommandThe Chinese military published a video on Monday showing warships being deployed as it announced drills in the Taiwan StraitChina is holding military drills around Taiwan simulating the seizure and blockade of the island's key areas, as a warning against \"separatist forces\".The army, navy, air force and rocket force have been dispatched for the drills which include live-fire exercises, the Chinese military said.Codenamed \"Justice Mission 2025\", the drills are taking place days after the US announced the sale of one of its largest weapons packages to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn). That move drew sharp protest from Beijing which in turn sanctioned US defence firms. Taiwan's push to ramp up its defence this year has also angered Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory.Taiwan's presidential office has criticised the upcoming Chinese drills, calling them a challenge to international norms.Taiwan's defence ministry said that they detected Chinese aircraft and ships around Taiwan on Monday morning, and have deployed their own forces and missile systems to monitor the situation. Its forces are on \"high alert\" to defend Taiwan and \"protect our people\", the ministry said.In a post on Weibo, the Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command - in charge of the Taiwan Strait - described the upcoming military exercise as a \"shield of justice\".\"All those plotting independence will be annihilated upon encountering the shield!\" the post read.While some initial drills have begun, the military said it would conduct a major exercise from 08:00 to 18:00 local time on Tuesday.Beijing's foreign ministry called the drills a \"severe punishment for separatist forces seeking independence through force\" and warned \"external forces\" against \"using Taiwan to contain China\".\"Any sinister schemes to obstruct China's reunification are doomed to fail,\" the ministry's spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing on Monday.While China has long called for the \"peaceful reunification\" with Taiwan, it also has a law stating it will resort to \"non-peaceful means\" to prevent the island's \"secession\".Beijing has accused Taiwan's president Lai Ching-te of pursuing \"Taiwan independence\". The president maintains Taiwan is already a sovereign nation and therefore has no need to formally declare independence.On Sunday, Lai said in a local television interview that Taiwan needed to \"keep raising the difficulty so [China] can never meet the standard\" for an invasion.He also said that his administration was committed to \"maintaining the status quo\" and would not provoke China - though he added that peace relies on \"real strength\".Polls consistently show that most Taiwanese people want the \"status quo\", meaning they neither want to unify with China, nor to formally declare independence.CCTVChinese state media published a map released by the military showing Tuesday's drill locations around TaiwanSince 2022 Beijing has ramped up military drills in the Taiwan Strait, usually in response to what it deems as threats such as former US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 and Lai's inauguration in 2024.China's last live-fire exercise in the Taiwan Strait, held in April, simulated strikes on key ports and energy facilities, the People's Liberation Army said at the time. Along with the drills, the Chinese military released a series of cartoons depicting Lai as a \"parasite\".This week's military drills are the first to be held under Yang Zhibin, the new chief of the Eastern Theater Command who assumed his role in October.Taiwan holds military exercises of its own, both to prepare its population for an attack and showcase its defences to Beijing. This year's Han Kuang exercise, which took place over 10 days, was the largest and longest one yet.Since taking office, Lai has vowed to boost defence spending and enhance the island's defence capabilities in the face of increasing tensions with Beijing.In October, the Taiwanese president announced the building of a dome-like air defence system to guard against \"hostile threats\" - though he did not explicitly mention China.The drills this week in the Taiwan Strait would also aim at deterrence \"outside the island chain\", China's military said.China's ties with Japan have plunged to their iciest in years after Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi suggested last month -  in response to a question asked in parliament - that Japan's self-defence forces could step in if China attacked Taiwan.China has lodged heated protests and issued warnings to its citizens to avoid travel to Japan. Earlier this month, Japan protested after Chinese fighter jets locked radars on Japanese aircraft while Beijing accused Tokyo of \"harassing\" its forces during a training exercise.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,Washington DCandHarry SekulichDonald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky said progress had been made to end the Ukraine war during Florida talks but the US leader added \"one or two very thorny issues\" remained.While both the US and Ukrainian presidents described the talks as \"great\", Trump reiterated that a key sticking point was the question of territory. Russia has previously demanded that Ukraine hand over more land.Addressing reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Zelensky said they had come to an agreement on \"90%\" of a 20-point peace plan, while Trump said a security guarantee for Ukraine was \"close to 95%\" done.Zelensky later said US and Ukrainian teams would meet next week for further talks on issues aimed at ending Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\"We had a substantive conversation on all issues and highly value the progress that the Ukrainian and American teams have made over the past weeks,\" Zelensky said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.A proposal to turn the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which Russia largely controls, into a demilitarised zone remains \"unresolved\", Trump said.\"Some of that land has been taken,\" he told reporters after the meeting. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months.\"Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The regions are collectively known as Donbas.Russia wants Ukraine to pull back from the small part of the territory it still controls in Donbas, while Kyiv has insisted the area could become a free economic zone policed by Ukrainian forces.The US president has repeatedly changed his own position on Ukraine's lost territories, and in September stunned observers by suggesting that Ukraine might be able to take it back. He later reversed course.\"[That] is a very tough issue,\" he said. \"One that will get resolved.\"Security guarantees for Ukraine are \"95% done\", Trump said, without formally committing to logistical support or troop deployment to help protect Ukraine from future attacks.Trump floated the possibility of trilateral talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine, saying it could happen \"at the right time\".While the US president is keen to add the Ukraine-Russia war to the list of conflicts he claims to have ended, he cautioned that stalled or scrapped talks that go \"really badly\" could mean that the war continues.Earlier Trump had a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. While the US president did not offer many details of the phone call, he said he believed the Russian leader \"wants Ukraine to succeed\".At the same time, Trump acknowledged that Moscow had little interest in a ceasefire that would allow Ukraine to hold a referendum.\"I understand that position,\" he added.Russian foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said the call was initiated by Trump and that he and Putin discussed the latest EU and Ukraine proposals to end the war.Ushakov, Russia's former US ambassador, said Trump listened to the Kremlin's assessment of the proposals and the two presidents left the call united in their belief that a temporary ceasefire proposed by the EU and Ukraine would instead prolong the conflict.Zelensky suggested the Ukrainian officials could meet at the White House in January, potentially alongside European leaders, as the US and Ukrainian delegations finalise plans for further talks.In a post-meeting call with European allies, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed \"good progress\" in the Florida talks while reinforcing the need for Ukraine to receive \"ironclad security guarantees from day one\".French President Emmanuel Macron also said Kyiv's allies would meet in Paris next month to discuss security guarantees.\"We will bring together the countries of the Coalition of the Willing in Paris in early January to finalise each one's concrete contributions,\" Macron said on X after speaking with Zelensky and Trump.",

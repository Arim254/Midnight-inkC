    "body": "4 hours agoThe Guardian focuses on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky's speech to European leaders at Davos - saying he took \"aim\" and accused them of being in \"Greenland mode\" waiting for Donald Trump's cue on Ukraine and other international crises. Zelensky also used his \"fiery\" speech to demand greater pressure on Russia as envoy Steve Witkoff arrives in Moscow for ongoing peace talks, the paper notes.\"Zelensky turns on Europe\" says the Independent, highlighting more criticism from the Ukrainian president, saying Europe \"loves to discuss the future but avoids taking action\" against Russia.In more developments at the World Economic Forum, the Financial Times pictures Donald Trump front and centre during the unveiling of his Board of Peace in Davos. The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.In UK news, the Time leads with news that former Labour minister Andrew Gwynne is standing down as an MP, paving the way for Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to a possible run in a by-election to return to the Commons. The paper says the  Sir Keir Starmer's allies will try to block Burnham's return and him potentially mounting a leadership challenge to the prime minister.The i Paper dubs the move \"Operation Stop Burnham\", quoting an ally of the PM who says the Labour party doesn't need \"an Andy Burnham circus\".\"Does Andy Burnham have the bottle?\" asks the Daily Mail. The paper also describes the Labour party \"descending into civil war\" over the news.In other election news, the Daily Telegraph reports that some \"4.5 million people are to be denied a vote\" after more councils in England were given permission to delay local elections in May.The Metro features images of multiple skyscrapers from Donald Trump's \"glitzy Middle East tourist vision\" for a rebuilt Gaza. The pictures are part of the US president's plan to turn the coast of Gaza, which has been devastated by 27 months of bombardment by Israel following the 7 October attacks, into a tourist destination by 2029. \"Gaza or gaga?\" the paper asks.The Daily Star stays with the Beckham family feud, showing Brooklyn Peltz Beckham and his wife Nicola taking a walk in their first public outing since addressing the row. The paper describes the couple as presenting a \"united front\".\"Glad we did it\" is the Sun's headline, reporting that Brooklyn is \"very happy\" at the reaction to his statement on the strained relationship with his parents.\"No regrets\" echoes the Daily Mirror with the same image of the couple at the top of its front page. But for its main story the Mirror describes Donald Trump's comment that Nato troops stayed off the frontlines during the war in Afghanistan as \"shameful\" and an \"insult\" to the more than 400 British troops who died.  Finally, the Daily Express along with campaigners are urging ministers to ensure mental health is a key part of the government's National Cancer Plan. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "6 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorGetty ImagesA marble sits at the top of a very long, elaborate and twisting run right now.If - and it's a big if - it trundles all the way to the bottom, Andy Burnham might become prime minister.But hang on a minute, let's not get ahead of ourselves.That marble might not even set off down the run, or might fly off spectacularly halfway down.The twists, turns and obstacles standing between the Greater Manchester mayor and a return to Westminster as an MP – a prerequisite for him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the Labour leadership – are substantial.Firstly, Burnham has to decide if he wants to go for it. On the upside for him, this is a contest close to home, in Greater Manchester. It is also a contest triggered by the departure of an MP on medical grounds. It would be hard for his critics to suggest Andrew Gwynne stepping down is part of an elaborate political plot.But, if Burnham does say he wants to run, he has to ask the Labour Party's National Executive Committee for permission.This body, the party's rule book sets out, must give its \"express permission\" before directly-elected mayors can seek nomination as Labour candidates for elections to the Westminster Parliament. So the party could turn around and say no – on the grounds that a mayoral election would be expensive and potentially politically tricky. Plus, frankly, there are those within Labour who would rather he didn't come back to Westminster, such has been, as they see it, the gratuitous nature of his manoeuvring for the top job. But it is also true that plenty within the Labour movement think he could be something of a saviour for a party and a government that are really struggling.If Burnham is rejected - the marble flying off the run - what does he do next? He has a big enough stage, megaphone and profile to do the prime minister real damage, should he choose to do so.And what happens if he does stand? The by-election would attract vast attention.Andrew Gwynne won the Gorton and Denton seat comfortably at the last general election, but Labour's popularity has nosedived since.'No means a certainty'Reform UK and the Green Party finished second and third respectively, and many suspect they could both be much more competitive this time.Reform's leader Nigel Farage was quick to relish what lies ahead.\"This by-election is by no means a certainty for Labour, the left-wing Greens will split their vote, and we will be the challenger. We will give it our all,\" he said.It is far from certain, even in this scenario where Andy Burnham is the Labour candidate, that he makes it back to Westminster.But it is also true this might be his one chance to return to Westminster, in a seat in his patch, with a vulnerable prime minister and plenty of chat among Labour MPs about who might replace him.So finally, let's imagine he is Labour's candidate and he wins. It is entirely possible he would do so just as Labour did badly in elections in Scotland and Wales, and the local elections in many parts of England in May.And so he would arrive on those green benches in the Commons at just the point many Labour folk anticipate the prime minister reaches his stickiest moment yet. Is this the point he is a challenger for the Labour leadership, alongside others?As I say, this marble run is long and twisting. But it could become the political spectator sport of the spring. ",

One of them was a Chinese national, police told reporters on Friday.The landslides come after heavy rain pummelled parts of the North Island for days.Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who visited the disaster site on Friday, said it was \"inspiring\" to see the support pouring through the community, with neighbours and \"friends of friends of friends\" helping to clear debris in flood-hit areas.He said despite the tragedy he was \"incredibly impressed\" by the professionalism in the wake of the disaster.Key challenges remains, Luxon said, pointing to road access to isolated communities, continued risks of slips and flooding.Thunderstorms and strong winds are expected this weekend in Gisborne, where floods have cut off communities, and Tauranga, where the landslides happened, according to New Zealand's meteorological service.Much of the focus remained on the search and rescue mission, Luxon said.Besides the six people who are unaccounted for, police are appealing to the public for any information about another three people who might have been at the site.They are believed to be international tourists who may have already departed from the area, police district commander Tim Anderson said on Friday. \"We don't believe they're here, but we still got to do that inquiry.\"Rescuers have not seen any signs of life under the rubble today, Anderson said. But he added that they were still \"working 24/7\" and \"leaving no stone unturned\".Footage from the campsite on Mount Maunganui shows rescuers and sniffer dogs combing through crushed caravans and flattened tents.A tourist told broadcaster TVNZ that he had jumped out of the pool as he saw the huge landslide coming down. The sacred Māori site is a popular tourist attraction, though it has seen several landslides in recent years.At nearby Welcome Bay, police recovered two bodies in a house on Thursday after it was hit by a landslide. Another person at the scene was seriously injured, police said.\"We are sad to learn that two people are confirmed to have lost their lives, including a Chinese citizen, and a number of people remain unaccounted for\" at Mount Maunganui, said Wang Xiaolong, China's ambassador to New Zealand, on X.\"Our hearts are with the impacted families at this difficult moment.\"Elsewhere on North Island, the search has resumed for a missing man who had been swept away into Mahurangi River, north of Auckland, on Wednesday.His wife told RNZ that their family was still holding out hope for the 47-year-old, who had been a fisherman in Kiribati before moving to New Zealand in 2003. He knew how to swim and dive, and had seen big waves, she said.",

    "body": "52 minutes agoJude SheerinWashingtonReutersUS President Donald Trump has withdrawn an invite for Canada to join his newly constituted Board of Peace, in the latest spat between the North American neighbours.\"Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining,\" Trump said on Truth Social in a post addressed to Prime Minister Mark Carney.Carney made headlines this week warning of a \"rupture\" in the US-led global order. Ottawa also said it would not pay to join Trump's new body.The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.Trump did not give a reason in Thursday evening's post as to why he had decided to revoke Canada's offer. Carney's office did not immediately respond. The prime minster had indicated last week he would accept Trump's invite on principle.But Ottawa had indicated in recent days that it would not pay the $1bn (£740m) membership fee which Trump has said permanent members will be asked to pay to help fund the board.His Board of Peace was originally thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. BBC looks into who is and isn't on Trump's 'Board of Peace'But its proposed charter does not mention the Palestinian territory and appears to be designed to supplant functions of the UN. Trump would be chairman for life.Some 60 nations have been invited to join the board and about 35 have already signed up, according to the White House.Those who have agreed to join so far include Argentina, Belarus, Morocco, Vietnam, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kosovo, Hungary, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Jordan, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.But none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.Carney appeared to irk Trump with a speech that won a rare standing ovation this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos.The prime minister urged other \"middle powers\" to band together in the face of economic coercion by \"greater powers\", although he did not mention the US president by name.A day later Trump told the gathering in the Swiss Alpine resort that Canada gets many \"freebies\" from the US and it \"should be grateful\".\"Canada lives because of the United States,\" Trump said. \"Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"On Thursday, Carney swiped back at Trump as he delivered another speech back on home turf.Speaking in Quebec, he said: \"Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadians.\"",

    "body": "Botched insulation scheme was 'doomed to fail', say MPs5 hours agoZoe ConwayNews CorrespondentBBCThousands of homes, like this one in Swansea, were fitted with insulation that caused mould and dampThousands of people are living in homes that pose a risk to their health and safety after the ''catastrophic failure'' of two government insulation schemes, MPs have said.Major defects have been found in over 30,000 houses fitted with insulation through government schemes since 2022.The Public Accounts Committee has now said that the \"level of non-compliance\" by installers should be investigated for fraud and that the government's current response was \"not credible\".The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it was \"categorically untrue there are widespread health and safety risks\". A spokesperson added that \"for the vast majority, this means a home may not be as energy efficient as it should be\".The parliamentary committee, which monitors the effectiveness of government spending, said the insulation schemes ECO 4 and GBIS, which began in 2022, were so badly designed they were almost ''bound to fail''.It said they had received ''virtually no attention'' from senior government officials so that they did not know whether the schemes were working for at least two years.Committee chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton Brown said the level of non-compliance by insulation installers was so extreme that the matter should be referred to the Serious Fraud Office.The committee found that less than 10% of affected homes had been fixed since the problems emerged in October 2024.It warned that when households have to wait for help, the likelihood of damage increased, resulting in \"immediate health and safety risks that need urgent attention\".The report also criticises Trustmark, the organisation in charge of overseeing the quality of insulation work, for not notifying officials of high levels of faulty external wall insulation until October 2024. Responding to the committee's report, Trustmark said it remained \"totally committed to ensuring strong consumer protection for all types of home improvements\".\"We are continuing to work with government, our Scheme Providers, Registered Businesses and where appropriate, guarantee providers, to get these problems found and fixed. \"These examples of poor-quality workmanship are completely unacceptable and underline the need for change and reform to the current system,\" Trustmark said.Affected customers can find information about TrustMark's Find and Fix scheme on their website.Cost of repairsGovernment insulation schemes have been running for more than 15 years and have cost billions of pounds in public money. They were meant to makes homes warmer, reduce carbon emissions and help some of the poorest and most vulnerable people to lower their energy bills. But BBC News has reported on many cases over the last year where work done was of such poor quality it has led to damp, black mould and, in some cases, dry rot.The government has said that homes will be fixed at no cost to the consumer. It said the original installer is liable for fixing the problems, and a guarantee should cover repairs up to £20,000 when an installer goes bust or fails to address the problem adequately.But the committee warned that repairs can cost more than this. BBC News reported last year on the case of a home in Luton where the damage from failed external wall insulation is so extensive it is projected to cost more than £250,000. The bill is being picked up by the installer's insurer. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it expected a very small number of people to need help funding their repairs.But the Public Accounts Committee accused the Department of downplaying the scale of the problem and said their plan was ''not credible''.The committee's report focused on work carried out since 2022, but BBC News has spoken to homeowners who had their properties insulated under earlier government schemes, who say they are also in need of help.  In October, the government spending watchdog the National Audit Office said the insulation schemes could have involved between £56m and £165m worth of fraud.But MPs on the committee said they suspect the true level of fraud to be much higher.

    "body": "10 hours agoNick EardleyPolitical correspondentThe government is to radically reduce the number of police forces in England and Wales as part of what sources have called the largest reform of policing in decades.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will announce plans for police reform next week.She will pledge to \"significantly\" cut the number of forces from its current level of 43, and tell them to focus on serious and organised crime. Police chiefs have been calling for the creation of 12 \"mega forces\" to save money and boost crime-fighting efforts.It could be years before changes are implemented, with government sources saying only that it will happen by the end of the next parliament, around 2034.Mahmood will argue in a policy proposal that the current model of 43 forces is bureaucratic and wastes money, with each force running their own headquarters, management teams and backroom staff.Ministers also believe the performance of local forces varies too widely across England. They believe smaller forces are less well equipped to deal with serious crime and respond to major incidents.Mahmood is expected to say new, larger forces should focus on tackling serious and organised crime, as well as complex cases like murder and drugs.Ministers will also announce plans for new Local Policing Areas, with local officers focusing on neighbourhood policing.It is proposed these will be set up in every borough, town or city across in England, and will be tasked with working with communities and fighting what the government calls \"local crime\", such as shoplifting, phone theft and drug dealing.Government insiders acknowledge there is an \"epidemic of every day offences\" going unpunished, and say they believe criminals think they can \"cause havoc on our streets with impunity\" because people are forced to wait hours or days for police to investigate crimes.A government source said: \"Where you live will no longer determine the outcomes you get from your force.\"Ministers will not say next week exactly how many forces will exist under the new framework. Instead, an independent review will be announced to looking at precise details.Similar cuts have been proposed as long as 20 years ago, when then Home Secretary Charles Clarke suggested cutting the number of forces to 12.Scotland also merged its forces in 2013 to create Police Scotland.The home secretary's allies will sell these reforms as part of her \"modernising agenda\".A source said: \"For decades, people have called for forces to be merged. Mahmood is a politician who is not scared of bold reform and a political fight.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"Keir Starmer's forced police reorganisation will undermine efforts to flight crime across England and Wales, inevitably leading to centralised control and reduced policing in towns and villages across the country.\"Some police chiefs have called for a revamp of policing in England and have backed reducing the number of forces.Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: \"Crime is changing, technology is evolving, and we need to be set up in the best possible way to tackle crime in the modern world, relentlessly focused on good quality neighbourhood policing alongside national threats.\"I know the home secretary shares this ambition. We look forward to seeing the government's white paper and working with them to ensure policing delivers outstanding results and rebuilds confidence with the communities we serve.\"A spokesman for the Policing Federation, which represents officers from the rank of constable to chief inspector, said: \"Fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities. \"Skills, capabilities and equipment need significant investment if the public and officers are going to see reform deliver in the real world.\"Any proposals must be driven by evidence and best practice, not lowest cost, and must strengthen rather than weaken frontline, investigative and specialist capability, neighbourhood policing and public confidence.\"",

    "body": "France says it has seized an oil tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of being part of Russia's sanction-busting \"shadow fleet\".French President Emmanuel Macron said the tanker, named the Grinch, was \"subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag\".The French navy, with the assistance of allies including the UK, boarded the vessel on Thursday morning between Spain and Morocco. French maritime authorities said that a search of the vessel had \"confirmed the doubts as to the regularity of the flag\".Russia's embassy in Paris said it had not been informed of the seizure.Moscow's so-called shadow fleet is a clandestine network of tankers used to evade Western sanctions on Russian oil exports by shipping the oil on aged tankers with obscure ownership or insurance.The Grinch was travelling from the Arctic port of Murmansk in northern Russia when it was intercepted, French authorities said. The vessel had been flying a Comoros flag, according to ship tracking websites marinetraffic and vesselfinder.Announcing the seizure on X, Macron said: \"We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions.\"The activities of the \"shadow fleet\" contribute to financing the war of aggression against Ukraine,\" he said, adding that the vessel had been \"diverted\".Defence Secretary John Healy said the UK navy had provided \"tracking and monitoring\" support, with HMS Dagger monitoring the tanker through the Straits of Gibraltar.He added: \"Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels to choke off the funds that fuel Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine.\"The UK has imposed sanctions on 544 Russian shadow fleet vessels. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the action, saying it was \"exactly the kind of resolve needed to ensure that Russian oil no longer finances Russia's war\".\"Vessels must be apprehended. And wouldn't it be fair to confiscate and sell the oil carried by these tankers?\" he said on X.Speaking at Davos earlier, Zelensky exhorted Europe to do more to ensure its own security, saying: \"Europe loves to discuss the future but avoids taking action\".Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Earlier in January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia. Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.Last October, France seized another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast before releasing it a few days later.Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil.Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.

    "body": "3 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentGetty ImagesPlans are taking shape for the national memorial to the late Queen Elizabeth IIThe national monument to the late Queen Elizabeth II will feature a statue of her standing, rather than on horseback as previously illustrated, the memorial committee has announced.The memorial, including three statues and a tiara-shaped glass balustrade for a bridge, is going to be built in St James's Park in central London, near Buckingham Palace.The designer of a second smaller sculpture has also been announced as Karen Newman, who once made waxwork models at Madame Tussauds, including Prince Philip.But in an update from the memorial committee and Cabinet Office, the main statue on The Mall will show Queen Elizabeth standing up and not riding a horse, as depicted in earlier illustrations.Foster + PartnersThe Queen's statue will be beside the Mall and was originally shown on a horseKing Charles has been kept informed of the plans and consulted on the developments, with the final design to be made public in April 2026 to coincide with the centenary of the late Queen's birth.But the sculptor of the showcase statue on the Mall, Martin Jennings, explained it would show the horse-loving monarch standing rather than riding.\"After careful research and thought, my design for the Queen's monument will emphasise her role as head of state and proudly follows a sculptural tradition that shows kings and queens from the House of Windsor in a standing position,\" said Jennings.The previous horse-riding images had been for illustrative purposes only to show the size, scale and location rather than the final design, says the Cabinet Office.The statue will not be far from memorials to the late Queen's parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and they are shown standing and wearing formal robes.Karen NewmanKaren Newman previously created a sculpture of actor Charles DanceThe main statue of Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022, will be near to the Marlborough Gate in St James's Park, and nearby will be a statue of her husband Prince Philip.The design includes a glass balustrade on a bridge across a lake, commemorative gardens and at another entrance to the park will be a sculpture which it's been announced will be created by Karen Newman.She has made images of performers such as Charles Dance and Roger Daltrey and Second World War heroines such as Noor Inayat Khan and Violette Szabo.But she was also once a maker of waxwork likenesses on display at Madame Tussauds, including the late Queen's husband Prince Philip and former prime minister Sir Tony Blair among the models she made.Foster + PartnersThere will be a bridge with a reinforced glass balustrade, evoking a tiaraNewman said it was a great honour to make the sculpture of the late Queen.\"She was an iconic and unifying figure in our national story. I am very much looking forward to portraying the strong and complex personality of our late Queen,\" said the sculptor.Lord Norman Foster, the architect who is leading the design team, said her \"talent and sensitivity will bring a profound sense of dignity to the work\".The cost of the project, with a budget between £23m and £46m, has been criticised by the anti-monarchy group, Republic, who have said the royals should pay for the monument rather than the government.",

    "body": "Some former state employees across the country have been left with no income this month after the company managing civil service pensions failed to pay them.The Civil Service Pension Scheme, which manages the pensions of 1.7 million public sector workers in the UK, has been unable to provide lump sums or regular payments to many people since Capita took over administration of the scheme in December.Capita said it had been left with a much bigger backlog of cases than originally agreed and apologised to those affected.One retiree, Steve Duell, said that he will have to borrow to pay his bills if he does not receive his pension by the end of the month.The 65-year-old from Hull retired on 1 January after 40 years at the Land Registry. He should have received a lump sum shortly afterwards but has received no information at all about his retirement package.Steve has made numerous attempts to contact the administrators, including spending nearly 15 hours on the phone on hold, he told the BBC.\"We've got no money, and we've got lots of financial commitments.\"We need to pay off car loans and make mortgage payments. We arranged to get building work done on the  house, on the basis of expecting a lump sum at start of January,\" he told the BBC.The outsourcing services firm, Capita, took over the contract in December after a lead-in time of two years. It administers pensions for public sector institutions including HMRC, the MOD, the Welsh government, the Scottish government, Transport Scotland, the Crown Prosecution Service, Defra and the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office. Paul McKenna, from Liverpool, spent most of his working life working with the Inland Revenue and HMRC.Now aged 59, he planned to retire early on health grounds, after having a heart bypass operation. He gave the required five months' notice to start his pension, before finishing work on 30 November.He had hoped to use his lump sum to pay off his mortgage, then live off his pension payments, but is still waiting.\"The worry has been affecting my sleep, it's bad for my angina. \"I'm supposed to be getting married in September, but this has left me with lots of uncertainty,\" he said.When he telephoned he waited for an hour on hold before being given the message:  'The building is on fire and we've had to evacuate'.\"He said that happened twice, before getting through, only to be told his case was with the \"resolutions team\".Capita has previously faced criticism over their management of teachers' pensions in England and Wales, and has lost that contract to rival Tata.Until the end of November 2025, the Civil Service Pension Scheme was administered by a company called MyCSP. The contract was taken over by Capita on 1 December, in a seven-year deal worth £239m.Capita launched a new online portal, for customers to access projections of their expected pensions and lump sum payments. But the portal launch was plagued with problems.In a statement to the BBC Capita said that when they took over they had expected a backlog of 37,000 cases, but the actual number of outstanding cases was 86,000.  Capita says it now has over 500 people working on the project, double that of the previous provider.\"Our teams are working tirelessly to clear the backlog we inherited and resolve member queries as quickly as possible. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused to our members,\" Capita said in a statement.Parliament's Public Accounts Committee warned in October that Capita would not be ready for the planned takeover.Committee chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP, said at the time: \"It is deeply frustrating for this committee to be scrutinising an issue that ought to be as seamlessly run as civil service pensions. \"Scheme members who have dedicated their careers to public service ought to be secure in the knowledge that it is under sound administration.\"Responsibility for managing the administrator contract rests with the Cabinet Office. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said it remained \"committed to working with Capita to ensure the scheme's success and [to] safeguard the interests of all members.\"We are aware of the issues some members have faced and we have instructed Capita to fix them urgently,\" the spokesperson added.\"We have been assured that Capita is rolling out targeted fixes to better meet the demands of members and employers.\"Fran Heathcote, general secretary of the PCS union, which represents civil servants said: \"This fiasco is extremely distressing for those who have worked and paid into their pension all their working lives.\"We believe that this work should be run by the civil service, under ministerial control, so that it can be properly resourced and pensions paid on time.\"",

    "body": "Warning: This report contains discriminatory, homophobic language that some may find distressing.The BBC has apologised to a former radio presenter after an internal investigation found a failure to act in response to homophobic abuse.Jack Murley alleged he was called homophobic names, including \"fairy boy\", by other staff members and told to sound \"less gay\" on air by a manager.The 37-year-old was dismissed from BBC Radio Cornwall in 2024 for breaching the organisation's editorial and social media guidelines after posting online about proposed changes to BBC Local. An employment tribunal found it was \"reasonable\" and not a result of discrimination over his sexuality.In a subsequent letter to Murley, the BBC's chief operating officer across Nations, Jason Horton, apologised on behalf of the organisation for \"the behaviours and comments\" he was subject to.\"We have worked hard to change the culture for the better across management and the wider team,\" Horton said in the letter, adding that work had been done to address the recommendations made.Horton acknowledged the BBC accepted all the findings but did not believe there were grounds for a financial payout to Murley.Murley said he was \"grateful\" to his former colleagues who had provided witness evidence.\"At a time when I was producing an award-winning LGBTQ+ show for the BBC, I was being subjected to the kind of homophobic and bigoted behaviours from BBC staff members that would have been unacceptable decades ago – let alone in a modern workplace,\" he said.He added: \"I am glad that the BBC has finally admitted that people in positions of power created and sustained an environment in which my abuse was explicitly and implicitly tolerated by those who should have been expected to stop it.\"A BBC spokesperson said the organisation did not comment on individual cases but took \"any reports of our workplace values not being upheld extremely seriously\".A leaked report by the corporation's whistleblowing team, detailed that internal investigators examined 12 allegations of abuse and lack of action by management - finding there to be a \"case to answer\" in eight of these.The 38-page report contains witness statements from Murley, as well as his colleagues and bosses at the station.It notes that many of those who gave evidence did so anonymously for fear of retaliation.Two of the claims relate to a particular colleague who on one occasion found his car blocked by Murley's car in the office car park.He allegedly said something to the effect of \"fairy boy, you need to move your car\".Murley reported that this staff member's behaviour was widely known, but felt there was an onus on him to \"laugh it off\".He provided witness evidence for the two incidents involving this staff member and the report found there was a case to answer.Murley reported that another staff member told a joke in front of colleagues, which included the homophobic slur \"poof\". The report found there was a case to answer for.In a separate incident with a different colleague, Murley reported being in the staff kitchen talking about being able to donate blood after a change in the law - something he was previously unable to do as a gay man.Murley claimed the staff member entered the kitchen and said: \"I can understand why you were banned (from giving blood). Statistically, your lot are a lot more likely to die of Aids, that's just a numerical fact.\"The report found that this incident was witnessed by two people, and there was a case to answer for it.Jack Murley also said he was receiving homophobic abuse in emails, texts, and phone calls from listeners - including one incident in which he received an envelope with Bible verses and homophobic remarks.After approaching a senior manager, Murley claims he was shocked by the response - in which the manager said it was not his job to deal with the abuse, and the only solution he could offer was for Murley to be \"less gay\" on air.For this claim, the report found that Murley had provided direct evidence. Five witnesses gave indirect circumstantial evidence that supported Murley's claim he was not taken seriously.",

What’s really going on with Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine?AmericastAvailable for over a yearDonald Trump has posted on social media that ‘something good just may be happening’ when it comes to negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, after overnight talks in Geneva.\nEuropean leaders criticised a 28-point US peace plan when it emerged last week, saying it was too favourable to Russia. A new plan has been promised, but President Zelensky has played down Trump’s hopes of progress.\nSarah, Anthony and Marianna join Matt Chorley on 5 Live to answer your questions. We look at who’s actually involved in putting the plan together? And what does Donald Trump stand to gain from the proposed deal?\nPlus, the MAGA icon and Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene says she will resign from Congress following her bitter feud with the president last week. Could we start to see power shifts within the MAGA movement following her departure? And why did Trump say the behaviour of some Democrats was “punishable by death”?\nPlus, what happened when the mayor-elect of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, met Donald Trump in the White House on Friday? Clips of the meeting quickly went viral, with users commenting on the warmth between the two leaders. Is this the start of a fruitful friendship between Trump and Mamdani - or is it all just for show?\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "10 hours agoJoe McFaddenHealth reporterAn NHS resident doctor has been suspended by a medical tribunal for 15 months after posting alleged antisemitic comments on social media.Dr Rahmeh Aladwan, a 31-year-old trainee trauma and orthopaedic surgeon, was also alleged to have expressed support for \"violent action and terrorist organisations\".The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) said Dr Aladwan's posts \"may impact on patient confidence\" in both her and the profession, while patients could be \"discouraged\" from seeking treatment from her.Dr Aladwan, who is British Palestinian, denies making racist or hate speech.She is currently the subject of a fitness to practise investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC), an independent body that regulates doctors, physician associates and anaesthesia associates to protect patient safety.The GMC began its investigation following complaints that Dr Aladwan had made antisemitic or offensive comments on posts that also appeared to support terrorism.The tribunal heard that Dr Aladwan's alleged posts on X included antisemitic conspiracy theories as well as posts that \"demonise, or express and encourage hatred towards Jews in general, their history and their way of life\".Her lawyer told the tribunal there was \"no evidence\" that her activities have had \"any impact on patient safety or her ability to fulfil her duties as a doctor\".Dr Aladwan's suspension will take effect from today and will be reviewed within six months.The hearing, which took place in Manchester, was an interim orders tribunal (IOT), deciding whether Dr Aladwan's practice should be restricted while the GMC's investigation takes place.It does not rule on the allegations under investigation.In the tribunal's ruling, it said it \"notes that there is no information to suggest that any patient complaints have been raised or that any patients have come to harm\".Dr Aladwan was previously subject to an IOT in September, which determined that no restrictions should be imposed upon her.On 3 October 2025, a decision was made to refer Dr Aladwan's case to an IOT hearing again after the GMC alleged an \"escalation in the tone of Dr Aladwan's social media posts\" following the September ruling and the Manchester synagogue attack in early October.Responding to the tribunal's ruling on X, Dr Aladwan said: \"Let this decision stand as the definitive proof that there is no independent British medical regulation. The 'Israeli' and Jewish lobby decide who can and cannot practise medicine in Britain.\"She added: \"This is not an end. It is the beginning of a far greater battle for the integrity of our institutions.\"The GMC's social media guidance states that medical professionals have the right to \"freedom of belief, privacy, and expression\" but that using social media \"has to be balanced with the possible impact on other people's rights and interests\".",

    "body": "A woman has died and a man has been seriously injured after they were attacked by a shark while swimming at a remote beach in the Australian state of New South Wales.Police said the woman, believed to be aged in her 20s, died at the scene, while the man, also believed to be in his 20s, was airlifted to a hospital in Newcastle in critical condition. Paramedics had been called to Kylies Beach, in Crowdy Bay National Park about 300km north of Sydney, early on Thursday morning local time, police said. Authorities praised a bystander who put a makeshift tourniquet on the man's leg before the paramedics arrived, which \"potentially saved his life\".\"The courage from some bystanders is amazing in this situation,\" NSW Ambulance Superintendent Josh Smyth told reporters.\"To put yourself out there is heroic and obviously it did give us time to get to that male patient.\"The shark involved was likely a \"large bull shark\", the Department of Primary Industries said. Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are \"one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people\", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.The beach has now been closed and \"smart\" drumlines - which lure sharks with baited hooks so they can be tagged and re-released - were being deployed.Surf Life Saving NSW said surrounding beaches would also be closed for 24 hours while drones surveilled the area.\"This is a terrible tragedy and our deepest condolences go to the families of the woman and man involved,\" Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steve Pearce said.\"For now, please remain clear of the water at beaches in the vicinity and follow the direction of lifeguards.\"This is the fifth fatal shark attack in Australia this year. The most recent was less than three months ago, when a man was killed in a rare shark attack in Sydney's northern beaches.",

It was inspired by the strict dress code and atmosphere of London's Blitz Club during the early 1980s.Hogg told the BBC's Kirsty Wark: \"I started making clothes when I was about five years old from all the hand-me-downs from neighbours – more wealthy neighbours but they probably weren't that wealthy, just better off than us. And I was really formulating my look way back then.\"The designer's clothes, as well as her personal visual identity, embraced futuristic beauty looks, bold hair, punk sensibilities, and a strong sense of androgyny.One of her most memorable contributions to fashion is her interpretation of the catsuit.It became a signature statement of her aesthetic and she continued to create catsuits throughout her career for stars such as Minogue, Rihanna and Lady Gaga.Supermodels Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer and singers Jessie J, Björk, Siouxsie Sioux, Grace Jones and Kelly Rowland are among the other stars who wore Hogg's designs over the years.In 1989, Hogg opened her first standalone boutique on Newburgh Street, just off Carnaby Street in London.Princess Diana once wore one of Hogg's dresses, while Princess Eugenie wore one of her custom designs to Ascot in 2013.In 2016, Hogg designed the statuette for the Brit Awards, producing 13 trophies characterised by her distinctive use of glitter and metallic tones.Hogg was a music artist in her own right and supported Debbie Harry of Blondie and The Pogues, before founding the band Doll.

    "body": "15 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterActor Kevin Spacey is set to face civil claims of sexual assault from three men at the High Court in London next October.The men have sued the star, alleging that he assaulted them between 2000 and 2013.At a hearing on Wednesday, a judge suggested a provisional trial date of 12 October 2026. The claims could be heard in a single trial, or in three consecutive trials to hear each case.Mr Spacey denies all allegations of wrongdoing. He has formally denied two of the claims and is yet to file a defence with the court in the third. He was separately cleared of nine sexual offence charges at a criminal trial in 2023.Two of the men who accused the Oscar-winning star during the criminal trial have also filed civil legal cases at the High Court.One man, known only as LNP, alleges that Mr Spacey \"deliberately assaulted\" him on about 12 occasions between 2000 and 2005.Another, referred to as GHI, says he met Mr Spacey through a workshop at London's Old Vic theatre and claims he \"suffered psychiatric damage and financial loss\" as a result of an assault in 2008.Mr Spacey was artistic director of the Old Vic between 2004 and 2013.The man originally sued Mr Spacey in 2022 but his case was paused when the criminal charges were brought.The third man, Ruari Cannon, has waived his right to anonymity.He was in Tennessee Williams' play Sweet Bird of Youth at the Old Vic in 2013, and alleges that Mr Spacey groped him at a party after the show's press night.Mr Cannon took part in a Channel 4 documentary, Spacey Unmasked, in 2024.Mr Spacey said the allegation was \"ridiculous and it never happened\".Elizabeth-Anne Gumbel KC, representing the trio, said in written submissions that the cases should be heard in a single trial to avoid the men and Mr Spacey giving evidence more than once.The US actor has previously admitted \"bad behaviour\" and \"being too handsy\" at times, but said he would not use the word \"grope\" to describe his actions.At his criminal trial in London in 2023, he was acquitted of seven counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.",

    "body": "17 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterForeign tourists visiting popular US national parks like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite will need to pay an extra fee, the Trump administration says.The Department of the Interior, which runs the country's national parks, said each international visitor will need to pay $100 (£76) per person on top of existing fees to access 11 of the most popular sites.From 2026, non-residents will also need to pay more than $250 for an annual pass to the parks, while US citizens and permanent residents will continue to pay $80.The fee hike aims to \"put American families first\" and reflects President Donald Trump's goal to make the parks more accessible and affordable for US citizens, said the department.\"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.The increase will take effect at the start of 2026, alongside the launch of an upgraded online booking system and better access for motorcyclists across the parks.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, \"patriotic fee-free\" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.The fee hike follows an executive order, signed by Trump in July, to raise entrance fees at national parks for overseas visitors. The extra revenue would raise funds for conservation and maintenance at the sites, the White House said at the time - even as the Trump administration planned deep cuts to the Park Service budget.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before.The country's most visited parks include the Everglades in Florida, Yosemite in California and Colorado's Rocky Mountains.",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesA major ransomware attack crippled most of Asahi's factories in JapanJapanese beer giant Asahi revealed on Thursday that a massive cyber-attack in September has potentially leaked the personal information of more than 1.5 million customers.The drinks company published a statement on its investigation into the ransomware attack, which had crippled its operations across its factories in Japan and forced employees to take orders by pen and paper.Asahi said it found that personal details of people who had contacted its customer service centres were likely exposed and that those affected would be notified soon.The firm added that it would delay the release of its full-year financial results to focus on dealing with the fallout of the attack.Asahi did not state the attacker's identity or demands. Ransomware group Qilin - which has previously hacked other major firms - had claimed responsibility for the Asahi attack.The beer maker said in its preliminary findings that it discovered a disruption at one of its data centres on 29 September.It said that although the system was quickly isolated, investigators found the attacker had already infiltrated the network, encrypted its data and deployed ransomware - a virus that blocks access to files until a ransom is paid.Some data in the affected computers, along with personal information stored in the hacked servers, were also potentially exposed, said Asahi.The only confirmed cases of data exposure involved 18 items of employee-related personal information, which were stored on company-issued laptops, Asahi told the BBC.All other personal information involved is regarded as being at risk of possible leakage, it added.It includes personal details of more than 1.52 million customers, specifically their names, gender, addresses and contact information.Data belonging to about 107,000 current and former employees and 168,000 family members of staff were also potentially leaked.The name and contact details of 114,000 external contacts that had communicated with the firm were also linked.Credit card details were not included in Asahi's list of leaked data.The company added that it has not confirmed any evidence of the data being released and that the impact of the attack is limited to systems managed in Japan.The firm also owns big brands in Europe like Peroni and Fuller's Brewery in the UK. Asahi has said that the operations of those firms have not been impacted by the cyber-attack.The company said it spent nearly two months containing the attack and is now working to restore systems and reconfigure its network.Getty ImagesRetailers in Japan warned of beer and drink shortages as Asahi grappled with a major cyber-attack on its operationsThe outage resulted in drink shortages in shops across Japan. Asahi accounts for around 40% of the country's beer market.The shortage also affected Asahi's soft drinks, such as ginger beer and soda water.Shipments are also gradually resuming, said Atsushi Katsuki, the firm's president and chief executive, who apologised for the difficulties caused by the disruption. \"We are making every effort to achieve full system restoration as quickly as possible, while implementing measures to prevent recurrence and strengthening information security across the group.\"Other global brands have also recently experienced similar cyber-attacks.Jaguar Land Rover was forced to tap emergency funding after a major cyber-attack crippled operations at its British factories.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterPeers have been given an extra 10 days to scrutinise the assisted dying bill, after a record number of amendments prompted concerns it would run out of time to be passed into law.The bill was backed by MPs in a historic vote in June and is now in its final stages in the House of Lords, where peers must agree the wording of the legislation for the bill to become law.There are fears opponents are trying to talk out the bill by lodging a record number of requests for changes, and making very slow progress in discussing them. With the legislation having been drafted as a private member's bill by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, there is a hard deadline on when agreement must be reached with peers.Approval for the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would need to be approved by both the Commons and the Lords before spring when the current session of Parliament ends.If passed, it would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales with fewer than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval by two doctors and a panel featuring a social worker, senior legal figure and psychiatrist.Critics and opponents of the bill have insisted the legislation requires significant re-drafting to ensure any system properly protects vulnerable people.However, peers had managed to discuss fewer than 30 of the more than 1,000 amendments lodged after two of the four days reserved for committee stage, when the bill is scrutinised line-by-line.With only two more sessions scheduled before the end of the year, Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with cancer, last week warned peers not to \"sabotage democracy\".Leadbeater has also shared her concern that \"some of the processes and procedures that can be used are being used to frustrate the bill, and that is deeply disappointing and upsetting\".Now, the government's chief whip in the Lords has announced 10 extra Fridays will be given for debate in the Lords, spread over a number of weeks in the New Year between 9 January and 24 April.Lord Roy Kennedy said it is \"clear the House needs additional time to scrutinise the Bill\" given the high number of amendments.He said: \"I have always been clear that as this government is neutral on the Bill any additional time will not come from government time.\"I also believe given the importance of the subject and the number of colleagues wishing to participate, that this scrutiny could not take place in the Grand Committee, as some have suggested to me.\"I have therefore arranged for the House to sit on an additional eight additional Fridays in the New Year in addition to the three Fridays already announced.\"He added the government is not trying to \"prescribe\" how the Bill will progress, given its neutral stance.Welcoming the decision, backbencher Leadbeater said she was pleased extra days had been granted to deal with the large number of amendments.\"It is right that peers use their expertise and experience to properly scrutinise the Bill and propose improvements to strengthen it where necessary,\" she said.\"These extra days provide an unprecedented amount of debating time for a private members' bill.  \"There is little doubt that these days, used responsibly and constructively, will allow the Bill progress through the Lords and enable Parliament to give dying people choice and dignity in their final days and protect their loved ones from the threat of prosecution.\"Lord Charlie Falconer, who is steering the Bill through the Lords, said the extra dates mean that up to 24 April, there will have been 16 days for consideration of the legislation in the Lords.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "50 minutes agoJames ChaterWatch: US President Donald Trump says alleged gunman was Afghan nationalThe US has suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, after an Afghan man was identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services said the decision was made pending a review of \"security and vetting protocols\".The suspect of Wednesday's shooting, which left two National Guard members critically injured, is said to have arrived in the US from Afghanistan in September 2021.US President Donald Trump said the attack was an \"act of terror\", adding that he would take steps to remove foreigners \"from any country who does not belong here\". Tens of thousands of Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections following the chaotic US withdrawal from the country in 2021 under former President Joe Biden.The Department of Homeland Security named the suspect in a press release as Rahmanullah Lakamal, \"a criminal alien from Afghanistan\". An official has told the BBC's US news partner CBS that he applied for asylum in 2024, and his application was granted earlier this year.The 29-year-old is understood to have entered the country under the programme called Operation Allies Welcome. Trump said following the shooting that the US \"must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden\".The Joint Task Force DC, which is co-ordinating the National Guard deployments to the nation's capital, said the attack took place at around 14:15 EST (17:15 GMT) on Wednesday near the Farragut Square Metro Station.The soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets - a busy lunch spot for office workers.Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Jeff Carroll said the suspect \"came around the corner\" and \"immediately started firing\", adding that the soldiers had been \"ambushed\".ReutersSecurity officials cordoned off the scene of the attack near the White House in Washington DC on WednesdayOther National Guard members nearby heard the gunfire and intervened, holding the suspect down until police arrived, he said.The suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS.Thousands of National Guard soldiers from across the US have been deployed to Washington DC to tackle what Trump has described as \"out of control\" crime.There have been similar deployments in other cities across the US, which have faced legal challenges by opponents who accuse the Trump administration of overreach.Trump imposed a travel ban on nationals of Afghanistan - and 11 other countries - earlier this year.Afghan nationals holding Special Immigration Visas - available to those who worked directly with the US military and feared retribution from the Taliban as a result of that co-operation - were among a few exceptions to the sweeping bans. The Taliban returned to power following the US withdrawal in 2021.Trump has also ended a programme that granted deportation protections for thousands of people from Afghanistan.The temporary protected status programme allowed migrants to get work permits if the US government deemed it unsafe for them to return to their home countries due to war.",

    "body": "3 hours agoWall-to-wall coverage of the Budget dominates the daily papers, unpacking the tax and spend measures announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in the Commons. \"High welfare, high tax\" is the Times's take, saying Reeves will \"raise taxes to the highest levels in history\". The paper explains \"one in four taxpayers, equivalent to 10.6m people, will be higher or additional-rate taxpayers by 2030\". It includes the Office For Budget Responsibility (OBR)'s forecast, which says \"the rises would hit living standards and could 'constrain economic activity'\".\"Budget goes as billed\" is the Metro's take. \"You're paying!\", it adds, writing the chancellor \"will make working people pay £26bn more tax – a year after vowing no rises\". The paper recounts a \"clanger by the Office for Budget Responsibility which posted its verdict on [the chancellor's] plan 40 minutes too early\". It caused a \"brief stock market roller-coaster\", it reports, with the Conservatives demanding \"a criminal investigation\".The Financial Times focuses on reaction to the Budget, citing official forecasts and economist views, while underlining it \"smashes tax records\" in the headline. \"The OBR said a weaker outlook and rising tax burden would squeeze household finances,\" the paper says. Meanwhile, it writes the \"bond markets welcome decision to increase Exchequer's fiscal headroom\".\"Spend now, pay later\" is the i Paper's take, as the chancellor lays out plans to \"boost benefits and tackle UK black hole\". The paper quotes Reeves saying \"ordinary people\" must \"pay a little bit more\" as \"1.8m workers are dragged into a higher income tax band\". \"Millions more to pay higher income tax\" is the Independent's headline and key takeaway. The chancellor confirms \"43 tax increases to raise a record extra £26bn\". It says Reeves \"scrapped\" the two-child benefit cap, adding £9bn to welfare spending.The Daily Mail describes Reeves's measures as \"spiteful raids on strivers\", referring to what it calls a \"Budget shambles\" and saying the chancellor's message is \"if you work hard and save prudently, I'm coming for you\".Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's assessment leads the Daily Express: \"A Budget for benefit street\". She believes the new measures will hit \"hard-working Britons\" hardest as the government looks to \"increase welfare spending to £406bn by 2030-31\" for measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap.The Sun headlines on what it calls a \"benefits street\" Budget, saying: \"Workers and savers were clobbered... to fund the ballooning welfare bill\". The Tories now accuse the chancellor of breaking \"Labour's manifesto promises\", it writes, and says Rachel Reeves has \"refused to rule out further punishing hikes\".Photoshop, or another image-altering programme, has assisted the Daily Star in portraying Reeves as the Christmas Grinch on its front page, a grumpy green-skin fictional character who \"stole Christmas\" in its eponymous film. The Star nicknames the chancellor \"Rachel Thieves\", accusing her of delivering a Budget that is \"all tax, tax, tax, and spend, spend, spend\".\"Budget with a Labour heart\" is the Daily Mirror's take, saying it was \"crafted with ordinary people in mind\". The paper calls the two-child benefit cap \"cruel\", saying the policy \"trapped 450,000 kids in poverty\". It also writes that \"Reeves hiked gambling taxes and placed a levy on homeowners with £2 million properties\".The Daily Telegraph says Reeves's fiscal statement contain \"broken promises\", including a \"new tax on homes worth more than £2m\" and other measure it says will affect \"pensions and savings\". Reeves gave \"assurances\" after the last Budget's \"£40bn of tax rises\" there would be \"no further increases before the next election\", according to the paper.The Guardian leads by quoting the chancellor saying \"I am asking everyone to make a contribution\" and later explaining that this was \"to repair the public finances\". Reeves says she \"avoided reckless borrowing and dangerous cuts\", while the paper notes the tax share as a proportion of GDP will hit an \"all-time high of 38%\" by 2030.\"Chancellor wallops workers\", declares the Sun, while the Times opts for \"high welfare, high tax\", as the front pages deliver their verdicts on the Budget. Contained in what the Daily Telegraph describes as a \"red box of broken promises\", the paper says Rachel Reeves delivered a £30bn package of tax increases \"largely targeting the middle classes\". The Daily Mail is damning, accusing her of \"spiteful raids on strivers – to lavish billions on benefits street\".The Guardian quotes the chancellor's words at the despatch box: \"I am asking everyone to make a contribution\" in its headline. The Daily Mirror's assessment is that it was a Budget \"with a Labour heart\", praising the decision to end what it calls the \"cruel\" two-child benefit cap. The i Paper and the Financial Times are among the front pages to highlight one of the risks of Ms Reeves' plan, with both quoting analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that she has opted for a \"spend now, pay later\" approach.\"Despite all of the promises\", says the leader in the Daily Express, \"Labour did what it always does, put up taxes\". The editorial in the Times strikes a similar tone saying that \"finally the veil has been lifted\", to reveal \"an unreconstructed throwback to the 1970s\" with taxation funding an evermore burdensome welfare state. The Daily Telegraph points out it should all come as \"little surprise\" that a socialist government is \"wedded to taxing, spending and borrowing\".The Guardian says the Budget \"has done its job politically\" -- and that \"whispers\" around the prime minister and chancellor's future \"have subsided\". The Daily Mail also suggests Rachel Reeves will \"live to fight another day\" despite the entire Budget being leaked by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Financial Times hedges its bets on the chancellor's future: \"this may have been Reeves' last budget\", the paper says, before speculating that \"if all else fails, there should be an opening in the OBR's IT department\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "13 hours agoColette HumeBBC WalesGwent PoliceAntonio Villafane has been jailed for eight years for his treatment of Sally Ann NormanWarning: This story contains details of physical and emotional abuse.A man who subjected his partner to seven years of violent abuse, leaving her homeless, penniless and suicidal, has been jailed for eight years.Antonio Villafane, from Tintern, Monmouthshire, imprisoned Sally Ann Norman in a caravan, forced her to wear a full face covering to hide her bruises and spent her £280,000 divorce settlement.The 67-year-old was found guilty of coercive control, strangulation, unlawful wounding, actual bodily harm and fraud.At Newport Crown Court, Judge Daniel Williams told Villafane, also known as Anthony Manson: \"You worked your way through the domestic abuser's playbook.\"The couple lived off-grid in a caravan near Tintern after meeting in 2015 as Mrs Norman's 25-year marriage was ending.A jury was told the nurse and therapist, now 64, escaped from him in July 2022 after he tried to strangle her during her 61st birthday meal.Judge Williams said Villafane charmed his partner and pretended to be caring and generous.In a statement to the court, Mrs Norman said she felt \"guilt and shame\" about \"being led down the garden path\" by Villafane.Their relationship had developed quickly, she told the court, and within seven years he had isolated her from her parents, children and friends.He would not allow her to attend a memorial service for her father in Edinburgh and took her mobile phone away, telling her it was a privilege that had to be earned.Their isolated lifestyle meant he could abuse her in secret, the court heard.She told police she was punched, kicked and hit with a walking stick and made to stay in the caravan they lived in for hours, often without food and water.She has since been diagnosed with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and the injuries he inflicted have left her walking with a stick because of balance issues.He spent her £280,000 divorce settlement and beat and imprisoned herShe recalled Villafane tying her up and pushing her head into a dirty water-filled toolbox until she almost passed out.He once forced her to stand naked in the cold and dark and \"pray for forgiveness\", a jury was told.The court heard he has 15 convictions from 37 offences going back to 1971  including violence, fraud, theft, drugs, offensive weapons and public disorder.This year, he was convicted of animal cruelty for not ensuring the welfare of a horse.Martha Smith-Higgins, defending, said Villafane had a previous diagnosis of personality disorder with psychotic features.In addition to the prison sentence, Villafane was given an indefinite restraining order, barring him from contacting Mrs Norman and those close to her.Judge Williams told Villafane: \"You chose not to give evidence or subject yourself to the discomfort of scrutiny.\"Like any hard work, you left giving evidence to Sally Ann.\"You remained in the dock, relying on your lies in your police interview that she was delusional and you had only tried to help her grow.\"The effect on her is hard to put into words. The effect is difficult to overstate.\"You set out to ruin her life and in many ways her life lies in ruins.\"If you have been affected by any issues in this report, help and support is available on the BBC Action Line.More top stories",

    "body": "8 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe chancellor has announced her Budget which includes a freeze to income tax thresholds, a rise in minimum wages and a so-called milkshake tax.Here are several ways Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Budget might affect you if you are 25 or under.Minimum wage workers will benefitMinimum wages will go up from April with 18 to 20-year-olds getting the biggest pay rise.Their hourly rate will go up by 85p to £10.85, while under-18s and apprentices will see a 45p uplift to £8 an hour. Over-21s will get a rise of 50p per hour to £12.71.Reeves said 2.7 million people will benefit from these increases.More broadly, the government is trying to bring minimum wages for 18 to 20-year-olds in line with workers aged 21 and over.But businesses have warned that the increases could push up prices and lead to a freeze on hiring.Think tank the Resolution Foundation said the \"unnecessarily big\" rise for under-21s specifically could make it harder for 18 to 20-year-olds to find work.Student loan repayment thresholds frozenThe chancellor has frozen the threshold at which student loans must be paid back from 2027-28.The threshold is currently £28,470 for those with loans taken out from September 2012 onwards in England or Wales.This means each year, workers earning above that amount will be dragged into making larger repayments on their student loans than they would have if thresholds rose in line with inflation.Student loan repayments typically amount to 9% of their incomes over a given threshold each month.Reeves also unveiled a new international student levy, which will see universities charged £925 per overseas student per year from August 2028, with an exemption for 220 students per year.The income raised by the levy will be used to fund maintenance grants for disadvantaged students studying so-called priority courses such as university degrees and technical qualifications.Budget 2025Private renters expected to be hit  The chancellor made an appeal to renters in her Budget speech, saying it is unfair that income from work is taxed more than income made by landlords.Reeves set out plans to raise the tax rate on income from properties by 2%.But the changes risked contributing to \"a steady long-term rise in rents\", the official forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned.This is because landlords may leave the private rental market, limiting supply and pushing up prices for renters, it said.Young people will be helped into workThe chancellor set aside £1.5bn over the next five years to help 16 to 24-year-olds into work or training.Reeves said £820m will go towards her guarantee to offer paid work placements to young people who have been out of work, education or training for 18 months.It is part of a drive by the government to reduce the number of people out of work, with those who refuse to take up the offer facing the threat of being stripped of their benefits.A further £725m will go towards making the training of under-25 apprentices free for small and medium sized firms.Getty ImagesSome online shopping to get more expensiveThe chancellor's decision to scrap a tax loophole on small parcels could see some online shopping get more expensive from 2029.The \"de minimis\" loophole allows overseas retailers to send goods to the UK worth up to £135 without incurring customs duty.British retailers have been highly critical of the loophole, arguing it undercuts high street firms, and wanted the change to be introduced sooner.It means brands that benefit from this loophole, like Shein and Temu, are likely to up their prices when it’s closed. Iced lattes and fizzy drinks to fall under sugar taxIf you grab a pre-made latte with your lunch or a protein shake on the way back from the gym you could be hit by the so-called milkshake tax.Pre-packaged milkshakes and coffees with high sugar content will face an extra tax from 2028.The threshold at which the sugar levy applies will be 4.5g of sugar per 100ml, down from 5g.The change, part of a bid to tackle childhood obesity, could mean an extra tax on popular products like Yazoo, Muller's Frijj and Starbucks Caffe Latte as well as drinks branded \"high protein\" like Ufit and Shaken Udder.First-time buyers to be helped with savings Reeves promised a \"new, simpler\" way to help first-time buyers onto the property ladder.There will be a consultation in early 2026 on what could be a replacement for the Lifetime Isa (Lisa).Anyone under 40 can open a Lisa to either help save towards retirement or buy a first home. Savers can put in up to £4,000 a year and the government will top it up by 25%.Frequent complaints about the Lisa include that savers face a penalty for withdrawing money early, meaning they could lose 6.25% of their own savings.Critics have also called for the £450,000 threshold for properties eligible to be purchased using a Lisa to be increased, having been unchanged since 2017.The consultation could also see the retirement aspect of Lisas removed in favour of focusing solely on first-time buyers.Rail fares in England frozenIf you use trains or buses to get about then the good news is fares won't be going up for now.For the first time in three decades, the chancellor announced that regulated rail fares in England will be frozen until March 2027.Typically the fares, which include season tickets for most commuter routes, are uprated in line with inflation plus 1%. The most recent increase, in March 2025, was 4.6%.The bus fare cap of £3 for a single journey, covering most bus journeys in England, is already in place until March 2027.",

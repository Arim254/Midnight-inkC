    "body": "7 hours agoLaura KuenssbergSunday with Laura KuenssbergBBCIs there a boys' club in politics? I ask a smart, tough, very experienced woman who has worked at the highest level of government.\"Yes,\" comes the answer - without a second's hesitation. \"The end.\"Yes, many more women than ever have taken up perches on the green benches - but that's not the same as having access to the inner sanctum where decisions are made.Yes, there are many more women working at senior levels in Whitehall - and all the main parties have made big efforts to get more women into parliament. But that's not the same as being listened to.And yes, as part of Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to prop up his administration, three senior men have used the exit – the boss of the civil service, his chief of staff, and his head of communications, to be replaced, at least in part, by women.But this week, a serving member of the cabinet, Lisa Nandy, suggested Labour had been operating as a \"boys' club\" and went on to complain \"some of the briefings have absolutely been dripping with misogyny\".Don't just casually ignore one of Labour's most senior politicians suggesting - quite openly - that a clique of men have had too much sway in government, and some of them have used woman-hating as a political tool.But what is the \"boys' club\" and how big a problem is it for Sir Keir?\"Massive,\" says one minister.PA WireDeputy leader Lucy Powell is the second-highest ranking politician in the Labour PartyIt's more than 100 years since the first woman took her seat as an MP - there weren't even women's loos when Nancy Astor arrived. She's said to have nipped down to the Ritz to use the facilities before a ladies' toilet was installed in Parliament's neo-gothic palace.More than 100 years later, Rachel Reeves arrived in the Treasury in 2024 to find a urinal in the chancellor's bathroom - that shows how long it has taken for women to get access to all areas of politics.Loos aside, one former Labour minister tells me the so-called \"boys' club\" is a particular problem for Starmer because, \"You have a prime minister who is not very political, so he has had to rely very heavily on the network that he has - which is the boys' network. He has been unable to see the pitfalls or the issues or problems of it\".There was even, one cabinet minister says, a \"whole network of Matts\". Others have joked before about the \"boys in blue suits\", or the \"ladz\" (yes, with a z), a group whose hero was Morgan McSweeney, the departed chief of staff.But there have been plenty of women at senior levels in and around Starmer's operation – the home secretary Shabana Mahmood, the foreign secretary Yvette Cooper, the general secretary of the Labour Party Hollie Ridley, some of the press team, and, of course, his chancellor.ReutersLabour peer Harriet Harman is urging the prime minister to name a woman as his first secretary of stateOne insider and Starmer ally told me that \"boys' club\" perception is \"totally unfair on all the brilliant women\" who have been involved. Another senior figure said they were \"boiling with rage\" when that accusation had been chucked around.Yet senior sources suggest No 10 has sometimes made it difficult for the very senior female ministers to get \"face time\" with the prime minister – access is one of the most precious commodities in politics.There does, at least for now, seem a determination that things will change with a new interim female chief of staff and a female political director in post.\"It probably doesn't exist anymore – because a lot of the people that gave rise to some of that culture have gone now,\" says a cabinet minister.But they suggest the perception of the \"boys' club\" was also a shorthand for something else. \"It wasn't just a boys' club, it was a factional group as well\".One veteran Labour figure told me: \"Not only is there a boys' club, but the most important thing is that there are all these cliques and all these factions that just don't talk to each other - people get together and talk to people only in their bubble.\"That is what has led to so many mistakes, many of Starmer's internal critics say.ReutersMorgan McSweeney quit as chief of staff after mounting scrutiny over his role in Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK ambassador to the USHe relied on too small a group of advisers, who came from one, more hard-edged wing of the Labour Party, favoured by Morgan McSweeney, and stuck his fingers in his ears to a wider range of views – it was about one faction dominating, not the deliberate exclusion of females.One Whitehall insider who deals with Downing Street said: \"It means you're not getting the best people if you exclude anyone, for any reason. It's not woke, it's just making sure you get the best people when it comes to the government.\"There are promises the prime minister will listen to a wider range of views, more voices from different parts of the party. Some are trying, very obviously, to make sure they get more of a look in from now.At the start of the week, Ed Miliband said the prime minister had to be \"bold\" and he wanted to focus on class. On Thursday Angela Rayner said the government had to do more for the hospitality industry, and Lisa Nandy made her remarks about misogyny and the \"unforgivable\" turmoil in government.One senior Labour politician warns against any attempt to brush off women's concerns by saying it's all about warring factions, telling me: \"It's not good enough to just say it's because people oppose Keir or Morgan's agenda - that gives them an excuse to not do anything and that would be hopeless\".And after the last few weeks, there are specific calls from women in the Labour Party for an inquiry into the behaviour of the late Mohammed Al Fayed, and a woman to be given the cabinet post as first secretary of state.PA WireOthers are sceptical – suggesting plenty of MPs have tried, and been disappointed, for years to get the party leadership to look outside its own narrow group.One told me: \"We would say, 'Why don't you engage with women? Why wouldn't you engage with backbenchers?' They just looked utterly baffled  - he wouldn't engage.\"Let's see. Does Westminster have a wider problem when it comes to how women are treated?There are far too many examples of sleazy or improper behaviour, or harassment. It is still a late-night working culture where the line between what's social and what's professional can be blurred, and power swirls around along with the warm white wine.As an experienced former cabinet minister admits, \"if you are a junior female in Westminster you can still find yourself in uncomfortable situations\" - or, for that matter, a young male staffer too.But the atmosphere, and what is considered acceptable, has completely transformed in recent years.Leaving aside behaviour that is clearly improper, are there features of the way the system works that make it not, perhaps one big giant boys' club, but a place that's easier for men?PA WireLisa Nandy has been culture secretary since 2024Let's spare the blushes of the frontbencher who asked a senior female adviser to get him a cup of coffee during the milling around before cabinet. She told him to get his own. He was mortified minutes later when the prime minister of the day called on her to answer the first question during the meeting.Politics is certainly not the only business where old-fashioned assumptions are still made, women are paid less, or find it harder to progress and are sometimes overlooked.But as one former cabinet minister suggests, perhaps, \"it's not deliberate, but the culture is just so male. There are a lot of what you'd call male characteristics that are deemed to be what you need to get on: saying you have all the answers, briefing against people who aren't doing what you want\", referring specifically to a combative way of doing interviews where \"No 10 comms would be yelling at you for not pushing back, when it's just not the way women operate\".A hugely experienced female party activist suggests politics, fundamentally, is just more attractive to men, some of whom just see \"women are like blobs, the men just hang out together, and they like risk more than women do. It goes back to the days when they went off and killed tigers, and it is in our DNA to be more risk averse\".You might raise your eyebrows, but votes need to be won. That means rivals need to be beaten.One senior Labour figure describes it as \"gang warfare\", saying, \"you rely on people who have been in the trenches with you and been through battles and that means you are exclusive rather than inclusive\".\"Does that mean people you need in the room to make decisions are not there? Does that mean women? Yes, but that is life.\"ReutersAngela Rayner resigned as deputy prime minister and housing secretary after failing to pay enough tax on a flat in HoveThat remark might drive some people round the twist. Perhaps that is about as honest an admission about why things sometimes work the way they do in SW1 as you're going to get.And there is widespread agreement in Westminster that women are so often held to different standards than the men they sit alongside. That's not new.We are a long way since the first female prime minister made time to iron her husband's shirts, and be pictured doing it. But despite record representation of women, parity seems way off. Whether it's how they look, how they act, what they wear, the lens applied to women is different.A senior Labour figure accepts Angela Rayner made mistakes in her tax affairs, but suggests she's always been treated more harshly than a man would have been in her position.\"She does manoeuvre, but she is also uncompromising and lives her life, has never changed her accent. And some of the men can't cope with that.\"Another source points to how Starmer's new pick for cabinet secretary, Dame Antonia Romeo, has been briefed against and written about in acid terms in the last few days. It's like, \"How dare she be glamorous? All the bits they talk about - her ambition, in any man those would be seen as strengths. But because it's her, it's used against her\". An investigation into one formal complaint against Romeo alleging bullying concluded there was no case to answer.\"The smears being thrown against her are reprehensible and hypocritical,\" Rupert McNeil, former head of HR at the Civil Service said recently.But does the notion of the \"boys' club\" really make a difference? In a narrow way, it does right now, because dismantling the perception of it, and listening to a wider range of his colleagues is one of the tasks Starmer's been set by his own MPs.It matters profoundly that one half of the population, the narrow majority after all, is fairly represented by the politicians we choose to serve us.And it matters too when it comes to having different perspectives in the rooms where decisions are taken.It's a matter of public record, from the second most senior civil servant in the country during the pandemic, that a lack of women in the room affected the decisions taken during an emergency.Helen McNamara, who spoke to us about the Covid inquiry on Newscast, said there'd been a lack of thought about childcare during school closures, how domestic violence victims could be trapped during lockdown, and too much attention paid to how it affected more male pursuits - hunting, shooting and fishing.Another source told me opening up car showrooms and golf courses was considered before thinking about kids' playgrounds.Before you scream, of course issues like childcare, education and domestic violence affect men, and not just women. Of course, neither men nor women all care about the same things. But one activist who has been around for many years relates: \"I'm still a woman in a man's world. I count every meeting - there are 45 men and five women. They never count, or say, 'Hang on, we need some women around to see their point of view.' They don't think about it\".The numbers aren't always so outrageously heavily skewed. There has been enormous progress in the numbers of female politicians, senior civil servants, and in other parts of public life too.But as another Whitehall insider suggests: \"The habits of Westminster were set when nearly all politicians were men, nearly all journalists were men, and nearly all civil servants were men\".And it was the decision to appoint Peter Mandelson that has prompted this bout of soul searching about women's role in government, with some convinced Starmer would simply never have got into this mess if he'd included women in the decision. One senior figure said: \"At the heart of that decision was misogyny – it required you to think that the Epstein victims were neither here nor there\".Men may no longer always be in such a majority, but perhaps old habits formed years ago, really do die hard. If Starmer really wants to change the perception, the pressure is on him to respond.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Alpine skiing: Men's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Switzerland's Marco Odermatt has claimed four successive World Cups in this event and is attempting to do something that not even greats like Marcel Hirscher and Hermann Maier could manage – back-to-back Olympic gold medals in giant slalom. The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian – Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 – so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held. Tabby Stoecker and Freya Tarbit sit fifth and sixth after the opening two runs, but may struggle to force themselves onto the podium.  Alpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.The first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

    "body": "Ex-Reform MP Rupert Lowe launches new party9 hours agoPA MediaRupert Lowe was elected as Reform UK MP for Great Yarmouth in July 2024 but now sits as an independentA former Reform UK MP, who is now serving as an independent, has launched a new political party.Rupert Lowe, who represents Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, launched Restore Britain, which he said would be a \"national political party\", on Friday night.He initially set up Restore Britain as a \"political movement\" after he was suspended from Reform UK last March.It is now expected to act as an umbrella political party, with locally based political parties as partners.Lowe, a businessman and farmer who used to be chairman of Southampton FC, is expected to stand again for the Great Yarmouth constituency with local party Great Yarmouth First, which will be a partner of Restore Britain.Senior Conservative figures Susan Hall and Sir Gavin Williamson had been involved in an advisory board for Restore Britain when it was described as a political movement.Former minister Sir Gavin suggested to the Press Association he would end his involvement with Restore Britain as a result of it becoming a political party.Hall, the Tory leader in the London Assembly, is also understood to be leaving Restore Britain's board.The BBC's East of England political editor, Andrew Sinclair, said Lowe had a reputation for being a bit of a \"maverick MP\". \"He's not very collegiate, which was one reason why he left Reform UK,\" he said.\"He also believes, more than many, that there is a real disconnect between mainstream politicians and the public - and he points to his Great Yarmouth constituency as proof that he is right.\"There haven't been any elections in the town since he left Reform but anecdotally he seems to have a lot of support. I have been shown private polling by both Labour and his own people which suggest that he would do well if an election was held now.\"He believes that in a crowded marketplace there is room for another party, on the right, which will pride itself on its independence of mind. \"He had hoped his local creation Great Yarmouth First would make its mark in this year's local elections, but they have been cancelled. This new party will aim to pick up national support.\"More related stories",

    "body": "8 hours agoMegan BonarBBC ScotlandGetty ImagesScottish craft beer giant Brewdog could be sold off after bosses called in financial experts to look for new investors.Consultants AlixPartners have been brought in to oversee the sales process which could lead to the businesses being broken up.Brewdog, which was founded by friends James Watt and Martin Dickie in 2007, has breweries and pubs around the globe, including about 60 in the the UK.The company said it had taken the decision after \"operating in a challenging economic climate\" in order to focus on the \"long-term strength and sustainably\" of the company.A spokesperson for Brewdog said: \"Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business.\"This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the Brewdog brand and its operations.\"The spokesperson added they expect to attract \"substantial interest\" and breweries and bars will continue to operate as normal.AlixPartners refused to comment on the sales process.In an email to staff, which has been seen by BBC Scotland News, Brewdog said: \"AlixPartners are specialists in business performance and transformation, and they will work alongside the leadership team in the coming weeks to evaluate options and make recommendations, including assessing the next phase of investment in the business.\"It is important to stress this is a normal and prudent step, and no decisions have been made. This does not change our day-to-day operations, our roles or our immediate plans. Our bars and breweries continue to operate as normal, and our focus remains on brewing world-class beer, serving our customers brilliantly and supporting our teams.\"Last month, the company halted production of gin and vodka brands at its distillery in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, in order to \"sharpen\" the businesses focus.Earlier in the year it announced the closure of 10 bars across the UK, including its flagship pub in Aberdeen.The company currently employs around 1,400 people and has breweries in Ellon as well as in the US, Australia and Germany.In recent years it has made headlines for its marketing campaigns and workplace culture.In 2024, the firm faced a backlash after revealing it would no longer hire new staff on the real living wage, instead paying the lower legal minimum wage.Watt later stood down as chief executive officer and moved to a newly-created position of \"captain and co-founder\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesThe event was due to take place over five days in late FebruaryAn annual cigar festival in Cuban capital Havana has become the latest casualty of a fuel shortage caused by a US oil blockade.The organising committee of the Festival del Habano announced on Saturday that this year's event - which was due to take place over five days in late February - would be postponed until further notice. It said the decision was motivated \"by the complex economic situation\" facing Cuba due to the \"economic, commercial and financial blockade\" by the US.A fuel shortage causing power cuts on the Caribbean island has been worsened by the US seizing oil shipments from Cuba's long-standing ally Venezuela.Cuba also has a shortage of aviation fuel, leading several airlines to suspend services there, while some countries, including the UK, have warned against non-essential travel to the island.Cuban cigars are regarded as among the finest in the world, but are illegal in the US due to long-standing American trade embargoes. More than 1,300 people from around 70 countries are estimated to attend the Habano Festival each year to sample cigars from Cuba's producers, as well as visit tobacco plantations and factories.With international tourism to the island nation limited by the US embargo, the festival's organisers said they hoped to wait until conditions had improved.The organising committee said it was working on setting a new date, which has yet to be announced.\"The priority of the Habano Festival is to offer its participants a comprehensive experience at the height of the relevance and prestige that this event represents internationally,\" it said.\"The postponement of this celebration is a measure aimed at protecting this experience.\"Venezuela was previously believed to have sent around 35,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba before the US military seized former president Nicolás Maduro on 3 January.Power cuts lasting up to 18 hours a day have since affected hospital emergency wards, dialysis patients and pumping stations.US President Donald Trump has urged Cuban leaders to \"make a deal\" or face unspecified consequences.UN human rights experts have described Washington's restrictions on Cuba's oil imports as an \"extreme form of unilateral economic coercion\".The US and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the communist Fidel Castro overthrew a US-backed government in 1959. US economic and trade embargoes on Cuba have been in place since 1960.While steps were taken to improve diplomatic relations, particularly under former US President Barack Obama, the Trump administration has reversed many of these moves.",

    "body": "8 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondent, reporting from MunichReutersThe US Secretary of State said America and Europe's destiny were closely linked during a closely watched address in MunichWorld leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have been gathering in Munich for Europe's biggest security and defence conference. The burning question on everyone's minds: is the US still an ally of Europe?The keynote speech that everyone was waiting for was from Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. Would he repeat the attacks made on Europe last year by the US Vice-President JD Vance? Or would he be conciliatory?The hall was packed to the rafters. Generals and admirals, bemedalled in their uniforms, prime ministers and presidents, diplomats, ambassadors, US Congressmen and women, European politicians and their Spads - all waiting nervously to hear what President Donald Trump's top diplomat had to say.The applause did not come straight away. In fact, for the first few minutes, as Rubio got into his stride, it began to sound very much like a repeat attack on Europe. Free trade, mass migration, green policies on climate change – all came in for sharp criticism. World leaders gather in Munich for high-level security talks - follow liveHe even talked about \"a climate cult\" that was harming America's economy, while he went on to slam the United Nations, saying it had failed to resolve the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. The US secretary of state, impeccably neat and groomed, stood with one hand casually in his trouser pocket, delivering this from a prepared script at a podium.But then he spoke the words everyone in the room wanted to hear: \"Our destiny will always be intertwined with yours (in Europe).\"\"The end of the transatlantic era,\" he went on to say, \"is neither our goal nor our wish... we will always be a child of Europe\".Rubio spoke of \"unshackling creativity\", of shared goals in securing supply chains for critical minerals, and of the European culture he so admired, a continent that had given the world Shakespeare, Mozart and the Rolling Stones (he got a muffled laugh for that). But there was a sting in the tail. What we have together, he said, was unique and \"we in the US have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline\".So what did people make of this? It was broadly positive – about half the audience stood up at the end to applaud him. There was certainly a palpable sense of relief that after all the upsets of the last few months, with tariffs and the threat of a US grab for Greenland, the transatlantic alliance was not dead.\"It was a good speech,\" Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, told me afterwards. \"I think the Europeans sighed with relief because it was saying that Europe is important, that Europe and America are very intertwined and good allies, and have been for so long and will be in the future.\"She did not deny, though, that there remain real differences in policy in some areas between Washington and Europe. And while both sides agree that Europe needs to shoulder much more of the burden for its own defence, I have encountered some quiet exasperation here in Munich at Trump's refusal to put enough pressure on Russia to end the Ukraine war, that is poised to enter its fifth, bloody year.",

    "body": "3 hours agoZahra FatimaPA MediaBishop Richard Moth during his installation Mass as the 12th Archbishop of WestminsterThe newly appointed leader of Catholics in England and Wales has acknowledged the failures of the Church \"especially when the vulnerable have been abused\" during his formal installation ceremony.Archbishop Richard Moth also paid tribute to the struggles faced by refugees and reaffirmed the need to listen to victims of abuse as he was formally installed at Westminster Cathedral.As the 12th Archbishop of Westminster, he succeeds Cardinal Vincent Nichols, who stepped down aged 80 in December after serving 16 years in office.Also in attendance was the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Dame Sarah Mullally, who welcomed Moth's appointment, praising his \"deep concern for the dignity of every person\".As part of the symbolic rites of taking office the archbishop knelt at the Great West Door of the central London cathedral before blessing a line of people with holy water and processing down the nave.As Archbishop of Westminster, the cleric has become the president of the Bishops' Conference of England and Wales and leads an estimated four million Catholics.Prior to his appointment, Moth served for a decade as Bishop of Arundel and Brighton. Following his official naming by the Vatican in December, he pledged his continuous focus on areas of social justice and accountability.Addressing a 2,000 strong congregation of Catholic faithful, the new archbishop pointed to the Church's \"vital\" evangelical work which he acknowledged was \"fragile\" and had been \"adversely impacted by our failures in love, power and self control\".He said: \"Here, I am most aware of every occasion on which members of the Church, or the Church as a whole, have failed - most especially when the vulnerable have been abused.\"The archbishop said that such failures call for \"listening to\" and \"learning\" from \"those who have suffered so grievously\", adding: \"We need not fear the great questions of our time: the need for all peoples to live in peace; the value and dignity of every person; the right to life at every stage; the protection of the vulnerable; the plight of the refugee and the dispossessed; and the protection of our common home.\"\"I very much look forward to working with you to deepen our relationships and to strengthen our shared Christian witness,\" she told her new Catholic counterpart.",

    "body": "20 hours agoMadeline HalpertandSakshi VenkatramanGetty ImagesJames Van Der Beek kept working after being diagnosed with cancerActor James Van Der Beek seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s and 2000s. With the title role in coming-of-age teen drama Dawson's Creek, he walked some of the industry's hottest red carpets, and his face plastered magazine covers - one even dubbing him a \"new superstar\".But when tragedy struck later in life, his family needed to rely on the kindness of his friends - and fans - for financial help, shedding light on the precarious situation of not just many actors, no matter how famous, but millions of everyday Americans struggling with medical bills.Van Der Beek - who had six children with his wife - died on Wednesday at the age of 48 after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer three years ago.The cost of his medical treatments were so financially draining, his wife says, that she has now made a public plea for donations so they would not lose their home. They have raised $2.3m (£1.7m) thus far.Getty ImagesJames Van Der Beek auctioned off the shirt he wore in this promotional stillIn the months before his death, Van Der Beek had shared how cash-strapped the cancer treatments had left him and his family. He even publicly auctioned off items he'd saved for decades from the roles that defined his career: a tartan buttoned shirt he wore in the first episode of Dawson's Creek, a necklace he gave to Katie Holmes' character on the teen drama series and sports shoes he wore when he starred in the 1999 film Varsity Blues.\"I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now,\" Van Der Beek told People magazine last November.On top of the costly treatments, Van Der Beek was not making the same cash that he'd seen in the prime of his career decades ago. He had said he was paid \"almost nothing\" for Dawson's Creek and his contract didn't include residuals - payments writers, actors and directors receive when their work is re-aired on television. Actors on other still-popular shows from that same period, like Friends, are said to make about $20m annually from such payments.\"There was no residual money,\" Van Der Beek told Today in 2012. \"I was 20. It was a bad contract. I saw almost nothing from that.\"He continued working after his diagnosis, appearing in two episodes of the television show Overcompensating in 2025, but it's unclear whether that was enough to qualify him for health insurance from the prominent actors' union in Hollywood. Actors can qualify for health insurance through Sag-Aftra only if they work 108 days a year or earn at least $28,090 on union shoots. The BBC has contacted the union.Van Der Beek is not the first high-profile US actor to highlight the issue. Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannen Doherty, who died in 2024, said she did not have insurance when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer.Getty ImagesVan Der Beek and his Dawson's Creek co-stars pictured in 1997Benjamin Byron Davis, 53, an actor who has appeared on television shows as well as in movies like Marvel's Ant-Man, told the BBC that decreased residuals had become a problem for actors across the board.\"Revenue streams that actors have depended upon have disappeared,\" he said, noting that the rise of streaming has affected how production companies compensate performers. He said many actors depend on these payments both for income and to qualify for health insurance through their union Sag-Aftra. \"I work when I'm hired and I survive when I'm not.\"Davis said he lost his health insurance during the 2023 Sag-Aftra strikes. \"There wasn't work,\" he said, adding that he ended up getting it back when the strikes were over and he was able to meet the qualifications again.Davis said that, just 10 years ago, the union's minimum earnings for health insurance was a third of what it is now, at a level today that is out of reach for the vast majority of actors.Those who are covered by the union plan get good health coverage, said Valerie Yaros, an archivist with Sag-Aftra.But it was possible Van Der Beek no longer received the union plan because of his fewer work hours, she added.In 2024, Van Der Beek told People that it had become a \"full-time job\" dealing with cancer treatment appointments and his insurance.A heated debate on health insuranceHis death put a new celebrity face on the debate about rising healthcare costs in the US - an issue that Republicans and Democrats have long recognised needs reform but have disagreed on the best ways to resolve the problem.The US has one of the most expensive health systems in the world, with spending on health care estimated to reach $5.9tn in 2026, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.About 100 million people in the US are estimated to struggle to pay off their medical and dental healthcare debt, according to recent data.The GoFundMe page posted online on Wednesday solicited donations to assist Van Der Beek's widow Kimberley and their six children, whose ages range from four to 15.His wife shared the page, which noted the \"significant financial strain\" the family had seen as they \"did everything possible to support James and provide for his care\".\"In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. The costs of James's medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,\" the page reads. \"They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time.\"Even with health insurance, cancer treatment can prove extremely costly for those in the US. Some studies suggest the average monthly cost of chemotherapy can range from $1,000 to $12,000.This is because in the US private healthcare system, even those with insurance can face high deductibles and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, said Eva Stahl, the vice-president of policy at Undue Medical Debt, a non-profit that has paid off about $25bn of medical debt for almost 15 million people.\"People simply can't afford vital, life-saving treatments without going into debt,\" she said. \"When even someone with James Van Der Beek's resources has no option but to fundraise for treatment, it's clear how fundamentally unfair our healthcare system is.\"Michael Short, a graphic artist in Tennessee who has had his own battles with medical debt, told the BBC that his sister has had to declare bankruptcy because of medical debt for treatments for her endometrial and another cancer, even with insurance coverage.\"It's in the hundreds of thousands if not millions for these cancer treatments,\" he said. \"The prices on these medications and on these treatments are just so high.\"More weekend picks",

He was a wonderful companion, with a gentle nature, and will be sorely missed,\" the post added.The black-and-white cat, who is named after the 19th-Century Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister Viscount Palmerston, joined the diplomatic service in 2016. He moved out of the department's central London building during the Covid pandemic, before formally retiring in 2020.Announcing his retirement, a letter to Lord Simon McDonald, then the most senior civil servant at the Foreign Office, read that Palmerston had enjoyed climbing trees and patrolling the fields around his new home and wanted to spend more time \"relaxing away from the limelight\".\"I have found life away from the frontline relaxed, quieter and easier,\" the letter signed in Palmerston's name read. Palmerston's account claimed he had been \"lured out of retirement\" by \"diplomacy and a purr-fect role\" with Bermuda's governor, Andrew Murdoch, who he had been living with since his retirement - with news of his return a cause of celebration by many of the cat's 99,000 social media followers.Leading tributes to Palmerston was his former rival, Number 10's chief mouser, Larry who this weekend celebrates 15 years in post - having served under six prime ministers.\"Farewell old friend x,\" read a post by the cat's unofficial X account.The four-legged felines were rumoured to have had a long-running feud, with highly publicised spats during their overlapping time in Westminster.",

The Queen told Ms Pelicot that she had \"inspired women across the globe\" and \"created a powerful legacy that will change the narrative around shame, forever\".Gisèle Pelicot waived her right to anonymity during the 2024 trial to make the \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist. She became a global figurehead of strength and feminism, and during the 15-week trial in Avignon, supporters stood outside the court every day with signs thanking Ms Pelicot for her courage, and calling for justice.\"It was an honour for me to receive this letter, I wasn't expecting it at all,\" Ms Pelicot, 73, told Victoria Derbyshire for BBC Newsnight.\"I was overwhelmed that the Queen could send me this letter.\"The Queen is a long-standing campaigner on domestic and sexual violence and has worked with organisations that support survivors for years.\"Thank you for all that you have done,\" she wrote to Ms Pelicot. \"You are very much in my thoughts and prayers, and I hope that you will now be able to rest and recover from this devastating ordeal.\"CHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFP via Getty ImagesCrowds of  supporters greeted Pelicot outside the Avignon courthouse every day of the trialIt is the first time the contents of the letter have been revealed. But with the Queen and Ms Pelicot's permission, it was shared with the BBC during Ms Pelicot's interview with Newsnight ahead of the release of her memoir: A Hymn To Life.Ms Pelicot said she was surprised and felt \"very honoured\" when she received the note, \"because although my words touched the whole world, I wasn't expecting a letter from the Court of England\". \"I felt moved and very honoured that she had become aware of what had happened to me. I am grateful to her.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoAdam GoldsmithandTom McArthurGetty ImagesRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin, the UK and European allies have said.Two years on from the death of Navalny at a Siberian penal colony, Britain and its allies have blamed the Kremlin following analysis of material samples found on his body.Speaking from the Munich Security Conference, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said \"only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity\" to use the poison while Navalny was imprisoned in Russia.According to Tass news agency Moscow has dismissed the finding as \"an information campaign\", but Cooper said there is no explanation for the toxin, called epibatidine, being found.While Cooper announced the findings, a joint statement was issued by the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.Cooper met with Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya at the conference this weekend.\"Russia saw Navalny as a threat,\" Cooper said at the event.\"By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition,\" she added.In the statement the allies said: \"Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.\"Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia.\"There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny's body.\"The Foreign Office said the UK has informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of Russia's alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Praising Navalny's \"huge courage\", UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"his determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy\".\"I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin's murderous intent,\" he added.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot also said his country \"pays tribute\" to Navalny, who he suggested was \"killed for his fight in favour of a free and democratic Russia\".Navalny – an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's most vociferous opposition leader - died suddenly in jail on 16 February 2024 at the age of 47.In 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.Watch: 'Only Russian state had means' to poison Navalny, says Yvette CooperBefore Saturday's announcement, Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently argued that her husband was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024.She did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results.Reacting to the announcement, Navalnaya said: \"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof.\"I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,\" she added.German Federal Foreign Office via Getty ImagesNavalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently claimed that her husband was poisoned by RussiaAccording to the state-run news agency Tass, Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: \"All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to the penal colony.According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk at his Siberian penal colony, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.Speaking to BBC Russian, toxicology expert Jill Johnson said epibatidine was \"200 times more potent than morphine\". By acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause \"muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death,\" she said.The extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in one wild frog species in tiny quantities, and only when the frog eats a specific diet, Johnson said, describing it as an \"incredibly rare way to poison a person\".She said: \"Finding the wild frog in the correct location that is eating the specific diet to create the correct alkaloids is almost impossible...almost.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoFiona NimoniGetty ImagesEurope must be ready to fight to protect its people, values, and way of life, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told world leaders on Saturday. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Starmer also called for deeper links and cooperation, including economic ties, between the UK and EU. The PM stressed the continent must \"stand on its own two feet\" when it comes to defence commitments.During his speech, Starmer also said the UK would deploy its carrier strike group to the Arctic and High North as part of efforts to bolster security against Russian threats.Starmer said the US, Canada and other Nato allies would also join the initiative to combat Russian threats in the region.Russian rearmament following a future peace deal for Ukraine would \"only accelerate\" and Europe must be prepared to \"deter aggression\" and be ready to fight if necessary, he added. \"We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age,\" he told the conference. US President Donald Trump has previously questioned whether European partners would adhere to the commitment to defend its allies if called upon, known as Article 5.The alliance was formed in 1949 with the primary aim of blocking expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union.Numbering 32 members, including several Eastern European countries, Article 5 is one of Nato's core principles. It says that an armed attack against one or more members will be considered an attack against all.But Starmer sought to dispel Trump's doubts, telling the conference that the UK's commitment to Article 5 is \"as profound now as ever\".He added: \"Be in no doubt, if called on, the UK would come to your aid today.\" Delivering her speech prior to the PM, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described Starmer as an \"unflinching ally and friend,\" and said both the EU and UK faced the threat of \"outside forces trying to weaken our union from within\". She said Europe had undergone \"shock therapy\" from the US and must take more responsibility for its defence. \"Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility,\" she added.Von der Leyen also called for more pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, posting on X: \"Now is the time to raise the costs of Russia's war higher than ever.\"Downing Street said the pair met in Munich on Saturday and \"agreed that Europe needs to step up and work towards becoming a more European Nato\".Anadolu via Getty ImagesBritish warships, including an aircraft carrier, will patrol the Arctic, Starmer saidAlthough Starmer's Labour government has worked to \"re-set\" the relationship with Brussels following Brexit in January 2020, it had previously pledged not to return to the single market. Marking a shift in policy, the PM insisted the EU-UK status quo was \"not fit for purpose\" and acknowledged there would be \"trade-offs\" as a result. Speaking on \"closer economic alignment\" with the EU, he told the audience: \"We must look at where we could move closer to the single market in other sectors as well, where that would work for both sides.\"The prize here is greater security, stronger growth for the United Kingdom and the EU, which will fuel increased defence spending, and the chance to place the UK at the centre of a wave of European industrial renewal.\"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called for a strengthening of European defence capabilities, \"in a co-ordinated and targeted way\", as well as the need to \"stop Putin\".Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Europe needs to do more collectively when it comes to security in the Arctic region.Finnish President Alexander Stubb said he did not believe Russia would test the resolve of Article 5, and that he did not see a \"direct threat\" from Russia to Nato currently.Starmer's speech at the annual Munich Security Conference, an event billed as the world's leading forum for debating challenges to international security, came after a tumultuous week which saw him face the most perilous threat to his premiership so far. On Monday afternoon, many in Westminster concluded that Starmer would not see out the day without resigning - but his cabinet rallied around him and he survived. Asked whether domestic challenges left him vulnerable, the PM told the crowd of world leaders and politicians in Munich: \"No, I reject that. I ended the week much stronger than I started it. \"And that's a very good place to be\". ",

    "body": "2 hours agoTinshui YeungReutersThe US Secretary of State signalled the Trump administration wants to strengthen ties with the continent during a speech in MunichMarco Rubio has assured European leaders the US does not plan to abandon the transatlantic alliance, saying its destiny \"will always be intertwined\" with the continent's.The US secretary of state told the Munich Security Conference: \"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history.\"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was \"very much reassured\" by Rubio's remarks.Rubio, the Trump administration's most senior diplomat, said it was \"neither our goal nor our wish\" to end the transatlantic partnership, adding: \"For us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.\"And I am here today to leave it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity, and that once again we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends.\"Follow updates on this storyHowever, he repeated several criticisms repeatedly levelled at Europe by the Trump administration, including describing immigration policies as a threat to civilisation, and saying a \"climate cult\" had taken over economic policy. On trade, he said Europe and the US had \"made mistakes together\" by adopting a \"dogmatic vision of free and unfettered trade\". He repeated familiar calls from the US for Europe to invest more in defence, saying: \"We want allies who can defend themselves so that no adversary will ever be tempted to test our collective strength.\"In response, von der Leyen said: \"[Rubio is] a good friend, a strong ally. And this was, for me, very reassuring to listen to him.\"She continued: \"We want a strong Europe. And this is, I think, the message of today.\"Elsewhere in his half-hour address, Rubio said the system of international co-operation \"must be rebuilt\" and singled out the UN for particular criticism, saying it had \"played virtually no role\" in resolving the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts. He also said the organisation was \"powerless to constrain the nuclear programme\" of Tehran.In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if a deal to curb its nuclear programme can be reached, as negotiations between the two intensify.A second round of talks will be hosted by Oman in Geneva next week, the Swiss foreign ministry said on Saturday.Outside the conference, an estimated 200,000 protesters held a rally against the Iranian government, local police report.The demonstrators denounced the country's leadership, following the government crackdown on January's protests in which thousands of people were killed.AFP via Getty ImagesOutside the Munich Security Conference, a large crowd of protesters gathered to denounce the Iranian government Rubio also said the US did not know whether the \"Russians are serious about ending the war\" in Ukraine, before adding: \"But we're going to continue to test it.\"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky told the conference later on Saturday that no one in Ukraine believed his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin would leave the country alone, describing the Russian leader as a \"slave to war\".Zelensky has come under pressure from the White House to hold presidential elections, which have been suspended while the country is under martial law.Asked about a Financial Times report that his administration was planning for elections as soon as May, Zelensky said it was \"something new to me\" and repeated that \"nobody supports elections during the war\".He said that Ukraine would need \"two months of ceasefire\" and \"security infrastructure\" to safely conduct elections. ReutersZelensky rejected a report from the Financial Times that said his administration is planning elections for MayAddressing Russian threats to the continent, he told the conference: \"We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age.\"As part of efforts to bolster security, Sir Keir announced the UK - in a joint initiative with the US, Canada and other Nato allies - would deploy a fleet of warships, submarines and aircraft to the Arctic and High North.The UK PM also called for deeper links and co-operation, including a \"closer economic alignment\", between the UK and the EU.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Finland's President Alexander Stubb also echoed calls for a unified response to Russia.Sánchez said there was a need to \"stop Putin\" and strengthen European defence capabilities, but added: \"Let's do it in a co-ordinated and targeted way.\"He also insisted on the building of a \"true European army, not in 10 years but now\".Frederiksen added that Putin was not interested in peace and that \"we have to recognise... that Russia will not change\".She said Europe \"knows exactly what we need to deliver,\" referencing Ukraine's calls for additional air defences.Stubb said he did not see a \"direct threat\" from Russia to Nato right now, but an Arctic training exercise with 20,000 Nato soldiers would help outline possible defence scenarios.",

    "description": "For the second time in two matches, Canadian curler Marc Kennedy has been accused of cheating by an opponent at the Winter Olympics.The 44-year-old - ",
    "body": "For the second time in two matches, Canadian curler Marc Kennedy has been accused of cheating by an opponent at the Winter Olympics.The 44-year-old - who won gold in 2010 and and bronze four years ago - became involved in a heated verbal exchange with Sweden opponent Oskar Eriksson towards the end of his side's 8-6 win on Friday.The Swedes believed Kennedy was repeatedly double-touching some of his stones - releasing the handle at the appropriate time but then giving the stone another little prod with his finger to correct its course - with TV pictures appearing to show that he did indeed touch the stone on occasion.That led World Curling to announce that they would deploy extra officials for the remainder of the Games to check for such infractions - a departure for a sport that is self-governed by the players.However, when the Canadians returned to the ice on Saturday to face Switzerland, controversy flared around Kennedy again, with the Swiss reporting him to the umpire for the same offence in their 9-5 win.\"I saw [Kennedy do it] when the referee was next to me,\" Swiss lead Pablo Lachat-Couchepin told BBC Sport. \"I really believe it does nothing - it doesn't change the stone - but when you have a referee looking at it, they should see it. \"I was a bit annoyed and said to the chief umpire if they send an email they have to follow what it says. It's nothing against Marc but you have to follow the rule.\"After the initial accusation, Kennedy - who was later given a warning for using foul language - said: \"I don't like being accused of cheating after 25 years on tour and four Olympic Games So I told him [Eriksson] where to stick it.\"He might have been upset that he was losing...\"Each stone has a sensor on it to ensure players release their grip on the handle before the thick green line that runs across the ice, known as the hog line.If they do, the sensor flashes green. If not, a red light shows.In both matches Kennedy's stone showed green, but his opponents thought they saw the Canadian give his throw an extra push with his finger on the stone after letting the handle go - and the video evidence seems to back that up from the Sweden game.But, as BBC Sport curling commentator Steve Cram asked former world champion Jackie Lockhart, is it actually cheating and does it make a difference?\"You should not be touching the stone after you've released it,\" Lockhart said. \"If you touch it with a broom, it's burned and removed.\"He's released that stone, then poked it with his finger - I'm not sure why. Is it to push it a little bit harder because he felt he didn't give it enough?\"Fellow pundit Logan Gray suggested it was perhaps \"muscle memory rather than active cheating\", and after their win over the Czech Republic on Saturday, Team GB's Grant Hardie said that to call it cheating \"would be a stretch\".Skip Bruce Mouat added: \"I'm sure Marc didn't mean anything by it, it is just that he was caught doing it on TV. Now it's out there, it should be regulated pretty well, and hopefully by the athletes.\"But will anything come of it? It appears not.When the teams come off the ice after a game, they are required to sign a declaration saying they are happy with the result. After the first incident, World Curling confirmed that \"decisions made during a game are final\" and that they do not use video replays \"to re-umpire\" decisions.They added that \"touching the granite of the stone\" is not allowed and that once the issue was brought to the umpire's attention in the game with Sweden, officials were positioned at the hog line to monitor throws for three ends - as per protocol. No violations were observed, so no action was taken. It remains unclear what the fallout will be to the second allegation by Switzerland but it does leave a cloud over the Canadians, who are considered medal contenders and seem well placed to reach the semi-finals.\"The question we should be asking is if Oskar is challenging him, has he [Kennedy] done it before?\" Lockhart added. \"Have they been doing it at other Championships and now they're being called out on it?\"I'm a bit disappointed with the Canadians if that's what they're doing. We'll all be looking now.\"",

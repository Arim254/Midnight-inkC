    "body": "Rift at top of the Taliban: BBC reveals clash of wills behind internet shutdown14 hours agoBBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIt was a piece of audio obtained by the BBC that revealed what worries the Taliban's leader most.Not an external danger, but one from within Afghanistan, which the Taliban seized control of as the previous government collapsed and the US withdrew in 2021.He warned of \"insiders in the government\" pitted against each other in the Islamic Emirate the Taliban set up to govern the country.In the leaked clip, the supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada can be heard giving a speech saying that internal disagreements could eventually bring them all down.\"As a result of these divisions, the emirate will collapse and end,\" he warned.Javid Ashna / Middle East Images / AFP via Getty ImagesSupreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada (centre) has \"absolute power\", his spokesman said - but ministers including Sirajuddin Haqqani (left) and Mohammad Yaqoob (right) have questioned decisionsThe speech, made to Taliban members at a madrassa in the southern city of Kandahar in January 2025, was more fuel to the fire of rumours which had been circulating for months - rumours of differences at the very top of the Taliban.It is a split the Taliban leadership has always denied - including when asked directly by the BBC.But the rumours prompted the BBC's Afghan service to begin a year-long investigation into the highly secretive group - conducting more than 100 interviews with current and former members of the Taliban, as well as local sources, experts and former diplomats.Because of the sensitivity over reporting this story, the BBC has agreed not to identify them for their safety.Now, for the first time, we have been able to map two distinct groups at the very top of the Taliban - each presenting competing visions for Afghanistan.One entirely loyal to Akhundzada, who, from his base in Kandahar, is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate - isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society.And a second, made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which - while still following a strict interpretation of Islam - engages with the outside, builds the country's economy, and even allows girls and women access to an education they are currently denied beyond primary school.One insider described it as \"the Kandahar house versus Kabul\".But the question was always whether the Kabul group, made up of Taliban cabinet ministers, powerful militants and influential religious scholars commanding the support of thousands of Taliban loyalists, would ever challenge the increasingly authoritarian Akhundzada in any meaningful way, as his speech suggested.After all, according to the Taliban, Akhundzada is the group's absolute ruler - a man only accountable to Allah, and not someone to be challenged.Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills.Listen: Audio obtained by the BBC of Taliban supreme leaderIn late September, Akhundzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world.Three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why.But what had happened behind the scenes was seismic, say insiders. The Kabul group had acted against Akhundzada's order and switched the internet back on.\"The Taliban, unlike every other Afghan party or faction, is remarkable for its coherence – there have been no splits, not even much dissent,\" explains an expert on Afghanistan, who has been studying the Taliban since they were established.\"Bound into the movement's DNA is the principle of obedience to one's superiors, and ultimately to the Amir [Akhundzada]. That's what made the act of turning the internet back on, against his explicit orders, so unexpected, and so notable,\" the expert said.As one Taliban insider put it: this was nothing short of a rebellion.A man of faithOnly two confirmed pictures of Akhundzada exist; this one, showing the supreme leader on the left, has been verified by BBC AfghanHibatullah Akhundzada did not begin his leadership like this.Indeed, sources say he was chosen as the Taliban's supreme leader in 2016 in part because of his approach of building consensus.Lacking battlefield experience himself, he found a deputy in Sirajuddin Haqqani - the feared militant commander, then one of the US's most wanted men with a $10m (£7.4m) bounty on his head.A second deputy was found in Yaqoob Mujahid, Taliban founder Mullah Omar's son – young, but bringing with him his Taliban bloodline, and its potential to unify the movement.The arrangement continued throughout negotiations with Washington in Doha to end the 20-year war between Taliban fighters and US-led forces. The eventual agreement, in 2020, resulted in the sudden and dramatic recapturing of the country by the Taliban, and the chaotic withdrawal of US troops in August 2021.Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesThe unexpected fall of Kabul in August 2021 saw thousands rush to the airport in the hope of being evacuated with US and other troops as they withdrewTo the outside world, they were a united front.But both deputies would find themselves quietly demoted to ministers as soon as the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, with Akhundzada now a lone power centre, insiders told the BBC.Even Abdul Ghani Baradar - the powerful and influential co-founder of the Taliban who had led negotiations with the US - found himself in the role of deputy prime minister instead of prime minister as many had expected.Instead, Akhundzada - having shunned the capital where the government sits in favour of remaining in Kandahar, a base of power for the Taliban - began surrounding himself with trusted ideologues and hardliners.Other loyalists were given control of the country's security forces, religious policies and parts of the economy.\"[Akhundzada], from the outset, sought to form his own strong faction,\" a former Taliban member - who later served in Afghanistan's US-backed government - told the BBC.\"Although he lacked the opportunity at first, once he gained power, he began doing so skilfully, expanding his circle using his authority and position.\"Akhundzada has filled his cabinet with loyalists in line with his vision, but those considered the \"Kabul group\" maintain their positions. Here, arguably the most influential members of each group are shownEdicts began to be announced without consultation with Kabul-based Taliban ministers, and with little regard for public promises made before they took power, on issues like allowing girls access to education. The ban on education, along with women working, remains one of the \"main sources of tension\" between the two groups, a letter from a UN monitoring body to the Security Council noted in December.Meanwhile, another insider told the BBC that Akhundzada, who had started out as a judge in the Taliban's Sharia courts of the 1990s, was becoming \"even more rigid\" in his religious beliefs.Akhundzada's ideology was already such that he not only knew but approved of his son's choice to become a suicide bomber, according to two Taliban officials after his death in 2017.And he is convinced that making the wrong decision could have implications beyond his lifetime, the BBC has been told.\"Every decision he makes he says: I'm accountable to Allah, on judgement day, I will be questioned why I didn't take an action,\" one current Taliban government official explained.Two people who have been in meetings with Akhundzada described to the BBC how they were faced with a man who barely spoke, choosing to communicate mainly through gestures, interpreted through a team of elderly clerics in the room.In more public settings, other eyewitnesses said he obscures his face - covering his eyes with a scarf draped over his turban, and often standing at an angle when addressing an audience. Photographing or filming Akhundzada is forbidden. Only two photos of him are known to exist.Getting a meeting has also become increasingly difficult. Another Taliban member told the BBC how Akhundzada used to hold \"regular consultations\", but now \"most Taliban ministers wait for days or weeks\". Another source told the BBC the Kabul-based ministers have been told to \"travel to Kandahar only if they receive an official invitation\".At the same time, Akhundzada was moving key departments to Kandahar - including distribution of weapons, which had previously come under the control of his former deputies Haqqani and Yaqoob.In its December letter, the UN monitoring team noted Akhundzada's \"consolidation of power has also involved a continued build-up of security forces under the direct control of Kandahar\".Reports suggest Akhundzada issues direct orders all the way down to local police units - bypassing ministers in Kabul.One analyst argues the result is that \"real authority has been transferred to Kandahar\" - something Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied to the BBC.\"All the ministers have their power in their ministerial framework, undertaking daily works and making decisions - all the powers are delegated to them and they carry out their duties,\" he said.However, \"from a Sharia perspective, he [Akhundzada] has the absolute power\", Mujahid added - saying \"to avoid God-forbidden division, his decisions are final\".Men 'who have seen the world'APKabul (pictured) is the capital, and the seat of government for AfghanistanAmong the Kabul group, unhappiness was growing and alliances were strengthening.\"They [the Kabul group] are people who have seen the world,\" one analyst told the BBC. \"Therefore, they believe that their government, in its current form, cannot last.\"The Kabul group want to see an Afghanistan which moves towards the model of a Gulf state.They are concerned about the concentration of power in Kandahar, the nature and enforcement of virtue laws, how the Taliban should engage with the international community and women's education and employment.But despite advocating for Afghan women to have more rights, the Kabul group is not described as moderate.Instead, insiders see them as \"pragmatic\", unofficially led by Baradar - the Taliban founding member who still commands great loyalty. He is also thought to be the \"Abdul\" referred to by Donald Trump as the \"head of the Taliban\" during a 2024 US presidential election campaign debate. In fact, he was the group's chief negotiator with the US.The Kabul group's shifting positions have not gone unnoticed.\"We remember that they [the Taliban leaders based in Kabul] used to destroy television sets, but now they appear on TV themselves,\" one analyst said.They also understand the power of social media.Former deputy Yaqoob - whose father led the Taliban during its first rule, when music and television were banned - finds himself increasingly popular with young Taliban members and some ordinary Afghans, evident in gushing TikTok videos and merchandise adorned with his face.But no one has been more effective in rebranding themselves than his fellow former deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani. His ability to evade capture as his network orchestrated some of the most lethal and sophisticated attacks in the Afghan war against US-led forces - including a 2017 truck bombing in Kabul which killed more than 90 civilians near the German embassy - elevated him to near-mythical status among supporters.During this time, only one known photograph of him existed - taken by a BBC Afghan journalist.FBIThe bounty on Sirajuddin Haqqani - pictured in his wanted FBI poster, before the Taliban returned to power - was dropped last yearBut then, six months after the US withdrawal, Haqqani marched out in front of the world's cameras at a graduation ceremony of police officers in Kabul, his face uncovered.It was the first step towards a new image: no longer a militant, but a statesman - one with whom the New York Times would sit down in 2024 and ask: is he Afghanistan's best hope for change?Just a few months later, the FBI would quietly drop the $10m bounty on his head.Yet analysts and insiders repeatedly told the BBC that openly moving against supreme leader Akhundzada was unlikely.Arguably the most visible opposition to his edicts had been minor and limited - for example not enforcing regulations like the ban on shaving beards in regions controlled by Kabul group-aligned officials. But larger acts of rebellion have always been considered unthinkable.One former Taliban member emphasised to the BBC that \"obedience to [Akhundzada] is considered mandatory\".Haqqani himself, in his interview with the New York Times, played down any chance of an open split. \"Unity is important for Afghanistan currently so we can have a peaceful country,\" he said.Instead, one analyst said, the Kabul group is choosing to send \"a message to both the international community and Afghans\", one which says: \"We are aware of your complaints and concerns, but what can we do?\"At least, that was the case before the order came to shut down the internet.A breaking pointAFP via Getty ImagesThe internet switch-off began in carefully selected provinces and then expanded to the whole country in late SeptemberThe Taliban's supreme leader is a man with a deep distrust of the internet; he believes its content to be against Islamic teachings, and is so dedicated to his belief that an aide reads out the latest news or social media posts to him each morning instead, his spokesman once explained to the BBC.The Kabul group believe that a modern country cannot survive without it.The supreme leader's internet shutdown order began in provinces controlled by Akhundzada's allies, before it was expanded to the whole country.Sources close to the Kabul group and within the Taliban government described what happened next - an almost unprecedented moment in the Taliban's history.\"It surprised many members of the movement,\" one source said.In short, the Kabul group's most powerful ministers came together and convinced  Kabul-based Prime Minister Mullah Hassan Akhund to order it switched back on.In fact, the group had already made its unhappiness with the edict known before the internet was cut across the country: the group's de-facto leader, Baradar,  travelled to Kandahar to warn one of Akhundzada's most loyal governors that they needed to \"wake him up\" - adding they had to stop being the supreme leader's \"yes\" men.\"You don't tell him the truth openly; whatever he says, you just implement,\" he was reported as saying by a Kandahar insider.His words, the source said, were dismissed. On Monday, 29 September, an order came into the telecommunications ministry directly from the supreme leader to shut everything down. \"No excuses\" would be accepted, a source in the ministry told the BBC.On Wednesday morning, a group of Kabul group ministers - including Baradar, Haqqani and Yaqoob - gathered at the prime minister's office, joined by the telecommunications minister. Here, they urged the Kandahar-aligned prime minister to take charge and reverse the order. According to one source, they told him the full responsibility lay with them.It worked. The internet returned.But perhaps more importantly, within those few days, it was as if what Akhundzada had hinted at in that speech months earlier had come to pass: insiders were threatening Taliban unity.AFP via Getty ImagesThe decision to reverse the order took many by surprise - including Kabul group supportersBut why this order? One expert points out Taliban members have been happy to follow Akhundzada despite disagreeing with edicts like the ones on girls' education.Meanwhile, many of those who had challenged him openly before had paid a price.In February 2025, the then-deputy foreign minister had to flee the country after warning publicly the leadership was straying from \"the path of God\" in \"committing injustice against 20 million people\" - a reference to the female education ban.UN monitors point to at least two others who have been arrested after questioning Akhundzada's decrees on girls' education, in July and September 2025.But there is also evidence of Akhundzada and his allies moving to keep figures like Haqqani close - despite the latter's public criticisms of the supreme leader's consolidation of power.Even so, tipping over from words into actions and so decisively disregarding an order was arguably another step all together.As one expert points out, this time it may have been worth the risk.Their positions come with power and an \"ability to make money\", the expert says. But both depended on the internet, now crucial to both governing and commerce.\"Turning off the internet threatened their privileges in a way that keeping older girls out of education never did,\" the expert points out.\"Maybe that's why they were 'brave' that one time.\"APBeyond primary school, girls and women are denied an education under the TalibanAfter the internet was turned back on, speculation was rife about what would happen next.A source close to the Kabul group suggested the ministers will be slowly removed or demoted.However, the Kandahar insider suggested it might be the supreme leader who backed down \"because he fears such opposition\".As the year drew to an end, it appeared publicly that nothing had changed.The letter to the UN Security Council noted some UN member states \"have downplayed the division between leaders in Kandahar and Kabul as akin to a family dispute that would not alter the status quo; all senior leaders are invested in the success of the Taliban enterprise\".Zabiullah Mujahid, the senior Taliban government spokesman, has categorically denied any split.\"We will never allow ourselves to be divided,\" he told the BBC in early January 2026. \"All officials and leadership know that a split can be harmful for all, for Afghanistan, religiously prohibited and forbidden by Allah.\"However, he did also acknowledge that differences in \"opinion\" exist among Taliban members, but equated it to \"a difference of opinion in a family\".Half way through December, those \"differences\" had appeared to surface once more.Haqqani was filmed addressing a crowd in his home province of Khost during Friday prayers, warning that anyone who \"gets to power through the nation's trust, love and faith and then abandons or forgets the same nation... is not a government\".The same day, Akhundzada loyalist Neda Mohammad Nadem - the higher education minister - made his own speech to graduating students at a madrassa in a neighbouring province.\"Only one person leads and the rest follow orders, this is a true Islamic government,\" he said. \"If there are too many leaders then problems will emerge and this government that we have achieved will be ruined.\"After the dispute over the internet, these recent comments are set against a very different backdrop to those made by Akhundzada in the leaked audio at the start of 2025.Yet whether 2026 will be the year that the Kabul group move to make meaningful change for the women and men of Afghanistan is very much still up for debate.\"As ever… the question remains after apparent disagreement within the Emirate's top tier – will words ever lead to action?\" says one expert.\"They haven't yet.\"Edited and produced by Zia Shahreyar, Flora Drury and the BBC Afghan Forensics team.

    "body": "A staff member who was working at the Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught alight, her family's lawyer has alleged.Cyane Panine, 24, died in the fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans Montana and was widely identified in a video wearing a helmet and holding a champagne bottle with a sparkler attached when the ceiling caught fire.The bar's French owners, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Forty people were killed and 116 were injured in the blaze in southwest Switzerland.Pope Leo XIV met relatives of some of those killed in the disaster on Thursday and said he was \"very moved and distraught\" to talk to them at the Vatican. \"Where can one find a consolation equal to what you are experiencing?\" he asked.Sophie Haenni, the lawyer representing Cyane Panine's family, told the BBC she \"wasn't supposed to be serving tables\" on the night of the fire but had been asked to go downstairs to help manage high demand for bottles. \"It wasn't Cyane herself who decided to put on this helmet, it was at the request of her employers. She was just doing her job.\" It is shocking to place the responsibility for their own failings on Cyane, a 24-year-old woman and their own employee\".Ms Haenni added that Cyane Panine had never been informed \"of the ceiling's danger and received no safety training\".A source who has seen the inquiry documents said that Jessica Moretti told investigators they had used sparklers in champagne bottles for the past 10 years. \"It wasn't the first time she'd done it, putting herself on someone else's shoulders,\" Ms Moretti told them. \"She did it on her own initiative.\"In a statement, Sophie Haenni said the casualties \"could have been avoided\" if \"safety standards (particularly regarding materials) had been followed and the required inspections carried out\". She added: \"Cyane is undoubtedly a victim.\" The Panine family's lawyers also say she \"felt used\" and was \"suffering from her working conditions\".\"[Cyane Panine] expressed her incomprehension at the lack of empathy and understanding from her employers\" in regards to her workload, the statement adds.\"My clients have lost their daughter, their sister. A loved one, a wonderful person, has been stolen from them,\" the statement says.The BBC has contacted lawyers for Jacques and Jessica Moretti for a response.On Wednesday, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention due to what prosecutors claim is a \"risk of flight\". She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day, authorities say.She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. Prosecutors have also argued that he is a flight risk.Initial findings from the investigation into the blaze suggest that it was caused by sparklers igniting soundproof foaming that lined the ceiling.Authorities have acknowledged that the bar in the popular ski resort had not undergone safety checks for five years.The Swiss canton of Valais has now banned pyrotechnic devices in all indoor public venues.Authorities said each of the victims would get a 10,000 franc ($12,500; £9,200) emergency payment, with a fund being set up to collect donations.Additional reporting by Marianne Baisnée in Paris.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKerena CobbinaAFP via Getty ImagesOscar-winner Matthew McConaughey has trademarked his image and voice to protect them from unauthorised use by artificial intelligence (AI) platforms.Clips including his famous catchphrase \"alright, alright, alright\" from the 1993 film, Dazed and Confused, have been registered to the United States Patent and Trademark Office database, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports.It is the first time an actor has attempted to use trademark law to protect their likeness from AI misuse, his lawyers and an expert said.Stars across Hollywood and the music industry including Scarlett Johansson and Taylor Swift have endured a wave of fake video, audio and images online, created by AI tools.Lawyers for the Magic Mike star told the WSJ they had no current examples of McConaughey's likeness being manipulated by AI, but hoped the trademarks could be used broadly against any unauthorised copies of him.A secondary aim would be to \"capture some of the value that is being created with this new technology\", Kevin Yorn - one of the lawyers representing McConaughey - told the AFP news agency.\"My team and I want to know that when my voice or likeness is ever used, it's because I approved and signed off on it\", McConaughey said via email to the newspaper.\"We want to create a clear perimeter around ownership with consent and attribution the norm in an AI world\".Several clips were registered by the commercial arm of the Just Keep Livin Foundation, a non-profit organisation created by the Dallas Buyers Club actor and his wife Camila, according to AFP.Alina Trapova, an assistant professor in copyright law at University College London, also believes it to be first time an actor has attempted to use trademark law to their benefit against AI.Trapova has worked on copyright and AI for more than eight years. She told the BBC that AI is a big problem for celebrities, saying that they may object to unauthorised AI \"due to reputational reasons\", but for Hollywood stars it \"is often a case of missed licensing opportunities\".She said celebrities are experimenting with different forms of protection as \"unauthorised commercialisation\" of their likeness in the forms of deepfakes becomes \"more and more challenging in the age of AI\".McConaughey is not a hardline opponent of generative AI. He has a stake in ElevenLabs, a software company specialising in AI voice modelling \"for several years now\", according to the 56-year-old. The company has created an AI audio version of the 'Interstellar' actor, with his permission.Dr Sandra Wachter, professor of technology and regulation at the University of Oxford, says she would not be surprised if others in the creative industries did the same as McConaughey in the future.\"It is simple for companies to take your work and train a model to do your job. It is comparatively difficult for you to protect your work in the first place,\" she told the BBC. AI images and deepfakes are of growing concern in the entertainment world.In 2024, Scarlett Johansson said she was left \"shocked\" and \"angered\" after OpenAI launched a chatbot with an \"eerily similar\" voice to her own.OpenAI removed the voice, but insisted that it was not meant to be an \"imitation\" of the Avengers star.In June 2025, Disney and Universal sued AI firm Midjourney over its image generator, which the Hollywood giants alleged was a \"bottomless pit of plagiarism\".Also last year, an AI video generator on Elon Musk's X social media platform was accused of making \"a deliberate choice\" to create sexually explicit clips of Taylor Swift without prompting.Grok Imagine's \"spicy\" mode \"didn't hesitate to spit out fully uncensored topless videos\" of the pop star without being asked, the Verge reported.",

    "body": "8 hours agoHenry Zeffman,Chief Political CorrespondentandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterPA MediaThe government is to announce new powers making it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former armed forces personnel to prepare for war.New rules will mean reservists remain on call for an extra decade, and lower the threshold for them being called into service.Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the election of US President Donald Trump have put pressure on the government to ramp up defence spending and readiness for action.Labour has pledged to increase defence spending, but the government has not denied reports that the Chief of the Defence Staff Sir Richard warned the prime minister and chancellor about a £28bn shortfall forecast for spending plans just before Christmas.Legislation on the armed forces containing the changes will be published in parliament later, with some parts seen by ministers as a crucial part of the conversation about Britain's readiness for conflict.The measures affect the segments of the armed forces reserve who are former service personnel rather than volunteers - known as the strategic reserve.Currently, the age limit for the strategic reserve is 55. This will change to 65.The threshold for members of the strategic reserve to be mobilised will change too. Under existing rules they are called upon in the scenario of \"national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK\". That threshold will be lowered to \"warlike preparations\", which is already the threshold for reservists who have left active service in the past few years.The changes, which include technical measures the government has to renew at regular intervals, will come into force next year, if passed by parliament.Last year the Strategic Defence Review called on the government to \"reinvigorate the relationship with the strategic reserves\", estimated to have about 95,000 members.At the same time, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden told parliament that the UK must \"actively prepare for the possibility of the UK coming under direct threat, potentially in a wartime scenario\" as he published a national security strategy. McFadden told MPs the nation was \"in an era in which we face confrontation with those who are threatening security\" and pointed to Russia's war against Ukraine as \"the most obvious and pressing example of this\".The document also referred to \"Iranian hostile activity on British soil\" and \"adversaries\" planning how to disrupt energy or supply chains.Labour set out plans to increase overall defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, costing an additional £6bn a year. It has also said spending will rise to 3.5% by 2035.A threat from Trump threat to withdraw US protection from NATO countries also led Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to pledge to meet a new Nato target to spend 5% of the UK's GDP on national security by 2035.

    "body": "3 hours agoJemma Crew,Business reporter andGraham Satchell,News correspondentOne of Britain's most prolific rail fare dodgers could face jail after admitting dozens of travel offences.Charles Brohiri, 29, pleaded guilty to travelling without buying a ticket on Govia Thameslink train journeys a total of 112 times, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.He could be ordered to pay more than £18,000 in unpaid fares and legal costs, the court was told.District Judge Nina Tempia warned Brohiri \"could face a custodial sentence because of the number of offences he has committed\". Brohiri, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, was dressed in black as he pleaded guilty to 76 offences on Thursday. Each offence was read out to him, with Brohiri quietly and repeatedly replying \"Guilty\" for around 20 minutes.It came after he was convicted in his absence of 36 charges at a previous hearing.During Thursday's hearing, Judge Tempia dismissed a bid by Brohiri's lawyers to have the 36 convictions overturned.They had argued the prosecutions were unlawful because they had not been brought by a qualified legal professional, but by a lay prosecutor.But Judge Tempia rejected the argument, saying there had been \"no abuse of this court's process\".In a written ruling setting out her decision, she said she agreed that \"a lay prosecutor can commence proceedings\".She added there has been an \" industry-wide use of non-authorised employees to lay informations which has been a long-standing process\".A  Govia Thameslink Railway spokesperson welcomed the decision to uphold previous 36 convictions.The 112 charges span from February 2024 to November 2025. They relate to journeys between London and  Brighton, and on the Thameslink lines into Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire.In addition, Brohiri is also accused of continuing to dodge fares in late November and December last year, and in January, prosecutor Lyndon Harris told the court.The most recent allegation was three days ago - on 12 January, he said.At a previous hearing in August last year, Brohiri was bailed and told \"not to be present on or attempt to gain access to any train owned or operated by Govia Thameslink\".He was bailed on the same conditions as imposed at previous hearings, to return for sentencing on 11 February.In addition, he is accused of failing to pay fines worth £48,682 from separate prosecutions between August 2019 and April 2025.",

    "body": "8 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterBroadcaster Amol Rajan is to leave BBC Radio 4's Today programme, announcing he intends to launch his own company.He will continue doing some work for the BBC away from news, including hosting quiz show University Challenge and the Radical podcast. In a statement, Rajan said leaving Today \"might be mad\", but added he was \"extremely excited to jump into the great digital Narnia of the creator economy\".It has not yet been confirmed who will replace him on the BBC's flagship radio news programme, but the corporation said an announcement would be made \"in due course\".The BBC's editorial rules would likely have prevented Rajan from staying on as the presenter of a news programme while also launching his own company.Rajan has presented Today for nearly five years, having joined in March 2021.He effectively replaced John Humphrys, who left 18 months earlier, but the programme had continued with fewer presenters during the gap. Before joining Today, Rajan was the media editor for BBC News, and guest presented several major programmes such as The One Show and filled in for presenters on BBC Radio 2. On Thursday, Rajan said: \"The pips have sounded, and it's time to get my coat.\"He praised the Today team as \"the best of the best\" and \"consistently world class\", adding that he also \"couldn't be prouder\" of his Amol Rajan Interviews series which has run on recent years on BBC Two. However, he continued: \"Twenty years after I first flirted with the idea, I'm extremely excited to jump into the Great Digital Narnia of the Creator Economy, and build my own company. I'll still do Britain's oldest TV quiz and most exciting podcast.\"But Del Boy was my hero growing up, and it's time to unleash my inner entrepreneur.\"He added: \"I am very much not leaving the BBC, Britain's noblest cultural institution, whose Reithian spirit is such a generous gift to a world in flux. It's that world I'm heading for, and I'm excited.\"Today editor Owenna Griffiths described Rajan as an \"exceptional talent with a rare combination of intellectual dexterity, impressive breadth of interest and a brilliant sense of humour\".Radio 4 controller Mohit Bakaya said Rajan had \"brought a distinctive intellectual energy and curiosity to Today that we will be really sad to lose\".In a separate post on Instagram, Rajan paid tribute to his Today colleagues and said he had made sure to tell them of his exit before the official announcement. Rajan is the third presenter in two years to leave Today, following Mishal Husain and Martha Kearney, who were replaced by Anna Foster and Emma Barnett respectively.The programme's other presenters are Justin Webb, who replaced Edward Stourton in 2009, and Nick Robinson, who took over from James Naughtie in 2015.Before joining the BBC, Rajan was the editor of the Independent newspaper, from 2013 to 2016.",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesByMarcus AlvesBBC SportA young Igor Thiago could not have known he would one day break the record for the most goals by a Brazilian player in a Premier League season.But the Brentford forward has always had one thing clear in his mind - nothing would stop him from becoming a professional footballer. That is the promise he made to his mother Maria Diva when he was growing up in Cidade Ocidental, a small town in central Brazil.He has never forgotten the day they went to a family meal where everyone was supposed to bring a dish.Raising four children on her own and working as a refuse collector on a minimum wage, Diva did not have it easy and arrived empty-handed. It was then that Thiago heard a close relative say she would only take her children out to eat at other people's expense. Diva felt humiliated and left in tears.\"From today on, no-one in this life is going to humiliate you any more,\" Thiago told her on the way home.\"I'm going to become a footballer, you'll see. Everyone will know me one day.\"His mother may have thought he did not really know what he was talking about. But he knew.However, his path to success has not been straightforward.He had to wait until he was 17 to sign for a club, having faced several rejections at trials around Brazil.\"Thiago would call me late at night in tears to say that football wasn't for him,\" Sergio Goncalves, his mentor from his early years at Gremio Ocidental, a local community football initiative, tells BBC Sport. \"But he was born to score goals.\"The 24-year-old has found the back of the net 16 times in the Premier League this season.He is on target to reach the 20-goal mark once again in his career - having done so in three of his four seasons in Europe, the only exception being his debut campaign with Brentford, which was disrupted by a serious injury.Thiago's next stop is Saturday's west London derby against Chelsea.Image source, Sergio GoncalvesImage caption, Igor Thiago started his career at Gremio Ocidental in Brazil'I don't want to know about football any more'Having lost his father prematurely, Thiago found a paternal figure in Goncalves, who mentored him between the ages of eight and 16 - before the striker joined Vere in 2018 then moved to Brazilian giants Cruzeiro a year later.\"People look at him, see how big he is, and think he's that kind of static centre-forward. But he has a lot to his game because of the time he spent in futsal,\" Goncalves says.\"Thiago was born in futsal. It gives you so much dynamism, such quick thinking. A lot of scouts who came through here now call me to say 'Sergio, I missed out on Thiago'.\"Thiago did not take long to make an impact for Cruzeiro, going on to score in his senior debut in Belo Horizonte. But that was it.He probably could not have had a more challenging first-team experience.That side is remembered as the worst Cruzeiro team ever - they finished their Serie B campaigns in 11th and 14th place in 2020 and 2021.\"The pressure was everywhere - it affected all the players and the coaching staff. It was a very difficult period for the club - delays in paying wages, problems with transfer ban,\" former Brazil international Mozart Santos, who had a brief spell as head coach, says.\"Younger players tend to feel it more. So one of the reasons Thiago maybe didn't perform better in Brazil was this turbulence.\"Such was the situation that Thiago fell into depression, questioning himself and even whether he should continue as a professional footballer.\"There are things no-one knows that I went through. I went through a period of depression,\" he said in an interview with Futebol no Mundo podcast from ESPN.\"There were nights when I thought about giving up. Even though I was already a professional at Cruzeiro, I didn't want to know about football any more.\"I just wanted to walk away from all of it and live back in the countryside. What really gave me strength was my mum and my children.\"'The sky's the limit'At the start of 2022, Thiago told his agents it was time to move elsewhere.Bulgarian champions Ludogorets, who had tried to sign him the season before, returned with another offer and secured a deal.\"In football, a lot of people try to define paths and limits for others. You often see a player going through a difficult period and being labelled as a certain type of player and that label becomes a kind of ceiling. I fight strongly against that,\" former Ludogorets assistant coach Rafael Ferreira, currently at Atromitos in Greece, said.\"I believe everyone has room to grow as long as they're in an environment that allows it. And Igor Thiago fits into a very interesting profile because he has a very strong mentality.\"In his early period, he didn't get many minutes. And what does he do? He asks to play for the second team. He wants to play. That shows you his mentality - not sulking because he isn't playing but looking for alternatives. When you work with that type of player, we usually say the sky's the limit.\"Thiago's mentality also stands out with his team-mates.\"What I really liked about him was that when he arrived, he was always asking the older players what they thought he could improve. That's what I found different about him, special even,\" says Cauly, a former Ludogorets midfielder who now plays for Bahia in Brazil.\"He already had that worker's mentality, that desire to keep improving. And a player with his physical attributes... we already knew that, one way or another, it had to work out for him as a striker.\"It was no surprise that, following only one full season and 20 goals later, he was on his way to Club Brugge in Belgium.\"Sometimes he'd get, I don't know, five or 10 minutes in a game, come on and score. It was like he had something about him... as if his energy attracted good things,\" Ferreira added.Image source, Sergio GoncalvesImage caption, Sergio Goncalves (left) was Thiago's early mentor in his boyhood days in Brazil'His dream was to play in the Premier League'Thiago scored 29 goals in his first and only season with Club Brugge.Brentford then anticipated competition for his signing and paid a club record £30m for him. The forward arrived as a replacement for Ivan Toney, who was sold to Saudi club Al-Ahli.\"I remember he always said his dream was to play in the Premier League. He was always speaking very highly of Erling Haaland. And now, today, he's competing with him for the Premier League's top scorer,\" Cauly says.\"That makes me really happy to see. I'm proud of him. He's someone who truly deserves it - a genuinely good person, with a big heart, and he deserves to be where he is.\"With Brazil desperately looking for a number nine before the summer's World Cup, there is a growing expectation head coach Carlo Ancelotti will include him in his March squad.\"For me, in this next list - which is the last one before the tournament - he has to be in. If he isn't, then it won't be justice,\" Goncalves says.\"Brazil is missing a proper striker, and I believe this is his moment. And when he gets there, I think he'll make the difference. \"I've already been dreaming about it - the World Cup final, him scoring the winning goal. I'm dreaming.\"Insight: In-depth stories from the world of sportBrazilBrentfordPremier LeagueFootball",

    "body": "The Princess of Wales hosted England's women's rugby union team at Windsor Castle to celebrate their World Cup success in September.England beat Canada 33-13 in front of 81,885 spectators at Twickenham to lift the trophy for a third time.Catherine, a patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU), met with officials and staff from the organisation as well as the 32-player squad.She followed England during the home World Cup campaign and was in attendance when they beat Australia in Brighton in the pool stage.Captain Zoe Stratford, two-time World Cup winner Marlie Packer and head coach John Mitchell, who were all named as OBE recipients in the New Year Honours, were among those at the royal reception.Vice-captain Megan Jones, back row Sadia Kabeya and Sports Personality of the Year nominee Ellie Kildunne were also recognised with MBE awards in December.Kildunne, who tattooed '2025' on head coach Mitchell after their World Cup success, became synonymous with a cowboy hat during the competition and placed it on the head of Catherine after one of their victories.Speaking at Windsor Castle, Kildunne said: \"It was the first thing she said when she came over to our group, 'Have you forgotten your cowboy hat this time?' I said 'it looks like you're the one that has forgotten your cowboy hat'.\"When she came to watch the game - I didn't really know the royal rules and whether you're not allowed to put a hat on - she put it on and did a bit of a cowboy dance and it's a special moment that she is now officially a cowboy, so I'll have to tattoo her soon.\"The Red Roses were an hour late after their bus broke down and the bus driver then took a wrong turn, meaning the team missed out on a tour of Windsor Castle.Following the royal reception the squad went to Downing Street to meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentPAForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper was visiting northern Norway to see an  operation involving British and Norwegian soldiersNato should \"double down\" on Arctic security to defend the region from Russian aggression, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has told the BBC.On a visit to British forces in northern Norway, she said the alliance should establish a combined operation - known as Arctic Sentry - to defend the region, just as it does in the Baltic Sea.She also said allies, including the US, should unite around the shared threat despite continuing disagreements over Greenland.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in buying mineral-rich Greenland, with the White House failing to rule out the use of force to annex it.His demands have been rejected by Greenland's leaders and by Nato member Denmark, of which the island is a semi-autonomous territory.Cooper was joined by her Norwegian counterpart, Espen Barth Eide, who said the row between Europe and the US over Greenland was a \"distraction\" from the greater security threat in Ukraine.The Foreign Secretary said: \"The Arctic is the gateway for Russia's Northern Fleet to be able to threaten the United Kingdom, to threaten Western Europe and Norway, to threaten the United States and Canada.\"So it's a whole transatlantic security depends on our Arctic security,\" she added. Cooper explained that Nato needs to \"double down\" and \"do what we've done in other areas\", to make sure that \"we really strengthen the security of the high north\".Asked what that meant in practical terms, she explained she wanted \"co-ordinated excercises, operations and intellgience sharing\" in the region - similar to the Baltic Sentry and the Eastern Sentry - coining it Arctic Sentry.PA MediaCooper was joined by her Norwegian counterpart, Espen Barth EideCooper said Russia was a threat not just to Europe but to transatlantic security and said \"co-operation would make the alliance stronger\" despite divisions over Greenland.\"We've been very clear that the future of Greenland is for the Greenlanders and for the Danes.\"Where I think there is shared agreement is about this Arctic security, this broader threat, and the need, really, for all of our countries to come together as part of that Nato alliance.\"She explained that \"this is how we deal with Russian threat, which affects us all\".Moose Campbell/BBCCooper visited Norway as part of a wider tour of ScandanaviaMeanwhile, Eide welcomed Cooper's call for Arctic Sentry, saying it would demonstrate a \"serious commitment\" to tackle the most challenging issue, namely the Russian threat to the seas of the high north.But when asked if he was worried about disagreements between Denmark and the US over Greenland, he said: \"Put it this way - two days ago, I was in a shelter in Kiev, and I was engaged with the highest leadership in Ukraine in several meetings. \"I think we should try to avoid the distractions from what is the issue number one these days, we need to help Ukraine to get well out of this war, to get to a just and lasting peace, because that is matters to transatlantic and European security more than anything else.\"",

    "body": "Hygiene ratings shouldn't apply to Michelin restaurants, says food critic3 hours agoJames McCarthyandMaria Cassidy,BBC WalesGetty ImagesRestaurant inspectors need to modernise, according to critic Giles CorenMichelin-starred restaurants should not have to abide by normal health and safety rules, food critic Giles Coren has said.The writer claimed inspectors needed to \"modernise\" after two-star Ynyshir Restaurant and Rooms received a hygiene rating of one out of five after food safety officers visited on 5 November.According to the Food Standards Agency (FSA), that means \"major improvement\" is required at the site in Machynlleth, Ceredigion, which charges almost £500 per head.Coren, who visited Ynyshir in 2022, said high-end restaurants were \"a different sort of world\".He was speaking as two-Michelin star Ynyshir received a hygiene score of one out of fiveSpeaking on Radio 4's World at One programme, he said: \"It is not little kitchens and pots boiling away, mimsy little things being placed on plates. \"He is cooking with fire... He stands there in his leather apron and it's roaring like fireworks. \"You're also, conversely, served quite a lot of raw food. He's talking about sushi, Japanese techniques.\"Coren said the rules \"should probably be modernised\".\"The normal health and safety things, I think it's fair enough, don't really apply,\" he said.\"It's much harder to do. It's not about your fridge and 'have you put the roast chicken from last night next to the raw chicken', which can lead to bacteria, it's a different sort of world.\"They are clearly doing enough to prevent the spread of bacteria but if you imagine a hygiene inspector, in his white coat, with his pen in his top pocket, expecting to see a neat provincial fridge, I can see that he would lose his mind [over Ynyshir].\"'No food business above the law'The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) said Coren risked giving the impression food hygiene rules were \"optional, subjective or old fashioned\".It reiterated they were not and existed to protect the public.\"No dining experience, however unusual or exclusive, sits outside the law,\" it said.CIEH's food advisory panel chairwoman, Una Kane, said the institute was \"disappointed\" by Coren's views, which included \"common misconceptions about the purpose of food safety standards\".Getty ImagesChef Gareth Ward (left), pictured at The Good Food Guide Awards 2023, said he was not embarrased by the score\"Coren suggested that the nature of the restaurant which was the subject of a really low food hygiene rating... meant that 'normal health and safety things' should not apply,\" said Kane.\"We are appalled at the suggestion that it should be considered optional for certain kinds of restaurants to meet legal standards.\"Many restaurants offer a unique experience for diners while meeting the standards of food hygiene legislation.\"It's insulting to those restaurateurs to imply you can't do both. No food business should see itself as above the law.\"In Wales, it is mandatory for restaurants to display food hygiene ratings. Kane said Ynyshir's rating meant it was operating below minimum legal standards.She denied food hygiene inspections were a \"tick-box exercise\" but critical to ensuring food was being handled and produced hygienically.\"Consumers have a right to expect that wherever they choose to eat, the same basic standards apply. That principle is non-negotiable.\"We welcome that the restaurant has recognised the concerns raised and is working co-operatively with the local environmental health team to remedy the issues raised.\"Chef Ward, who has featured as a guest judge on MasterChef: The Professionals, previously said he was not embarrassed by the score.The restaurant said it was working \"at the highest standard in the world\" and doing \"something different\" with how it approaches raw ingredients and techniques.More top stories",

    "body": "7 minutes agoBrajesh UpadhyayandNatalie ShermanThe US has seized a sixth tanker in the Caribbean Sea in its ongoing efforts to control exports of Venezuelan oil, officials say.The vessel, Veronica, was boarded in a predawn operation \"without incident\" as it was defying President Donald Trump's \"quarantine of sanctioned vessels\",  said the US military.\"The only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully,\" the Southern Command said.Since the US military strikes on Venezuela and seizure of its president Nicolás Maduro this month, Trump has said he plans to tap into the country's huge oil reserves. \"The Veronica is the latest tanker operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean,\" US Southern Command said in a post on social media.It also posted a video showing Marines and sailors boarding the tanker.Veronica, a crude oil tanker sailing under a Guyanese flag, departed empty from Venezuelan waters in early January, according to monitoring service TankerTrackers.com. The International Maritime Organization's database shows the vessel was previously registered in Russia under different names.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on social media that Thursday's tanker seizure was carried out with \"close coordination with our colleagues\" in the military as well as the state and justice departments.\"Our heroic Coast Guard men and women once again ensured a flawlessly executed operation, in accordance with international law,\" Noem added.It suggests Washington's crackdown on the so-called dark fleet, comprising more than 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned oil, will continue as the US works with Venezuela's interim government to control the country's oil sales.It also comes a day after an American official said the US had completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500m (£373m).Trump last week asked oil executives at the White House to invest $100bn in Venezuela's energy infrastructure. They said significant changes would be needed make the country an attractive investment.The blockade has sharply curtailed Venezuelan oil exports, with only ships associated with Chevron and bound for the US operating as usual, according to Matt Smith, head of US analysis at Kpler. Loadings have fallen roughly in half this month to about 400,000 barrels per day,  he said. The Veronica, a relatively small tanker with a sanctioned owner, was among about 17 ships that attempted to breach the blockade earlier this month, according to the firm.Smith said it was unclear why vessels from the so-called dark fleet would risk seizure, but noted the financial cost of delays. \"If a tanker was supposed to be moving crude and can't get through, that's money lost,\" he said.He said the US quarantine had created a bottleneck of supply that would otherwise be headed to countries, mainly China. But as the US starts selling Venezuelan oil, he said there were signs the situation was evolving with some tankers now headed to the Bahamas for storage.The latest tanker seizure came just hours ahead of a meeting between Trump and Venezuela's opposition leader Maria Corina Machado at the White House.Trump has previously described her as a \"freedom fighter\", but rejected the notion of appointing her to lead Venezuela after Maduro's removal, arguing that she lacks sufficient domestic backing. He instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.Trump describes Rodríguez as an \"ally\", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.Machado is expected to use her face time with Trump to try to persuade him that his decision to back Rodríguez's interim government is a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition.A Venezuelan government envoy, too, is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps towards reopening the country's embassy, the New York Times reported.\"The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of the interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, who has been described as \"extremely co-operative\" by the White House.On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the $500m energy deal was struck in large part because of help from Rodriguez. She said the interim president had also confirmed that Venezuela would be releasing political prisoners from Venezuela.\"There were five Americans who were recently released this week as well,\" Leavitt said. \"So, the president likes what he's seeing. And we'll expect that co-operation to continue.\"",
